Elizabeth V. Camp, 49, confessed to stealing Walmart gift cards while employed at the Manson Post Office and discarding the opened envelopes in her trash at home, according to an affidavit filed by the USPS Office of the Inspector General. She was arrested Thursday in her current city of Aberdeen. She is charged with three counts of second-degree identity theft and three counts of possessing stolen property, and made her first appearance Friday in Chelan County Superior Court. Postal inspectors said a Manson resident who kept a post office box was expecting two $50 Walmart gift cards at Christmas, but reported their disappearance Jan. 5. The cards had been used at the Chelan Walmart store Dec. 17. Inspectors probed the purchase and said they found store security footage that appeared to identify Camp as the person using the cards.  The Postal Service then set up an “integrity test” that provided Camp another opportunity to steal a Walmart gift card. Camp allegedly stole and used that card Feb. 18, and confessed to the thefts during an interview with inspectors Feb. 25. Camp was charged by summons in April, but court records show the summons and a subsequent warrant were sent to an address in Oklahoma, where Camp said she had never lived. No trial date has been set. Camp remained jailed Saturday on $1,500 bail. Reach Jefferson Robbins at 509-664-7123 or (javascript required to see email). Follow him on Twitter at @JRobbinsWW.

Jackson Police officers were called to Walmart at 12:42 a.m. Thursday, September 22, where the male suspect, Lacy Wolford, 32, of Keystone Road, Vinton, was being detained by store personnel and witnesses after they had restrained him and taken a pocketknife away from him. Police said Walmart representatives attempted to stop Wolford as he was in process of leaving the store, pushing a cart with bags of dog food for which he had not paid. Wolford allegedly shoved a Walmart representative, then ran out of the store. Witnesses in the parking lot saw what was happening and took Wolford to the ground, who then allegedly took a pocketknife from his pocket and threatened to stab one of the witnesses who had stopped him. However, a Walmart representative was able to grab the knife out of Wolford's hand with nobody getting hurt. Police were able to locate other items Wolford had allegedly stolen from the store which had a total value of $194. Wolford was charged with Theft and Aggravated Menacing and held in custody for six hours at the Jackson Police Station. According to the police report, he was released because no jail space was available to incarcerate him. Oak Hill area home struck by gunshots An Oak Hill area woman reported her house was recently damaged by gunshots while she was at the residence. According to Jackson County Sheriff Tedd Frazier, Lori Jenkins of 13940 State Route 279, Oak Hill, reported the incident at 3:01 p.m. Saturday, September 3. Jenkins said she was inside the house and heard a gunshot. When she went outside to investigate, she heard another shot. Upon closer inspection, she found two gunshots had left holes in the house's siding next to the front door. It was not immediately determined who fired the shots or where they came from. Man cutting corn finds Marijuana in Milton Township A man who was recently cutting corn in Milton Township found another crop instead - and it was an illegal one. According to Jackson County Sheriff Tedd Frazier, Ray Bierhup contacted the sheriff's office at 11:21 a.m. Monday, September 5, and reported he had come across some Marijuana plants while cutting corn off A.W. Long Road. Deputies went to the scene and confiscated seven Marijuana plants and later destroyed them at the sheriff's office. Semi rig damages road sign, utility pole A semi-truck driver was cited in Jackson after his trailer struck a road sign and utility pole Monday evening, September 19. According to Jackson Police, the incident occurred at 11:29 p.m. at the intersection of Morton and Chillicothe Streets. The semi rig, driven by Brian K. Johnson, 49, of Mebane, North Carolina, was attempting to make a right turn from Morton Street onto Chillicothe Street when his trailer struck a State Route 93 road sign and a utility pole owned by Frontier. Johnson was not injured, but police cited him with Failure To Control. Pedestrian charged with Intoxication in Jackson When Jackson Police officers were on patrol at 4:19 a.m. Monday, September 19, they noticed a man who appeared unsteady and uncertain on his feet walk across the intersection of Main and Bridge Streets. He continued to walk and passed through a couple of different yards before officers stopped to check on him at the corner of West and Crossland Streets. The man was identified as Randy L. Wiseman, Jr., 26, of Youngstown, Ohio, and officers detected the odor of alcohol from his person and noted he was exhibiting poor balance and was having trouble standing up. He was charged with Disorderly Conduct By Intoxication and held in custody for six hours at the Jackson Police Station. Jackson area woman charged with Resisting Arrest Jackson Police officers were dispatched at 1:14 a.m. Thursday, September 22, to an alley behind Marie Laveau's Bar at 203 East Main Street where two women reportedly had been in a fight. A Jackson County Sheriff's Office deputy was talking to the women when police officers arrived. When one of the suspects, Amelia Hobbs, 54, of 247 Smith Bridge Road, Jackson, was questioned about the incident, she allegedly became disrespectful to officers and later resisted their attempts to arrest her. Police took her to the ground during the episode and she was treated for a cut on her elbow. Police charged Hobbs with Resisting Arrest and Persisting Disorderly Conduct and held her in custody for eight hours at the Jackson Police Station.

 Discount supermarkets are taking over the US Hayley Peterson Sep. 24, 2016, 1:30 PM 11,556 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP Photo /Martin Meissner, file America's largest supermarkets are slashing prices amid ongoing food-price deflation and growing pressure from the rapid expansion of discount-grocery chains like Aldi. The price cuts are squeezing profits and dragging down company shares. Kroger, Whole Foods, Sprouts Farmers Market, and Dollar General have seen their stock prices drop a collective 13% in the last three months. "The current landscape is now beginning to look a lot like 2009, when meaningful deflation resulted in an industry price war and multiple quarters of declining earnings," Credit Suisse analyst Edward Kelly said in a recent research.Yahoo Finance Dollar General said in August that it's cutting prices on hundreds of items across 2,000 stores as it battles slowing sales growth. "These price reductions are meaningful and recognizable," Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in an earnings call. "These are the items that will actually drive additional foot traffic into our stores." The strategy follows in the footsteps of Kroger, Trader Joe's, and Walmart, which have also been slashing prices this year. Kroger lowered the cost of 1,000 popular grocery items in 120 of its stores, retail consultant David Merrefield writes on industry website The Robin Report. It's also in the process of hiring 14,000 people at its 2,800 stores to boost customer service. Prior to Kroger's cuts, Trader Joe's quietly dropped its prices and Walmart revealed it was reducing prices on hundreds of items in its grocery department with a particular focus on fresh produce, consumables, and over-the-counter drugs. Walmart's price cuts are part of a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment that Walmart it in the first quarter of the year. The grocery price wars are cropping up at the same time that German discount grocer Aldi expands its footprint in the US. Walmart's grocery department. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson In a price check last year, Business Insider found Aldi's prices were roughly 30% lower than Walmart's. Aldi has about 1,500 stores in the US with plans to open 500 more stores over the next two years as part of a $3 billion expansion. Aldi and rival discounter Lidl have upended the grocery market in the UK in recent years, forcing the nation's largest supermarkets to dramatically cut prices and lay off workers to stay competitive. As Aldi expands, Lidl is gearing up to open stores in dozens of cities in the US, spanning from New Jersey to Georgia, the company told Business Insider this week. Lidl wouldn't reveal how many stores it's planning to open, but sources told the commercial real-estate firm CoStar that the company will open as many as 150 US stores by 2018. The company currently has 10,000 stores in 26 European countries. Lidl has already snatched up leases in dozens of US cities. It's seeking store managers in areas including Burlington County, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; and Augusta, Georgia. Aldi and Lidl are known for their rock-bottom prices and small, convenient store locations. Aldi's stores are about 15 times smaller than Walmart's supercenters. Lidl's stores, by comparison, are about twice the size of an Aldi. Deutsche Bank analysts have referred to the two German chains as "predators crossing the pond." In a research note published in April, the analysts predicted that the two companies will shake up the US grocery market by killing off weaker chains and stealing customers from larger players — most notably Walmart, Dollar General, and Whole Foods. "All retailers need to treat Aldi (and at a later date Lidl) as a meaningful threat — and to be dismissive will likely prove to be a tactical/strategic error," the analysts wrote. So far, the biggest supermarket chains in the US are being proactive in fending off the competition by lowering their prices. As Aldi and Lidl continue to expand, however, they will likely be forced to make even deeper price cuts.

But consumer drones are just a small part of the story for this emerging technology. Sarah Priestley (TMFSarahp) Sep 24, 2016 at 11:39AM GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) unveiled several new products this week, including their new Karma drone. In this episode of Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Motley Fool analysts Vincent Shen and Sarah Priestley talk about GoPro's release -- what improvements they've made to their products, how the price points might affect consumer response, and where the stock is today from an investor's point of view. Then, the hosts dive into the potential future of drone adoption in the commercial sector. Find out how huge this market could be, and some giant obstacles that e-commerce companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) are going to have to solve before drone delivery can really take off. A full transcript follows the video. This podcast was recorded on Sep. 20, 2016. Vincent Shen: Hey, Fools! Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. It is Tuesday, Sept. 20, and I'm your host Vincent Shen, joined here in studio by Sarah Priestley to bring you the latest news and insights from the consumer retail sector. Jumping right into it: Yesterday, GoPro unveiled several new products, including what are considered to be some of its most important releases since the original GoPro 35mm Hero and GoPro Digital Hero a decade ago. Those new products included the Hero5 Black, the Hero5 Session, and of course, what everyone has been waiting for since the delay in the first half of 2016, the Karma drone, which will introduce quite nicely our main discussion for this episode, which is drones. What kind of experience do you have with drones, Sarah? Sarah Priestley: We have ... Shen: Who is "we?" Priestley: My husband and I. (laughs) My husband was given by my father a drone for Christmas. And we have, I'm ashamed to say, only used it to make insulting home videos with Star Wars background music. Shen: Very nice. Do you know specifically which drone it is? Priestley: That we have? I think it's a DJI. Shen: In terms of usability, are you impressed with how far the technology has come along? In the consumer space, at least. Priestley: Yeah, I'm incredibly impressed. I think they've come on in leaps and bounds in a very short period of time. It's incredibly stable and easy to fly. I would say my issue with it is probably battery life, which is the same as what a lot of people seem to have. And I know people are talking about the GoPro, it has an 18 minute battery life? Shen: Yeah, about 18 to 20 minutes. The Hero5 cameras, there's some really interesting upgrades and improvements from the prior generation cameras. They have voice control now, GPS tagging and more. The Karma is what really caught our attention, especially since we're focusing on drones for this episode. It's been priced at about $799 as the stand-alone device, $999 or $1099 paired with one of the new Hero5 cameras as a package. Based on research and speaking with some of my friends who are into drones as a hobby, some of the key factors that people generally consider when they buy a drone for consumer use are battery life (like you mentioned), form factor, range, how far it can fly out, the camera system it uses, if you want to have a camera on it, and, of course, the budget. How the Karma fares with these criteria, in terms of battery life, we mentioned 18 to 20 minutes, it's actually pretty standard and competitive with rival offerings. Other makers like Parrot, DJI, the current battery technology, even just a half hour flight time is actually considered to be industry-leading for consumer drones. And then the form factor -- where I thought the Karma really stood out, it was actually on stage with the CEO for his entire presentation in a backpack. When he pulled it out, it was kind of a surprise, because of the fact that it's so compact. Basically, arms fold in for storage; otherwise, when they fold out, it looks like the standard quadcopter. But it's very easy to snap open and deploy. The whole package with the camera, the mount, the remote controller, and the stabilizing gimbal -- if I'm pronouncing that correctly -- it weighs not much more than five pounds, and the remote has a five-inch screen with controls that really resemble, in my opinion, your basic handheld gaming device, kind of like with joysticks, which I think a lot of everyday users would be able to pick up and learn relatively quickly compared to some of the other drone remotes that I've seen that are how much more complicated, and resemble things like a more complex RC device. In terms of range, it can fly up to 1 kilometer -- over 3000 feet from the user, which is pretty impressive. 35 miles per hour flight speed, and a maximum altitude of 14,500 feet for flight. The camera system is obviously compatible with the Hero5 series, also the Hero4. When it's paired with the stabilization accessories, it makes for a really smooth, professional-looking video, as can be seen in some of the marketing footage, which I highly recommend you check out. I'm sure once it is released in October, there will be tons of user footage out there to show how good it is compared to the competition. But overall, I think the Karma is pretty well-suited to the action-sport lifestyle and activities where GoPro has established its roots. If you take a minute and look at some of the media headlines about the Karma release, first impressions seem really good. Even in drone hobbyist communities and forums, people seem to be really impressed. These new products are due officially in October. It's perfect timing for the holiday season. That's usually the company's biggest selling period. In 2014, for example, the company was still delivering really strong double-digit growth, and that fourth-quarter holiday season made up nearly half of total sales in 2014. Right now, it's a much different world for GoPro and shareholders. A lot of new, low-price competing action cameras have eroded the company's market share, taking a toll on the company's results for the past three quarters. So, including the holiday quarter of 2015 and the first half of 2016, the company reported year-over-year revenue declines of anywhere from 30% to 50%. The stock itself peaked back in October 2014, when it hit nearly $90 per share, bounced around until August 2015 at about $60 per share. Now it's endured a pretty steady decline; it's trading at $15. Honestly, with that decline, its valuation multiples have come down from the clouds into much more reasonable territory. It's trading at about 20 times trailing earnings. Previously, it was 70 times or more. But, when it comes down to it, it's a $799 device, or $1,000 or more if you need a camera to go with it. I'm not sure this is something that can necessarily sell in enough volume to really help GoPro return to its previous growth levels. What do you think? Is that something that people are willing to spend? If you think about another really popular electronics item that's higher end, more expensive during the holidays, for example, gaming consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation, even when they first come out, they're $400 to $500 for a package. This is even beyond that. Maybe certain computers, the newest MacBook, might rival this in terms of price range. But, what do you think? Priestley: I think if you are serious hobbyist, and you're really into drones -- in fact, if you're really into action photography -- this would probably be something you would do. There's a lot of people who have side gigs, like they're doing wedding photography -- our man behind the glass today is actually supporting his cousin, doing some videoing for her wedding this weekend. I was at a wedding a couple weeks ago, and they had a drone just hovering above the ceremony the whole time. That's a very easy, if you think about it, low-priced option that a lot of people can add to their packages. It's not necessarily just amateurs, I think. Shen: Yeah, sure. With all that in mind, I think I will leave listeners to stew on this question, and ultimately, wait to see how successful the Karma sells -- how many it's able to sell, and if it has that significant an impact on GoPro's results. But, a little bit of additional color for you to consider is that ABI Research estimates that the consumer drone market will grow from the 5 million units shipped in 2014 to about 90 million by 2025, or about $4.6 billion in sales. So, there is a lot of opportunity, I think -- a runway for growth for GoPro to establish itself in what is ultimately still a very much developing niche market. If anything, the company definitely has a ton of history taking a pretty specialized product and turning it into a mainstream success. They've sold millions upon millions of action cameras, and at some points, they boasted 80% to 90% market share in that segment -- so, dominant. GoPro is not quite an early mover in the drone industry, as it was with action cameras. For a long time, when consumers thought of action cameras, they thought of GoPro. And though the price tag makes me a little skeptical, the company does have the option of expanding its price points, just as it did with cameras. The Sessions come in at cheaper levels, at lower price levels. GoPro can do the exact same thing with different models of drones in the future. And I think, when it comes to drones, bigger picture, away from GoPro, our discussions have really been focused on the amateur hobbyist market. Even the professional consumer market. But, in actuality, that's really just a small piece of the opportunities in the drone market overall. Over the summer, back in June, the Federal Aviation Administration issued its official rules for commercial drones, which really opened the door to their use in a lot of industries. Those rules went into effect late last month. And honestly, the commercial drone market is going to dwarf the consumer drone market. Laying a little bit of foundation in terms of how these commercial drones are coming into play initially, can you tell us a little bit about the framework for the rules, and how that's impacting their use? Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's important for people to know that prior to this period, it was illegal to use commercial drones unless you had a section 333 exemption from the FAA. This is actually the second time that they have been asked to come up with these rules and regulations. They were asked in 2012 and they missed the deadline. So it's been something that's on Congress' mind for a while, foreseeing this activity. But, as you said, the new rules came out in August 2016. I'll just read you a brief excerpt from the press release: "The FAA has finalized new operational rules for routine commercial use of small, unmanned aircraft systems, opening pathways toward fully integrating UAS into the nation's airspace." It's quite a bold claim, and I think these are almost baby steps. Right now, pilots have to keep drones within line-of-sight, which reduces a lot of opportunities in terms of delivery, especially, for retail like we're looking at with Amazon Air and things like that. But, at the same time, it's a big step forward. The same press release suggested that it could add $82 billion to the U.S. economy and create 100,000 new jobs in the next 10 years. It seems like a baby step, but it's a step in the right direction. Shen: I think it's really important to note that number you just mentioned, $82 billion. That's huge. The commercial drone usage, the number I had for 2025, almost 10 years from now, on the consumer side, is only $5 billion. Again, a really big difference in terms of the size of the market. I think, not just for GoPro, but also some of the other players right now that are trying to establish themselves in the drone market, mostly private companies like Parrot, DJI Innovations, they're going to be fighting pretty hard for a piece of that very sizable market. A few other rules, specifically, that I thought were kind of interesting in terms of commercial drone usage: They obviously regulate proximity to airports, their flight speed, their flight altitude. But the one you touched on in terms of it having to be within line-of-sight, really affects something that has been a huge trend for e-commerce, which is the impact of delivery, and you mentioned Amazon Air, and the fact that a lot of e-commerce retailers are challenging the traditional retailers, and challenging consumers to think that maybe "It's easier for me to order something, essentially, from the comfort of my couch than it is to make the drive 10 minutes, 15 minutes, or even farther for some people, as we'll get to, to go to the store to buy something. Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's, for a long time, been the preserve of sci-fi movies, but now it's starting to become a reality. I don't know how quickly it will actually happen for consumers. But if you look, in 2015, just business-to-consumer -- so, excluding business-to-business -- the online retail market was $808 billion. There is a huge amount of consumer expectation over how quickly they're going to receive those packages. I think that's, essentially, created a huge pressure point, and a competitive pressure point, for retailers and how they're competing over free delivery -- which obviously is not free for them -- and immediate delivery, which is what we're talking about now. Shen: Sure. When you look at, what I consider to be one of the biggest examples, it's the biggest example of a traditional retailer, like Wal-Mart, it's obviously been focused a lot in terms of its e-commerce efforts. We've talked previously on this show about it's Jet.com acquisition and other efforts. I think for the most recent quarter, it's been able to return to more robust levels of growth for its e-commerce efforts. And they are really pushing their shipping option. They have their Shipping Pass package, now, I think it's $50 per year, comparable to Amazon Prime. Something I thought was really interesting is, Piper Jaffray research analysts estimates that Amazon has successfully built out its network of fulfillment centers at this point to be within 20 miles of 44% of the U.S. population. Back in 2010, that penetration level was just 5%. On the other hand, we know that Wal-Mart has a ton of stores. What's their penetration level? Priestley: They have a store within 5 miles of 70% of the population. Shen: So, what do you see in terms of shipping, the drone opportunities, how do you see that playing out? Because Amazon, obviously, with about 44% penetration within 20 miles, that seems, potentially, in the future, as the technology develops, as the flight times improve, for them to be able to really deliver and expand what is right now a limited 40 markets for Prime now, essentially, your delivery within 1 or 2 hours. What do you think? Priestley: I think there's a lot of hurdles for them to overcome, not just regulatory. I think it's going to be a societal change, too. How much do you really need to get it within 30 minutes? And, obviously, price will affect that. But, as you said, Wal-Mart's distribution of the retail locations is a huge advantage. I don't think people realize, when you talk about drones, the idea is that it will essentially be a single-package short delivery. Then, this opens up a whole secondary question over how cost-effective is this actually going to be? A lot of people have made the argument that this could be, in fact, cents per mile. The last mile of the delivery is where the opportunity is for retailers. I think the last mile adds 28% of the cost of delivery. So, if you just take this last mile and think about how much cost benefit there is going to be for a drone. And there are some analysts that are pegging this out to be ridiculously cheap, $0.88 for the final delivery. Some of them are pegging it to be $10 to $17 per delivery, depending on what you factor in. So, there's a whole host of issues. There's a whole timeline when we need to find out what the price point is for people; if they actually want this, how much they're willing to pay for it. Deloitte surveyed last year 4,000 shoppers around the holiday season, and a quarter of them were unwilling to pay for next-day delivery. You can see that expectations are rocket-high from consumers already from what they're expecting. Shen: If you're online and you're not competing on price, you're competing on getting that package to the person as quickly as possible. That's, ultimately, one of the big challenges with shopping online. You have to wait for it, and you can't handle it in person. That has driven consumers to have this expectation where, "Hey, I want that, and I want it shipped to me quickly for free." Amazon has certainly contributed, partially, to that. But that has also been a huge competitive advantage for them. Focusing in on what you mentioned, that last mile of delivery. There was an article in The Wall Street Journal that was really interesting, basically about how it's affecting the United States, a very big country, a lot of people live in more rural areas. With last-mile delivery, for the logistics companies like UPS or FedEx, they benefit most when their truck can drive along a street, maybe a five-mile stretch, for example, and deliver a ton of packages, hundreds of packages in their route. It's the most cost-effective for them. Whereas, in some cases, in more rural area, population densities are much, much lower, it's the complete opposite. Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. This is called route density and drop size -- the two criteria here. So, either you do your normal route, and you deliver a lot of packages, or you do a smaller route to, say, one place, and you deliver a lot of packages. That's the way they work out the economics of this. The issue, as you alluded to, is the fact that the rural economy in the U.S. is really picking up online. I think 68% of people were online shopping in rural areas last year. That's grown to 75% this year. This poses a challenge to retailers in the fact that they offer a standard delivery price whether you live in Manhattan or you live Arkansas. The reason that they do this is because they have to be completely transparent, and they have to be open. They can't seem to be penalizing people for where they live. But there is an additional cost for doing this, and it's around $4. If you look at USPS or even the more premium FedEx and UPS, they're charging upwards of about $4 for very rural deliveries. And the retailer is absorbing these costs. That's going to have a direct impact on margins eventually, if this continues to increase. At the moment, it's probably just a small fraction of the overall revenue source for them. Shen: Yeah. To put some of that into context, too: Right now, online purchases for all consumer spending is still in the single digits, like 9%, almost 10%. So, there's really a ton of opportunity for online shopping, especially among rural consumers, to grow. That Wall Street Journal article had some really interesting examples where, basically, they mentioned, it's not just people shopping for a big ticket-item like a PC, or something you would buy online. It's really some of their daily staples, including paper towels and other things you need every day in your home. Another example of how long some of these mail routes get: There was one carrier, his daily mail loop is almost 190 miles in Oklahoma. That's the kind of challenge we have. Potentially, if the cost structure and the other logistics to regulations work out, drones can help alleviate that. Right now, a lot of the technology is limited. You can only carry one package, for example. But I would assume they're working on that. What other limitations do you think -- it seems like a really great idea in a city, getting things out really quickly, less than 30 minutes. What aren't we thinking of? Priestley: There are a whole host of issues, especially in cities. The people that are working on this, they call this the last 50 feet issue. So, not only do you have problems with human interference -- we're naturally inquisitive people, and there' the suggestion that maybe they could be taken, stolen ... Shen: They could just swat a drone like a fly. Priestley: Exactly. You get children, animals, all those kinds of interferences that can occur. And also, you have logistical issues. Last year, in November, Amazon released a YouTube video basically showing a woman who needed football cleats, and she ordered them, and it showed you the dispatch, and it going all the way there. She put a little pad outside on her yard, and that's where the drone landed. We don't know if that's actually what's going to happen, but there needs to be some kind of identifying factor of where this is going to land. And if you live, like we do, in an apartment complex, where does the drone deliver? Is it going to be on the roof? How safe is that? There's a whole host of issues. Shen: It's funny, we talked about last mile delivery, when we're talking about a truck. Now it's the last 50 feet when we're talking about drones. Anything else, in terms of what you see as possibly being a holdup in terms of adoption in the specific consumer retail application? Priestley: Yeah, I think there's also going to be big argument that, how necessary is this? You have, now, Walgreens and CVS, who have a huge store footprint. They're stocking a lot of the things that formerly, you would have to make an emergency run to the supermarket for. It seems this is going to be much more niche than people are expecting, to me. I think it has much more application with things like oil rigs, parts for when big oil rigs stop pumping, and medical applications. And I think this is where a lot of other people project this to go, too. Shen: Let's focus in on that. What examples have we seen, or, are there good examples out there that you've seen of drones working really well? People have talked about, beyond the consumer retail space, also agriculture, defense, energy, medicine. Do you have examples? Priestley: Yeah, absolutely. There's a start-up -- I guess they're not start-up anymore, they were established in 2011 called Matternet, and they deliver medical supplies. They operate in Switzerland, Haiti, the Dominican Republic right now. And I'll take one example from them. In Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, which is in Southern Africa, one in four adults has HIV. Matternet's drones deliver blood samples to clinics, they deliver medicine, and they already operate in a network 1.5 times the size of Manhattan. So, it really does show you the opportunity there. But I think the biggest reason this is used is that the paved roads are scarce, and the drone network is cheaper than establishing a road network. I think the delivery cost is about $0.24 per delivery on what they operate now. Shen: Oh, wow. So, I think, overall, bringing this back into the Foolish world, in terms of investing, with the drone players themselves, GoPro is really making a splash with its Karma, that we spoke about earlier. But a lot of the other companies right now are definitely small, private, a little harder to make that direct investment, if you're interested in getting an investing foothold here. But we talked about some of the retailers, as well. Amazon -- for years now, Jeff Bezos has talked about, for years, his interest in turning this into a viable way of expanding its delivery options and its efficiency, for example. But otherwise, I'd love, in future shows, to tackle some of the different companies that might be supplying some components and things along those lines -- as much as we can in the consumer retail space -- for these drones. Any other takeaways for you, that you were surprised by, or anything in terms of the future for this industry right now? Priestley: Yeah, I will say, if you're an investor right now in Amazon or Wal-Mart, the things you're probably going to be seeing are the building out of more click-and-collect kind of offerings, more distribution centers, shipping from store. And I wouldn't be surprised to see that in the earnings calls. This is going to potentially offer a huge benefit. If you look right now in the U.K., the retailers are losing about 300 million pounds a year because they can't find the right price point for delivery, and consumers are so sensitive to it. I think this is really a good debate to have. Shen: OK. Thanks a lot.

(REUTERS/John Gress/Files) Reuters Sep 21, 2016 at 9:03 am | Print View CHICAGO — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said it paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly store staff as 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout and better service. The world’s largest retailer said 932,000 store employees received a quarterly bonus this year. This was a jump from 880,000 employees in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 687,000 workers in fiscal 2015. Wal-Mart is the largest private employer in the United States, with about 1.5 million workers including hourly store staff, store management and truck drivers. Hourly workers at the company’s nearly 4,600 U.S. locations are eligible for quarterly bonuses based on the performance of their store. This increase in bonuses comes after the retailer bucked a string of weak earnings by its rivals and reported a better-than-expected quarterly performance last month, saying it benefited from more efficient U.S. stores and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service. It also comes at a time when the retailer is cutting back-office jobs. Earlier this month, Wal-Mart said it will cut about 7,000 jobs, mostly in accounting and invoicing positions at its U.S. stores, and will offer affected employees consumer-facing positions. Wal-Mart spokesman Kory Lundberg said until two years ago Wal-Mart’s internal targets focused more on metrics like higher store sales. However, in the past two years the retailer has pivoted toward a greater emphasis on customer service by bringing more employees to the front of the store from its backrooms. Wal-Mart has also increased entry-level wages to $10 an hour and said it will invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it has said contributed to improved service levels. “As a result employee turnover has reduced and you have more people on the sales floor,” Lundberg said. The retailer also recently launched a new system for scheduling workers at 650 U.S. stores to improve staffing levels during peak shopping times and offer more certainty over hours for employees.

Digital distribution and highly-accessible game engines have led to a crowded marketplace where making a good game doesn't necessarily equate to success. While many developers still bring their games to market on their own, in the past couple years there has been a rise of smaller publishers like Versus Evil, which works with small indies to bring their games to an increasingly complicated market.  Gamasutra spoke to Steve Escalante, general manager at Versus Evil about what pitfalls indie developers should avoid if they want to find an audience in the midst of the explosion of new titles. Can you give me a little bit more of your background on Versus Evil? I think I'm on my sixteenth year or so in the games business. From basically developing MMOs for about five or six years and then kind of getting into the book publishing side with Brady Games for a few years. Then back into games publishing again. My last five years before I started Versus Evil was with Bethesda Softworks. I was there as marketing director on Elder Scrolls Online for quite a bit. Then I moved over to Bethesda Softworks team for the last year and a half. Then I started Versus Evil almost three years ago back in, I guess, August of '13. The end of August? Something like that. So we're coming up on our three-year anniversary. Banner Saga How many people are at Versus Evil? There's a total of four including myself. Low headcount means you don't have to worry too much about each title selling millions of copies to keep everyone employed. Yes. The flip side of that is we've also got indie teams that we need to support. So if I'm pretty fat as a company, then I have all these expenses that I need to cover and I can't do the deals that I'm doing. When we started this, there were only a few indie publishers out there. There were certainly developers who were doing it on their own, but very few indie publishers. That's why we're named "Versus Evil." It's like, "How do we break the dynamic of overruling publishers swooping in and taking all the revenues. Recouping all these different things, all these hidden expenses and all this stuff?" Banner Saga Since you've been on the larger publisher side and now the smaller publisher side, could you describe this evolution that's happened? It looks like it was all big companies and then there was kind of this "mid-tier" implosion. And now you have all these new tools, and you've got these indie developers, and more open platforms. Where does a publisher fit in these days? Why does Versus Evil and Devolver and publishers like that exist? To your point about the mid-level guys exploding--THQ and Midway and everybody kind of went away. Which is kind of like the Kmart vs. Walmart and Target. They just got squeezed out. What's interesting to me is I kind of wonder if we're actually in that part of our business. What I mean by that is, you've got the smaller-value guys that are coming in. I don't even mean to say that we are value like Walmart. It's more of, just those mass market price points, if you will, versus the triple-A $60 stuff more premium. It's really changed some of the dynamic. As we grow, we look at a Paradox Interactive. I think they said they did, what, $70 million last year and $30 million of profit. They're talking about going public. So they're kind of a "mid-tier" outfit. Are we in the stage where we're going to build some mid-tiers again? It's a question that I ask myself all the time. Are there mid-tier publishers basically just growing up? As we add more titles and have more hits and things like that, I think it's realistic to assume that you're going to have some publishers, the Paradoxes and bigger, that are suddenly doing a couple hundred million dollars a year because they have some really solid indie hits. (You could also say that about mobile as well, but mobile certainly had the explosion of the "triple-A mobile," if you will, that are making such big money.) Armikrog But to answer your question specifically about "Why do we exist?" I think the biggest problem that we have right now -- anybody, whether you're an indie publisher or what -- is discovery. Steam is releasing hundreds of games a month. Hundreds. ... So how do you differentiate yourself from the next guy? The same was said about the App Store. I think where publishers such as ourselves and others who have expertise in marketing and PR and reach and things like that, we're pretty well suited to do that for a team. When you look at the smaller teams, like the Banner Sagas and Stoic, they are like three or four guys.  I think more than anything, what we give back to our teams is time. We are able to focus on that while they focus on the game, because that's hard enough as it is. That's not to say that you can't do it alone, but when you have someone that's supporting you and helping you with the financials of all of that as well; working with you as a partner, then you can kind of go, "Okay, good. I can now focus on the game and not have to worry about all this other stuff." Armikrog I feel like we have a place in the market because we now have experience, we now have reach, we now have good relationships with the platform holders and things like that. All of those things which are typically a reason why you want to work with a publisher is now kind of coming true with indies. We can really talk with the platform holders about how we can promote and get featured and do those different things. It's just not possible for them to speak with hundreds of developers every single month. There was maybe a year or so where indie developers started coming up through some of the emerging platforms and it was like, "Screw you, publishers. we don't need to share revenue. We can do this ourselves!" Now, thanks to all the changes that are happening, some are saying, "Actually, now we do." Now that it's more flooded, the need has come back and we're heading back to where we were publisher-wise, in a way. What it used to be was, you've got to go to manufacturing. You've got to negotiate with all the top-tier retailers, which means you need a sales team, because you've got to get into the buyers. You're not getting into Walmart unless you know the buyer or unless you've got a sales team that can get you in front of the buyer. Even then, it wasn't a given that they would actually buy your product. So it was risky. At the same time, there were lot more retailers back then. You had the EBs of the world, and GameStops, everybody that was out there. You also had a cost of goods that. That being said, as a consumer, the confidence was when I walked into the store there was a pretty decent slew of PC games and console games. Toren As soon as you go digital, once they opened up those floodgates, it really helped build a lot of great content. The indie movement has brought back old genres. They've brought back old art styles, and moved them forward. Some games are beautifully stunning and yet they're still an 8-bit, 16-bit type of look. Then you get games like Hyperlight Drifter that are just beautiful to look at. Banner Saga, which almost turns a concept artist into your main artist, which is not typical in a game. It's really kind of opened up a whole marketplace. I do agree with you, there's all these indies out there and not everyone is succeeding and some of these games are really good. Is there a way that I can help them? What I found with a lot of the experienced teams that became indie and we were talking to, some of them were like, "Yeah, screw you, publishers. I don't want to work with anyone because I've been raked across the coals so many times." You get that a lot, then? That dynamic has been removed. I could tell you my first year of signing titles, it was all with hesitancy. It's really hard to make that decision to become independent and then to start talking to a publisher. Has that sentiment changed for the better, for you? From my perspective, I think it has. I think there certainly are teams that go it alone. Some of those teams that I've talked to haven't done as well and they've kind of come back saying, "Hey, we'd like to talk with you about our next one. We didn't do as well as we'd hoped." Everyone kind of checks references, which I think is very cool. The indie community is very well connected, right? Because Versus Evil has had a good reputation with the developers that we've worked with, I'll talk to a developers that we're working with, and they say, "Oh, I talked with those guys. So you signed that game?" Toren We run Versus Evil like a service company. These are my clients, and I need to do well by them. Otherwise we're not Versus Evil, we're just this overruling publisher that does messed up things just like everybody else. We become the evil. So we're very cautious of that. I think the conversation has changed. When we launched Banner Saga 1, I think there were 34 titles launched that month. I think this last April there were 320. It's different. All of a sudden, it's more like the App Store and how do you differentiate yourself? Just the last two years Twitch and YouTube from a live streaming perspective have really changed things as well. How can you tell an indie developer that you can do a better job at discovery than they could? I hate to keep saying the same thing, but it really just boils down to time and focus. I'm not a person to say, "I can do this better than you." If you look at it from a marketing and community standpoint, we're not talking rocket science here. There's knowledge and experience, don't get me wrong. There's things that I've done over the last 16 years that allow me to say, "This works. This doesn't." Everyone is a consumer, so they can really have an opinion about the marketing and the management of the community and things like that. We're not saying that we can do it better, we're just saying we have experience doing it. You have a good artist that's pretty well trained in what he does, don't ask him to program. And in some regards, don't ask him to do marketing.  Ask anyone who's run a Kickstarter campaign. You lose at least 30 days prior getting ready for the Kickstarter and then the 30 days running the Kickstarter. And then afterwards fulfilling it. It's a job in itself,  and you've not been developing the game during that time. It's things like that that you're kind of like, "How much am I going derail myself from managing community, managing different things, from developing the game?" Bedlam Some people can do it. The Stardew Valley guy did an amazing job. I'm not silly enough to sit here and say that I can do it better. I'm saying that I can do a good job and I'm saying that we are 100 percent focused on it and we feel that we will add value, we will bring more. What are you looking for in a game? The answer to this question has changed from when I first started. In the past, when Steam wasn't so wide open, it was just, "Fun? Good." There was a time that I think I was looking at four viking games at the exact same time. My team and I were laughing about it, but they're all good games. For me now, those core values still exist. It's got to be a fun game. It's got to be an art style that is different and noteworthy. We don't have multi-million dollar marketing budgets that we can brand an image into many consumers' minds. So you need to make sure that your art style is unique enough so that when you do anything, even your social media posts, your imgur stuff, that it stands on its own. That's where your branding and everything comes from when you're starting to build community and get out there on social media. Your look and feel can be "Oh, that's The Banner Saga. Oh, that's Guild of Dungeoneering, because it's so unique." Bedlam But today the big thing that we also look at is multi-platform. With the PC and mobile being so crowded, we have to have multiple SKUs so that we can help recoup risk both from the developer and publisher side, as well as differentiate ourselves, and make it look like a much bigger launch. For us now, it's like, "What's your console plans? What's your PC plans? What's your mobile plans?" All three of those don't have to be "Yes" answers, but we do try to have a "Yes" answer to at least two of those questions. Speaking of console games, what kind of numbers or performance are you seeing when you release an indie game on a console these days? I hear from a decent amount of indies that release, for example, on PlayStation 4. Seems like a lot of those games are dying on the vine. To be fair, it's not apples to apples. We launched Banner Saga there two years after the PC release. We launched Toren simultaneously, and I would say it kind of paralleled the numbers. I've been doing a lot of analysis just to see where we are for the year, I would say that my console business is growing and catching up to PC quite quickly with fewer titles. My three verticals, if you will, I see mobile, I see PC, I see console whereas before I was predominantly PC. I'm now seeing all three of those things grow and compete with each other from a revenue standpoint, and that's exciting. We're much more stable as a company because we have that whole ecosystem. I look at the console games and I don't see that, "It dies on the vine." The biggest risk for any indie game, whether it's developer or publisher, is going back to the old dynamic of retail. Your storefront is the digital storefront. If you're not getting featured, you're not getting marketing, you're not getting placed well, then how are they really hearing about it? Whereas before you would walk into a GameStop or a Walmart and you'd walk around the store. You'd pick up a physical box, you'd read the back, and you'd get informed. Maybe you wouldn't buy it, but you'd at least go somewhere and look. You'd have these big media hubs that people would go to like an IGN or GameSpot,  to check news or whatever. A lot of that has changed to, "Who's playing it on YouTube? Who's playing it on Twitch?" Guild of Dungeoneering When I look at it, I don't necessarily see it as a correlation to platform. It's all about discovery and making sure that the audience is aware that you're coming to that platform, and they actually care. We've had good success with console, we're going to continue going that way. We feel that console is very important to our market. Armikrog did okay on the PC, but we're really excited about what we're going with it on console. It certainly is getting more crowded on the consoles, but it's a long ways off from where Steam is right now. It is. It's a harder process. You have to go through certification. You have to have dev kits, you have to have all these different things and it's more complicated. It is absolutely not impossible. People are doing it and they do it successfully every single day. The barrier to entry is still higher than PC. What are some common mistakes you see indie devs make from a publishing or marketing standpoint? I think the common mistake, which really parallels triple-A titles as well, is they push it out. It's one of the things that I tell a lot of indies: "You've got to let it bake. You've got to test it more. If you think it's done, can you sit on it for a month? Make sure that this is the title." You see a lot of devs saying, "We just need to monetize. We're going to push it out on early access." My response to that is, "Consumers do not know what an alpha is. They really don't. They don't know what a beta is either." The beta testing that consumers are used to are the Call of Duties and MMORPGs that basically brought millions of people in for a really pretty and polished experience. What some of the early access titles have been doing is showing them a true alpha or beta and people going, "Whoa. What's this?" Guild of Dungeoneering The Darkest Dungeon guys did an excellent job of not doing that. It was fun, it was polished. It wasn't complete, but quite frankly you didn't notice. To me they are still, by far, the best run early access title out there. And they kind of ran it like an MMO where they released content over time and kept engaging people, releasing classes -- And they had their own blowup when they added in heart attacks and things like that, and people kind of freaked out and had to adjust. It was really fun to watch. It felt like you were getting rewarded. When they add new content that they intended on adding the whole time, you felt like it was a nice surprise and they were gifting you with something. Right. The key point there is that what they started with was good. It's kind of what World of Warcraft did way back in the day. When you played their beta, it was like, "Wow, this feels better than most MMOs." The other big mistake I see is focused around Kickstarter and trying to dredge up press. With Kickstarted projects, in order to get the funding they need, they've had to put out all the features, all the stuff that they basically had to do to get funding. Then when they go to the press, the press guys are like, "Well, I saw that on your Kickstarter, it's  old news." They spent all of their cool features to get the Kickstarter money. Which they needed! But then when it comes to dredging up press and PR and getting people excited, it's tougher because there's nothing new to say. I was talking to somebody who is about to launch a game out of alpha, and he had no idea how it will do. The game was getting good traction during early access on Steam, getting good sales. But when it "actually launches," he's wondering if he's going to see any bump at all. It is interesting because when speaking to press about a title that's been in early access, they ask what you've added, what's new. And you have to say, "Oh, no, we're just done. We're out of early access." Kyn This suggests that you've got to have a big content drop at the time of release. If you don't, you might not get any press to give you a bump. How are you bringing back the people who tried the early access seven months ago? How are you bringing them back and getting them excited again? Another strategy is, do early access on PC for six, seven, eight months. Then when you go live, roll out your console and PC version together. Because now you've got multiple platforms, now you've got different marketing, you've got different press excited about it because the console guys haven't been paying attention.  Kickstarter is interesting. We've seen some pretty good things there where your Steam community does not care that these guys paid you some money on Kickstarter. They'll say, "It's a good game, but they gave the Kickstarter people something special. I want those things too." Well, they funded the title, just to be clear. They deserve it. But some of the Steam community is like, "Yeah, but I want that too." I get that, but to be angry about it seems interesting to me. So basically keep in mind the different audiences on different platforms and how they'll react to business moves. You've absolutely got to. I think that's probably the biggest mistake -- I tell that with people that we don't work with. "Do me a favor, just take a step back." Think about when you're launching. Look at your window. Who are you launching against? When's the next sale? You've got to wind this thing up. Are you doing a pre-order discount? Are you doing a launch discount? You've got to make sure that you're not upsetting any of your early adopters. You've got to line up when you're going to drop certain things along the way. Kyn Even just from a high level. "I've got my beta. Maybe early access. Then I've got a launch. How am I doing in pre-sales? How am I doing launch discount? When's my first sale?" You can't put it on sale two weeks later, because you just pissed off all your early adopters. You've got to respect the people that are actually following you and being your fans. The message needs to be, "You guys are getting something and I'm not going to suddenly drop it a couple weeks later because I was looking for some money real quick." Do you think that the industry is setting itself up for another kind of mid-level collapse? Could that happen again? I'm sure some economist would disagree with me, but I kind of look at it like a mid-level birth. Because back in the day, what you were dealing with in the traditional retailer sense, you were dealing with physical retail distribution, placement in those stores, dealing with all the triple-A guys who had these massive kiosks and things like that, that you may or may not have been able to afford, because you just don't have enough titles to financially justify those types of displays. Whereas today, mainly because of how wonderful the console players have been and how Apple and Google really are open doors, you can get your content on there, it's just how you do it. Then with Steam and others on the PC, you've basically got a lot of avenues to create a really good brand. I would almost argue that it's all about your community and your management of the press and your management of the streamers to create a brand for yourself and hold on to that. You could exist as a medium-level company so long as you just don't screw that up. I'm sure the day will come when I'm going to get squeezed out, because the big guys always figure out a way to do that. But I think medium-level publishers can exist for a long time because they don't have a lot of the barriers that existed in the past that would require them to close doors. And we're not even a medium-sized publisher yet, so -- [laughs] Yeah, we've got plenty of time before we have to worry about that. It's an interesting thing, but I do think about it. If a Midway and THQ was around when there was the digital platforms and everything was much more open and they didn't have those expenses and things, where would they be today? I don't know. They had a lot of baggage going into it so it was tough for them to stay square. Merged with Eidos and that made them quite a bit bigger. Warner has done an excellent job of establishing themselves. Great IP, great games. So it's interesting. I think it's exciting to look ahead. I think the medium-level publishers can exist for indie teams that are also getting bigger that want the $5-$10 million development budgets to do "III" third party development. Could be cool. Big companies like THQ were publicly traded and there's so much focus on growth, growth, growth, growth for their investors, where perhaps that's not going to be such a huge focus for some of these independent publishers that are on the rise. Yeah, I don't think so. For me, a lot of the reasons why I like where we are is I want to have fun and in the process create some great relationships with partners and be successful with each other. If I can end my career in however long, I've got plenty of time left, I guess, and I was able to accomplish that with multiple teams, I'm going to be a pretty happy guy. It doesn't mean that everybody had some big payout and they made hundreds or even tens of millions of dollars, and they're able to retire. It's more like did we do it well? Did we treat each other respectfully? Were we completely transparent? Did we have a good time doing it? Did we do good products? I love what I do and I know these guys do as well.  That's where the big publishers helped birth the indie market. "Well, if this doesn't sell over a million copies, we're not interested." I wouldn't focus on trying to hit a million units or saying that selling 200,000 copies is easy. It's difficult because you've got a lot of choice out there. I mean, I'd be happy to sell a million copies. That would be great. We're set up to be able to not have to be focused on that type of success. But if that level of success happens, then you're in a really good place.

Buy Now KRISTIN STREFF, Journal Star The entrance to the Spreetail office at Nebraska Innovation Campus offers a hint at what the e-commerce company does. It features an enclosure made from a shipping container and wood from pallets. Buy Now KRISTIN STREFF, Journal Star Spreetail employees work in their new office space last week at Nebraska Innovation Campus. Brett Thome compares Spreetail, the company he runs, to a duck. It looks calm on the surface, but below, things are going 100 miles an hour. These days, a comparison to a small fish might be more apt. And that fish is swimming in a sea of sharks. Spreetail is the Lincoln e-commerce company that burst on the scene last fall, announcing its presence with a name change and a move to Nebraska Innovation Campus. Since then, it has stayed the course, continuing to grow in its new space -- now up to 100 employees there and nearly 160 companywide, according to Thome, the CEO. The company earlier this summer opened a new distribution center in a suburb of Indianapolis, improving its geographic coverage, and Thome said it is looking to open another one in Georgia in the next two years and one in Texas after that. Last fall, Spreetail said it was working toward the goal of $1 billion in revenue and 800 employees by 2022, and Thome said that is still a goal the company sees as achievable. The e-commerce market is so big and is growing so fast that, "if we get one-tenth of 1 percent in 2022, that's $1 billion," he said. "That's a slice of a slice of the pie." The key is getting there intact in an industry that is changing and consolidating rapidly. Last fall, Spreetail had a similar-sized competitor just 50 miles up the road in Omaha in Hayneedle. But Hayneedle was acquired by Jet.com in February for $90 million, and then Wal-Mart acquired Jet.com less than six months later for $3.3 billion. In addition to consolidation in the space, more and more large competitors are ramping up their use of e-commerce. In Lincoln alone in the past year, Hy-Vee started grocery delivery and Google expanded its Google Express online delivery and service to Lincoln and all of Nebraska. Google, Wal-Mart and others are all chasing online sales king Amazon, which had $79.3 billion in e-commerce sales last year, six times as much as Wal-Mart, the second-largest company. By comparison, Spreetail had about $140 million in sales last year and is hoping to hit $200 million next year, as it keeps its focus mostly on selling home and garden items. Even for pure e-commerce companies, meaning ones that sell exclusively online, that's tiny. According to the website eMarketer, Wayfair.com had $1.9 billion in sales last year and Overstock.com did $1.65 billion. Before it was acquired, Hayneedle was doing more than $400 million a year. The numbers game would seem to make Spreetail a prime target for acquisition, and Thome said the company does get what he termed as "feelers" from time to time. But he said Spreetail has no interest in being acquired. Being privately held makes it much easier to ignore buyout offers because there are not outside investors clamoring for an "exit" so they can get a big return on their money. Thome said Spreetail wants to keep it that way and tries to be as frugal as possible to ensure it has enough money to both fund operations and invest in the future without the need for outside capital. It did splurge a bit on the Innovation Campus space, though. Spreetail's previous offices were in a building near the Lincoln Airport that used to house a garden hose manufacturer. Though there were a few high-tech touches, it looked like any other office space. The Innovation Campus offices, on the other hand, look like something that might be featured in Architectural Digest. The space, on the second floor of the Innovation Commons building, is very open, with polished concrete floors and exposed ceilings. What walls there are -- to create conference rooms and meeting spaces -- are made from shipping containers, a nod to Spreetail's business. There also are design elements that incorporate wood from pallets that are used to store product in the company's distribution centers. Like many other high-tech offices at mostly millennial companies, Spreetail's office has a rec room with video games and beer taps. Thome said the company wanted to create a fun workplace but one that isn't too fun. "We don't want to be the place everyone wants to work," he said. "We want to be the place where 5 percent of the right kind of people want to work." Thome said the new office has helped with recruiting, not only with bringing in new hires and interns from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln but also with potential employees who visit from out of state. While it introduced the name Spreetail last year, the company still doesn't advertise itself that way, using that name mostly only for recruiting. Its website still operates as VM Innovations, its previous name. When Indiana officials put out a news release last month about the company opening a distribution center there, there was no mention of Spreetail. "The only place we're known as Spreetail is Lincoln," Thome said. That's by design. For one thing, the company wants to attract as little attention as possible from large competitors. "We want to stay off of lists and radars," Thome said. Another reason, though, is that the company wants to have all its ducks in a row before attempting to make a big splash. "What we do not want to do is go out and launch under the Spreetail name and not be able to deliver," Thome said. So it will continue to focus on growth, adding distribution centers, adding employees -- especially software developers -- and attempting to steer clear of any sharks -- or duck hunters. Thome said he is really optimistic for the future, despite all the competition and consolidation. "Do we think there's going to be 20 e-commerce companies, long term," he asked. No, he said, but there will be a handful, and Spreetail expects to be one of them. "At the end of the day, people are always going to want options," Thome said.

Twitter user George Garrett spotted Xiaomi’s Mi Box at a Walmart store, complete with a price tag of $69.00. According to a photo posted by Garrett, there were three Mi Boxes on this Walmart store’s shelf. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69. Was this released yet? pic.twitter.com/AsuNZeU5oJ — George Garrett (@garrettdotcom) September 23, 2016 What’s notable about the Mi Box’s appearance in Walmart is that Xiaomi hasn’t made any announcements regarding the device’s pricing or launch date. In fact, the closest that we’ve gotten to learning that info is a recent report that claimed that the Mi Box would launch in early Q4 2016 for less than $100. Considering that Xiaomi hasn’t actually announced the Mi Box’s availability yet, it’s possible that this Walmart just put the Mi Box on shelves early.  The Xiaomi Mi Box includes features like a quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, output at up to 4K 60 frames per second, and both HDMI and USB 2.0 ports. There’s a Bluetooth voice remote control in the box, and Xiaomi will offer a Mi Game Controller separately if you’re into gaming on the device. Would you buy a Xiaomi Mi Box for $69?

The proposed route. Proposed schedule for the new 'Route 65' in North Adams. PreviousNext BRTA Considering New Loop Route for North Adams By Tammy DanielsiBerkshires Staff 06:24PM / Friday, September 23, 2016Print | Email Administrator Robert Malnati says he rides the bus when he can to see how things are working. NORTH ADAMS, Mass. — The Berkshire Regional Transit Authority is considering a new loop in North Adams as a way to get its riders where they need to go in a faster and cost-neutral manner. Dubbed "Route 65" for the moment, the loop as currently proposed would start and end at the Walmart Supercenter on Curran Highway every hour starting at 6:30 a.m. Route 1 from Walmart south would continue until 6:30 p.m. The loop route would hit the Ocean State Job Lots plaza (turnaround), Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, Main Street, two stops at Mohawk Forest, Berkshire Medical Center North Adams, and then the reverse. The Walmart and Main Street stops would be timed to line up with Route 1 (Pittsfield-North Adams) and Route 3 (Williamstown-North Adams), respectively. Currently, Route 1 travels from Pittsfield to Main Street, North Adams, but changes to Route 31 as it heads to Mohawk Forest. Then it changes Route 33 to BMC North. The creation of the North Adams loop is expected to cut a half-hour of travel between the two cities. Administrator Robert Malnati said the input from public hearings like Friday morning's at First Baptist Church would inform plans to be presented to the BRTA board of director next week. If approved, any changes would likely start near the beginning of November. The wish list for years has been to add evening and possibly weekend services, he said. Those have consistently shown up on surveys dating back some years. "If we had that extra money, this is how we would spend it," Malnati said the agency has told Beacon Hill. "We would implement later evening services, we would try out a few different routes, see how they go how that would be received and eventually morph into a Sunday service, maybe Saturday." But that's not happening this year, he told the handful of residents at the public hearing on route changes. "There is no extra money coming from the state, in fact, our budget is based on a budget from two years ago." The regional transportation funding for the entire state has been set by the governor at $80 million; in fiscal 2015 and 2016, legislators had overridden that to bump up funding. RTAs had hoped for more in this fiscal year, but it didn't happen. "We're stuck at an $82 million pot for us," Malnati said. "That translates to about $2.5 million for us. Fixed route service alone costs us over $4 million to put on the street as it is. ... "What we're trying to do is tweak it and make it more user-friendly, to go where we need to go without incurring additional costs because we know it's not coming from the state." Regular rider Yesmine Sarkis wondered if there was a way that customers could help. "It affects the economy overall. People can't afford to go back and forth to work," she said. "I wish we could get the public on board as well." Malnati, however, said the transit authority was heavily subsidized by the state and that raising fares as revenue would affect those who couldn't afford it. Walmart was determined as a good waypoint because people often needed to go there whether working or shopping. In response to questions, Malnati said the company had in the past provided bus shelters for its stop but the BRTA had not approached it about further funding. The idea was to develop more of an express along the routes by using the Walmart as a transfer point. A smaller bus would be used for the North Adams loop and riders would pick up the larger bus headed for Pittsfield. "We want to make sure people understand that this should be the same amount of time and Walmart is not the end of the destination," Malnati said. Kenneth Birck, also a regular rider, said riders are going to be worried about making their connections and transfers. "There are going to be a lot of people unhappy ... because they have to transfer," he said. A stop at the Cheshire post office on Route 1 would only be used on demand. That alleviated some of the concern raised by Richard Greene about safety issues with the large bus exiting from Richardson Street in Cheshire on its northbound runs. Malnati said they would look into a turnaround to have the bus return to Route 8 at the light on Church Street if it stops at the post office. The Route 7 bus, which is subsidized in part by Williams College to provide access for its students to local schools and Pittsfield, may be discontinued or reduced to only morning and afternoon because of low ridership. Malnati said the route would be weighed at the end of the month when the numbers are in. He also said off-service buses, those ending or starting their shifts, could be become active. It didn't make sense for a bus ending its run by going to Pittsfield, or starting by leaving Pittsfield, not to carry passengers. Those attending did not have any comments specifically opposed to the route change but did warn that the BRTA may run into some problems. Kenneth Birck, also a regular rider, said switching to a smaller bus could cause congestion at the beginning of the month because many people were doing their shopping at Walmart. "Even the big buses get busy on the first of the month at Walmart," he said, especially with the added number of people using wheelchairs. "You're ridership is way up ... first of the month you see a huge increase in ridership." Sarkis said the bus drivers are often in a situation where someone in a wheelchair or with too many items has to be left behind for the next bus. "That poor driver is trying to be courteous but someone gets left behind," she said. "During that first part of the month, you might want to have the big bus." They also suggested having a backup vehicle. Those who are eligible for paratransit don't always use it because of the cost, said Birck. "That's something we're going to have to wrestle with. Do we need another bus and where would we stage it?" Malnati said. There were also questions on small amounts left on Charlie Cards that bus drivers can't accept; those can be brought to the Intermodal Center in Pittsfield to be combined or added to. Malnati said the BRTA has no control over the administration of the cards. People are also bringing their bikes more, which Malnati said was a good thing but which, at the same time, illustrated that the BRTA wasn't serving some populations because they needed bikes to get home because no buses were running. The authority now has two-bike racks on buses and is looking at installing three-bike ones. Malnati also plans to ask the general manager about adding a transfer point in Allendale in Pittsfield because riders now have to go back to the Intermodal Center to pick up Route 1 back to North Adams. Several people also encouraged the BRTA to have more information posted on buses to let riders know what was happening and said drivers should be able to provide updated information. Both Birck and Sarkis said BRTA drivers, in general, were a conscientious and friendly group who often know their riders and their families. "There's a genuine caring there," Sarkis said, calling the daily riders and drivers a kind of family. "They care about what's going on in our life."

The east-metro locations now offering the service include Cottage Grove and Oak Park Heights. A Monticello store also has the service, and a Maple Grove location will join the mix on Oct. 6. Customers using the free service can browse about 30,000 items in Walmart’s grocery inventory, and millions of additional items available at Walmart.com. A $30 minimum purchase is required. They choose a pickup location and time they intend to arrive — from later that day up to three weeks in the future. The customers are then instructed by e-mail and phone where at their store to seek out their purchases. Typically, they would not have to leave their cars but just call a phone number provided to them.

Regulators in Allegheny County have approved the first phase of a two-part environmental review Wal-Mart needs before work can begin on the new store planned in McCandless. The Allegheny Conservation District has approved Wal-Mart's plan for how it will keep sediment out of Pine Creek during construction, said Kelly McLaughlin, an assistant district manager. The application has been sent to the state Department of Environmental Protection, which will conduct a second review, she said. The agency works on behalf of DEP to administer erosion control programs, review plans, inspect construction sites for compliance and investigate complaints, McLaughlin said. “Once DEP reviews and approves the sediment control plan, we'll be able to issue a permit,” she said. The Benton, Ark.,-based retail giant is planing a 155,000-square-foot super store on 23 acres along Blazier Drive. The state Supreme Court recently decided not to hear an appeal from a McCandless residents' group trying to block construction of the store. DEP spokesman John Poister said developers are required to demonstrate how they will prevent silt and other pollutants from being discharged into nearby Pine Creek during construction. Stormwater runoff at construction sites is a major environmental concern because it can carry debris that clogs storm drains and causes flooding, Poister said. The state also requires that soil from construction sites be tested to ensure it is not contaminated. Soil tests conducted by Wal-Mart in February determined there are no contaminants present, Poister said. After construction is completed, regulators will visit the site to ensure that the curbs, banks and retention ponds required to handle stormwater are operating properly. Poister said Wal-Mart applied for a permit on Feb. 3, 2015, and it is being reviewed by DEP's Waterways and Wetlands Program. While there is no timetable for completing the review, he does not anticipate a problem. “Wal-Mart has these construction sites down to a science,” he said. “They probably know as much about the regulations as anybody else and they are very familiar with what is required in Pennsylvania.” In addition to the environmental permit, Wal-Mart will need a highway occupancy permit from the state Department of Transportation. Yasmeen Manyisha, a spokeswoman for PennDOT's District 11 office, said the company's application is under review, but couldn't say how long the process will take. While PennDOT does not typically gather public comment when deciding whether a highway occupancy permit should be issued, people concerned about specific details of an application can ask the agency to intervene on their behalf, Manyisha said. “They need to reach out to the (transportation) district and request an intervention,” she said. “Eventually, they and PennDOT will file for a hearing before an administrative judge who will determine if they have standing.” When PennDOT issued a highway occupancy permit in early 2014 for a Wal-Mart proposed along University Boulevard in Moon, members of the community group Moon First appealed the agency's decision, saying traffic from the store would impede their ability to safely exit a residential street. Wal-Mart began construction shortly after the transportation agency denied the group's appeal in August 2015. The 150,000-square-foot super center is expected to open this fall. The state highway and transportation permits are needed before McCandless can issue grading and building permits, according to the town's planning director.

LOCAL L.A.

A 12-year-old boy was arrested after starting a fire inside a Walmart in Barstow and causing $1.2 million in damage, deputies said. (AFP/Getty Images) Veronica Rocha With the flick of a lighter, a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the crafts section of a Barstow Walmart this week, causing at least $1 million worth of damage, police said. The boy rode off after setting fire to the merchandise around 2 p.m. Wednesday, police said. He was found later that day in a neighborhood nearby and arrested on suspicion of arson, said Barstow Police Lt. Chris Kirby. The giant retail store at 621 Montara Road has remained closed due to water, fire and smoke damage throughout the building, he said. “That’s a substantial loss for Walmart,” Kirby said, adding that the incident also required many firefighting resources. The boy wasn’t with his parents when he set the fire, police said. Surveillance video showed the boy — who was wearing a backpack and green T-shirt with distinct markings — igniting the crafts and then riding out of the store on his scooter, Kirby said. Several Walmart employees attempted to douse the flames with fire extinguishers but were unsuccessful, police said. Three employees suffered from smoke inhalation and were treated at the scene. Eventually, firefighters from Barstow Fire Protection District were able to snuff the blaze. After discovering that the fire was likely arson, police began talking to witnesses and looking at evidence. They searched surrounding neighborhoods for the boy. Finally, police spotted the boy as he rode his scooter near Rimrock Road and Opal Street. He was taken into custody and his parents were notified, police said. He has not been identified because he is a minor.

News New Music Culture Features Lists The Archives Share < br />this article: News \ Justin Timberlake Abandons Sexy, Premieres Trolls Soundtrack in Every Walmart in America Anna Gaca // September 23, 2016 Share < br />this article: CREDIT: Getty Images Did you go to Walmart this week? What were you looking for? A 64-pack of paper towels? A rifle? The sudden realization that your teen idols will never again carry the glow of youth and creativity they once did? Well, you were in luck: Yesterday, Bud Light Platinum enthusiast Justin Timberlake, once hailed for bringing sexy back, premiered the soundtrack to Trolls, an animated film based on a fad toy, at Walmart. At every Walmart. Trolls: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack debuted “in all 3,900 Walmart stores across their in-house radio station, Walmart Radio,” Sony/RCA said in a press release. (Not to nitpick, but: there are actually only 3,868 U.S. Walmarts.) Walmart Radio, yes, is a real station—it’s played in every Walmart store since 2015. It even has real human DJs, plucked from the ranks of ordinary Walmart employees, who probably never get a chance to premiere much of anything. If you didn’t shop at Walmart yesterday, you aren’t missing much. You’ve almost certainly already heard Timberlake’s lead single, the insipid “Can’t Stop the Feeling.” But have you heard the remix, featuring the backing vocals of his Trolls co-stars James Corden, Zooey Deschanel, Anna Kendrick, and Gwen Stefani? That’s four more unstoppable feelings. There’s also “What U Workin’ With?,” a Stefani/Timberlake collab. True story: I’ve abandoned brick-and-mortar stores mid-purchase because “Can’t Stop the Feeling” came on. No material item is worth getting that thing stuck in my head. Its success as a #1 single doesn’t change the fact that this whole endeavor should be beneath the Timberlakes and Stefanis of this world. The worst part, honestly, is that Trolls isn’t even out yet; this dumb movie doesn’t even hit theaters until November 2. That’s five and a half more weeks of “Can’t Stop the Feeling” on the radio, and then you’re going to end up seeing the movie with your baby cousins over Thanksgiving weekend and you’ll have to hear the whole soundtrack in action. Prepare yourself.

Barclays analyst Karen Short raised her rating on Wal-Mart’s stock WMT, -0.83%  to overweight from equal weight, and said the company was her “top pick” in the U.S. food and staples retailing sector. She raised her price target on the shares to $87, which is 20% above Friday’s closing price of $72.35, from $70. But Short said there is a good chance--“with a 70% probability”--that the shares could run up to $95, which would be 5% above the Jan. 8, 2015 record close of $90.47. “After years of struggling, we believe the changes made under new Walmart U.S. leadership are gaining traction, and we believe the turnaround is in the early stages,” Short wrote in a note to clients. “We also believe competitors have become somewhat dismissive of Walmart, and we believe this will prove to be a fatal strategic error.” FactSet The good news for potential investors, is that despite the recent improvement in sales results and the rally in the stock price, Short doesn’t believe the turnaround is priced in yet. She said only about one-fifth of the Wall Street analysts covering Wal-Mart have a bullish rating on the stock. The ratio of Wal-Mart’s stock price to earnings per share over the last 12 months—P/E ratio—was 15.59, according to FactSet. That compares with the implied P/E ratio of 20.04 for the SPDR Consumer Staples Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLP, -0.14%  and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.10%  P/E ratio of 17.65. “The stock is trading at a meaningful discount to the staples universe, and is clearly not being valued as a turnaround,” Short wrote. Don’t miss: Wal-Mart’s market share gain is Target’s loss, analysts say. That appears to already be changing, as Wal-Mart’s stock has run up 18% so far this year, while the consumer staples ETF has gained 5.6% and the Dow has tacked on 4.8%. The following are some changes Wal-Mart has made that Short believes helped trigger the turnaround: • Labor—The multiyear downtrend in the number of employees per U.S. store, and employees per 1,000 square feet of store space, bottomed last year. The company announced the first of two wage increases in April 2015, and offered all hourly U.S. employees an opportunity at a quarterly bonus of $550 based on sales, profit and customer experience. • Service—Walmart has implemented goals for achieving milestones for being clean, fast and friendly. Investments in wage rates and training have led to employees who were more engaged with customer service. • Fresh—A commitment was made to improve the quality of its grocery offerings, to have more locally sourced and organic products. • Assortment—New systems were put in place to help store managers use sales data more effectively. Managers were also given control over certain merchandise space for localization and the ability to markdown products. • Digital-to-physical—The company has joined other retailers in expanding the option to order groceries online and then pick them up at the store, which is known in the industry as click-and-collect. The company also announced in August plans to buy discount e-commerce retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion.

Attorney Michael Wright, who represents the family of John Crawford III in a federal wrongful-death lawsuit delayed by the department's investigation, told the Dayton Daily News (http://bit.ly/2ctqeKm) he is meeting with Lynch on Sept. 30. "We would hope that they would give us a little insight with regards to the investigation on why it's taking so long," Wright said Thursday. Department of Justice officials didn't immediately return calls for comment Friday. Officers went to the Beavercreek Wal-Mart on Aug. 5, 2014, after a man called 911 to report, in a recorded call, that someone was walking around waving an apparent rifle and "pointing it at people." Police said they believed Crawford had a real weapon and didn't respond to commands to put it down. Crawford had an air rifle from a store shelf. Officer Sean Williams, who shot Crawford, was cleared by a Greene County special grand jury a month after the shooting. Wright had sent a letter to Lynch in July asking the Department of Justice to wrap up its investigation by the end of August. "We want the investigation to either move forward or to stop," Wright said. "Because at this point, it is preventing us from doing anything in this case." Wright wants to depose Williams and another officer, but a federal judge has allowed the officers to avoid that process because of the Department of Justice investigation. "I don't know who's not doing what, but something has to be done," Wright said. "Something has to be done to prevent the types of killings that we are seeing day in and day out in this country." Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is based in Bentonville, Arkansas. ___ Information from: Dayton Daily News, http://www.daytondailynews.com Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Tom Mirandi, vice president of real estate at RD Management, said tenant announcements are expected in early 2017 at Academy Plaza, a brand new project to be anchored by Academy Sports + Outdoors and surrounded by 36,000 square feet of additional mid-sized retail space. Demolition is nearing completion at the site, which was home to Walmart until fall 2014 when the retailer moved to 3031 Memorial Parkway S.W. "We've gotten a lot of interest in the property," Mirandi said. "Unfortunately, we're unable to disclose anything specific, but we are speaking with a number of retailers, mostly national retailers, to occupy that space." Academy Sports will span about 63,000 square feet and create approximately 100 jobs when it opens next year. The nearest Academy stores are on U.S. 72 in Huntsville-annexed Madison County and Wimberly Drive in Decatur. Additional retail could be single-use or multi-tenant, but Mirandi doesn't expect any freestanding restaurants at the site, which has a two-way average traffic count of 93,000 cars per day and a population of 63,419 within three miles. When Walmart left the Drake Avenue site nearly two years ago, many residents worried about blight at the property. Mirandi said the redevelopment of the prime retail corridor is a "tremendous opportunity" for the community. "We own shopping centers all over the country so we are very adept at doing these kinds of projects," Mirandi said. "We have relationships with retailers all over the country so I think everybody will be very pleased at the end of the day with the outcome of the development, especially considering where it's coming from: from a large vacant box to something that's going to be new and vibrant."

A short straddle is an options strategy that profits when a stock's price doesn't move. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Sep 23, 2016 at 1:06PM Image Source: Getty Images A short straddle is a neutral options strategy that entails writing uncovered, or naked, calls and puts simultaneously, at the same strike price and expiration, on a certain underlying stock. With a short straddle, the potential for profit is limited, but the downside risk is not. Setting up a short straddle A straddle means to either buy or sell a call and a put option on the same underlying stock, at the same strike price and expiration. A long straddle consists of buying both a call and a put, and is essentially a bet on a large price movement in the stock. On the other hand, a short straddle consists of selling both a call and a put -- it is a bet that the stock will go nowhere. For example, let's say that I'm convinced that Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) will stay around its current price for at least the next month or so. As I write this, Wal-Mart trades for just shy of $73, so I could set up a short straddle using options expiring in about four weeks as follows: Sell one call option with a strike price of $73 for $1.27 per share Sell one put option with a strike price of $73 for $1.38 per share Keep in mind that since options contracts are written for 100 shares apiece, this trade would generate $265 in premium income for each call-put pair you sell. The best-case scenario The ideal case would be for the stock to close exactly at the strike price when the options expire. If this were to occur, you would keep the options premium you collected and both contracts would expire worthless, leaving you with no further obligation. In our Wal-Mart example, this means that our maximum profit is $265, minus whatever trading commissions you pay. Unfortunately, this isn't a perfect world, and this ideal case doesn't usually happen. So, let's take a look at the other ways this trade could play out. Breakeven points and loss potential Your breakeven points for a short straddle are the strike price of the options, plus or minus the total premium you collected. In the Wal-Mart example, this translates to $70.35 and $75.65. If the stock ends up within this range at expirations, you'll make money. If it ends up outside of this range, you'll end up with a loss. Source: Author It's important to point out that with a short straddle, you can lose money quickly if the trade doesn't go your way. Let's say that a market correction hits and Wal-Mart falls to $60 per share. If this were to happen, you'd be sitting on a loss of more than $1,000. Because there is technically no limit to how high a stock's price can climb, the amount of money you can lose on a short straddle is unlimited. Make sure you keep this in mind as you decide whether the relatively small profit is worth the risk. The bottom line on short straddles Short straddles can lose money fast, so they are rarely the best approach to make a profit from a neutral outlook. There are several good alternatives, such as a butterfly spread, iron butterfly, or iron condor, just to name a few. All of these earn profits if the stock stays in a narrow range, but have components that help limit your loss potential. I'm not saying that a short straddle never makes sense -- rather, I'm saying that you need to know exactly what you're getting into. And you'd better be pretty confident about the trade.

 Walmart forges processing partnership with Chase BI Intelligence Sep. 23, 2016, 12:43 PM 1,524 facebook linkedin twitter email print This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. BII See Also American Express has linked up with Global Payments Chase has debuted a new card aimed at small businesses Green Dot is looking to a younger audience JPMorgan Chase announced that it will begin processing Chase Visa payments made at US Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, along with Sam's Club's website, through ChaseNet, the bank’s closed-loop processing network for Chase Visa cards. The partnership marks an expansion of the relationship between ChaseNet and Walmart, which was previously confined to Walmart e-commerce processing.  It’s probable that Chase Visa cards comprise a significant share of Walmart’s overall card payments. Eighty percent of US consumers prefer debit or credit cards for both in-person and online payments, according to TransFirst, which means it’s likely that a considerable amount of Walmart’s purchasing comes from payment cards. Because Chase, which issues predominantly Visa cards, is the largest US bank by assets, it’s likely that it’s the issuer of a decent share of cards used for spending at Walmart. As such, it’s likely the number of payments the partnership will cover is not insubstantial.  That makes the expansion of the partnership a major opportunity for ChaseNet. ChaseNet was already processing Walmart e-commerce payments. Last year, Walmart’s digital sales totaled $14 billion, according to Fortune. And that’s a segment that’s growing — global online sales grew nearly 12% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2 2016. But the expanded partnership gives them much more access. Walmart’s shopper traffic in-store is also growing, according to Fortune, which means ChaseNet will also get access to this population. In addition, adding Sam’s Club’s online business, which grew by46% in Q4 2015, gives ChaseNet access to another large and fast-growing revenue stream.   And it could also help lower interchange payments for Walmart, which has been a sticking point for the retailer in recent months. Walmart pays a considerable amount in card fees annually. And earlier in 2016, the retailer sued Visa over its fee structure. But for its partners, ChaseNet provides fixed-rate and often discounted interchange pricing on eligible cards, which means that Walmart would pay considerably less on any purchase made via a Chase Visa card, thereby decreasing fees on a number of purchases. That could help relieve tensions between Walmart and Visa in other areas by making fees across the board more affordable. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on payments gateways that explains what they do, the benchmarks on which they compete, their growth drivers, and the key players. It also assesses the potential for gateways to impact legacy processors.  Here are some key takeaways from the report: Payment gateways help e-commerce merchants accept online transactions. They serve as the online version of a payment terminal and front-end processor for online and mobile sellers. Gateways typically sell bundled services, including payment acceptance, data reporting, and fraud management. Gateways have an opportunity to capitalize on the growing online processing market. BI Intelligence estimates that the US online processing market — from which gateways extract some of their revenue — will be worth about $10.7 billion this year. The market will grow to $17.5 billion by 2020, driven by the increase in online shopping. As online sales rise, gateways' addressable audience — e-commerce merchants — is getting both larger and more valuable, affording gateways an opportunity to seize and compete for more potential revenue. Gateways pose threats to the old guard as more merchants embrace the online-to-offline (O2O) business model. Many of the most successful tech companies, like Uber and Airbnb, leverage an O2O model, in which customers pay for in-person goods and services digitally. With an early-mover advantage among these types of retailers, gateways might begin to displace revenue from legacy processors because they will substitute rather than complement in-store processing volume. In full, the report: Explains how gateways function and compete with each other in the payments ecosystem. Identifies the factors enabling gateways to capture long-term growth. Forecasts the size of the online and in-store processing markets to give context on the industry gateways operate within. Lists the key gateway providers and explains what makes each successful. Assesses the disruption opportunity for gateways and how this will affect legacy processors. Interested in getting the full report?

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 23, 2016 12:02pm   Comments Share: Related WMT Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Children's Place Rises On Strong Q3 Results; DryShips Shares Tumble 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Thursday Nasdaq Holds Leadership Baton Again; Best Buy Soars On Earnings (Investor's Business Daily) Related SFM Strong Sector-Wide Grocery Performance Monday Leads Director To Add Shares 7 Stocks That Rallied Four Days, Then Sold Off Yesterday Barclays initiated coverage of the food and staples retailing industry with a Neutral view and categorized the 19 stocks in their coverage into four groups, namely: "growth stars, stable staples, in transition and attempting to reinvest." In a note released Thursday, the firm said it is Overweight only on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ: SFM) and Performance Food Group Co (NYSE: PFGC). Barclays analyst Karen Short noted that most stocks in the sector have declined notably in the year-to-date period. The analyst sees challenging times for the food retailers, given successive years of deflation. With Wal-Mart acting as the disruptor, the analyst sees most companies in her universe facing risk. Related Link: Barclays Neutral On Food & Staples Retailing Stocks Accordingly, Barclays feels many names will remain range bound for the next several quarters. Naming Wal-Mart as its top pick (upgraded to Overweight), the firm noted that it has assumed coverage on the retailer and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) at Equal Weight. Explaining the rating from the returns perspective, Barclays noted that its Overweighted stocks are likely to generated returns of 17.9 percent compared to 4.9 percent for Equal Weight and -0.4 percent for Underweight. The four segments Barclays used to categorize companies in its coverage is based on whether a company can generate or reduce shareholder value in the context of growth top line and increasing return on invested capital. Those categorized as growth stars or stable staples are gaining share and have appropriate long-term strategies. Meanwhile, companies in the transition quadrant may be kept in the quadrant in the intermediate term due to secular challenges despite their best efforts and appropriate strategy or need to alter their strategy to create incremental shareholder value and transition to being a growth star or stable staples. Those in the attempting to reinvent quadrant face meaningful secular challenges, and in most cases, valuations reflect these challenges. Barclays Segmentation Of Food Retailers Growth Stars: Casey's General Stores Inc (NASDAQ: CASY): Equal Weight, $116 price target. Sprouts: Overweight, $24 price target. Five Below Inc (NASDAQ: FIVE): Equal Weight, $42 price target. Smart & Final Stores Inc (NYSE: SFS): Equal Weight, $13 price target. Stable Staples: Costco: Equal Weight, $158 price target. Wal-Mart: Overweight, $87 price target. Kroger Co(NYSE: KR): Equal Weight, $33 price target. SYSCO Corporation(NYSE: SYY): Underweight, $48 price target. Performance Food Group: Overweight, $28 price target. SpartanNash Co (NASDAQ: SPTN): Equal Weight, $31 price target. In Transition: Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG): Equal Weight, $74 price target. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR): Equal Weight, $88 price target. Whole Foods Market, Inc. (NASDAQ: WFM): Equal Weight, $30 price target. Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BIG): Equal Weight, $51 price target.

When it comes to buying one of our main necessities, food, we have a lot of options.  We have choices within our home communities, we have choices in neighbouring communities and we have choices in larger regional centres.  Overall, in Canada, there are lots of choices, especially as non-traditional grocers, like Wal-Mart, continue to enter the market.    Consumer choice means that stores are fighting to differentiate themselves and increasingly, price is where they are choosing to compete. Food is a necessity and low food prices are extremely important to all Canadians.  The problem is that these low prices must come from somewhere and in almost all cases, they are being pushed further down the chain, towards the producer. Last year, Wal-Mart’s extra aggressive cost cutting put it in the news. The retail giant has always been known for driving a hard bargain with suppliers, but last year, when faced with weak earnings, the retailer began asking for additional cuts. Reuters reported that unlike previous years, where negotiations took place between suppliers and the retailer, last year, the retailer took a more aggressive stand. The concessions demanded including asking suppliers to take money earmarked for joint advertising and displays and to instead use this money to lower the prices charged to the retailer. The problem is that Wal-Mart represents such a big share of the retail landscape, companies are hesitant to push back and find themselves no longer on those shelves. Wal-Mart isn’t the only one driving a hard bargain. This summer, Loblaw Cos. Ltd. was reported to have sent a letter to its suppliers asking for a price decrease of 1.45 per cent for shipments beginning in September. In response United Grocers, the buying group that represents many of Loblaw’s competitors, also sent a letter insisting that they be given the same price cut as their competitor. The problem isn’t just a lot of competition, it’s compounded by increased concentration, which is creating larger, more powerful buying groups. We have to think about what that means not just to us as consumers, but also as suppliers. Statistics Canada tracks food prices as part of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). From July 2015 to July 2016, the price of food purchased from stores increased by 1.1 per cent. However, not every type of food increased in price.  Some of the decreases were seen in fresh or frozen meat excluding poultry (1.7 per cent), non-fish seafood (1.7 per cent), dairy and eggs (0.9 per cent), bakery products (0.1 per cent), cereal grains and cereal products (0.9 per cent) and preserved fruit and fruit preparations (0.2 per cent). Interestingly, most of these products are closest to their raw, from the farm, form. On the flip side, StatsCan’s Farm Product Price Index (FPPI) measures the changes in prices that farmers receive for the agricultural commodities they produce and sell. The most recent release finds that the FPPI fell by 0.3 per cent in June 2016, compared to June 2015. Most of the decline was driven by falling cattle prices, which were down 7.8 per cent.  This release marked the fifth consecutive month where the index has shown a year over year decline. As shoppers, we all want low prices and for many families, low prices are an undeniable necessity in order to put food on their tables.  But at some point, we have to consider where the relentless drive for lower prices will take us, and if it’s somewhere we want to go.

(Photo: Kinfay Moroti/news-press.com)Buy Photo When Curt Sheard looks around Dunbar, he sees the sweetest of memories. Along South Street, he sees summer days when he and his friends walked home from the pool, sticky with the juice of mangoes they’d pluck from trees. At the corner of Highland Avenue and Dora Street, he sees the acre where he was raised by a hard-working father and a mom who stopped the school bus she drove one afternoon to give Sheard a whooping after she spotted him running from a girl. He was a husky kid and the girl, he explained, “had really long nails.” Sheard, 43, laughs at this memory and leans back as if drawing joy from the past as he chatted outside the STARS Complex in Fort Myers as cheerleaders and football players arrived for practice for the Dunbar Rattlers, the youth travel league of which he’s the vice-president. Dunbar can be rife with danger, but its history is rich and its pride is deep. From the outside, its prospects for becoming a safe and prosperous community may seem bleak but there are dreamers like Sheard with aspirations that are only bright.

Sheard hopes to build a distribution plant for his sauces in the Dunbar community.  (Photo: Kinfay Moroti/news-press.com) “I’ve never sold drugs. I’ve never done drugs,” said Sheard, who is on the cusp of the biggest deal of his life. “At the same time I am Dunbar … I’ve traveled around the world and there’s no place like home.” I’m the past, current and I strive to be the future.” His dream is his survival tool. The father of two is working to exhaustion, running on four hours of sleep most nights as he launches his Big Boi’s BBQ sauces and rubs into 16 Walmarts from Bradenton to Naples along with working full-time as a construction project manager and volunteering for the Rattlers. Big Boi’s is set to arrive in stores Oct. 7.  He scored the deal after pitching during an open call this summer at Walmart headquarters. But to be clear, Sheard doesn’t see Dunbar as place where he needs tools to survive. His is the final profile in the "Surviving Dunbar" series: a look at how daily life is different for those who live under the threat of gun violence. “I honestly don’t like that title, ‘Surviving Dunbar’ because, you make it seem like it’s a war zone. Now if you say, ‘Curt, you’re surviving Afghanistan.’ Yeah, you’re surviving Afghanistan.” THE NEWS-PRESS Surviving Dunbar: Grandma uses hurricane shutters to stop bullets Dunbar pales to Afghanistan, where Sheard lived from 2011 to 2013 in Taliban territory as he managed the construction of an Army base.

Sheard hopes to build a distribution plant for his sauces in the Dunbar community. Kinfay Moroti/news-press.com Dunbar does reflect a compression of extremes in Lee County: poverty, unemployment, and homicides. Five years ago, Fort Myers ranked fifth in the nation out of cities of its size for murder, beating out the once-notorious Compton, California. The bloodshed has not abated. Often, the victims and perpetrators of the city’s most violent crimes have ties to Dunbar. But that’s not the Dunbar Sheard focuses on. On the evening we met, he pointed out the basketball courts and football fields teeming with kids and the warmth and respect extended to him by those who passed by. It’s not that Sheard is blind to negativity. “We’re the heart of the city and if the heart is not right, the city is not right … I think you’ve got to appreciate Dunbar because I do appreciate what it has to offer but you have to be willing to be part of the solution and a lot of people are like ‘I’m too scared.’” His teenage son and daughter attend Dunbar High. “My children interact with the same kids getting in trouble or they’re friends of friends of friends so my children may be one or two people removed from an incident, so if I can affect that 14-year-old-boy who’s out on the football field today or that 13-year-old girl who is out here cheering today so they can make a smart choice tomorrow, that may save my child’s life.” THE NEWS-PRESS Surviving Dunbar: Loss, hope and a pair of Air Jordans This season, the Rattlers began barricading streets near its practice fields so kids and parents would feel safer without cars driving by. They rent lights for the fields.  He does keep “his head in a swivel” but bad things can happen anywhere. The bad things don’t distract him from his dream. “Yeah, we’re f---ed up in our churches. We’re f---ed up in our houses. There’s no community support. There’s no police support and there’s no city and county support but at the same time, I’ve made the conscious choice that I’m going to put my brand back here in the same town where I grew up.” Sheard’s choice of words came in an impassioned stream after some prodding as to if his Dunbar was a romanticized version of reality. His words came from a place of being frustrated with journalists he sees as eager to pounce on the worst, when he sees so much good. “I’m not living in a world with rose-colored lenses. I choose to put on the biggest pair of yellow lenses so where I can see clearly enough where my path is clear. So no, I see the negativity but I refuse to allow it to separate me from my goal or ambition.” Sheard has strategic goals to broaden distribution for Big Boi’s sauces. He hopes to grow big enough to open a manufacturing plant in Dunbar along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and bring jobs to a community with a smattering of employment opportunities.

Sheard hopes to build a distribution plant for his sauces in the Dunbar community.  (Photo: Kinfay Moroti/news-press.com) Barbecue has long been his passion. After becoming the first in his family to graduate college, the former Army officer returned to Fort Myers, where he opened (and soon closed) a barbecue restaurant. At one point, he sold Mason jars of his sauces out of his Honda Accord. He tested his recipe with cooks around town. “It was, ‘Man, it’s alright,’ or ‘It’s pretty good’ or ‘You got something.’ In my community and my culture, I’ll take it to the bank because on the other side of the tracks, white people are going to love it. ‘Oh my God, it’s the best thing since sliced bread.’ If black people like it, white people love it. That’s a true statement. White people have been stealing from us forever. They stole rock n’ roll. They stole jazz. So if you like it, y’all will love it.” For those unfamiliar with Fort Myers, it should be noted that the railroad tracks remain a color barrier though mandated segregation was repealed in 1963. The tracks still largely, though not entirely, represent the division of where black people live and white people live. Last year, a black city councilwoman worried about placing a voting location in Dunbar, east of the tracks, out of concern white people would fear crossing the tracks. People thrive west of the tracks in what passes as paradise down the road from neighborhoods that have earned the city the moniker, “Lil’ Pakistan,” though you can count the number of streets between these two areas of town on your hands. Yet, if there were no dreamers in Dunbar, there would be no hope for a day when people don’t feel the need to adapt their lives to the fear of being shot. A grandmother wouldn’t have to keep her hurricane shutters up all year. A teenager wouldn’t stress about the physical ramifications of pressing the wrong “like” on Facebook. A mother could drive at night in peace in her own neighborhood. Learning how to cope with the murder of a loved one wouldn’t be a common part of growing up. Fear and hope can co-exist. A dream can be as sweet as a memory. And, in Sheard’s case, the dream tastes like barbecue sauce.

The two participated in the event for the first year. (Ashley Stewart/People’s Press) OWATONNA — More than 20 Steele County law enforcement officers scrambled through aisles of shoes and racks of clothing Wednesday evening at Wal-Mart in Owatonna. The officers, part of the Minnesota State Patrol, Steele County Sheriff’s Office and Sheriff’s Posse, Owatonna Police Department and Blooming Prairie Police Department, assisted 24 area children back-to-school shop. “It’s such a worthwhile program,” said Gina Shepherd, case manager at the Salvation Army in Owatonna. “I just love to see the smiles on the kids’ and the officers’ faces.” Shop with a Cop, a referral program started in 2008 by the Salvation Army, is designed to offer children between kindergarten and sixth grade in Steele County the opportunity to have a positive interaction with law enforcement, she said. Before 6 p.m., officers and children started trickling into the west entrance of Wal-Mart, where they were greeted by Salvation Army volunteers, who provided red “Shop with a Cop” T-shirts and name tags for the children and matched them with an officer. Most were matched at random, but 9-year-old Ashton Little approached the check-in table requesting Blooming Prairie Police Officer Dan Peach, an officer he hadn’t met but heard about from his grandmother who lives in Blooming Prairie. This year, there were at least 24 matches, each including a child and an officer. After being paired, the matches had their photo taken before either eating supper at Subway or shopping for new clothes, shoes and other school-related items. Peach, who had supper with Little before shopping, said it was his first time participating in the program. “I’m pretty excited,” he said, noting he enjoys working with children. “Me, too,” Little chimed in before taking another bite of his sandwich. Little said he was looking forward to the evening with Peach because he wants to service his country by being a cop or a member of the U.S. Army someday. “There’s nothing like hanging out with a cop for two hours,” he said. Little had his eyes set on some new clothes and shoes, while Donovon Scott, a 10-year-old paired with Blooming Prairie Police Officer Shane St. John, was looking forward to picking out shirts and pants. “You’ll be dressed pretty well after this,” St. John said. St. John participated in the program for his first year, too. “It’s an awesome opportunity,” he said. “I’m looking forward to hanging out and shopping.” After they finished eating, they each grabbed a shopping cart and ventured through Wal-Mart. The Salvation Army allotted $150 per child and officers were provided a list of the child’s needs and sizes for clothes. “Ready to shop ‘til you drop?” Peach asked Little, who nodded. Their first stop was the necessities: socks and underwear before checking out the shoe aisle, where many other matches were. Steele County Sheriff’s Posse Deputy Joe Schwering and his wife, Marilyn, were there assisting 6-year-old Eli Fedderly find his size in a pair of blue and black shoes. The Schwerings were also first-time participants of the program. “We thought it’d be interesting and good public relations,” Joe Schwering said. “And fun,” Marilyn Schwering added. After picking out a pair of shoes, Fedderly picked out a pair of green dinosaur slippers and a superhero backpack. The sheriff’s posse had about six officers helping with the program, making the sheriff’s office’s total 11, Shepherd said. While shopping, Wal-Mart employees scrambled to make snow pants and winter coats that weren’t out and priced available to the children and the officers. Nearly every child left the store with a new pair of snow pants, a winter coat and a hat and gloves. After checking off all the items on the children’s lists, the officers tallied the items’ totals to ensure each child got as much as he or she could before checkout. “Some over, some under, so it balances out,” Shepherd said. “Ultimately, the goal is the relationships.” She said the program is funded through the Salvation Army’s annual Red Kettle Campaign, which begins after Thanksgiving. Last year’s campaign, which brought in about $102,000 from community donations, allowed the Salvation Army to help more children through its backpack and Shop with a Cop programs, but Shepherd said the need is greater than the 27 children they helped this year. “There’s such a demand,” she said. “I wish we could bring in more every year.” Linda Seljeseth, service unit chairwoman at the Salvation Army, said of all the things the Salvation Army does, Shop with a Cop is her “most favorite thing to do.” And it was evident why as they chatted and joked with officers until their parents picked them up. “I’m truly thankful for the law enforcement in town because they work so well with us,” Shepherd said. “What other town can say they have this great of a response?” Reach reporter Ashley Stewart at 444-2378 or follow her on Twitter.com @OPPashley ASHLEY STEWART Owatonna People's Press reporter covering Steele County, Blooming Prairie and Medford government as well as health, transportation and community happenings.

The new feature allows customers to register online, pick out your items then pick them up curbside at the nearest Walmart location that has the option. "You can plan so you won't over shop," said Teresa Gaines of Ridgeland but she works in Pearl.  "There's a lot of positive things. They can have the innovatory pushed out so it's a quicker procedure so it has a lot of advantages." "I think it's going to save a lot of people some time and take some stress off some moms because moms have a lot to do," said Brianna Peacock of Star. The feature is aimed to helping busy moms or people who may have a physical handicap. "I'm sure it will help the business and save a lot of standing in line," said Otis Lichlyter of Brandon. "I think it's a tremendous convenience and I think it will help the business in many ways." Here's how it works: You go online, register, put in your zip code and if the Walmart nearby allows you to online shop, you can start making your list. You must have a minimum order of $30 dollars. "We'll have Designated parking spots on the side of the building to where the customer can pull in, call a number. Let the associate know that they're here and we will be bringing their groceries right out showing them their products and loading them up in their vehicles," said Matthew Nagorka, store manager of Pearl. Some people like the idea, but they'd rather use it for non-perishable items. "Fruit and vegetables. Produce, fresh things, no I want to go and shop those items for myself," Gaines explained. "I think it will be a good idea. I know SAMs has it too but I just never buy that much at SAMs but here at a regular store it probably will be better," said Phyllis Allen of Brandon. This online shopping option will be available at the Flowood, Clinton and Pearl locations. It launches on October 3. Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

Wal-Marts offering Spoolies: Buena Park Foothill Ranch Huntington Beach Irvine Laguna Niguel Orange Spoolies are back. The husband-and-wife team of Jeanne and Tim James of Dana Point has restored the quirky hair gadget through the couple’s company, San Juan Capistrano-based Spoolies Hair Curlers. The heatless curlers are available in 400 Wal-Mart stores. Users wrap a section of dry hair around the spool and fold it to secure the hair. Before long, the Spoolies make their mark, leaving the user’s hair curled. A five-pack on Wal-Mart’s website costs just under $6. “I used them when I was a little girl, and I remembered loving these curlers,” Jeanne James said. “They aren’t around anymore, so I looked into manufacturing them.” The Jameses manufacture Spoolies in San Clemente. Their deal with Wal-Mart is part of a commitment by the retailer to buy $250 billion in U.S. products by 2023. “Production close to conception is smart business,” said Cindi Marsiglio, vice president of U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart. “It keeps our items on our shelves, and it has a great community impact. It keeps more manufacturing jobs in the U.S.” Marsiglio said that where a product is made is becoming increasingly important to Wal-Mart shoppers, making brands like Spoolies “a very attractive proposition.” Spoolies once was a patented Conair product. The beauty giant canceled the trademark in the early 2000s, and James jumped at the chance to use the name. After a three-year quest, she claimed the trademark in 2006, then worked on improving the product by redesigning the curlers, making them hypoallergenic and heat resistant. A portion of the profits from every Spoolies sold will benefit girls education projects in Kenya, she said. Spoolies also will be found as an impulse-buy item near Wal-Mart checkout counters and hanging on clips around some 300 more stores next year, James said. “It will give us more visibility and is really a huge opportunity for us,” she added. James said Wal-Mart is constantly ordering more Spoolies, keeping the company busy. “Everyone is looking for healthy curlers, girls are softening their hair with soft waves, and people want things healthy and natural and organic,” she said. “People don’t want to use heat and damage their hair, and this is a great alternative, which is why they are so popular right now.” The company is developing a serum to make the curls last longer. Every year, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. hosts a summit to help U.S. manufacturers and suppliers grow, in addition to something called Open Call, which seeks new products made in the U.S. Spoolies attended the company’s most recent Open Call session. “They are a great example of a small supplier based in the U.S. with a new, fun item contributing to our commitment,” Marsiglio said. Products like Spoolies go in select stores to see how they will do and “prevent overwhelming the manufacturer.” Two-thirds of products sold in Wal-Mart are made in the U.S., Marsiglio said. The figure includes food sold at the stores. Contact the writer: hmadans@scng.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular O.C.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 22, 2016 at 8:02PM Wind turbines at a Wal-Mart store in Worcester, Mass. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has long been the bogeyman of the left as its low wages, union-busting, and monopolistic ways have made it a popular target among liberals. But on at least one important liberal issue, Wal-Mart is a shining exemplar. The nation's largest retailer, known for its rural and conservative values, is actually the biggest corporate solar power consumer in the country. In fact, Wal-Mart has been the biggest solar user for several years running. Last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, Wal-Mart had 142 megawatts of solar capacity, more than double all but one other U.S. company, Prologis, and Wal-Mart has completed 348 installations. The company's solar installations have accelerated in recent years, increasing from 59 installations in 2011 to 75 installations last year. A history of green business In 2005, former CEO Lee Scott set a goal for Wal-Mart to be completely powered by renewable energy. The company uses wind, fuel cells, and hydropower in addition to solar. Renewable energy sources now make up 26% of its global energy consumption, and those efforts have reduced the company's energy costs per square foot by 9%.   The company has a goal of reaching 7 billion kilowatt hours of green energy by 2020 and reducing energy per square foot intensity 20% from 2010 levels.    In addition to solar, the corporate giant has also made significant steps in using wind energy. Last year, Wal-Mart agreed to buy 58% of the output from Pattern Energy Group's new 200 MW Logan's Gap Wind Facility in Texas, serving 380 stores.  Wal-Mart has also experimented with wind turbines in stores, building 12 small wind turbines at a Worcester, Mass., location when it opened in 2010. It removed those turbines last year as subsidies for the small engines had been reduced, but the company has since made a number of other installations, including a large-scale wind turbine system in a California distribution center, a 265-foot tower with a blade with a 250-foot diameter.   Burnishing the bottom line and its image Unsurprisingly, a company with the motto "Save Money, Live Better" is focused primarily on saving money with its green program. According to one estimate, its global energy costs are around $1 billion, so even a 9% cut in those expenses would constitute a meaningful addition to the bottom line as well as free up cash that can be better spent elsewhere. But the steps the company's taking to be more environmental may also help warm it up to a demographic generally opposed to the retail giant. CEO Doug McMillon seems to be focused on undoing many of the sources of Wal-Mart's negative perceptions since taking the helm in 2014. McMillion boosted the company's minimum wage from $7.25/hour all the way to $10/hour over the last two years, setting off a ripple effect across the retail industry as peers like Target, TJX Companies, and McDonald's all followed its lead. Last year, when the governor of Arkansas (Wal-Mart's home state) was considering signing a "religious freedom" bill that would restrict LGBT rights, McMillon spoke out against it, saying: "Every day, in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve," helping to persuade a veto of the bill. Repairing its image is key if Wal-Mart wants to continue to grow domestically. The retailer is underrepresented in major cities and is still without a store in New York City. Its best-performing store type of late is its Neighborhood Market, smaller-format grocery stores that are intended for cities, which often don't have the real estate to accommodate a supercenter. Recently, it's slowed the pace of its store growth, but the urban frontier still presents ample opportunity, especially as it invests in e-commerce. Urbanites are among the most frequent online shoppers and are also the cheapest to serve, explaining why Amazon.com has been able to roll out its Prime Now one-hour delivery service in cities across the country. Going green makes good business sense for Wal-Mart, and if it can make it more attractive to potential customers, that'll be a big win for the company as it looks to turn its business around.

Speaking as someone with a diagnosis that worked in the service industry (worked at Walmart, grocery stores, and then was an over-glorified customer service rep for a cable company that advertised the position as "technical support" during hire, yeah) I was more or less totally annihilated by it to the point it made everything terrible. I actually quit the job because of how harmful and stressful it was to my mental health and my overall well-being. I tried to go back to school after that (it was a "safe zone" for me.) I did eventually buckle under it all. So, after a stay in the psych ward I've found my sense of "normal" for the most part now thankfully. I've personally had mental issues for a long time and avoiding of them in working them out I did two things, I was of mind to choke it back and keep going and simultaneously I was being a very "mind over matter" individual and tried to handle it all myself to a point, which lead to failure and me being about as nutty as Galvatron in G1 for a while. What you said though, that's not very promising. Service industry does take a special kind of person that is significantly more extroverted. "Ah, the power of public relations." Soundwave may be a Megatron fanboy, but I am as well. All Hail Megatron!

There are other jobs that hire with "no experience needed" But since you live in Georgia they assume you're already a handyman redneck who can fix a carburetor with a blindfold on. Which is unfair. I haven't applied yet, as my sleep schedule won't allow me to do much currently. What really sucks is being surrounded by people who aren't or have never dealt with any kind of mental illness aside from throwing me at a doctor. In their eyes i'm just a normal person who can handle anything "If I put my mind to it" If that were the case, I wouldn't be living here right now. Check out my Art Thread!

It's crazy how different freelance VS normal job hunting can be, in freelance half of the employers/people want you to talk yourself up like you're the next big thing while other expect you to be the most humble person ever. And it can be hard trying to tell before you even apply what they want, I personally am introverted and suck at fluffing myself up sound amazing so I prefer when I'm just allowed to give my resume and let that be that.

Townsquare Media According to a press release, around 11:30 Thursday night officers responded to the Mays Landing Walmart parking lot for the report of carjacking. The victim, a 34-year-old female, stated she was approached by a man dressed in all black and wearing a black mask, while she was entering her vehicle. The suspect made threats to harm her if she did not get out of the car. The victim complied and the suspect fled in the victim’s champagne-color 2003 Chrysler Sebring with New Jersey plates T74-GNS. The victim was not injured during the incident. The suspect was described as a male, 5’ 6″ to 5’ 9″ with a stocky, muscular build, dressed in all black. Anyone with information is asked to contact Hamilton Township Police at 625-2700.   SOURCE: Hamilton Township Police Department Press Release Newsletter Sign up for the WOBM-AM 1160 & 1310 Newsletter!

The store in Barstow remains closed for a fourth day as a result of the damage caused. Barstow police said in a statement that the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees tried to put it out with fire extinguishers but failed, and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters arrived and extinguished it, but serious damage was done by both fire and water. Police looked at surveillance video and saw the boy with a scooter and a backpack. He was found on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken into custody.

Box store touts corporate citizenship, dodges taxes Lowes.JPG Lowe's Home Center in Daphne, Ala. Lowe's is challenging its property tax assessments throughout Alabama including the store at Ala. 181 and U.S. 90 in Daphne. (John Sharp/jsharp@al.com). Print Email Kyle Whitmire | kwhitmire@al.com By Kyle Whitmire | kwhitmire@al.com AL.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 24, 2016 at 8:30 AM, updated September 26, 2016 at 8:51 AM comments Lowe's, I've got to hand it to you. If your store prices went as low as your newfangled tax strategy, you'd have to change your name to Wal-Mart. It's not like we shouldn't have seen something like this coming. Big box retailers have a long history outsmarting the taxman, starting even before you move into town. First, you tell city and county governments that you might set up show in their hometowns if the deal makes sense, which usually means millions of dollars in tax breaks and incentives. Take the store you recently built in Hartselle, for example. The city council there was so eager to have a Lowe's store that they gave up $1.2 million in sales taxes. All you had to do was pretend to be on the fence, and the locals did the rest. How's that go? "You can do it! We can help!" Sorry, that's the other guys' slogan. Regardless, they gave up $1.2 million, just for you. That's money that could have gone to schools or public safety, but instead, it helped pay for your new store. All under the assumption that at some point the city would have the opportunity to make that money back later. At least then, the city would have something. And something is better than nothing, right? It seemed that way at the time, but now it's not so clear. Once you planted your flag here, like a lot of big box retailers, you exploited loopholes in our tax laws and invented new schemes to avoid paying tax here. Already you've used tax avoidance schemes to dodge tens of millions in state income taxes. And now you want to dodge your property taxes, too. It isn't enough, I guess, that Alabama already has among the lowest property taxes in the country. You want to see how low Lowe's can go. I get it. I do. According to your filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, you have more than $20 billion of property in the United States. That must be a heck of a tax bill. Unless, suddenly, it wasn't worth $20 billion anymore. As AL.com reporter John Sharp wrote this week, you have invented a new tax dodge called the "dark store" strategy. The idea here is that you want to value your stores, for property tax purposes, at what their market potential would be if you backed up a truck and moved on down the road, leaving an ugly cinderblock shell behind. I admit you have an interesting argument. When chain retailers and restaurants abandon their stores, it's often hard to find a new tenant. Just look at how many old Kentucky Fried Chickens have turned into Chinese restaurants or payday lenders, or how many old Wal-Marts and K-marts (may they rest in peace) have turned into thrift stores. Only you want to pay taxes now on brand new stores like they were already one of those ugly empty cinderblock boxes. It's a neat trick, and a lot of other big box retailers are watching to see if it works. If you are successful, you might cut commercial property taxes in half or less, for them and many others. That's clever, and if you reported to your shareholders that the $20 billion in property you have nationwide suddenly dropped the same way you want the tax man to appraise your stores, I might be inclined to accept it. But let's face it. If you told your stockholders tomorrow that you sunk $10 million into a new store somewhere and then saw those improvements lose 85 percent of their value in just two or three years, you'd have problems. If you told them that happened everywhere, you'd have a shareholder revolt.   This isn't just a tax avoidance scheme. It's a scam. One perpetrated on cities and towns, big and small, all over this country. You come in with the promise of being an economic engine and then make them pay for the gas. The courts might find your scheme to be legal, but it sure isn't neighborly. Sooner or later, it's going to backfire on you. Just listen to Baldwin County Commissioner Tucker Dorsey who told Sharp that if a Lowe's building isn't worth more than $1.5 million to you, it might be better suited for some other public purpose.   "If they feel that a Lowe's is worth $1.5 million, we can offer that to them and transform the Lowe's into a school," he told Sharp. That might sound like a lot of tough talk, but it's coming from someone who holds the power of eminent domain. It's time, Lowe's, for you to be socially responsible. What does that mean? "At Lowe's, it means we're accountable – to customers, to our people and to the communities we serve. It means we aim to do what's right – to find a solution that works for all of us. It means we strive to be trustworthy – to do what we say and keep our commitments." That's what your CEO Robert Niblock wrote in his CEO letter last year, which he titled "What does it mean to be socially responsible?" In retrospect, however, he seems to have meant that as a question rather than a statement. Columnists John Archibald Kyle Whitmire Roy S.

Photo by Benjamin Hochman Hochman: Cubs fan just can't help it, even in Cardinals territory By Benjamin Hochman St. Louis Post-Dispatch Benjamin Hochman Sep 23, 2016 (…) Nancy Sheets, the grandmother of Jake Arrieta, at her home in Desloge MO. Photo by Benjamin Hochman DESLOGE, MO. • Down here in Cardinals country, KMOX crackles. Sixty-three miles south of Busch Stadium, they fervently follow their Cardinals in an old Missouri mining town called Desloge. And near the water tower and the Walmart is a pleasant neighborhood of septuagenarians. Curl around the back road and there’s a sweet brick house with white shutters but two contradictory signs posted. One has a picture of pumpkins and says: “WELCOME.” The other? “RESERVED PARKING — CUBS FANS ONLY.” Sure enough, Jake Arrieta’s grandmother lives here. The reigning Cy Young Award winner and Cubs star starter was born 30 years ago in nearby Farmington. New parents Lou and Lynda Arrieta moved to Texas four months later, but Lynda’s mother remained in Missouri. And now, at 76, Nancy Sheets is probably the biggest Cubs fan in Cardinals country. She watches every single Cubs game — not just every fifth one — sometimes in her light-blue Cubs T-shirt or bundled in her Cubs blanket, but always wearing her baseball-glove necklace, a gift from Jake. “I put it on the first day of spring training,” Nancy said, “and I don’t take it off until the season is over.” On Friday afternoon, Arrieta pitched in Chicago against the Cardinals. “I’ve said several prayers,” Nancy said, moments before the first pitch. “I started last night.” In the carpeted living room, there are two plush chairs and a couch, but it does not matter – Nancy will be standing. Well, pacing. Her hair is as white as home plate, and as she spots her grandson, her smile is as wide as a strike zone. Jake’s grandfather died in 2003. Nancy married Jerry Sheets three years later. They knew each other from church. Today, Jerry is controlling the remote, while Nancy tries to control her emotions. “Nervous, nervous, nervous!” she said. “You’d think I wouldn’t be nervous because I watched him all these years.” When she cheers, she often repeats a word – “Yes! Yes!” – or a sound – “Woo! Woo!” She watches pitches with her left hand gently pressed upon her chin. And when she celebrates, as when Jake struck out the first two batters in the first, she sticks her right arm in the air and opens her palm, like she’s trying to get the teacher’s attention. “She was over at her sister’s one night, and tore up the light!” Jerry said. “I didn’t mean to!” Nancy replied. “I jumped up and the light was kind of low. And I broke it. It was glass.” “I was sittin’ there on the couch!” Jerry said. “Couldn’t believe it.” Two outs, two strikes on Stephen Piscotty. “Come on, one more,” Nancy said, as a fastball froze the Cardinal to end the inning. “He’s listening to his Nanny! He calls me Nanny.” Getting together Nancy and Jerry’s first date was in Festus. “Pogolino’s Pizza Place,” Nancy said. Jerry Sheets lost his wife in 2004. In due time, he felt comfortable with Nancy. “We started going to church together,” Jerry said. “And we got married down in Branson in 2006.” Jerry used to play his acoustic guitar at church, years ago. Now he plays at home for Nancy — perhaps some Merle Haggard or Don Williams — or at local nursing homes, performing bluegrass, gospel or country. “He sings well,” Nancy said. The two occasionally go out to dinner, and seemingly every time that Nancy wears a Cubs shirt, someone will say, as Nancy excitedly imitated in a high-pitched voice: “What are you doing wearing?” She’ll politely explain to the Cardinals fans that her grandson is a Cub. “They can’t believe it sometimes!” she said. “They’ll want their picture taken with me.” It happens at Colton’s Steak House & Grill. And The Pasta House Co. Even at the service station at Cherokee Pass, where Jerry parked his motorcycle, “And a lady comes out and jumped all over me: ‘Whuddya wearing a Cubs shirt in here for?’” It gives the proud grandmother and step-grandfather a chance to show off. “And for a long time,” she said, “the days that he pitched, I would get blue helium balloons and tie them outside our house, on our little bench.” They don’t like the Cubs down in Desloge, but they do like Jake Arrieta. OK, but maybe just a little less on Friday. Nancy’s grandson struck out 10 Cardinals in his seven scoreless innings pitched, as he earned his 18th win of the season. Jake’s earned run average dipped to 2.85. And he allowed just five hits, so his opponents’ batting average is .186, the lowest of any starting pitcher in Major League Baseball. Deep roots When Arrieta was a boy, his grandfather would pick him up in a plane. Nancy’s first husband, Sonny, was a pilot of a small aircraft. Sonny would scoop up his first grandson in Texas and bring him to Missouri. And then sometimes, before they’d fly back to Texas, they’d first play catch in a nearby ballyard. “My late husband would have been so proud,” Nancy said. Nancy’s father has since passed, too. Herschel. He lived on a farm in Frankclay, an unincorporated community five miles west of the Flat River. On a wall near her living room, Nancy pointed out important family photos — Sonny, with his distinguished mustache; Jake, just married with his wife and a smile; Herschel, an elderly man next to a horse. Jake’s mother and little Jake sat atop. Turns out Arrieta’s great-grandpa, who died about two decades ago, was a huge Cardinals fan. “My dad was a farmer, an old-time farmer,” Nancy said, “and wore bibbed overalls with a long-sleeved shirt. But when then the Cardinals played, he’d put a Cardinals shirt on – and tennis shoes.” Benjamin Hochman @hochman on Twitter bhochman@post-dispatch.com Sports columns 10 Questions: Hochman on St. Louis sports Sep 23, 2016 (…) Sports Box score: Cubs 5, Cardinals 0 Sep 23, 2016 (…) Sports The Hoch Corner: Benjamin Hochman's forum for STL sports fans Sep 2, 2015 (…) Sports More Hochman: Columns, blogs, videos, podcasts Sep 6, 2015 (…) More information Cardinals notes: Cards put Garcia back in rotation Lefthander will start Monday against Reds.

Police say a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Wal-Mart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than $1 million. The store in Barstow remains closed for a third day on Friday because of the damages. Barstow police said in a statement that the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees tried to put it out with fire extinguishers but failed, and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters arrived and extinguished it, but serious damage was done by both fire and water. Police looked at surveillance video and saw the boy with a scooter and a backpack.

(Reena Rose Sibayan/Journal photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on September 24, 2016 at 3:00 AM comments On Sept. 5, police were investigating a possible theft in the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter at 400 Park Plaza Drive in Secaucus when they came across a separate incident — a man caught red-handed trying steal from the store, police said. Juan Rodriguez, 41, of the Bronx, was leaving the store with a backpack full of $561.54 worth of electronic devices when officers placed him under arrest, police said. The following day, two more men were arrested at the store when they allegedly tried stealing PlayStation controllers. For Secaucus cops, responding to these types of calls at Walmart is to be expected. Since Aug. 3, there have been 11 arrests at the superstore — 10 for alleged shoplifting and one for an attempted shortchange scheme, cops say. The week of Aug. 18 alone saw four arrests made at Walmart. While data is not yet available for 2016, police say that over 12 percent of all Secaucus Police Department arrests in 2015 were at Walmart — 121 of 964 arrests. Incidents at Walmart (458) accounted for 4 percent of the police department's total number of town-wide service calls in 2015. And while the superstore, which opened in 2004, is a frequent stop for Secaucus police officers, all of the people arrested there are not Secaucus residents. "Walmart is a big place and people come from all over to go there — from New York to other parts of Hudson and Bergen County," Capt. Dennis Miller said. "(Secaucus) is located centrally and is easily accessible to all these places. The other thing is that this one is open 24 hours a day." The store also generates millions of dollars in tax revenue for Secaucus. The Sam's Club and Walmart — both operated under the same company — contributed $1.5 million in tax revenue in 2015 for the town, and has thus far contributed nearly $1.2 million date this year, according to electronic tax records. Nonetheless, Mayor Michael Gonnelli said the town would like to sit down with Walmart officials and negotiate the cost of having an officer permanently positioned inside the store. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," Walmart spokeswoman Betsy Harden said in a statement. This would be in addition to Walmart's loss prevention staff, as well as a third party security firm that works overnight hours, Harden said. "They have loss prevention that works there already," Miller said. "We had met with one representative of Walmart to discuss them having a cop there full time — to be stationed down there as a detail and that officer would handle the call volume from there. But there's nothing to report on that right now."

Rashaad Moore, a high school sophomore, was shopping with his neighbor, a disabled veteran named Ray, when the man began having a heart attack inside the chain’s Fort Wayne, Indiana, store, KTLA affiliate WANE-TV reported. Moore didn’t wait for paramedics — he immediately started giving Ray CPR and is now credited with saving his neighbor’s life. Walmart manager Darlene Walker went to Northrop High School Friday and met Moore after school to thank him with two gifts: a 50-inch smart TV and a $100 gift card. Walker said she was “very pleased with what he did to stand up and help because that doesn’t happen every day.” With a wide smile, Moore said he was surprised and grateful for the support, saying, “I am very blessed that everybody is showing support and love, and I’m very appreciative.” Moore said he has a television that’s about 20 years old and is happy to be able to replace it. His friend Ray is still recovering and isn’t yet able to communicate, but Moore said he hopes to talk to him in the next few weeks. In May, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, wrote a letter to Walmart’s president urging the company to “to examine its internal security protocol to ensure effective deterrence measures are in place and reduce the burden on local police.” Rather than relying on taxpayer-funded police forces, Walmart could cut down on criminal activity at its stores with more staffing, uniformed security and better layouts, according to a report by the Tampa Bay Times. The newspaper found that authorities were dispatched to Walmart for disorderly incidents such as drunk customers and aggressive panhandlers more often than they were for shoplifting. Casey wrote that “large retailers like Walmart bear responsibility to have in place reasonable security measures to assist in the deterrence of frivolous crimes.” 41.079273 -85.139351 Filed in: Nation/World, News Topics: Indiana, Walmart Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Pinterest Email KTLA 5 News on Instagram Popular Arizona Grandmother’s Accidental Invite to Wrong Teen for Thanksgiving Dinner Goes Viral Texas Teacher Impregnated by 13-Year-Old Student She Had Sex With ‘on Almost Daily Basis’ Pleads Guilty: Report JetBlue Flash Sale Offers Flights as Low as $34; Book by Wednesday Video Shows Chili’s Manager Taking Away Free Meal From Army Veteran in Texas Latest News LA Auto Show- Opening Day Holidays at Disneyland Resort McDonald’s to Offer Table Service, Touch Screen Ordering at US Locations Fire Crews Respond to Pallet Yard Fire Burning in Perris Nation/World Tornados Barrel Through Central Indiana, Flattening Starbucks at Mall Nation/World Video of Indiana State Troopers Lip-Syncing to ‘Summer Nights’ at State Fair Goes Viral Nation/World Small Metal Blade Found Inside Candy Bar After Indiana Girl Bites Into Halloween Candy Nation/World Pennsylvania Man Crawls from Car Wreck 3 Days After Crash Kills Girlfriend Nation/World Suspected Meth Lab Discovered Under Walmart Parking Lot in New York Nation/World Indiana Police Officer Lies on Floor to Comfort Tearful Young Boy Having ‘Rough’ Day Nation/World Heroin Laced With Elephant Tranquilizer on The Streets; 10,000 Times Stronger Than Morphine Nation/World Indiana Mother Told Police She Used Her Hands to ‘Smother’ Two Young Children to Death: Court Documents Local News Sex Offender Suspected of Recording Girl, 10, in Walmart Bathroom Near San Diego: Sheriff’s Dept.

The meeting comes two years after the Department of Justice opened an investigation into the shooting of John Crawford III at a Beavercreek Wal-Mart. Crawford family attorney Michael Wright told the Dayton Daily News he hopes the Sept. 30 meeting provides insight into why the investigation is taking so long. Justice Department officials didn’t immediately return calls for comment Friday. A 911 caller on Aug. 5, 2014, reported a man waving a gun at the store. It was actually an air rifle taken from a shelf. Police say Crawford refused to drop it. The officer wasn’t charged.

Source: AAP 24 Sep 2016 - 1:32 PM  UPDATED 24 Sep 2016 - 1:32 PM Tweet A 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Wal-Mart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than $US1 million ($A1.3 million), police say. The store in Barstow remained closed for a third day on Friday because of the damages. Barstow police said in a statement the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees had tried in vain to put it out with extinguishers, and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters had put the fire out, but serious damage was done by flames and water. Police saw the boy on surveillance video footage with a scooter and a backpack and found him on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken to juvenile hall.

Attorney Michael Wright, who represents the family of John Crawford III in a federal wrongful-death lawsuit delayed by the department’s investigation, told the Dayton Daily News he is meeting with Lynch on Sept. 30. “We would hope that they would give us a little insight with regards to the investigation on why it’s taking so long,” Wright said Thursday. Department of Justice officials didn’t immediately return calls for comment Friday. Officers went to the Beavercreek Wal-Mart on Aug. 5, 2014, after a man called 911 to report, in a recorded call, that someone was walking around waving an apparent rifle and “pointing it at people.” Police said they believed Crawford had a real weapon and didn’t respond to commands to put it down. Crawford had an air rifle from a store shelf. Officer Sean Williams, who shot Crawford, was cleared by a Greene County special grand jury a month after the shooting. Wright had sent a letter to Lynch in July asking the Department of Justice to wrap up its investigation by the end of August. “We want the investigation to either move forward or to stop,” Wright said. “Because at this point, it is preventing us from doing anything in this case.” Wright wants to depose Williams and another officer, but a federal judge has allowed the officers to avoid that process because of the Department of Justice investigation. “I don’t know who’s not doing what, but something has to be done,” Wright said. “Something has to be done to prevent the types of killings that we are seeing day in and day out in this country.” Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is based in Bentonville, Arkansas.

According to previous records, Johnny Smith was charged with mischief and burglary in 2008 in Jones County. At the time he was accused of breaking into his ex-girlfriend's garage, killing her dogs and popping her tires. Authorities alleged he decapitated and ripped the other one open with a machete. He stood trial for those charges, but a jury found him not guilty. Smith was also once charged with embezzlement because some equipment came up missing after he was terminated from the south Mississippi narcotics task force. That charge was eventually dropped.

Roston - Sep 23, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit In case you’ve forgotten, Xiaomi has a sleek looking Android TV device in the pipeline called the Mi Box. This set-top-box will compete with the likes of Roku and Amazon as a consumer video streaming device, one that brings fairly high level specs compared to similar products. We’ve got a bunch of pictures and all the details in our hands-on from May, and now we may have a price: $69, at least per someone who spotted the Xiaomi Mi Box in a Walmart. Though the Mi Box was announced earlier this year, it hasn’t yet launched and it’s not entirely clear when it will. Speculation has it that we’ll be seeing it next month, and the price will be — according to the rumor mill — somewhere south of $100. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69. Was this released yet? pic.twitter.com/AsuNZeU5oJ — George Garrett (@garrettdotcom) September 23, 2016 Someone at Walmart didn’t get the memo, though, and put the device out on display with a $69 USD price tag, seemingly confirming its price while hinting that its launch is very close to happening. The Mi Box was spotted by Twitter user George Garrett who sent out the above tweet and photo. If it does launch at this price point, it would be hard to argue the Mi Box is anything less than a pretty great deal (in comparison, you’d have to spend $129.99 to get a Roku box with 4K support). The device offers a quad-core ARM processor and a couple gigs of RAM, 8GB of storage (that can be expanded), support for 4K at 60fps, a mic-equipped remote control for voice control, and support for all the major apps like Netflix, Sling, VUDU, Hulu, and more. The set top box can also be used for modest gaming, with Xiaomi planning to offer a game controller. Check out the timeline below for more info!

Garrott Benjamin Jr. Senior Living Center, holds photos of James Carpenter (left) and Calvin Bowie, two of the center's residents who were killed crossing North Michigan Road after being dropped off at a bus stop. The east side of the street where the men were dropped off lacks sidewalks and streetlights. (Photo: Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star, Michelle Pemberton/Indy Star)Buy Photo For the elderly residents at a northwest-side senior living center, a simple walk off campus to Michigan Road has become a deadly exercise. Three residents of the low-income apartment building have been struck and killed on the busy, fast-moving thoroughfare in five years. The latest was 89-year-old Horace Rounds, killed by a hit-and-run driver and left in a ditch Thursday morning, police said. Rounds had left a Walmart Neighborhood Market in the 5500 block of North Michigan Road, south of Kessler Boulevard. Rounds was the third resident of the Bishop T. Garrott Benjamin Jr. Senior Living Center, 4720 N. Michigan Road, since 2011 to be killed in traffic on Michigan Road in the dark. Calvin Bowie, 72, a Sunday school teacher, was killed in 2014 while crossing  the street in his wheelchair. James Carpenter, 65, a volunteer at the Indianapolis Children's Museum, was struck and killed in 2011. IndyStar highlighted their deaths in a story published Thursday as part of its "Left in the Dark" series about the city's pedestrian death toll amid a dearth of streetlights. Like Bowie and Carpenter, Rounds was struck while trying to cross Michigan Road in the dark where there are no streetlights and spotty sidewalks. Indianapolis police said a dog walker found Rounds in a drainage ditch on the west side of Michigan Road. He had apparently tried to cross the street from east to west at 6 a.m. where a sidewalk ended in front of the Walmart. Police said he was hit by a 1997 or 1998 Ford Expedition or a green 1997-1998 Ford F-150, which should have damage to the driver's front side, including a broken headlight. IMPD crash investigator Sgt. Doug Heustis said police were able to determine from a scattering of car parts in the street its make and model. Rounds lived at the senior living center for the past year and often took walks for exercise, said Thomas Benjamin, who manages the apartment building. “He liked to walk early in the morning because it was cooler,” said Benjamin, who described Rounds as a sweet, kind man. An IndyStar investigation found that more than half of the pedestrian deaths in Indianapolis happen at night where the roads don't have streetlights, a much higher rate than other cities. A 35-year moratorium on new streetlight construction has left huge swaths of the city poorly illuminated, even though the population has increased by 180,000 since the ban was put in place. Compounding the danger for pedestrians is that the city did not build sidewalks for 20 years and now would need to spend $750 million to lay them down just along the city's main streets. INDIANAPOLIS STAR Left in the dark: Indy's deadly streets An IndyStar reporter on Friday visited the spot where Rounds was killed, at about the same hour of the morning. The street was extremely dark, almost pitch black except for a solitary, recently installed streetlight at Oles Drive at least 200 feet away from where Rounds was run down. Jim Grey, 49, who has lived near Kessler and 56th Street for 21 years, said it is dangerous to walk in the neighborhood. "I learned very quickly that walking in the area is not wise," he said. "My kids attend Crooked Creek Elementary, which is definitely in walking distance, but they take the bus." Grey said he would would like to see more streetlights on Michigan Road and perhaps a lowering of the 45-mph speed limit. "I was surprised when I moved here from Terre Haute about the lack of streetlights," he said. "We could use some more infrastructure to make it more walkable since there is so much more commercial development here and places to go." Mayor Joe Hogsett announced this summer he would install 100 streetlights across the city, but none of the first 25 are planned for Michigan Road. "We are currently working with (the Department of Public Works)  and Business and Neighborhood Services, as well as IndyGo, to assess the pedestrian needs and identify the range of options that can improve the safety in the immediate area — including addressing the fact that the pedestrian crosswalk and bus stop have not matched up for years," mayoral spokeswoman Taylor Schaffer said in a statement. "It might also be worth noting that residents of the senior living center reached out to (Deputy Mayor) Dr. (David) Hampton yesterday morning about their safety concerns and he, Jeff Bennett, IMPD and a variety of department heads have been sorting through traffic studies and the range of pedestrian accessibility issues ever since." Lance Terry, 68, a resident of the senior center, was among those lamenting the loss of yet another member of the community.  Terry, who walks with the assistance of a cane, said he won’t venture beyond the apartment building’s parking lot. “I don’t walk out there,” he said, nodding toward the rush of traffic on Michigan Road. “It’s too dangerous.” Benjamin said police “are very aware of the risk people take when they travel on foot in this corridor.” “It’s very obvious something needs to be done,” he said. “How many individuals have to lose their lives because we’re being reactive instead of proactive?” The deaths of three men so late in their lives is a tragedy, he said. “To live that long and have it end this way, so tragically with them being hit by cars, it’s a shame really,” he said.

More than you might think Secaucus Walmart 11 percent of all arrests made for the year 2015 were made at the Secaucus Walmart Supercenter at Park Plaza Drive, police say. (Journal file photo) Print Email Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal By Corey McDonald | The Jersey Journal The Jersey Journal on September 23, 2016 at 11:54 AM comments SECAUCUS – On Sept. 5, police were investigating a possible theft in the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter at 400 Park Plaza Drive when they came across a separate incident – a man caught red-handed trying steal from the store, police said. Juan Rodriguez, a 41-year-old male from Bronx, New York, was leaving the store with a backpack full of $561.54 worth of electronic devices – including a pair of speakers and a GPS device – when officers placed him under arrest after he tried fleeing, police said.  The following day, two more men were arrested at the store when they allegedly tried stealing PlayStation controllers. For Secaucus cops, responding to these types of calls at Walmart is to be expected. Since Aug. 3, there have been 11 arrests made at the superstore – 10 for alleged shoplifting and one for an attempted shortchange scheme, cops say. The week of Aug. 18 alone saw four arrests made at Walmart. While data is not yet available for 2016, police say that over 12 percent of all Secaucus Police Department arrests made in 2015 came at Walmart – 121 of the 964 arrests made during the year. Incidents at Walmart (458) accounted for 4 percent of the police department's total number of town-wide service calls in 2015.  And while the superstore, which opened in 2004, is a frequent stop for Secaucus police officers, all of the people arrested there in the past month were not Secaucus residents.  "Walmart is a big place and people come from all over to go there – from New York to other parts of Hudson and Bergen County," said police Capt. Dennis Miller. "(Secaucus) is located centrally and is easily accessible to all these places. The other thing is that this one is open 24 hours a day." "(The Walmart is) really separate from the community, it doesn't really impact the community at all," added Mayor Michael Gonnelli. "It's in Harmon Meadow away from practically everything." The store also generates millions of dollars in tax revenue for Secaucus. The Sam's Club and Walmart – both operated under the same company at 400 Park Plaza Drive – contributed $1.5 million in tax revenue in 2015 for the town, and has thus far contributed nearly $1.2 million to date this year, according to electronic tax records. Nonetheless, Secaucus Police expend a consistent amount of time dealing with reports of theft at the superstore. Town officials say there have been talks of establishing a consistent police presence there, but nothing official has been established. Gonnelli said the town would like to sit down with Walmart officials and negotiate the cost of having an officer permanently positioned inside the store. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," Walmart spokeswoman Betsy Harden said in a statement.  This would be in addition to Walmart's loss prevention staff, as well as a third party security firm that works overnight hours, Harden said.  "They have loss prevention that works there already," Miller said.

ENSSLIN/Staff photographer)Buy Photo 23 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE TRENTON - Realistic looking toy guns no longer could be sold legally in New Jersey under a bill that has advanced in the state Legislature. The Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee on Thursday voted 4-2 with one abstention to forward the measure, which would require that toy makers include a 1-inch-wide, non-removable orange stripe along the barrel of a replica gun. The bill requires that the toy also be a color other than black, blue, silver or aluminum. NEWS FROM CAMDEN: Suspect charged in 8-year-old's shooting death The bill now advances to a vote in the full Assembly, but so far no version has been introduced in the Senate. Gov. Chris Christie has opposed a series of gun-related bills adopted by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. But Assemblywoman Sheila Oliver, D-Essex, who sponsored the toy gun ban, said her bill deals with a specific problem that is different than other gun control measures. Oliver said she decided to sponsor the bill in response to the November 2014 fatal shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was killed by police while holding an air pellet gun. Such guns are required by federal law to have an orange tip. While testifying Thursday, Oliver held up a black plastic replica of an automatic handgun that she said can be bought by children in a local corner store. “I am sorry,” she said. “I take umbrage with that when there is something like this that can be purchased in a confectionary store and a 12-year-old can be dead.” Oliver testified along with Ted Green, council president in East Orange, where officials passed an ordinance banning the sale of such toy guns. Assemblyman David Rible, a retired police officer, opposed the bill, saying it could create a potentially lethal situation if criminals were to paint an orange stripe along the barrel of a real gun and use it to kill a law enforcement officer. “I think we’re setting ourselves up for a larger unintended consequence,” Rible said. Rible, R-Monmouth, said he understood the intentions behind the bill but said it would prove ineffective. Police officers have to make split second decisions when confronted by a gun, he said. Rible cited one study that found 96 percent of officers were unable to distinguish between real and orange-tipped pellet guns in a shoot/don’t shoot scenario. Oliver countered that the problem with toy guns also involves confrontations between children that turn deadly. John C.

Luc Tieman (Photo: Contributed) An autopsy revealed that a former Greenville resident who was reported missing in Maine died of two gunshot wounds to the head, according to a police affidavit. The court document also detailed the police investigation into Valerie Tieman's disappearance and how her husband changed his story multiple times when speaking with detectives. Luc William Tieman, 32, of Fairfield, Maine, was charged with murder in the death of his wife, Valerie Tieman, a 34-year-old woman who grew up in Greenville. Her body was found Tuesday after no one had seen or heard from her in weeks. Valerie Tieman's parents last communicated with their daughter on Aug. 18 through Facebook, according to an affidavit filed by Detective Hugh Landry of the Maine State Police. On Sept. 8, Luc Tieman told Valerie Tieman's parents that she left him and he hadn't seen her for some time, according to the affidavit. "Valerie's parents felt it was unusual for her to go this long without contacting them," the detective wrote in the court document. At this point, Luc Tieman had not told authorities about his wife's disappearance. Her parents reported her missing Sept. 9, and officers with the Fairfield Police Department went to the Tiemans' residence in an effort to find her. The couple shared a home with Luc Tieman's parents, but his mother told officers the couple no longer lived there. Luc Tieman and his mother, in separate discussions with police, said Valerie Tieman wanted to move out. Tieman called law enforcement on Sept. 12 and told the Fairfield Police Department that he last saw his wife at Walmart in Skowhegan, Maine. He told police he left his wife in their red Chevy Silverado and went into the store. When he returned, she was gone, he said. THE GREENVILLE NEWS Husband charged with murder of former Greenville resident Maine State Police joined the investigation Sept. 13. Detective Landry went to the Walmart in Skowhegan and incidentally found Luc Tieman in the Silverado. He had a suspended driver's license and a warrant for his arrest. Landry stopped the vehicle, spoke with Luc Tieman, and he followed the detective to State Police Barracks for an interview. Luc Tieman told police he had not seen his wife since Aug. 30 at the Walmart. He said he thought it would be better to not tell Valerie Tieman's parents that she was missing, according to the affidavit. "I asked Luc if Valerie took her stuff and he responded that she must have expected to come back because she pretty much left everything," Landry wrote in the court document. "Luc explained that when he left the store and found that she was not there he called Valerie and sent her text messages trying to find her and telling her he would take her back." A detective reviewed Walmart surveillance video from Aug. 21-31 and did not see Luc Tieman's truck. Another detective reviewed Valerie Tieman's cellphone records and noted that her last recorded call was Aug. 24 to her husband. The call lasted 13 minutes, 33 seconds. Her phone used a cell phone tower that services the area of 628 Norridgewock Road in Fairfield. Luc Tieman's phone was using a tower in Waterville at the beginning of the call. By the end of the call, it was using the same tower as his wife's phone. His phone then only used that tower until 2:26 p.m. Aug. 25, when his phone again connected to the Waterville area tower. Maine State Police executed a search warrant Tuesday at 628 Norridgewock Road in Fairfield and found Valerie Tieman's body partially buried in a wooded area behind the residence she shared with her husband and his parents. "Luc initially denied any knowledge of the body, but changed his statement and said the body was his wife Valerie," an officer wrote in an affidavit. The autopsy Wednesday revealed she died of gunshot wounds to the head, according to the affidavit. Detectives took Luc Tieman into custody Wednesday morning in Waterville, near a hotel he stayed in Tuesday night, police said. He offered no resistance. Luc Tieman is being held at the Somerset County jail. 42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2d3sEuX TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Man explains why he is poll watching at a Greenville County Precinct 0:42 Church Burned and Vandalized in Greenville 2:17 Todd Kohlhepp's neighbors relieved he's in custody 1:17 Family dog euthanized during search 1:58 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 More Stories Tigers' Wilkins named Nagurski Trophy finalist Nov. 17, 2016, 2:07 p.m. Man dies weeks after drive-by shooting Nov. 17, 2016, 12:06 p.m. Lawrence on his growth this season Nov. 17, 2016, 10:53 a.m.

This isn’t about Target vs. Wal-Mart or Suicide Squad’s terrible reviews vs. Suicide Squad’s global box office haul. This post is about an entirely different version of the quality vs. quantity discussion. A friend of mine, James Andrews, who is CEO of Smashd, posed a question on Facebook earlier this year, asking what marketing trends people expect to see in 2017. One of the early comments was about the anticipation of greater focus on quality moving forward. I agree with this sentiment, but also believe that this push toward greater quality will take root in the way startups are measured, too. What I see happening right now in the venture capital business, both with private startups or with public companies that relied on VC dollars to grow, is a growing and perpetual lack of concern for quality if the quantities are right. Meaning: if user growth is rapid and revenue is steadily increasing, investors are routinely showing disregard for whether or not companies are doing the right thing. In the cases of Twitter, Snapchat and Airbnb, those decisions are coming back to hurt them. Related 'Experiences' Startup Besomebody Is Moving to Boston From Austin See, late last month, Snapchat pushed out yet another new filter that led to renewed tweets and Medium posts calling the company racist and offensive. While the unicorn said the filter was inspired by anime (similar to how their April 20th filter that was "inspired by" Bob Marley), many people including Katie Zhu, a product manager for the popular blogging platform Medium, called bullshit. Let me ask you something: is anyone really surprised? No. Twitter, another tech darling of the past decade, has had very well-publicized bouts with discrimination internally. First it was the lack of female representation on its board prior to their appointment of Marjorie Scardino in 2013 in the leadup to their I.P.O. Later came chronicled exits of black employees. A year ago, all any investor could seem to talk about was whether or not Twitter will ever grow quickly again to increase its stock price. In 2016, some began to wonder whether a climate of harassment and vitriol was keeping users away. As if on cue, alt-right Twitterati launched a campaign of harassment against celebrity comedian Leslie Jones, who quit the service very publicly (and temporarily). Twitter is waking up to the quality problem. In August it rolled out plans to introduce a quality filter. Then there’s Airbnb, the hospitality industry disruptor, that is facing the most significant hit to its reputation as a company in what had previously been a largely positive wave of praise on its way to a reported $30 billion valuation. The reason? A number of black users have experienced discrimination by hosts who are less inclined to offer their apartments and homes to people of color. So much for sharing and belonging, right? Airbnb's near-term solution of hiring former Attorney General Eric Holder to help address the problem seems sound, but also less likely to fix the underlying issue at the source (the product itself as Nextdoor realized) than would, say, hiring black engineers and product managers. But perhaps the investors who are about to pour the next $1 billion into the company at a whopping $30 billion valuation don't take the issue as seriously as its CEO. Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and US Commerce Sec'y Penny Pritzker at GES 2016 Money isn’t lost if they’re jerks. Money isn’t lost if you’re late to address a major issue. Money is lost if they aren’t growing. Nice guys finish last in Startupland, according to the ongoing and vibrant action of tech industry investors. That is the message that is being sent over and over again to tech startup founders, whether you’re Jack Dorsey hiring a white man to run your diversity and inclusion efforts or you’re Evan Spiegel at Snapchat who, unlike Airbnb’s Brian Chesky, has not called his company’s discriminatory practices (or filters) the most challenging issue facing his company today. How fast are you growing? What’s your recurring revenue run rate? How many monthly users do you have? What is your annual revenue forecast for this fiscal year? Many of the most important metrics in business, the technology industry in particular, are focused on the quantitative attributes of a company. It’s understandable. Successful businesses need to grow their customer bases, their monthly users and their bottom lines. But what about quality?  Very few are nearly as adept at predicting the value of quality-driven metrics.  If Uber gets in a fight with a major city’s government officials, exhibits what many of those officials believe to be asshole behavior then leaves the city (as it has in Austin), does that have implications on the quality of the technology or on the quantity of users and revenue potential? Perhaps investors don’t mind this happening in a city of just a million residents like Austin, but what if it happened in Paris or New York? Would that merit investor concern or a valuation adjustment? Or if Airbnb has highly-publicized issues with discrimination against a segment of its customers as it has with black users in America, is that a factor of the marketplace’s quality or quantity? What happens if those discrimination concerns are coming from the gay community or French people or females? Does that give investors confidence in the company focused on belonging? These occurrences and these questions should matter to you if you're a founder or startup investor or even if you work for a tech company. The industry today trains itself - the investors, the media, the employees - to be highly skilled at gauging the potential of a startup on quantitative aspects like user growth and revenue. Very few are nearly as adept at predicting the value of quality-driven metrics. Twitter investors who bought in at the company's $45-a-share IPO pop are understandably frustrated with its plummet to less than half that number. Would a better understanding of quality have helped them spot its problems earlier? Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Credit Bloomberg Media Source We may find out as transparency in business grows. Just look at the growing wave of criticism against tech companies and their lack of diversity since Intel, Apple, Amazon and others began publishing their hiring statistics. Hiring political figures like Eric Holder only goes so far. Eventually these companies - startups, even - will actually need to find a repeatable process that helps them consider quality over quantity. This, as it turns out, will help them recruit people of color, provide equal pay and promotion opportunities to women and stop being assholes in general. Of course, the tech industry wants you to believe this is simply a case of a few bad apples. That would be a lie. When these “bad apples” have as much business ownership as a senior executive at Uber or as much product leadership as the people who choose the filters at Snapchat, there is plenty evidence that this offensive behavior goes largely unpunished by investors who fuel the industry. And it all starts by placing as much focus on quality as quantity, and - in some instances - even more focus on quality if the quantity is lacking. Today, everything we’re seeing in the business community, be it ethical manufacturing or diversity in recruiting and leadership, points to a growing role for quality (alongside quantity) on the success of companies. The tech industry may be living in its own bubble of sorts, thanks to the continued success of Facebook, Uber, Airbnb and others, but that bubble will pop if enough users continue to feel like this is perpetually breaking the one rule Google was smart enough to deploy as its motto: don’t be evil. Why does a tech company need to tell the public it won't be evil? Because a successful tech company - Google, Apple, Facebook, Uber, Airbnb - can transform an entire industry, people's lives and their behaviors. So if your company is racist or sexist or has a few bad apples in prominent positions, that behavior may just seep out into the mainstream via an apartment for rent or a Snapchat filter. Quantity is about repeatable processes. Good news in knowing how to measure for it is that you scale more quickly by doing the thing that worked over and over again. Hire another white male engineer. Ignore another complaint from a black user or customer. We’re still growing so who cares, right? Bad news is you lack diversity because your business relies on duplicating and building on the past rather than constantly seeking out what's new. You miss opportunities to build bridges with city officials. You miss signals from underrepresented employees and users. You miss out on future growth with customers you don’t presently have. There's no filter for failure, but if success looks like a continued disregard for people, then I hope this is what they meant when they said "fail fast."

Chandrasekaran , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} September 23, 2016 9:26am   Comments Share: Related WMT 5 Good Things And 4 Bad From Wal-Mart's Earnings Mid-Afternoon Market Update: Children's Place Rises On Strong Q3 Results; DryShips Shares Tumble Delta, American Airlines Are Buys; Saleforce.com PT Hiked (Investor's Business Daily) Close on the heels of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) closing its Jet.com acquisition, Barclays upgraded the biggest retailer stocks from Equal Weight to an Overweight rating and boosted the price objective from $70 to $87. This implies a growth potential of about 20 percent. The brokerage believes that the company's turnaround is not priced and that the firm could see retailer regaining momentum. The retailer is one of the few companies to report EPS either in line or above estimates. In the last four quarters, its EPS topped between 1.0 percent and 11.4 percent. In the recent past, Wal-Mart struggled to post revenue in line with the expectations. However, the most recent quarter witnessed a beat. The acquisition of Jet.com has further added to investments' sentiments. Related Link: 4 Pieces Of Advice For Wal-Mart Now That Jet.com Acquisition Officially Closed In a research note to clients, analysts led by Karen Short said, "Given that Walmart exhibits all of the traits of a Stable Staple (positive traffic, 2.8 percent dividend yield, 7.5 percent FCF yield, respectable lease-adjusted ROIC, positive traffic), yet is trading at a significant discount, we are assuming coverage with an Overweight rating and an $87 price target (32 percent upside)." The brokerage has a upside target price of $95 while it kept a downside target price of $68 on the company's stock. Barclays places 30 percent probability scenario for the downside risks. On the positive side, analysts listed continued comp and traffic trends, holding firm the stable staple of key metrics like dividend yield, free cash flow and optionality on balance sheet. Similarly, on the flip side, CAPEX increase, lack of alternate format, and reversal of trends or customer feedbacks are listed for the potential drag down of the stock. In Friday's pre-market session, Wal-Mart shares were up 0.42 percent at $72.57. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

I do have a problem with the Walmart hunters who show up and buy a lot of their gear the night they arrive, or look like a refugee fleeing the apocalypse with everything imaginable for convenience hanging off their truck and trailer. I live in a small community in the middle of one of the most popular hunting areas in the state. I see how unprepared and uneducated many of these hunters are when they show up to hunt. Most of them have no idea where the occupied residences are or for that matter how close they should be shooting (150 yards or across roads). On two occasions I have had hunters discharge weapons in the direction of our home, nothing brings back old memories like the rip of a round going past you. Over the years, I have had to help several hunters retrieve their kill because they did not have the necessary means to do the job. I hate to see meat spoil. They don’t have the equipment like a quad or even a backpack to carry out several hundred pounds of meat. Sometimes they do not even know where they are in relationship to the roads. Two years ago, I had a hunter stumble up to our house and ask where he was. I took him back to his kill, it had been down for several hours and not even gutted or skinned. Loaded it into my quad trailer and took it to his pickup. He offered me some meat, no thanks. Also, you have those trigger-happy hunters who do not know the difference between a bull elk and a cow, or shoot first and ID later. In the past few years, I have found three cows that were shot right after a bull hunt. What a waste of meat. Then you have the campsites. We have found multiple campfires not extinguished. Bags of trash and diapers left at campsites. Then there is the human waste not even covered with dirt. Then there is the disrespect for private property. Our community has no access to the national forest. Yet, hunters regularly park in yards and climb over fences to access the national forest. Then there are those guys showing up with a brand new AR-15 or AK with several high capacity clips. Now, I know you can kill an elk or deer with these weapons, but if you can’t hit it with the first, well-placed shot, then 10 quick rounds aren’t getting anything. If I hear one shot, it’s usually a kill, two maybe, but three or more is just a frustrated hunter. I have no problem with hunting, it’s just all the uneducated and inconsiderate hunters.

Eligible associates can earn these bonuses four times a year.   The company explained that this incentive program goes back to Sam Walton who built the business on the idea of sharing profits with associates and treating them as partners.   In February, the company rolled out its Pathways training program for all entry-level workers, providing training, education and opportunities for associates, offering them a clearer career path from entry level positions to jobs with more responsibility and higher pay.

Read today's eNewspaper Business Weis Markets expands its presence in Maryland through two acquisitions Weis is expanding in Maryland Weis Markets is expanding in Maryland by acquiring and converting five former Mars stores and 21 Maryland Food Lion stores. Some customers say they are happy overall with the changes at the Weis store in Essex that was Mars. (Lloyd Fox, Baltimore Sun video) Weis Markets is expanding in Maryland by acquiring and converting five former Mars stores and 21 Maryland Food Lion stores. Some customers say they are happy overall with the changes at the Weis store in Essex that was Mars. (Lloyd Fox, Baltimore Sun video) Lorraine MirabellaContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Weis Markets is one of several grocers changing the food retailing landscape in the Baltimore area. Just days after Baltimore-based Mars Super Markets went out of business in July, five of its stores reopened as Weis Markets. The new name may be unfamiliar to some area shoppers but likely won't be for long. The Weis brand has proliferated around the state in a matter of weeks. Besides acquiring five stores from Mars, a family-owned fixture in Baltimore since the 1940s, the company acquired 38 Food Lion locations in the Mid-Atlantic and is converting those stores, including locations in Columbia and Elkridge on Friday. The rapid push into the Baltimore area and elsewhere in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia represents one of the Sunbury, Pa.-based grocer's biggest expansions. "It's a big move for us," said Kurt Schertle, chief operating officer for Weis Markets, which had some stores in Maryland but none in Delaware or Virginia. "We had been wanting to expand our footprint in the Baltimore region. [Former Mars stores] seemed like a natural fit. This was the year they were ready to move on, so it just worked out for us." As competition in grocery retailing heats up, Weis is among a handful of grocers eyeing the Baltimore area for expansion or new stores. Wegmans, with stores in Columbia, Hunt Valley, Abingdon and Gambrills, opened a much-anticipated eighth Maryland location a week ago in Owings Mills, when store officials said more than 23,000 people showed up. Lidl, a German discount grocer much like Aldi, which grew rapidly in the Baltimore region, is poised to make its own push soon.

Weis Markets acquired five Mars stores that were slated to close, including one in Essex, which it has remodeled.  (Lloyd Fox / Baltimore Sun) Lidl announced plans in August to invest $100 million to build an 800,000-square-foot distribution center in Perryville to gear up for its first U.S. stores by 2018, the first of which could be in Maryland, including one reportedly in Aberdeen. And mass merchants Target and Wal-Mart continue to expand food offerings — Wal-Mart now ranks as the third-largest seller of groceries in the Baltimore-Washington market, according to trade journal Food World.

Weis Markets is expanding in the Mid-Atlantic with the purchase of 38 Food Lion stores, including half a dozen in the Baltimore region, as Food Lion's parent company looks to unload stores to satisfy antitrust regulators as part of its merger with the parent company of Giant Food. Food Lion parent... (Sarah Gantz and Natalie Sherman) Weis officials said they saw an opportunity with both acquisitions to move into prime locations in a strong — if crowded — market, even though the acquired stores are smaller than new supermarkets. In Baltimore County alone, Weis increased its presence from four stores to 11 through the Mars and Food Lion acquisitions. Thanks to the Food Lion conversions, Weis now has four stores in Carroll County, three in Howard, and four in Anne Arundel. The chain had two already in Harford. The final Baltimore area conversion from Food Lion to Weis will be completed by Thursday. Weis acquired the Food Lion supermarkets as Food Lion owner Delhaize Group and Giant Food parent company Koninklijke Ahold sought approval of their July merger from antitrust regulators. The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general in Maryland and five other states required the parent companies to sell off 76 stores nationwide to satisfy those concerns, including 26 in Maryland. Weis purchased 21 of the Maryland Food Lions. Mars closed all of its 13 stores this summer, laying off hundreds of employees amid declining sales and intense competition. Mars Chairman and CEO Chris D'Anna blamed declining sales and said the company fell short in efforts to cut costs while trying to preserve jobs and benefits. Analysts said Mars also struggled to keep up with emerging grocery retail trends. Weis, which has built a reputation on price and service, will offer more prepared, fresh and natural products than the previous operators, said Jeremy Diamond, a director of Diamond Marketing Group, a Baltimore-based food retail consulting firm. "Weis is one of the few large supermarket chains that are still family-owned and private," Diamond said. "As the chain expands in Maryland, they're going to use that to their advantage." Weis likely faces heavier competition in areas around the newly acquired former Mars stores, Diamond said. "Most of the Mars stores were built so many years ago, when we didn't have Target or Wal-Mart in this area, and other grocers kind of moved in to the Mars neighborhoods," he said. Food Lion, newer to the region, "did a better job of selecting their locations." Schertle said Weis is well aware of the region's stiff competition. While Mars had "a great history, great locations and great associates," it was "fighting with one hand tied behind its back," going up against competitors such as Giant Food and Safeway, which offer private-label products, loyalty programs, gas rewards programs and greater variety in fresh food departments. Weis plans to bring those services to its newly converted stores along with more than 3,000 private-label Weis products and about 300 new produce items — for example, greater varieties of tomatoes. Meanwhile, it will keep some of Mars most popular items, such as its deli shrimp salad, and is rolling out the former chain's popular sugar cookies in all Weis stores. Already it has opened full-service pharmacies in three former Mars, one in Essex and two in Dundalk. Weis also is adding sushi, which will be prepared by chefs in the stores. "It doesn't take up a lot of space, but it's what consumers want," Schertle said. Shoppers are noticing the changes. At the Essex Weis, a former Mars, the store layout and signage looks the same as under the previous owner, and most workers and managers are former Mars employees. But in-store pharmacists now fill prescriptions, the floral department has been expanded and hundreds of Weis-brand products line the shelves. Alice Mays, 60, a retired screen printer from Essex, had shopped at Mars for nearly two decades. But "Mars was always higher-priced," and she shopped the sales, she said Wednesday during one of her three weekly stops at the Essex Weis. "Mars didn't have your off-brands." Schertle said the company is striving to hold on to loyal Mars shoppers while attracting new customers who may never have shopped Mars or Food Lion. Shopper Kenya Sykes, a 37-year-old mother of two from Essex, said she goes to different supermarkets for different items and shopped at Mars only occasionally. She also saw it as "pricey." "There are so many grocery stores around here," said Skyes, a teacher at a before- and after-school facility who said she has started coming to the Essex Weis because of the private-label brands and offerings such as the sushi bar. "I like Weis," she said. "I was happy they switched." A habit built over 34 years keeps Marlin Van Ells returning to the former Mars that now bears the Weis name. For years, he said, he shopped only at Mars, first on Philadelphia Road, then in Essex, because of "prices, quality and I loved their meats." Now, the retired tractor-trailer driver splits his grocery shopping among several area stores. But he still comes to the newly converted Essex Weis almost every day. "I made a lot of friends with Mars employees," Van Ells said. "I come to see them." lorraine.mirabella@baltsun.com Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad Job Layoffs Unemployment and Layoffs Federal Trade Commission Weis Markets will buy five Mars Super Markets stores Baltimore Police officer found guilty in shooting to be sentenced Friday Preliminary licenses to dispense medical marijuana in Maryland will be announced in December Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 48°

Smith turned to a legal insurance plan that he had taken out for situations just like this. With the help of an attorney, a settlement was negotiated with the district attorney’s office to get the misdemeanor dismissed upon the 16-year-olds’ completion of community service hours. And thanks to the legal plan with Arag, Smith figures he saved more than $2,000 in attorney fees, a lot of time savings, and a reduction in stress. The coverage “saved us from having to pay a lot of money,” said Smith, a police officer in Austin, Texas, “and it saved my son’s reputation. He wants to go to college, and having any kind of a record would have made it difficult.” Companies like Arag, U.S. Legal Services and others have designed legal insurance plans that are offered as part of employer-sponsored benefit plans or sold directly to consumers. Andinsurers are seeing a growing number of parents purchasing the coverage. Parents can purchase the protection for a range of legal matters ranging from traffic violations and apartment leases to more serious problems such as theft and personal injury claims. The cost? Premiums are typically less than $20 a month, plus a deductible of $250 or so. For some parents, legal insurance can provide peace of mind in the event their teenager or college-age child gets into trouble. And let’s face it, even the best kids sometimes do stupid things. Here’s how Arag’s standard policy works: When a policyholder has a legal problem, he or she contacts the company and explains the problem. Once the legal issue is identified, the insurer provides the policyholder with a list of qualified attorneys who practice nearby. The policyholder then picks the attorney and makes the contact. Arag, for example, has a network of about 11,000 attorneys with different specialities. The company generally aims to provide attorneys who practice within a 30-mile radius of the policyholder. Smith is a believer in the protection. The father of six pays about $14 a month, or $168 a year, for his legal plan, which is offered through the police department. While having the policy lessened the impact of the candy theft on Smith’s son, the outcome was far different for his best friend who wasn’t covered through legal insurance. The teen was fined, had to perform twice as much community service work, and still had the misdemeanor on his record that eventually might require the help of an attorney to have it removed when he becomes an adult. Laura Budd, an attorney near Charlotte, N.C., who has been in the Arag network since 2004, has handled multiple cases involving kids who got into trouble. Having immediate access to an attorney, Budd said, “keeps kids out of the (legal) system.” Still, is legal insurance the answer? Certainly the benefits may not be worth the price for some. Do the math, and factor in the deductible. Moreover when reviewing these policies, pay attention to what is covered and what is not. Some policies will broaden the coverage, but at a higher price. And some serious legal problems won’t be covered at all. Like other types of insurance, you’re also paying for some peace of mind just in case your son or daughter gets into a jam. Backing this legal protection up with stern advice to your kids is also key. There needs to be a discussion about responsible behavior, owning a mistake, and the consequences for getting into trouble. No legal insurance plan will cover all those bases for you.

A Hempfield man said in court documents he was improperly fired as a maintenance employee at a Wal-Mart store because he legally restrained a suspected shoplifter. In a lawsuit filed in Westmoreland County court, Paul Palmer said he utilized the “shopkeeper's privilege” when he detained a shoplifter in January at the Hempfield store where he worked. Palmer said store officials fired him a week later. “The shopkeeper's privilege is a recognized doctrine in Pennsylvania whereby a shopkeeper is allowed to detain a suspected (shoplifter) on store property for a reasonable period of time so long as the shopkeeper has cause to believe that the person detained in fact committed or attempted to commit theft of store property,” according to the lawsuit. A Wal-Mart spokesman said company officials can't comment on the allegations because they haven't seen the lawsuit. “We take the matter seriously, but we haven't seen the complaint. When we do, we will respond appropriately with the court,” said Randy Hargrove. Palmer served as head of overnight maintenance and said in his court action that while working he was approached by a customer near the store's front cash registers when a security alarm sounded. Palmer said the person punched him in the face when he questioned him about merchandise sticking out of the customer's jacket. Palmer threw the person to the ground and held him there for a short time before the customer, unnamed in the lawsuit, was able to get away and run out of the store. According to the lawsuit, the customer was later arrested after store workers reported his license plate number to police. Palmer is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages from Wal-Mart and is asking to have records detailing his firing expunged. Rich Cholodofsky is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

Yes Some years No View Results  Loading ... @MedicineHatNews Follow Us By Collin Gallant on September 23, 2016. Large-scale grocery retailer Save-on-Foods has been named as the anchor tenant of a planned redevelopment of the former Wal-Mart super centre on Strachan Road. Brentwoods Developments out of Edmonton was issued a development permit this summer for ancillary buildings.--NEWS PHOTO COLLIN GALLANT 00000 cgallant@medicinehatnews.com @CollinGallant A fifth major grocery retailer is preparing to set up shop in Medicine Hat with news that Save-on-Foods will become the main anchor of a redeveloped shopping centre in the south end. The near 13-acre site on Stachan Road has sat empty since 2008 when Wal-Mart built its new super centre further east. That company held the property until Edmonton-based commercial developer Brentwood Developments bought the site, rebranded it as “Strachan Corner” and began marketing a renovated building to potential tenants. Officials with both companies did not return phone calls Thursday seeking comment. Senior Brentwood officials had previously stated they would like to see some work begin before the new year. Save-on-Foods is operated by the Overwaitea Food Group, a division of the Jim Pattison Business Group, which also owns CHAT television and radio in Medicine Hat. The grocery chain, which operates 33 stores in Alberta, was originally centred in British Columbia. Last year, the privately-held company announced plans to open six locations in Saskatchewan and Manitoba by the end of 2017. In Medicine Hat, they join major grocers Safeway-Sobeys-IGA (with four local stores in total), South Country Co-op (two grocery locations), Superstore, Wal-Mart and Costco on the food retail scene. The new Medicine Hat location would total 41,000-square-feet in the planned 100,000-square-foot project, occupying a central bay in the existing building footprint. This summer the city planning department issued a development permit for the site that appeared to only include work on new ancillary buildings in the massive parking lot. At that time, Brentwood officials said the existing structure would be part of a second phase of construction. Updated marketing material from Brentwood also shows that another bay in the main building is set to become a Liqour Depot. Two new pad developments on the southern edge of the site would house lone tenants Tim Hortons and a 7-11 convenience store and gas bar. Two other multi-bay buildings would be built on the east side of the lot, bordering Dunmore Road. Plans include the possibility of two standalone single-tenant buildings filling in gaps. In the main building, one large 21,000 square-foot bay would remain up for lease at the north end. Plans show three smaller bays, totalling 17,000-square-feet, could be created with expansion to the south end of the building. You have 7 free stories left to read this month.

I do have to ask if many of these companies have forgotten with the northern part of the city? There is a void there since the closer of Safeway. It would be nice if the city could promote North Crescent Heights with the same energy they put in the “white elephant” on first street.

From Wire Reports | Thursday, Sept. 22, 2016, 9:42 p.m. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Lawmakers seek Labor probe of Wells Fargo Democratic lawmakers want to add the Labor Department to the list of regulators scrutinizing Wells Fargo & Co. over its fake-account scandal. A group of senators led by Elizabeth Warren asked the agency in a letter dated Sept. 22 to investigate whether the bank violated labor laws by denying fair compensation to employees who were under pressure to meet aggressive sales quotas. The lawmakers want regulators to look into whether the bank failed to pay overtime to workers and said that the probe should take place ahead of a December deadline for overtime rules. At least three lawsuits filed by former employees against the bank cited the Fair Labor Standards Act and aggressive sales quotas that forced them to work overtime without getting paid for it. Two cases were dismissed while the other was settled without any judgment on the claims. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo's embattled CEO is resigning his position on the Federal Reserve's advisory council. The San Francisco Fed said Thursday that John Stumpf is giving up his position as representative on the advisory council. Tesla update halts automatic steering Tesla says an update to its Autopilot system will disable automatic steering if a driver doesn't keep their hands on the wheel. Version 8.0 of Tesla's software began moving over the Internet to its electric vehicles Wednesday night. Earlier versions warned the driver and slowed the car to a stop if no hands were detected on the steering wheel. It's unclear whether the cars will still do that. Automatic steering won't resume until the car is parked. The new version of Autopilot relies more on radar than cameras. Tesla says the change should help avoid crashes like the one that killed a driver in Florida last May. Lennar to spend $643M on WCI Lennar will spend $643 million to acquire luxury homebuilder WCI Communities Inc., tying up two of the largest home construction companies in Florida as the real estate market continues to heat up. Despite the monthly decline reported this week by the Commerce Department, construction activity has accelerated for much this year. Builders are increasingly optimistic about sales growth, a reflection of how steady job gains are leading more Americans to purchase new houses and sign leases for new apartments. Wal-Mart to face suit over alleged bribery A federal judge has granted class-action status to Wal-Mart investors suing the world's largest retailer over allegations that it covered up a bribery scheme in Mexico to help its business there. The allegations included that Wal-Mart's Mexican unit paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed building permits and gain other favors. In a ruling this week, U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Ark., dismissed Wal-Mart's argument that a Michigan retirement fund could not lead a class-action suit because it suffered no related financial losses. AP Moller-Maersk splits its operations Danish conglomerate A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S is splitting its massive container shipping operations and its energy business into separate companies, in a shakeup that follows years of declining oil prices and freight rates. The Copenhagen-based group said Thursday the transport and logistics division will include its shipping, terminal and container businesses, while the energy division will handle oil drilling and production as well as the tanker business. A.P. Moller-Maersk raised the possibility of separating its oil units from the group through joint ventures, mergers or listings. Hanjin Shipping to get funds for cargo crisis Hanjin Shipping is set to receive as much as $100 million in additional funds to resolve the cargo crisis caused by its slide toward bankruptcy. Hanjin's lead creditor, Korea Development Bank, said Thursday it will offer a credit line of 50 billion won ($45 million) to help the shipper unload cargo stranded offshore. The announcement was made a day after Korean Air Lines' board approved a $54 million loan to the troubled ocean shipping line. Even with the help of the bank, it was not clear whether the new funds would be enough to solve the cargo crisis. — Wire reports More Business Cozy retirement?

Jim Lo Scalzo/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Peggy McGlone September 22 Follow PeggyMcGlone Visitors to the National Museum of African American History and Culture will pass the Robert Frederick Smith Orientation Pavilion on their way to the Walmart Welcome Center. If they go down the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Staircase, they can nosh at the “Sweet Home Café generously supported by Kaiser Permanente,” catch a performance in the Oprah Winfrey Theater or enter the David M. Rubenstein History Galleries. If they decide to go up — using the United Technologies Corp. escalator — they will find the Earl W. and Amanda Stafford Center for African American Media Arts and galleries named for Michael Jordan and Family, Time Warner, and the Rhimes Family Foundation. Welcome to the 21st-century Smithsonian, where the founding donor, James Smithson, gets trumped by corporate giants and captains of industry. The Englishman whose bequest launched the museum complex 170 years ago has his name on a small sidewalk sign outside. But today’s philanthropists, including Gates, Rubenstein and Smith, and 20th-century titans, like Rockefeller and Ford, have their names in brass letters on walls throughout the building. When the museum opens Saturday, 27 spaces — from the grand staircase to the VIP reception suite — and six programs will be named for brands such as Nike, 3M, American Express, GE and Target and less well-known organizations including the Kovler and Stavros Niarchos foundations. In addition, the lobby features a list of all the founding donors. A peek at the Mall’s latest addition View Graphic A peek at the Mall’s latest addition The large number of names reflects the Smithsonian’s need to raise more private funds, said Amir Pasic, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis. The new museum cost $540 million, with Congress footing half the bill. “Some of the museums that were built more than 30 or 40 years ago would have gotten more government funding,” Pasic said. “Naming benches, chairs, pieces of lab equipment is increasingly common.” The fact that so many individuals and companies signed on points to the perceived value of the project, he added. “People love the notion that you would have your name associated with the National Mall, connecting yourself to something so lasting and . . . historic.” Partnering with the museum was an easy decision for Prudential, which is sponsoring the Hometown Hub, an interactive element in the “Power of Place” exhibition. The museum approached the insurance company after it gave $1 million in 2009 to fund the construction. This year, Prudential gave $2 million more for a five-year sponsorship of the multimedia hub, which highlights the importance of place and region to African American culture. “What the museum is trying to accomplish is in direct alignment with our values and beliefs,” said Prudential Foundation President Lata Reddy, noting that the company has been an anchor in Newark for 140 years. “We have seen firsthand the power of place, and what opportunities a place can afford people, or not. During challenging times, we’ve been a part of rebuilding, standing shoulder to shoulder with the African American community. We know we have a role to play in society.” Naming opportunities are definitely on the rise at the Smithsonian. When the Renwick Gallery reopened last year after an extensive renovation, it named nine galleries for private donors. At the Cooper Hewitt, the Smithsonian Design Museum in New York, 15 donors are acknowledged in spaces throughout its Carnegie Mansion, which reopened in 2014 after a three-year renovation. In addition to galleries, the staircase, shop, study room, cafe, education center and garden and terrace are linked to Target, Henry Luce, Nancy and Edwin Marks and Peter Krueger. The National Museum of the American Indian had been the newest Smithsonian museum, opening in 2004. The federal government paid two-thirds of its construction costs, and 82 founding donors were listed inside. Donors are also linked to the outdoor fire pit, entry pavilion, theater, reference library, gift shop and “pause areas.” Inside the theater (named for the Christian A. Johnson Endeavor Foundation) there are 135 seats with donor labels. 1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The African American experience, in photos View Photos The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture showcases the arc of the black experience.

Although these deals help the museum raise much-needed funds, the agreements also benefit the companies. Bank of America, which is stalwart supporter of museums, signed on early by giving $2 million and sponsoring the Save Our Treasures program before the museum broke ground. It was one of four corporations to give $2 million to sponsor this weekend’s opening ceremonies. Rena DeSisto, the bank’s global arts and culture executive, said the corporation understands the educational power of all museums and appreciates this museum’s diversity. “I am hopeful it creates a sense of tolerance for diversity, and embracing of diversity instead of fear of it,” DeSisto said. “Museums are places where people are drawn to think, to learn and to reflect. I think they can enhance your world view, open up your mind and your life to different possibilities.” Pasic said associating yourself with a diverse project such as the African American Museum can be a powerful symbol. “People find value if they see themselves — if it’s an ad or a campaign — they feel the institution recognizes them.” entertainment museums Get 2016 Olympics updates by email Our best news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Co-owner Adam Mitchell is president of Creno’s Pizza, which operates 18 restaurants in Ohio. 775 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEWARK - BuckinBurger, which operated a food truck in Zanesville during the summer of 2015, has found a year-round home in north Newark, where it opens next month. Billed as a trendy, fast casual burger joint, BuckinBurger will be located at 1283 Log Pond Drive, in Log Pond Plaza, next to Wal-Mart. "We spent six months trying to find a location," co-owner Dan Woodward said. "It's really hard to find available real estate. It's been a nice, long journey. "It'll be nice anchored between Wal-Mart and the new Kroger. And, we're near 21st Street, but not paying the 21st Street price as a small business start-up." Owners Woodward and Andy Wills, both from Zanesville, liked Five Guys burgers and fries restaurant and wanted to try something similar. "So we opened up a food truck to see if it was a good idea or not," Woodward said. On their website, buckinburger.com, they state: "The truck was quite the success, and in the summer of 2016 we found a brick and mortar home to serve up the same fresh, old-fashioned, genuine goodness we’ve become famous for." The ownership group consists of four guys: Woodward, Wills, Eric Mitchell and his father, Adam Mitchell, both of Nashport. Woodward and Wills are Sheridan High School graduates, Eric Mitchell is a product of Licking Valley, and Adam Mitchell graduated from Tri-Valley. Adam Mitchell is president of Creno’s Pizza Co., which has 18 restaurants in Ohio, including seven in Licking County. He established his first Creno's Pizza franchise in 2002 in East Zanesville. When customers leave his restaurant, Woodward said, "I hope they just feel it was the best burgers and fries they can get around the area, made fresh, made to order, grilled up right in front of them, using local ingredients as much as we can." In addition to burgers, fries and hot dogs, the restaurant also will offer a doughnut burger, which Woodward said was popular in Zanesville. The 2,251-square-foot space, previously home to Bake-N-Brew, has been renovated extensively, Woodward said, with an open ceiling to reveal the metal and duct work, a concrete floor, and Amish-made wood tables. The restaurant will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. seven days a week. For more information about employment opportunities, Woodward can be reached at 614-600-9446. kmallett@newarkadvocate.com 740-328-8545 Twitter: @kmallett1958 Buy Photo Ryan Hoyt of Newark Drywall works in the new BuckinBurger location Thursday on Log Pond Drive in Newark.  (Photo: Michael Lehmkuhle/The Advocate) 775 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2dnlQg5 TOP VIDEOS Schroeder records hat trick in Newark Generals rout 1:13 Heath girls tune up vs. East Knox 0:38 Army Pfc.

Carrero for The Victoria Advocate Wagner's Hardware and Gifts • WHERE: 110 N. Esplanade St., Cuero HOURS: Hardware Store: 8 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 8 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays; Gift shop: 9 a.m.-5 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m.- 4 p.m. Saturdays. Closed Sundays • MORE INFORMATION: Call 361-275-5134 CUERO - When customers walk into Wagner's Hardware and Gifts they're in the atmosphere of an early 1900s hardware store. It's been in the Wagner family for three generations, in a location that has always been a hardware store. Almost all building infrastructure is original including the wall cabinets, display units, longleaf pine floor and wall shelving. The only updated infrastructure is the inner shelving. The building, located at 110 N. Esplanade, was built in 1891 by R.C. Warren and operated as R.C. Warren Hardware. Walter Pettit Wagner bought the store in 1945 from family members of R.C. Warren. Walter Pettit Wagner ran the hardware store with is wife, Faye Wagner, until he died in 1957. His son, Walter Robert Wagner, started helping his mother manage the store after his father's death. Walter Reed Wagner and his wife, Beverly Wagner, bought the store in 1989 from his grandmother, Faye Wagner, who worked at the store until her death in the late 1990s. Beverly Wagner, 59, said she doesn't know if the store will pass on to the next generation of Wagners and if her son or daughter will own or manage the family business. "We are passionate about keeping the old hardware store going," she said. "If it will go to the next generation, if it will be continued, we don't know. If it happens that will be wonderful. If it doesn't, if they follow their own paths, that's wonderful too, because that's really what life's about." Commercial stores such as Walmart have not hurt the business, Wagner said. The store is diversified because of the customer service and the convenience of locating products. Although the business is a privately owned hardware store, the Wagners keep the products competitively priced. "Our niche is different because not everybody wants to go into the big boxes, they want to go in and out and get what they want. They know where it is. We don't move it around," she said. The Wagners sell products from craftsmen from across the United States. For example, they sell knives made by a blacksmith from Arizona who makes hammer forged carbon steel knives. "You can see how that's made," she said. "Look at all the wood, I mean, he does that by hand. See the blade goes all the way through." The store sells lamps that are made by a craftsman in Arkansas. The store has lamps in house that were made from an old-time lantern, water pump, saddle and a wagon hub. The store also sells original safes that were made in the 1800s. By the safes and lamps, the store features Amish furniture made by hand from Pennsylvania. "You see how diverse we are?" Wagner asked. "This is how we set ourselves apart from the other stores." Genelle Goyen, owner of Goyen Electric Inc. in Victoria, said Wagners Hardware and Gifts has anything someone could possibly want. Goyen bought a candle during a recent visit, but planned to come back again to purchase small statues and cards. "I like it because it's unique," Goyen, 79, said. "You just don't go find it on every corner like your major franchises. It's an education when you come here. You see things that you forgot about or you never knew existed." On the walls top shelves of the hardware store sit items original to the store when the Wagners first bought it and before. These items are not for sale. A wagon wheel that sits on one of the shelves brought back childhood memories for Goyen. "My family had a farm in East Texas," Goyen said. "I remember when they had a wagon. What they did to plow their fields, they used a mule." Old lanterns on the shelf reminded her of the storm cellar that was on the farm. Her family would keep canned food and use the cellar when bad weather came. The hardware store sells antique items such as machinist tool boxes, cannon balls and plow discs. The store sells simple items as well such as glass milk jugs filled with marbles. "It takes me back to the first grade," Wagner said. "Pop the little top and drink the chocolate milk." Most of the outdoor furniture available at the store are from a craftsman in San Antonio who the Wagners have worked with for 23 years. The furniture is made from wolmanized pine wood and with no staples or nails, Wagner said. In addition, the hardware store sells full service electric, plumbing and steel power equipment. The store has an in house steel power equipment repair shop and will work on equipment sold from the businesses or elsewhere. When customers walk up stairs from the hardware store to the gift shop that opened in 2002 they see historical pictures of Cuero from the 1900s that show old businesses in town and the Turkey Trot - now Turkeyfest - the town hosts yearly. "We're preserving the past for future generations to see," Wagner said. The gift shop sells a variety of antiques and crafted products including wool blankets hand woven from Mexico, a German beer table, an antique roll top desk, railroad carts and theater seats. The gift shop sells ducks carved of old cedar posts from a craftsman in Colorado. The shop also sells cow hides that are tanned in Brazil that can be used to cover furniture or hang on the wall. The Wagners get their hardware inventory from a major hardware wholesaler, unique crafted items from craftsmen across the U.S. and antiques from contacts they have made over the last 20 years, Wagner said. "Our big passion is to continue to offer quality products, excellent customer service, really unique products, and a place where even if you don't come in and purchase something that you feel welcome and it feels inviting," Wagner said. "A positive experience in any business grows 10 fold."

But from the time she learned about the group in 2011 when her youngest of three children, Alexander, joined the U.S. Marine Corps and she read about them on a website dedicated to families of Marines, Schuetz can’t help but think of those women. “I feel the lord placed it on my heart,” Schuetz said. “It’s a whole new avenue of military families I didn’t know about. That’s the most heartbreaking thing you can have happen to your family. I said, ‘I’ll take care of it.’” True to her word, Schuetz has made it her mission to honor and celebrate Gold Star Mothers and to educate the people in Stockton about them. Gold Star Mothers Day was declared as the last Sunday of September by Congress in 1936 “but hardly anyone knows it,” Schuetz said. Most people she encounters don’t even know what a Gold Start Mother is, she said, although presidential candidate Donald Trump’s disrespect for a Gold Star family that spoke at the National Democratic Convention in July put a spotlight on them. Schuetz turned a more positive, and powerful light on Gold Star Mothers for the first time five years ago when she and her mother in law, Eunice Schutez, created luminary kits and invited friends, family, neighbors and fellow members of The Bridge church to light the candles placed inside bags at dusk on the last Sunday of September. She’ll celebrate Gold Star Mothers Day today in the same way, but after five years, she’ll be joined by many others. Eunice Schuetz gathered some of her neighbors in her home on Monday and Tuesday to put together 400 luminary kits. They worked in assembly-line fashion with materials donated by The Bridge, Raley’s, the Lodi Wal-Mart and Carando Technologies. Joan Hinds filled plastic bags with sand “because I have no skills,” she said. Oscar Vasquez separated white lunch sacks, through which Deanna Schuetz had punched a star in the middle to allow the light to shine through, into groups of four. Kasia Vasquez and Juanita Chvez assembled the kits and Rusty Haley, a friend from The Bridge, and neighbor Jill Berdahl tore apart stacks of perforated cards of information that are included in each sack. Recipients, including those who visited their booth at Weberstown Mall on Friday and Saturday, are asked to set up the bags with battery-powered tealight candles at dusk today. (The sand helps hold the bag and candle in place). Watching the group work together — without Deanna, who was returning from a run for Marines in San Diego held last weekend — it was obvious that it was a labor of love. “It’s an appreciation of the military,” said Eunice Schuetz, who comes from a family of those who’ve served. “It’s for what the guys have done,” Kasia Vasquez said. “To lose a child in that fashion would be the worst,” said Berdahl. “Most of us don’t like war anyway. We think, ‘what a waste.’ To honor them like that is pretty darn cool.” Chavez had a brother who served in Vietnam. He came home, but she feels for the mothers and families of those who didn’t. “I have a heart for soldiers,” Chavez said. Oscar Vasquez said “we’re servants and patriots.” Every year, Deanna Schuetz has overseen the assembling of 400 luminary bags. The first year, she and Eunice did the work themselves. Little by little, church members and Eunice’s neighbors have joined in. Deanna also led the distribution effort. She started by giving them out at church. Then she went to businesses and walked neighborhoods. This is the first year she’s arranged to set them up at Weberstown Mall. “It’s not about us,” Deanna Schuetz insists. “The word has to get out. It’s not on everybody’s mind. I’m after Hallmark. I will write to the director of the company, because this needs to be on their calendars. It’s for parents back to World War I, and the Civil War, and what happened to those families. It first became public in the first World War, and it’s never on a calendar. When I talked to someone in (Hallmark) customer service, she said. ‘you’re right. We tend to forget Gold Start Families.’ “It would be devastating to be a Gold Star Mother. I can’t even imagine.” Her son, now a reserve in the Marine Corps, deployed to Afghanistan and returned home safely. Deanna Schuetz, who gets choked up talking about the mothers who weren’t as fortunate as she is, has those women and families in her heart every day. She’s only asking others to offer their appreciation one day a year, and to light a candle today, at dusk. — Contact reporter Lori Gilbert at (209) 546-8284 or lgilbert@recordnet.com.

A guy by the name of George Garrett found the Mi Box at his local Walmart in Ohio and after picking it up brought it home to record his unboxing experience… In the detailed video, George shows that the Mi Box comes with a voice remote, power adapter, and HDMI cable in the box as well as several free offers for Sling TV, VUDU Movies & TV, CBS All Access, and a 3-month free trial for Pandora’s premium services. The video also reveals how the hardware compares to the previous budget Android TV device, Google’s Nexus Player. The Mi Box has a similar plastic construction while being a bit smaller in size and also being slightly taller off the table. Also revealed in this video is the presence of a full-size USB port which should allow for expandable storage. There’s also an auxiliary port for plugging in a 3.5mm audio device. The remote also gets an appearance in this video, showing buttons for navigation and voice search, but also for power and volume, something we’ve yet to see on a standalone Android TV box. Once plugged into a TV and turned on, the Mi Box boots up like any other Android TV device and comes with the usual interface. Xiaomi also has the device set up to recommend several apps for various streaming services such as Sling TV, VUDU, HBO NOW, Red Bull TV, CBS Sports, WATCH ESPN, and more. Out of the box, though, the Mi Box only includes Google’s suite of Android TV apps and the Live Channels app. Interestingly the Mi Box comes with Android 6.0.1 out of the box rather than Android Nougat. As mentioned, Xiaomi has yet to officially release this product, but we’re expecting to see perhaps see it mentioned at Google’s October 4th event.

In a speech at the UN General Assembly, Vice President Muhammad Jusuf Kalla said the UN needs reforms to make it stronger and more relevant to 21st-century challenges and realities. Kalla said the nation has a commitment to increase its peacekeeping force to 4,000 personnel by 2019 and fights terrorism both regional and globally. As the world’s most populous Muslim nation and its third-largest democracy, Jakarta sees Islam modernity and women’s empowerment as going hand-in-hand with democracy, tolerance, pluralism and peace, he said. Selections of the new non-permanent Security Council members in 2019-2020 will be made in mid-2019. MONTENEGRO Sniper kills man in jail A sniper has shot dead a prisoner in broad daylight in a yard at the Balkan nation’s highest-security jail, officials said on Friday. The victim, named only by the initials D.Dj, was shot in the chest on Thursday while walking in the grounds of the main jail in the capital, Podgorica, prison authorities said in a statement. The prisoner died of his injuries later on Thursday, the statement said, adding that he had been jailed for extortion in 2014. “Clearly this is a clash of criminal groups and this brutal murder requires the maximum engagement of all institutions involved in implementing justice,” the statement said. Local media identified the victim as Dalibor Djuric, saying he was the 10th person killed in feuds between drugs gangs in the past two years. Earlier this month, police arrested nine men suspected of belonging to a drugs gang responsible for a surge in violence in the nation’s top tourist destination. UNITED STATES Boy blamed for fire Police say a 12-year-old boy riding a push scooter set fire to the arts-and-crafts section of a Wal-Mart store in the Southern California desert, leading to losses of more than US$1 million. The store in Barstow remained closed for a third day on Friday because of the damage. Barstow police said in a statement that the boy, who was not with his parents, set the fire with a lighter on Wednesday afternoon. Wal-Mart employees tried to put it out with fire extinguishers, but failed and some had to be treated for smoke inhalation. Firefighters arrived and extinguished the blaze, but serious damage was done by both fire and water. Police looked at surveillance video and saw the boy with a scooter and a backpack. He was found on a street corner later in the day. He was arrested and taken to juvenile hall. UNITED STATES Dummy caught in truck A California driver has been cited for using a mannequin — not the required human being — while driving in a carpool lane. The Orange County Register reported that Brea police found the mannequin on Wednesday in a truck on the congested No. 57 freeway. The truck veered out of the carpool lane close to an officer’s motorcycle. As the officer attempted to warn the driver to be careful, he noticed the passenger was not a passenger. Police say the driver acknowledged using the mannequin in the carpool lane for some time. The driver told police that he would now accept that he needs to sit in traffic like everyone else. California requires that a vehicle have a minimum of two people for carpool lanes. Driving alone can bring a fine of at least US$481. This story has been viewed 1295 times.

Dunwoody Police blotter: Drug arrest after jaywalking stop, $10k stolen from safe From Dunwoody Police reports dated Sept. 1 through Sept. 8. The following information was pulled from Dunwoody’s Police-2-Citizen website and is presumed to be accurate. On Sept. 2 at shortly before 5 p.m. in the 100 block of Perimeter Center East at Ashford Dunwoody Road, an officer attempted to stop a suspicious person for jaywalking. When the officer made contact, the suspect fled and a foot chase ensued. The 19-year-old man from Decatur was arrested and charged with barbiturate possession, obstruction-resisting an officer, and with pedestrian crossing other than at a sidewalk. Police found possible Xanax on him as well as cyclobenzaprine and Skelaxin, both muscle relaxants. On Sept. 2 at about 7 p.m., someone broke into the home of a couple, both age 76, and stole $1,500 in jewelry and $300 in cash. A door and drywall valued at $200 was damaged during the burglary. On Sept. 3 at about 5 a.m., someone broke into the Chevron Food Mart station at 4249 Dunwoody Club Drive and stole $10,000 out of an iron safe. On Sept. 4 at about 12:40 p.m., a 28-year-old man from Charleston, Miss., was arrested and charged with shoplifting for stealing a $149 Little Tikes Baby Bouncer from Walmart. On Sept. 5 at about 11 p.m., a 76-year-old man reported to police that someone stole from a hotel in the 4300 block of Ashford-Dunwoody Rd. a gold ring valued at $2,500, $800 in cash, a gold Seiko watch valued at $2,500, and a gold nugget ring valued at $5,000.

The Timber Ridge Improvement District would allow the developer to pay the town to issue bonds to provide low-cost financing for the various improvements for the 150-home subdivision. The improvement district would raise money through a property tax assessment to repay low interest rate bonds used to pay for a roundabout at the intersection of Rumsey Drive and North McLane Road and Forest Park Court as well as street lighting, landscaping, sewer, water and other infrastructure for the subdivision. The town would pay for the cost of setting up the improvement district initially, but then sell some $2 million in bonds to recover the upfront money and pay for the infrastructure. The money for the facilities themselves would come from the developer, with repayment from the bonds funding with taxes paid over time by the homeowners. The improvements to Rumsey Drive will cost about $855,000. The roundabout will cost about $256,000. The improvements for Forest Park Road will cost about $548,000. True Life Companies is developing the 27-acre subdivision, the first new subdivision approved since the Great Recession relented. Developers have promised a community park, walking paths, sidewalks, streetlights and the roundabout at Rumsey Drive near the Payson Public Library. The development would also connect Rumsey Drive through to Walmart to the east and on the south end. Protests from residents blocked a plan to also make Forest Park Drive a through street instead of a dead end.

Isn't there an ordinance or something that prevents street lights from being put in? Some idiots several yrs. ago said they couldn't see the stars if there were street lights. So the town stopped them. When or why is it being changed for this subdivision? I live in Stone Creek and it is so dark I am afraid to go outside at night.

Forget the roundabout. Who is it in town that wants them and why? The ones already here are dangerous, too small, confusing and not built right. What is wrong with stop signs? Forest Park put thru would take some of the traffic off the already crowded streets and would be a fire escape. Does the town realize that anything they approve anywhere affects everyone in town?

Has the town of Payson (not just the Round Up) ever taken an actual poll to see if anyone really wants these things? Perhaps these plans were submitted while the previous 'regime' was still in power and prior to the election results?

Forbes, jforbes@post-dispatch.com OVERLAND • She darted into her bedroom, eager to show off the sanctuary of an 11-year-old girl. It is an infusion of pink and purple, colors replayed in her clothes and highlighted in her hair. Mazy shares the room with two guinea pigs and Squirt, a goldfish that has outgrown its name. Here, she closes off the world when she needs to. Outside of this small house she shares with her parents and brother lies the pain of the past, the hope of the future, the unknown that keeps Mom and Dad awake at night. On a floor lamp in the corner hangs a poster board sign. “I’m just a girl,” it reads. In smaller letters, Mazy added: “... in a boy’s body.” As a fifth-grader, Mazy has now lived nearly a third of her life as the person she says she was supposed to be. Born Malachi, she never identified as a boy. Before she could talk, Mazy would slide into her mom’s high heels and put on her tops, cinching them at the waist for a makeshift dress. When Mazy was 3, she pleaded for a toy kitchen for Christmas, which she got. But when she begged for a princess dress, Mom initially said no. “For me, I gave birth to a son and boys don’t normally wear dresses,” Amber Gilleylen, 35, said. “I didn’t put a lot of stock into it.” Through kindergarten and first grade, while still dressing as a boy, kids at school peppered Mazy with mean comments. She wanted to play with the girls, who told her to go play with the boys. By second grade, she was coming home every afternoon crying. “I want to start over. Be a girl like I’m supposed to be,” Mazy would tell her mom. “I don’t think that’s how it works,” Amber told Mazy. “I just don’t fit in, Mommy, and I need you to help me make this stop.” Mazy’s grades were horrible. She couldn’t sleep at night. “I’m thinking: ‘What am I doing wrong? I want her happy,’” Amber said. The solution was simple, she said. “All I have to do is let her be herself.” But that would be the hardest thing Amber and her husband, Donté, ever had to do. Turning point As a second-grader, Mazy would come home from school, go into her room and put on girls clothes. Eventually, she began wearing them around the house. Along the way, Mazy was growing out her hair. One day, while her mom was sitting on the front porch, Mazy appeared in a cheerleader uniform. About the same time, Donté drove up. “Uh, what’s going on?” he asked Amber. A few minutes later, Donté, 35, said he was going to get gas. Amber and Mazy jumped in the car. Donté gave Amber a look that said: “Let’s not do this.” Letting her out of the house as a girl was too dangerous. People would not understand. And if her parents were struggling with it, how could they expect those who don’t know Mazy to embrace her new identity? Amber assured Donté it would be fine. Amber and Mazy went inside the convenience store to buy milk, passing a woman who was on her way out. “She’s so beautiful,” the woman said. Mazy looked up at her mom. “She called me a girl. A real girl,” Mazy said. “She doesn’t know.” It was a turning point for Donté. “You’re right,” he said to Amber. “It’s not so bad.” Inside the car, it became a celebration. “I honestly don’t think she stopped talking about that for weeks,” Amber said. Mazy decided soon thereafter she wanted to go to school as a girl. Amber wrote an email to school administrators, Mazy’s teacher, counselor and social worker. “Mazy wants to come to school as herself. This is not a stunt, and I’m not asking.” Amber received a call from the assistant principal the next day. “We are so excited to meet Mazy. Let us know what we can do to accommodate her,” the assistant principal said. It was a refreshing response after family and friends, more often than not, would suggest Mazy was just going through a phase. And Donté also had reservations: “How do you know this is real? How do you know this is not a mistake?” “Questions,” Amber said, “that were honestly sitting in the back of my mind.” Mazy’s official debut would come on the last day of second grade. She chose a “My Little Pony” outfit from Walmart. Pink striped shirt with pink shorts. “Are you sure you don’t want to be Malachi anymore?” Amber asked one last time. “I don’t want anyone to know I was ever a boy,” Mazy replied. Donté vacillated from supporter to protector. There are people who will not be kind. Daddy’s little girl may not be accepted as such. The worries of her parents were unfounded. At least that day. “Ultimately, she had an amazing day,” Amber said. “It was the first time I saw Mazy smile in I don’t know how long. “We met a whole new person.” • Questions and answers about gender identity Bullying at school Mazy was now Mazy. No looking back. With her parents on board, out went the boy clothes. No more mention of Malachi. But not everyone saw Mazy as a beautiful little girl, like the woman at the gas station had. When Mazy tried to join the Girl Scouts, some parents objected, saying they should not be forced to accept something they do not approve of. Children at school bullied her. One student spit in her food. Another kicked her in the shins. Mazy was falling behind, unable to focus. Her nights included insomnia and panic attacks. In the middle of fourth grade, her parents decided to pull her out of school. Amber would teach her at home. “We have not turned back,” Amber said, sitting in Mazy’s bedroom. While Amber talked about home schooling, Donté pulled in a chair from the kitchen, grabbed a white board and challenged his daughter to a game of tic-tac-toe. “I’ve lost my free time. But that’s OK,” Amber said. “I am more content knowing Mazy will be OK. A big, huge weight is gone. It’s a million times better.” Home schooling, however, may not last beyond fifth grade. Mazy and her parents have talked about going back into the Ritenour School District next year for middle school. “Social environments to navigate are important to her,” Amber said. Mazy’s parents say it is better to confront problems than run away from them. That will include what bathroom Mazy will use. And whether they tell school officials that their daughter is transgender. But this is the best fit for now. Getting Mazy caught up in her studies. Taking away the anxiety of an unpredictable outside world. “We want to give her a fair chance,” Amber said. Last year, Donté and Amber had Mazy’s name changed on her birth certificate. Mazy Star Maria is the name their daughter chose: Mazy because she liked the way it sounded; Star because “I think they are one of the most beautiful things in the whole world”; and Maria because that was Amber’s grandmother’s name. It was another part of letting go. Malachi Devonté is a name Mazy’s parents spent a great deal of time selecting. Malachi is a biblical name, a nod to Donté’s Baptist upbringing, the son of a pastor. Devonté was chosen because of its similarity to Donté. The gender marker on the birth certificate remains male. Biologically, that is the correct designation. And Mazy’s parents want to keep it that way for now. In case their daughter has any health problems specific to genitalia, insurance navigation will be less cumbersome. Going from Malachi to Mazy did, however, put a strain on her parents’ marriage, even threatening it. “The D word was definitely on the table for a minute,” Amber said. Stresses remain. They are estranged from family and friends. And Mazy’s parents still worry about her future. “This is an extremely dangerous path for Mazy,” Amber said of her biracial transgender girl. Her parents have seen the statistics regarding hate crimes and suicide when it comes to those who look very much like their daughter. They are worried, but letting Mazy guide them. “Making her be someone she isn’t isn’t going to make her happy,” Amber said. “No good will come from that.” What happens next? Mazy is concerned. Puberty is imminent and the hormone blockers a therapist has OK’d for her to take are not covered by the family’s insurance. As a result, the process is out of reach for Donté, a fast food restaurant cook and Amber, a stay-at-home mom who has been unable to work since a serious car crash three years ago. “This is a very real struggle in our house right now,” Amber said. “Mazy doesn’t want to transition into a boy and she is freaked out about it. She says: ‘Mommy, don’t let me get hair on my face, get a deep voice.’” Her parents continue looking for ways to get the hormone blockers covered through insurance and hope to find answers from a parent support group they belong to. Meanwhile, Mazy continues to see a therapist twice a month. Mazy has purged her bedroom of any sign of Malachi and eschews the name. But Amber has not quite let go. “I still have a bag of Malachi’s clothes. They are for me. Every once in a while, they come out and I smell them.” They are a reminder that the child she gave birth to was a boy. A boy whose parents had to mourn his loss to fully accept they had a girl. It was tough, Dontè said. But necessary. Mazy’s parents have asked her who she is attracted to. Nobody yet, Mazy says. It’s her parents preparing for what could be next. If she likes girls, is she gay? If she likes boys, is she straight? If she likes both, is it OK? Parents pondering. Worrying. Accepting. As Amber shared her family’s story, Mazy sat quietly, playing a video game. “You still miss him don’t you?” Mazy said, catching her mother off guard. Amber paused, looked at her daughter but didn’t answer. She continued talking about Mazy’s home schooling schedule. But a few minutes later, Amber circled back to Mazy’s question, answering it indirectly. “I almost forget she was born a boy. ... She’s a girl. “Just a girl.” Mazy from Yuting Jiang on Vimeo. • Read more: Parent dives into Jefferson County transgender saga, helps create new schools policy • Listen: Reporters discuss their work on the “Inside the Post-Dispatch” podcast We are not allowing comments on these stories.

America's war: the killing of Jaiden Dixon and Tyler Dunn Saturday 24 September 2016 03.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close The most common adjective employed by weather reporters on Saturday 23 November 2013 was “treacherous”. But in reality there was not a hint of betrayal about it. The day was every bit as foul as one would expect the week before Thanksgiving. A Nordic outbreak of snow, rain and high winds barrelled through the desert states and northern plains towards the midwest. There was precious little in the news to distract anyone from the weather. A poll gave Barack Obama his lowest approval ratings in years. The same day, he announced a tentative deal with Iran over its nuclear programme. That night, Fox News was the most popular cable news channel; The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was the highest-grossing movie. It was just another day in America. And as befits an unremarkable Saturday, 10 children and teens were killed by gunfire. They died in altercations at gas stations, accidents in bedrooms, standing on stairwells and walking down the street, in gangland hits and by mistaken identity. Like the weather, none of them would make the national news because, like the weather, their deaths did not disturb the accepted order of things. Every day, on average, seven children and teens are killed by guns in America. Firearms are the leading cause of death among black children under 19, and the second greatest cause of death for all children of the same age, after car accidents. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kids killed by guns: America’s daily nightmare Video by Laurence Topham I picked this day at random, and spent two years trying to find out who these children were. I searched for their parents, pastors, baseball coaches, and scoured their Facebook and Twitter feeds. The youngest child was nine, the oldest 19. Four years ago, for a moment, there was considerable interest in the fact that large numbers of Americans were being fatally shot. On 14 December 2012, 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot his mother, then drove to Sandy Hook Elementary School and shot 20 small children and six staff dead. Mass shootings comprise a small proportion of gun violence, but they disturb America’s self-image in a way that the daily torrent of gun deaths does not. “Seeing the massacre of so many innocent children … it’s changed America,” said the Democrat senator Joe Manchin, who championed a tepid gun-control bill. “We’ve never seen this happen.” The truth is, it’s happening every day, only most do not see it; 23 November 2013 was just one of those days. Here are two of the boys’ (they were all boys) stories. Jaiden Dixon, Grove City, Ohio Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jaiden Dixon outside his Grove City home. Photograph: Courtesy Facebook/Nicole Fitzpatrick School mornings in Nicole Fitzpatrick’s home followed a predictable routine. As soon as her three sons – Jarid, 17, Jordin, 16, and Jaiden, nine – heard her footsteps, they would pull the covers over their heads because they knew what was coming: the lights. The older two would take this as a cue for the inevitable and get up. But Jaiden would try to string it out. He would climb into his mother’s bed. Then came the cajoling. “I’d tickle him,” Nicole says. “I’d pull him by his ankle.” They had a deal. If he could get himself ready – “all the way ready: socks, shoes, shirt, everything” – the rest of the morning was his. “He could play Minecraft, watch Duck Dynasty.” It was Friday 22 November, the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy’s assassination, and the papers were full of nostalgia for the nation’s lost innocence. They might have found it on Nicole’s street in Grove City, a dependably humdrum suburb of Columbus, crowned “best hometown” in central Ohio that year. It was its dependability that convinced people to stay. Nicole went to school with the parents of the children her kids went to school with. Jaiden was ready that morning with time to spare. When Nicole threw him his socks, he threw them back, telling her he wanted to try out as a pitcher for his baseball team. He was playing on his Xbox when, shortly after 7.30am, the doorbell rang. This was not part of the routine, but nor was it out of the ordinary. The teenage girls at the end of the road would pop around if they were short of sugar or needed a lift. Slowly, curiously, Jaiden walked around the door. That’s when Nicole heard the 'pop' Jaiden opened the door gingerly, hiding behind it, poised to jump out and shout, “Boo!” when one of the girls showed her face. But nobody stepped forward. Time was suspended as the minor commotion of an unexpected visitor failed to materialise. Nicole craned her neck into the cleft of silence to find out who it was. She looked to Jarid; Jarid shrugged. Slowly, curiously, Jaiden walked around the door. That’s when Nicole heard the “pop”. Her first thought was, “Why are these girls popping a balloon? What are they trying to do, scare me to death?” But then she saw Jaiden’s head snap back, first once, then twice, before he hit the floor. “It was just real quiet. It was like everything stopped. And I remember staring at Jarid.” She knew what had happened. It was Danny. Danny Thornton was Jarid’s father. Nicole had met him years earlier at Sears, where he made keys. She was 19; he was 28. “We were never really together,” she says. “It was a back-and-forth kind of thing.” She hadn’t seen him since July. He’d found her over a year earlier, in January 2012, when he was in need of help. “He was getting ready to be evicted, and we decided to let him stay. He could spend time with Jarid and keep him under control, and I could help him get a job.” While he was staying, Danny got to know Jaiden. He took him bowling. He told Nicole that Jaiden made him laugh, even that he preferred him to his own son. But Nicole needed her room back. That made Danny angry, and he didn’t deal with anger well. His criminal history included charges of felonious assault, domestic violence, attempted possession of drugs and carrying a concealed weapon. He was also a semi-pro, super-middleweight boxer, 5ft 11in and around 160lb, who favoured the southpaw stance: right hand and right foot forward, leading with right jabs, and following up with a left cross, right hook. “He moved all his stuff out,” Nicole says. “I don’t know where. I didn’t care.” What she also didn’t know for some time was that, as he was packing, he told Jarid, “I have no problem making you an orphan. I’m not going to be living out of my car at 47. I have no problem shooting your mom and shooting your brothers.” He’d end his life in a shootout with the cops, he said. Danny had talked to her about shooting other people. “He had twins. He was pissed off with the mom for filing child support on him. And he talked about if he knew where she lived, he’d shoot her and shoot the babies,” Nicole’s best friend, Amy Sanders, tells me. “He had a list – an actual, physical list – of people he wanted to kill. Nicole always thought if she was nice to him, she wouldn’t be on his list. And unfortunately she was the first one.” Jarid didn’t tell his mother what Danny had said until September. “I stopped dead in my tracks,” Nicole says. “I said, ‘Jarid, he’s going to kill me.’ And Jarid said, ‘He’s just blowing off steam.’ I was petrified.” But time passed, and she began to wonder if Jarid was right. Gun Nation Then Danny’s mobile phone subscription expired. Nicole had been paying it, but Christmas was approaching and she couldn’t afford it. On 20 November she wrote a text telling him his contract was up: “The phone’s yours. You can go and turn it on at any provider.” The message sat on her phone for a while, unsent. “I knew what he was capable of,” she says. “But I had to look out for my kids. I had to look out for me.” She pressed send. He replied within an hour: “What fucking took you so long?” Nicole forwarded the message to Amy. “I swear he’s gonna kill me one day,” Nicole texted. “In two years, when nobody suspects him.” Two days later, this was the man who sped away in a blue Toyota, leaving Jaiden with a bullet in his skull. “And I struggle to try and understand,” Nicole says. “Did he shoot whoever answered the door, or was Jaiden his target? Because, honestly, he could have stepped one foot in that house and shot me, shot Jarid, shot Jordin.” Jarid fled the house, asking a neighbour to call 911. Once he got hold of the emergency services, he could barely make himself understood. “Sir, please calm down so I can understand what you’re saying,” the operator says. “We’ve got to learn what’s going on.” “My dad just shot my baby brother,” Jarid replies. “Who shot him?” “Danny Thornton. D-a-n-n-y T-h-o-r-n-t-o-n.” There is desperation and the occasional expletive interspersed with formal niceties: “Sir”, “Ma’am”, “fuck”, “please God”. “C’mon, Jaiden. C’mon, baby.” Nicole did her best to focus. She put one hand over the wound and the other on the back of Jaiden’s head, where she could feel the bullet. She scooped him up, then laid him back down. Still unconscious, Jaiden lifted his left arm three or four inches off the ground and let it fall. “I freaked out,” Nicole says. “I said, ‘He’s still alive. He’s still OK.’ I was thinking, this is what they do on TV. CPR. Mouth to mouth. And all it was, was just gurgle…” The emergency services arrived and took over. Nicole felt there was still hope. “I hugged the boys and was saying, ‘Be strong. We’ll get to the hospital and get him fixed.’ I kept thinking, ‘Just get him to surgery, get the bullet out.’” With Danny’s whereabouts still unknown, the suburb’s security apparatus curled into a tight foetal ball. Within five minutes of the first 911 call, Highland Park Elementary, just one block away, went into lockdown. School hadn’t started, so the police diverted buses and told parents arriving in cars to take their children home. But Danny was long gone, heading eastbound on Interstate 270 to Groveport, 20 minutes away, where his ex-partner, Vicki Vertin, with whom he had an 18-year-old daughter, worked as a dental hygienist. Vicki came out to meet him in the lobby. She hadn’t seen Danny for 12 years, but still lived in fear of his temper. He was wearing a grey hoodie and had his hands in the front pocket. “Haven’t seen you in a while,” Vicki told him. Danny took out his gun and shot her in the stomach. By now, the 911 dispatch office was in overdrive. Calls were pouring in. One of Vicki’s co-workers was on the line. It took them six minutes to link the two shootings. Two of Danny’s friends also called the police. He’d told them that he’d “killed two people and that he’s not going back to jail”, and “he will not go down without a fight with police”. More schools went into lockdown. Vicki’s family were taken to a protective room. Nicole, meanwhile, had arrived at the hospital. Detectives pulled her aside to ask if she had any idea where Danny would be going. That was when she found out he’d shot somebody else. An hour and 45 minutes after he shot Vicki, Danny was traced to a Walmart parking lot. It was 9.46am. A shootout ensued in which one policeman was injured and Danny finally got his wish: suicide by cop. I keep replaying seeing him falling to the ground. I keep replaying: ‘I should have done this, I should have done that' Vicki’s first thought when she woke from surgery was that he could still be out there. ‘“Did they get him?” she asked her dad. “No,” he replied. She tried to get out of bed: “Oh my God, he’s coming back.” Her father clarified: Danny had been shot dead. It was the first time in years she’d felt safe. Across town, Nicole was told that Jaiden wouldn’t make it. The neurologist told her that Jaiden’s CT scan was one of the worst she’d ever seen. The bullet had taken a path straight to the back of his brain, where it had ricocheted, causing irreparable damage. They put Jaiden on a ventilator while a decision was made about organ donation. “I don’t remember feeling anything,” Nicole says. “All I remember is having this image of him in his shoes. He’d just put his shoes on, and his T-shirt was on the floor. And now he’s in a hospital gown with a thing down his throat. All in about an hour or so.” Jaiden was pronounced dead at 3.47pm the next day. Until they wheeled him away to the operating room, Nicole kept it together, but witnessing that was too much to bear. “I couldn’t see the doors close,” she says. “It was almost like they were taking him to have his tonsils out.” She had been up for 45 hours. “I just remember breaking down and crying, and then somebody put me in a wheelchair and took me out. I didn’t go back to the hospital at all.” The fog did not clear until the viewing. “It was maybe a week after he died,” she recalls. “He was lying in his casket. And because I’d been able to touch him so much at the hospital, I went right up and kissed him, and I grabbed his hand and it was cold as stone and hard. That was when the reality hit me: Oh my God. My baby’s gone.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jaiden Dixon with his mother Nicole Fitzpatrick. Nicole’s world is now divided into before and after. “It was like, before I was in a theatre watching this movie, and since then it’s been like walking into a parking lot and trying to adjust to the bright lights from being so engrossed in this movie for so long.” It’s not as though the movie was necessarily uplifting. As a single mother of three, she remembers being exhausted, overwhelmed and, at times, very down. “There were nights when I would come home and just order pizza because I didn’t feel like cooking. And I would stare at the TV, and Jaiden would be out or upstairs or whatever. And I wish I’d gone and played with them.” The first time I met Nicole was in her office, four months after Jaiden’s death. It was her birthday, but she hadn’t let on to her co-workers and had no plans. She was wearing a hoodie bearing Jaiden’s name and face and the word legendary. Her friend had set up a website so they could sell them to raise funds. But she found it difficult to see his face. “I have school pictures in the living room over the mantel. I catch myself diverting my attention so that I don’t have to look.” She was in therapy, but struggling with the advice. “They keep saying that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel. They keep saying, ‘It’ll get better.’ But I’m kind of at the point where I don’t see it.” Five months later, she still couldn’t see it. We had dinner at the Longhorn Steakhouse and went back to her house to meet friends. If anything, she was in a darker place. Most evenings she stayed up late to avoid going to sleep. Her mind kept whirring – an apparently endless loop of what-ifs and horror sequences. “I keep replaying seeing him falling to the ground. I keep replaying: ‘I should have done this, I should have done that. I should have opened the door.’” In the reception area of St Joseph’s Cemetery, where Jaiden is buried, a range of pamphlets is assembled to assist the bereaved: Losing Your Mom, Losing Your Dad, Talking With Your Kids About Funerals, Grieving The Death Of A Grown Son Or Daughter, to name but a few. There is pretty much every permutation of grief but one – a pamphlet entitled Losing Your Young Child. Because that’s not supposed to happen. Tyler Dunn, Marlette, Michigan Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tyler Dunn at home in Marlette, Michigan. Photograph: Courtesy Facebook/Justice for Tyler Dunn Sanilac County has a lower population density than Finland and is slightly less racially diverse than Norway (it is over 95% white). According to Michigan’s department of agriculture, Sanilac leads the state in the acreage devoted to soy, corn, wheat, dairy farms and general cattle operations. Straight roads lead past silos, Dutch barns, grazing livestock and fallow fields, interspersed with the occasional township and homestead. Marlette, population 1,879, is Sanilac’s third-biggest town and a 25-minute drive from the county seat of Sandusky. The shiny blue water tower bearing the town’s name announces itself from afar to the left, while McDonald’s golden arches peer over the trees to the right. Brittany Dunn, 20, wouldn’t be anywhere else. “I’d rather live here than in the city,” she says. “It’s more laid-back,” agrees her grandmother, Janet Allen. I am sitting in a pizzeria with four generations of the Dunn family: Janet, Lora Dunn Bartz (Janet’s daughter), Brittany (Lora’s daughter) and Ciannah (Brittany’s seven-month-old baby), as well as Thomas Bartz, Lora’s husband. This vast expanse of land was Tyler Dunn’s playground. To a city dweller like me, the 11-year-old sounds like a character from Mark Twain. He loved trapping animals, hunting, catching fish in the creek behind the house, four-wheeling and dirt-biking in the summer, sledding in the winter. The Dunns lived three miles down a dirt road off Highway 53. Several miles from the nearest traffic light, even streetlight, and surrounded by fields, he was safe to do his own thing. That year, deer hunting season started on 15 November, pheasant shooting on the 20th. “Tradition here is that the opening day you can just about close all the schools, because the kids are going hunting,” Sanilac County sheriff Garry Biniecki tells me. But with the exception of Tyler, hunting season didn’t particularly excite the Dunns. None of his immediate family hunted, and although Tyler enjoyed field sports, there is little evidence he was particularly good at them. One winter, Brittany’s boyfriend took Tyler trapping, but for more regular hunting trips Tyler turned to his friend Brandon. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marlette, Michigan – population: 1,879. Brandon (not his real name) lived about a mile away, on a dirt road off Tyler’s. Brandon, who was 12, would sometimes pick up Tyler on his go-kart, and they would roam the neighbourhood. They had been friends since kindergarten, but weren’t inseparable. Once, Lora told Tyler he could no longer play with Brandon after Brandon abandoned him in town and went off with another friend. Brandon was living with his father Jerry, who owned a trucking company. Jerry often took his son hunting and occasionally trucking, too. If Tyler was over, Jerry would take them both. Jerry’s truck runs, ferrying milk and topsoil around the midwest, usually took him away for 11 hours at a time. He’d give the boys some money to help him out. Sometimes Jerry would have them sit up front; at other times, they’d be in the back playing video games. Tyler loved it. On Thursday 21 November, Jerry had taken the boys hunting. Tyler had slept over on Friday night, and on Saturday afternoon the boys were scheduled to accompany Jerry in the truck down to Springfield, Ohio, 260 miles south and back. Lora dropped Tyler’s bike off at the house around 2pm, but the boys never used it because it was too cold: –8C, with winds of over 25 miles an hour. Shortly before Jerry was about to leave, the boys said they wanted to stay home. He left them to it. He made this trip as often as three times a week, and Brandon took care of himself fine. Lora didn’t know that by the time she dropped the bike off, Jerry was already gone. “Tyler knew he wasn’t allowed there unless there was supervision,” she says. But he didn’t call, and nor did Jerry. Lora went out with Thomas to celebrate a girlfriend’s birthday 90 minutes away in Union Lake. Jerry checked in with the boys a few times. The last time Brandon called Jerry was around 6.30pm, to ask if he could order pizza. Almost two hours later, Brandon walked out of the house with his hands up, wearing red shorts with no shirt or socks, the police telling him to keep his hands where they could see them. He had just called 911 and told them he had shot Tyler. “Do you have any weapons?” the policeman yelled. “No,” Brandon said. “It’s on the kitchen floor.” I would want eye for eye. Brandon needs to be gone. I don’t think he should be able to live his life A policeman walked Brandon to his car as he pleaded: “It was an accident. I didn’t know the gun was loaded.” An officer went inside, where he found a lever-action rifle on the kitchen floor and Tyler on the dining-room floor, in a Mountain Dew T-shirt and sweatpants, with a large pool of blood surrounding his head. There was a huge wound on the left side of his head. The policeman found no pulse, called dispatch, and told them Tyler was dead. As he left, he saw a shotgun lying on the living room couch and four holes in the dining-room window. Nobody but Brandon will ever know for sure what happened that night, Sheriff Biniecki says. Brandon claims they were playing Xbox when he got a rifle out of Jerry’s closet to show Tyler. He asked Tyler to hold it while he went to get his milkshake from the bedroom. He came back and took the rifle from Tyler, who passed it to him butt first, the muzzle pointing in Tyler’s direction. Brandon was resting it against the wall when the gun got caught on his pocket and went off. Brandon sat in the car while police combed the house. He’d been crying and was visibly shaken. When they searched him, they found two 12-gauge Remington buckshot shells and a mobile phone. There was blood on his hands and on the phone. When asked how he’d come by the shells, Brandon said he’d found them earlier that day and stuck them in his pocket for safekeeping. Inside the property, the police found a veritable arsenal. In Brandon’s room was a Remington 1100 shotgun, loaded and perched against the dresser with one round in the chamber and four in reserve. There were two more single-shot shotguns near the closet. In the top dresser drawer, there was some marijuana in tin foil and two rolled joints. When asked later how many guns he had in the house, Jerry couldn’t remember. First he said seven or eight, then between five and 10. Brandon didn’t know Tyler’s address, but he could describe his house. The police went there to find only his sisters at home, who told them to call their grandmother. Janet came shortly after midnight and was told the news. She called Lora. There was no reply: she’d left her phone in the car to charge. When she came out, she saw several missed calls and dialled Janet. “Are you on your way home?” her mother asked. “No – why?” Lora replied. “I think you need to come home.” She wouldn’t explain why, but that didn’t unduly concern Lora. She assumed her daughters had thrown a party and got caught. Night falls heavy in Sanilac County, cloaking the land in uncluttered darkness. On dirt roads with no street lamps for miles, the flashing lights of stationary police vehicles announce themselves with the force of a lighthouse. On the way to her mother’s house, Lora saw the lights on Brandon’s road and drove towards them. She called her mother. “Mom, do you have Tyler?” “I think you’d better just come here,” Janet said. “And then she put the police officer on the phone,” Lora recalls. “Don’t go there. Just come here,” she told her, and Lora obliged. “There’s been an accident,” the policewoman said when she got to the house. “OK,” Lora said. “Your son’s in Lapeer county hospital.” “OK,” Lora said. “Why didn’t you tell me, because I just came through Lapeer?” “No, Lora,” the policewoman said. “He’s been shot and killed.” While Lora was halfway home, Jerry was at the sheriff’s office in Sandusky. It was 2am. He had been called and asked to pick Brandon up. The police asked him whether there were any custody issues between him and Brandon’s mother, Connie, and whether he often left his son alone. Asked if any of his weapons were loaded, he said they might have been. Finally, they asked if Brandon had taken hunter safety classes. Jerry said he was doing the apprenticeship programme, in which a child aged 10 or more can hunt for two years without a safety certificate if with an adult. Beyond that, he had given basic instructions. “I told him to hold the gun with the barrel pointing in the air. Never to point the gun at anyone, and never put any shells in the gun unless you are outside.” How the gun got into Brandon’s bedroom was a mystery to Jerry. He thought it had originally been in the living room and didn’t remember moving it. All the guns were his, apart from the 20-gauge, which he’d bought Brandon. He said the .30-30 rifle that killed Tyler had been in his closet the whole time; he’d put three rounds in it a year earlier and not touched it since. It was only then that Jerry was told why Brandon was there. Guns were more available in Brandon and Tyler’s world than for any of the day’s other victims Had Brandon not shot Tyler, a handful of minor episodes relating to his behaviour would probably never have amounted to anything. But he did, and over the next few days police interviews provided hints that, even if this was not an expected turn of events, it was always a possibility. In her police interview, Connie said she had always been nervous about the number of guns Jerry had in the house, and assumed they were loaded. And then there were the incidents at school: the day before hunting season began, Brandon had boasted that he had pointed a 20-gauge at a boy’s stomach while it was loaded without the safety on. He also joked that the boy should put antlers on his head and run around so Brandon could shoot him. The child who overheard them thought they were “goofing around” about the antlers; he also thought “they were serious” about aiming at the boy’s stomach. Guns were more available in Brandon and Tyler’s world than for any of the day’s other victims. In much of rural America, guns are an everyday part of life, for recreational and practical reasons. “Being a rural community, we have problems with everything from skunks to critters,” Sheriff Biniecki explains. “It’s not uncommon for a farmer to have a firearm handy.” With so many guns around, the potential for calamity is ever present. A few weeks earlier, two local men said they were shot at by a duck hunter. Five days after Tyler was shot, a 16-year-old shot himself in the foot while hunting 20 minutes away. Although Biniecki treats each gun death as its own discrete tragedy, one nonetheless detects in his voice a weary familiarity with cases such as Tyler’s. The key to preventing accidents, he says, is education and parental responsibility. “I think we need to use the opportunity to further educate parents that if you do have a gun, unload it and put it away. Teach your kids the safety rules. And then, over time, don’t get lax with it, because children are always curious. Put those two things together and bad things can happen.” In January 2013, in the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings, Barack Obama started a second term that became increasingly strident in its advocacy for gun control. He sought to shift the climate of caution by issuing “a presidential memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence”. But the problem has been ongoing. On 14 November 2013, nine days before Tyler was shot, Obama nominated Vivek Murthy for surgeon general. Republican legislators focused on Murthy’s support for an assault-weapons ban and a tweet he’d sent in 2012, after the mass shootings at a cinema in Aurora, Colorado. “Tired of politicians playing politics w/guns, putting lives at risk b/c they’re scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue. #DebateHealth,” he wrote. It took more than a year for him to be confirmed by the narrowest of margins, after the National Rifle Association rallied its members. On 20 February 2014, Jerry and Brandon appeared in district court. Jerry was a three-time felon, previously convicted, among other things, of dealing drugs and operating a vehicle while impaired. In the US, felons are not allowed to have guns, so Jerry was charged with possession, a crime carrying a maximum of five years in prison. For leaving two boys alone with loaded guns that ended in the death of one of them, he was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, a 90-day misdemeanour. He was released on $2,500 bail. Brandon was arraigned in juvenile court and charged with careless discharge of a firearm, causing death, which carries a maximum two-year sentence. On 10 April, Brandon pleaded guilty; on 5 May, Jerry pleaded no contest. At a hearing on 1 May, Lora told me, Connie wept as her son stood in grey sweatpants and a hoodie, and the judge placed him in “intense probation” at her home. The next day he was sentenced. There were 29 terms to his probation. He was sent to a junior detention facility for 10 days, with a further 20 days to be enforced if he failed to comply with the other 28 restrictions (including a 7pm-to-7am curfew, participation in anger-management classes, random drug and alcohol testing, paying for Tyler’s cremation, and a minimum of 10 written assignments). The probation would be reviewed every 30 days, said the prosecutor, who expected it to last until Brandon was 18 or 19. Six weeks later, the judge sentenced Jerry to a year for weapons-firearms possession and 90 days for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Tyler’s family believes they both got off too lightly – particularly Brandon, who they are convinced shot Tyler on purpose. To them, the story doesn’t hang together. Lora doesn’t buy the idea that the latch got caught on his shorts: “I believe his finger was on the trigger.” Over pizza with Brittany, her mother, stepfather and grandmother, I ask what would constitute justice. Brittany pauses. “I would want eye for eye.” “You mean you want Brandon executed?” I ask. She nods. “Brandon needs to be gone. I don’t think he should be able to live his life.” I look around the table. “Does everyone agree?” They all nod. “And Jerry?” “He should have time for what he did,” Lora says. “He should probably sit inside for the rest of his life,” Brittany adds. “He had a role in it, but he technically didn’t pull the trigger.” According to the Sanilac County News, Lora has since filed suit against both Brandon and Jerry, seeking more than $25,000. I ask her if Jerry or Connie have reached out to them. She says they have had no contact since Jerry’s girlfriend came over, a few days after, to return Tyler’s effects. Would they have liked to? “It would have been nice for them to say something. Put a card in my mailbox or something.” “Even at the court they could have turned around,” Janet said. “Yeah, when he stood up in front of the judge and said it wasn’t his fault,” Lora recalls. “Well,” Janet says, “it wasn’t his fault. Because he wasn’t home.” *** This is not a story about gun control. It is a story made possible by the absence of gun control. Americans are no more violent than anybody else. What makes their society more deadly is the widespread availability of firearms. To defend this by way of the second amendment – the right to bear arms – has about the same relevance as seeking to understand the roots of modern terrorism through readings of the Qur’an. To base an argument on an ancient text is effectively to abdicate your responsibility to understand the present. Adopted in 1791, the second amendment states: “A well–regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” These 27 words have been elevated to the level of scripture, inscribed on a blood-soaked pedestal thwarting all debate, more than 200 years after its passing. None of the family members I spoke to raised the second amendment. Almost all believed guns were too readily available; none believed there was anything that could be done. But when I told them of other families who had lost children that day, they seemed shocked. It was as though they had lost a loved one in a war, unaware that the same war was simultaneously claiming other lives – indeed, unaware that a war was taking place. As though it were happening only to them, when in fact it was happening to America.

Tim Vizer tvizer@bnd.com i By George Pawlaczyk and Beth Hundsdorfer News-Democrat LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story EAST ST. LOUIS Taxpayers have paid thousands of dollars for annual mandatory audits of East St. Louis Township, none of which mention that Supervisor Oliver Hamilton and two others charged as much as $280,000 on taxpayer-supported American Express cards. The charges — which ranged from trips, gasoline and car washes to thousands spent at big box hardware stores — were made without the knowledge or approval of the township board of trustees on credit cards capped at $1,000 a month. There was not one month when the spending came in under the cap, township financial records showed. Even though taxpayers paid for the services, Dennis Ulrich, a spokesman for the auditing firm Scheffel Boyle in Belleville, said when it comes to an audit, he can speak only to “the client,” who in this case is Hamilton. Scheffel Boyle was paid $8,000 for the latest township audit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2015. Hamilton, who signed a form that he personally accepted the audit findings, is the target of an FBI investigation into the credit card spending. He has declined to comment on the advice of his attorney. Since June, the News-Democrat has reported in a series of investigative stories that Hamilton, his sister, June Hamilton Dean, who is paid to be a financial consultant, and an office administrator, spent $280,000 from 2012 to July 2016 on their township credit cards, including $12,500 during a single trip to Walmart; thousands spent on trips to Las Vegas, Chicago and Los Angeles; tens of thousands on building supplies such as paint, drywall and special tools; more than $3,000 for car washes, detailing and oil changes for Hamilton’s personal vehicle, and nearly $40,000 in gasoline. Oliver Hamilton’s card accounted for $230,000 of the total spending. Ulrich declined to respond to a list of News-Democrat questions about township financial matters and limitations of the audit. He said state law prohibits him or his staff from discussing his firm’s report, “With anyone who is not a client.” He said that for the township audits, only a government official could be considered a client. “It is weird that the taxpayer can’t go in and ask questions about the audit, but that is the way it works,” said Mark Peecher, a certified public accountant who teaches business at the University of Illinois. “If (an auditor) sees an irregularity or a suspicion is raised, he should do something about it. But credit card (abuse) might not even be included in the audit’s working papers, so he might not know anything about it,” Peecher said. If (an auditor) sees an irregularity or a suspicion is raised, he should do something about it. But credit card (abuse) might not even be included in the audit’s working papers, so he might not know anything about it. Mark Peecher, CPA and professor at University of Illinois The outside audits covering fiscal years 2012-15, which are required by state law, do not mention that the credit card spending was not approved by the board of trustees. A federal grand jury session that was scheduled to meet Tuesday in connection connection with the investigation of township finances was canceled. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Fairview Heights would neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation, but the News-Democrat saw copies of subpoenas issued to potential witnesses or targets. Trustees have said they never received a breakdown of credit card charges. Trustees received only an overall monthly claim sheet that listed the credit card costs as a single, lump sum line item with no breakdown of what was actually purchased. The trustees routinely approved the line item credit card costs without discussion, according to board minutes. Every one of the monthly totals exceeded a $1,000 limit set by the board in February 2012, just a few months after Hamilton became supervisor. Trustee Edith Moore, who heads the Community Development Department for the city of East St. Louis and pushed the resolution to limit credit card spending, said of the credit card spending, “I don’t know anything about what is going on about that. Nothing.” Township debt a ‘growing concern’ The latest audit for 2015 states the township has compiled a deficit of nearly $3 million — debt that threatens its financial future as a “going concern.” This same warning has been repeated word for word in audits from 2012, 2013 and 2014. “The auditors should have submitted to the township a management letter, which would indicate irregular transactions and procedures that are not conducive to sound financial principles,” said Joe Behnken, a certified public accountant from O’Fallon. Behnken is a former Republican member of the St. Clair County Board. Oliver Hamilton, a Democrat, is also a member of the County Board and serves on the board of the East Side Health District. “A quick review of the budget versus an actual expenditure report would immediately bring to light excessive, unbudgeted expenditures” like the credit card purchases, Behnken said in a written response. Behnken also commented on copies of township checks made out to Hamilton that were intended for others, including $900 to help a woman who has three small children pay rent. The woman said she never received any money from the township. There also was a $3,000 payment to a St. Louis construction company where the check was made out to Hamilton. Part of the routine duties of the auditor would be to review (trustee board) resolutions that would affect financial management, such as the resolution limiting credit card spending. Any violation of the resolution should have been noted. Joe Behnken, CPA and former St. Clair County Board member “Part of the auditor’s responsibility is to review the check register and question any large payments made to employees other than normal payroll. The $280,000 paid to American Express would show up in a statement of Revenues, Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances and in the budget,” Behnken said. “Large undocumented payments” should be included in a management letter, Behnken wrote. “Part of the routine duties of the auditor would be to review (trustee board) resolutions that would affect financial management, such as the resolution limiting credit card spending. Any violation of the resolution should have been noted.” The latest audit shows that the township has 15 full-time employees and eight part-timers. In addition, two financial consultants are paid $33,000 each per year. They are June Hamilton Dean, who is also an East St. Louis City Councilwoman, and businessman George Laktzian, who has worked for the township for more than 40 years. The township has operating expenses of about $1.3 million per year that includes grants for a Summer Youth Program and a lunch program for senior citizens. Of the total operating expenditures, “general assistance” to the needy is listed as $118,073, or about 9 percent. The audits noted other irregularities, often without explanation, including: ▪  Salaries in the latest audit were budgeted at $431,985, with $424,171 spent. Janitorial supplies were budgeted at $2,572 but $7,406 was actually spent. ▪  In fiscal year 2014, a total of $406,329 was budgeted for salaries but the actual expenditure was $547,231 — $140,902, or 35 percent, over budget. ▪  Travel was budgeted at $5,000 with only $736 listed as being spent in fiscal year 2014, even though travel costs listed on monthly American Express bills totaled at least $8,000 for that year. ▪  Janitorial supplies were budged at $3,000 in 2014, but $18,944 was spent, a 600 percent increase. As for the capability of external audits to detect fraud, Evy Poumpouras, a faculty member of the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, told CNBC in 2014, “You can’t put the onus on somebody else to keep your place clean.” She said internal financial controls should be relied upon to prevent misappropriation of funds.

The incidents occurred Wednesday night and were reported and investigated Thursday and Friday. Staff photo: Alisa Boswell The wall behind ARISE Sexual Assault Services is one of the 20 locations in Portales tagged with graffiti Wednesday night. Officials said more could still be reported. Portales Police Department Public Information Officer Charlie Smart said most of the buildings tagged were businesses across Portales, adding that there may still be more tagged buildings that have not been found or reported yet. “At this point in the investigation, we were able to locate two empty spray cans and were able to track the two empty cans back to Wal-Mart here in Portales,” Smart said on Friday. “Myself and Sgt. (Nathan) Hyde reviewed the security video and were subsequently able to identify the offenders.” Smart said seven suspects have been identified in the case with four having confessed upon being located and interviewed. He declined to name suspects until the investigation is complete and charges are filed. Smart said the dollar amount of the damage will be in the thousands. Each incident is being charged as a separate count with the charge likely to be unauthorized graffiti. If the damage to a property equals a $1,000 or under, the suspects will be charged with a petty misdemeanor, and if the damage is over $1,000, the charge is a fourth-degree felony. Eastern New Mexico University’s Greyhound Arena was vandalized across 50 percent of the building, according to ENMU Physical Plant Director Ted Fares, who said the damage cost the university $4,000. The Zeta Tau Alpha sorority building was also tagged, but he did not know the cost of the damages to that building. Wal-Mart, which was also tagged in the incident, declined to give the cost of the damage. Thai City restaurant representatives said they had not talked to their insurance company, and did not know the cost of their damages yet. Other damaged properties are not known.

Early Wednesday morning, protesters blocked Interstate 85, where they stole boxes from trucks and started fires before police used flash grenades in an attempt to disperse the angry crowd, an ABC affiliate in Charlotte reported. A group of protesters then tried to break into a Walmart store before  police  arrived and began guarding its front entryway, video footage by local media showed. Police officers wearing riot gear block a road during protests after police fatally shot Keith Lamont Scott in the parking lot of an apartment complex in Charlotte, North Carolina, U.S. September 20, 2016. Reuters/Adam Rhew/Charlotte Magazine Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Earlier in the evening, police in riot gear reportedly used tear gas on protesters who threw rocks and water bottles at them as they wielded large sticks and blocked traffic. One officer was sent to the hospital after being struck in the head by a rock, police  said. Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts urged for calm. "The community deserves answers and (a) full investigation will ensue," she said on Twitter, adding in a subsequent post, "I want answers too." Related Stories Why Killer Cops Aren’t Prosecuted The New American Cop Scott was shot by officer Brentley Vinson earlier in the day, according to Charlotte-Mecklenburg police. The shooting occurred when officers were at an apartment complex searching for a suspect with an outstanding warrant and they saw Scott get out of his vehicle with a firearm, the department said. Vinson fired his weapon and struck Scott, who "posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers," the department said in a statement. Vinson, who joined the Charlotte police force in July 2014, is black, according to the department. He has been placed on paid administrative leave. National Debate The fatal shooting came amid an intense national debate over the use of deadly force by police, particularly against black men. Police did not immediately say if Scott was the suspect they had originally sought at the apartment complex. WSOC-TV, a local television station, reported that he was not. Detectives recovered the gun Scott was holding at the time of the shooting and were interviewing witnesses, police said. Protesters and Scott's family disputed that the dead man was armed. Some family members told reporters that Scott had been holding a book and was waiting for his son to be dropped off from school. Source: Graphiq   Shakeala Baker, who lives in a neighboring apartment complex, said she had seen Scott in the parking lot on previous afternoons waiting for his child. But on Tuesday, she watched as medics tended to Scott after he was shot, she said. "This is just sad," said Baker, 31. "I get tired of seeing another black person shot every time I turn on the television. But (police are) scared for their own lives. So if they're scared for their lives, how are they going to protect us?" Source: Graphiq   About 200 people gathered earlier Tuesday night for a peaceful protest in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a white officer killed an unarmed black man last week in an incident captured on police videos. Lawyers for the family of Terence Crutcher, 40, disputed that he posed any threat before he was shot by Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby after his sport utility vehicle broke down on Friday.

Thanks to metallic matte lipsticks like Hard Candy's latest launch, you can try out the high-fashion look without the messy multistep process. They apply in a single swipe, no pressing, sealing, or blotting required. The Hard Candy Metallic Mousse lipsticks are just $6, and you can buy them at Walmart. They're also another great dupe of the metallic Kylie Lip Kits. I tried out Smoke & Mirrors, a shimmery amethyst, for a day and felt like a beautiful mermaid. (If you're into that vibe, we rounded up products that will speak to your inner underwater goddess.) My first time applying the metallic matte lipstick was definitely a learning experience. I applied two coats, and my lips turned into a hot, chunky mess. Every time I opened my mouth, I felt like the lipstick was forming little cobwebs between my lips—very cute. (To be fair, a coworker assured me that it actually didn't look that way.) The second time was the charm. With just one coat, I was web-free and good to go for the rest of the day. The metallic matte lipstick surprisingly stayed put despite a very moist and velvety finish. When I took sips from my water bottle, it only left a faint purple mark, not an entire great-aunt-Tilly-style imprint. The collection also includes Sweet as Honey (a bronze), Queen of Hearts (a magenta), Sandstorm (a rose gold), Gilded Cocoa (a, well, cocoa), Truffle (a faded rose), and Penny Talk (a copper).

GARRIDO The Brownsville Herald An 18-year veteran U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service inspector Tuesday pleaded guilty to charges he masterminded an immigrant smuggling ring based at Gateway International Bridge. Jose Flores Lopez, 58, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to three counts each of bribery, providing fraudulent documents, transportation of undocumented immigrants and one count of conspiracy to transport undocumented immigrants. Lopez is scheduled to appear in October before U.S. District Judge Hilda Tagle for sentencing. He is being held without bond in the Cameron County Jail. Juan Jose Rodriguez, a 14-year veteran INS inspector at Gateway and four alleged accomplices still face charges in the investigation, dubbed Operation Marquis Express by FBI and INS investigators. Lopez was arrested May 16 after what authorities said was a four-year investigation. The investigation targeted INS inspectors thought to be providing fraudulent documents to undocumented immigrants, Rosalie Savage, an FBI official, said. Lopez and Rodriguez were arrested in connection with an alleged smuggling ring that had operated in Brownsville for five years, Savage said. According to authorities, the smuggling ring helped hundreds of Mexican and Central American immigrants enter illegally into the United States at the Gateway Bridge. It is believed that the group charged between $300 and $500 for services. We believe Lopez facilitated the smuggling of aliens by accepting bribes and providing fraudulent documents, Savage said. He took advantage of his position as an INS inspector. Lopez appeared June 14 before U.S. Magistrate Felix Recio and was denied bond. Rodriguez was arrested June 11 by FBI agents for allegedly accepting bribes, conspiring to smuggle immigrants into the United States and providing fraudulently obtained documents. In a June 14 hearing, Recio set bond for Rodriguez at $50,000. Rodriguez posted bail and was released. He is to appear before Tagle Aug. 6 for jury selection. Also arrested in connection with the smuggling ring were Juan Jose Ayala, 53, of Brownsville, Candelario Perales-Jaramillo, 48, of Matamoros, Elio Salinas-Pequeo, 33, a permanent resident alien of Brownsville, and Gloria Paulina Alvarez, 39, of Brownsville. They were charged with conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into the United States. All but Perales-Jaramillo were granted bonds by Recio.

She’s also not attracting any grass-roots GOP support, since she’s labeled Republicans “enemies.” Fact is, her personal history and other factors “make it difficult for her to appeal to enough voters to lead her opponent by 10 points, let alone 50.” Media critic: Don’t Call Rioters ‘Protesters’ Alex Griswold at Mediaite takes issue with news reports following the Charlotte, NC, police shooting that described violent rioters and looters as “protesters.” Says Griswold: “There are thousands of protests in America every year, all of which manage to be nonviolent . . . None of them involved throwing people into a fire. Heck, none of them managed to set anything on fire.” At work, he suspects, is an attempt by reporters to “stay neutral” and not show any “moral condemnation.” But in trying “to please those of all political stripes, the media ended up misinforming their consumers.” Those “who looted that Walmart and destroyed stores were not ‘protesters,’ and if they had done so in a context divorced from politics, media outlets would have the stones to say so.” Establishment pundit: Please Ignore the Debates Every four years, voters and the news media make the same mistake: thinking debates “are an especially valuable way of helping the voters make that fateful decision.” This riles Elizabeth Drew, who first started covering US politics in 1959. She complains in The Washington Post that “the buildup of the debates” — especially next Monday night’s — “has exploded beyond all reason.” In her view, debates “test qualities that have virtually nothing to do with governing.” Worst of all, “the night usually goes to the deliverer of the best one-liner. It’s what’s most anticipated and most remembered.” She’s also peeved by “the media’s determination to declare a ‘winner’ ” — even though “these aren’t real debates” so “there’s no way to score them.” These debates, she concludes, “make a mockery of our democratic system.” From the right: Obama’s Chemical Nightmare It was one of the rare times President Obama was right — and “he almost certainly wishes he weren’t,” writes Noah Rothman at Commentary. Three years ago this month, Obama “explained to the American people why the United States must use military force to punish Bashar al-Assad for deploying chemical weapons in his nation’s civil war.” Because, he said then, “if we fail to act,” Assad “will see no reason to stop.” Now the Pentagon has disclosed that US troops came under attack by ISIS with chemical weapons possibly stolen from Assad’s stockpile. So that speech was “grimly portentous not because of what [Obama] warned but because of how he disregarded his own advice.” Transit wonk: Amtrak’s Imperiled Success Story Amtrak’s success, Acela, is nearly two decades old, and its trains are being replaced, to the tune of $2.45 billion. But Nicole Gelinas, in the Washington Examiner, says Acela still “isn’t the triumph that it could have been — and it may even turn into defeat.” For one thing, the New York-Boston and New York-DC service isn’t as speedy as originally advertised; for another, the service’s “high price isn’t something to brag about,” even if it does help alleviate airport crowding. But to seriously improve its DC round-trip service requires a new Hudson River tunnel, and no one has the money to pay for it. “So when Acela riders pass through [New Jersey], they should give a thought to how new trains won’t be of much use if there’s no tunnel through which to ride.” — Compiled by Eric Fettmann Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under 2016 presidential election ,  amtrak ,  barack obama ,  charlotte ,  chemical weapons ,  debates ,  editorial ,  hillary clinton ,  riots Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next Corruption lands at doorstep of governor who vowed cleanup Read Next Corruption lands at doorstep of governor who vowed cleanup Most Popular This Week 1 The one scenario that could still get Hillary into the White House 2 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 3 Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photos from racy shoot revealed 4 Kellyanne Conway tells The Post she feels 'blessed’ over White House gig 5 Insiders say Donald Trump is 'disgusted' by Chris Christie 6 Scenes from the liberal meltdown Share Selection Columnists Rich Lowry Liberals who claim history’s on their side got a cold wake-up call Karol Markowicz Stop blaming Trump for every anti-Semite that comes along John Crudele This list of topics is the quickest way to anger your liberal friends SEE ALL COLUMNISTS Editorials NYC scores big by hanging on to charter-school visionary Eva Moskowitz De Blasio can’t seem to get it right with the homeless Obama’s advice to Trump: Do as I didn’t Today's Cover Browse covers archive Trending Now on NYPost.com 191,988 Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide? 64,961 Clinton gets mixed reaction after going makeup-free for speech 47,217 'Kimmy Schmidt' actress reportedly commits suicide in Peru hotel More Stories pagesix 'Kimmy Schmidt' actress reportedly commits suicide in Peru hotel Now On Decider New Netflix Documentary Goes Deep On The Greatest X-Rated Movies Of All-Time nypost Did this astronaut warn of aliens before attempting suicide?

One of the car break-ins took place at the Leland Walmart.  "The other day they took between 15 and 18 motor vehicle reports that came in over night," explained Lt. Jeremy Humphries with the Leland PD.  Police reports show most of the cars were actually unlocked, while few reports do show forced entry into vehicles.  Cash, credit cards, electronics even ID's were stolen out of cars in residential and retail areas. The Leland Police Department took to Facebook Thursday to remind residents to keep valuables out of plain sight, with the following post: There have been several reports today of items taken from unlocked cars and trucks. Please, don't leave valuables in plain sight and ALWAYS lock your doors. Leaving your vehicles unlocked is an open invitation to thieves to steal. "At least put them out of sight to where they are not readily accessible to someone who would be walking by a vehicle, who would peer inside, see that as an opportunity to grab something quick and leave with it," Humphries stated.

Just after finding out about the Google WiFi and its $129 price, Google Home’s $129 price, and the $69 price of the 4K “Chromecast Ultra,” we now have our first clue of the price of Xiaomi’s previously-announced Mi Box Android TV. According to someone who spotted one of the shelf at Walmart, it will run for $69… The Mi Box features Android 6.0 Marshmallow, a quad-core ARM processor, 2GB of RAM, 8GB of expandable (via USB) storage, and an HDMI port which can output 4K video at 60FPS. The box will ship with a slim remote that includes a microphone for voice commands (a la Apple TV) and Xiaomi will also be selling a controller for gaming. Just a couple of weeks ago, a report suggested that the box would be coming at some point in October for a price less than $100. This $69 price tag is pretty believable, and a picture like this — with 3 Mi Box units just sitting on a shelf in their original packaging at Walmart — would be pretty difficult to fake. On this box, we learn that the Box comes with $76 in offers and a free HDMI cable. I’m about to head out to my local Walmart and see if I get lucky enough to nab one. @jasonhowell @androidshow @Ohthatflo @ronxo saw this Mi Box at Walmart today for $69.

The price? $69. Not bad at all – great, even. Xiaomi has not indicated when it plans to release the device specifically, but if this is any indication, you can probably guess “pretty soon.” So, it may not be a bad idea to call up your local Walmart and see if they made the same mistake – this could be more widespread than we know.

Large numbers of police were bused in Tuesday to seal off the neighborhood near the University of North Carolina-Charlotte after groups of protesters began to break windows of police cars, blocked traffic on Interstate 85 and broke into a Wal-Mart store. Police officers decked out in riot gear again confronted angry protesters Wednesday, firing tear gas. At least one person was shot on Wednesday night, with officials claiming he was not shot by police. The confrontation in North Carolina's largest city is another expression of the seething social tensions in America, driven by an economic crisis that has produced record levels of long-term unemployment, poverty and social need, while real wages remain below the level of a decade ago, before the 2008 Wall Street crash. The spark in Charlotte was the shooting death of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott, gunned down in broad daylight. Police arrived at the parking lot where Scott, a father of seven, was waiting to pick up his son at a school bus stop, looking for another man who had an outstanding warrant. Witnesses say that Scott was holding a book when he got out of his car and was shot four times by the police. Charlotte Police Chief Kerr Putney claimed that Scott was armed with a handgun and refused repeated police orders to hand over the weapon. The police have so far refused to release body camera videos of the shooting, and no cellphone video has yet emerged to show what really happened. From a legal standpoint, however, even the police version of events does not justify the use of deadly force. It is legal in North Carolina to carry a weapon openly, and if Scott had a gun, as police claim, they had no right to demand it without probable cause of a crime being committed. The killing of Scott is only the latest in an unending stream of horrors. Indeed, the shooting in Charlotte is the third highly publicized police killing in the past week alone. First came the killing of 13-year-old Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio on September 13, followed by the killing of 45-year-old Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma on September 16, and then Scott on September 20. - Advertisement - The fact that all three victims were African-American has been used to reinforce a racialized narrative of police violence as predominately one of white cops killing black men and boys out of ingrained white racism. Whatever role racism may play in particular police killings, it is not the fundamental issue. Here, the circumstances behind the killing of Scott are revealing. The police shooter, Brentley Vinson, is African-American, as is the police chief, Kerr Putney. The mayor of Charlotte is a woman, Democrat Jennifer Roberts. The police officer in Tulsa, moreover, was a woman. Of the 25 people shot to death by the police in the past week, beginning with Tyre King, at least half were white, according to the grisly tally kept by killedbypolice.net. Of the 702 people shot to death by police this year, according to a database maintained by the Washington Post, 163 were black men, about 23 percent of the total. Whites made up roughly half the victims, while Hispanics, Native Americans, Asians, black women and people of mixed race made up the balance. What nearly all the victims of police violence have in common is that they are part of the working class, and usually its poorest layers. Their deaths are a consequence of the basic social function of the police, as the armed bodies of men who defend the wealth and privileges of the financial aristocracy against the lower orders. The Charlotte killing and disturbances have been followed with the usual political homilies from government officials and presidential candidates. - Advertisement - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted that "the situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic," but he has consistently sided with the police in such situations while denouncing protests against police violence as tantamount to terrorism. He demanded an "immediate end" to the mass unrest in Charlotte. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, issued a statement Tuesday calling the fatal shooting of Terrence Crutcher "unbearable" and "intolerable." She added a tweet on Wednesday morning, "Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher. Too many others. This has got to end. -H." Such professions of concern coming from an arch-warmonger and candidate of Wall Street are about as unconvincing and insincere as every other comment that comes out of Clinton's mouth. As for the Obama administration, in its final months it appears to have given up any effort to vary its responses to tragedies and horrors. Attorney General Loretta Lynch -- who is African-American, like both the shooter and the victim in Charlotte -- warned against protest that "turns violent" and repeated the standard mantra of the Obama administration, that the events in Charlotte "have once again highlighted -- in the most vivid and painful terms -- the real divisions that still persist in this nation between law enforcement and communities of color."

Screen Rant You Are Reading: Star Wars: Rogue Friday Retailer Exclusives Revealed Share On Facebook Comments (2) Next Follow Us Follow @screenrant SR EXCLUSIVES MOVIE NEWS TV NEWS REVIEWS VIDEOS LISTS + TRAILERS PODCASTS TOP MOVIES Comics Gaming Up Next Star Wars: Rogue Friday Retailer Exclusives Revealed By Chris Agar 09.23.2016 2 Comments 59 Shares 2 Star Wars fans are well aware that Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is right around the corner, scheduled to premiere in theaters in just a few months. Lucasfilm has already done a great deal of advertising, releasing two well-received trailers, a plethora of still images, and information about the variety of new characters that are in the spinoff. The studio will continue their marketing efforts in the very near future with the Rogue Friday event. Similar to last year’s Force Friday, the day will see the first wave of Rogue One merchandise hit store shelves. Awareness has continuously been raised for the collection of toys. Hasbro spent the past few weeks unveiling pictures of their new action figures, and the “Go Rogue” stop-motion video series has showcased the products in action. As fans make their shopping preparations, they need to figure out which store(s) they want to visit. That decision should become easier (or harder, depending on your point of view) with the announcement of retailer exclusive items. In a press release, Hasbro revealed five new toys that will be available in specific stores. Wal-Mart will have the Smart R2-D2, which is similar to Sphero’s popular BB-8. It is programmable and interactive, linking with an app that allows users to control the droid’s movements and actions. It also responds to your voice, and dances to songs. At K-Mart, fans can buy the 6-inch Jyn Erso Black Series Mountain Base variation, which has a diorama base for the figure. Amazon shoppers will be able to get the Black Series Shadow Trooper helmet, which comes equipped with voice changing technology. Target is the only place for the Captain Cassian Andor blaster from Nerf, and Toys “R” Us has a Black Series 6-inch Imperial Hovertank Pilot figure. Check out images of the toys in the gallery below: In addition, the Star Wars fan site Yak Face has posted an unofficial check list of all of the various Rogue One items that will be available. Collectors can download a PDF and keep track of everything they own as they make their purchases. As one would expect, there are several products out there, and die-hards will no doubt be attempting to get as many as they can. There’s something for all budgets, so even the more conservative consumers should find at least one piece of Rogue One merchandise to bring home. It’s an exciting time to be a Star Wars fan, with Disney planning movies well into the next decade, and they can keep fan enthusiasm high, there will be Force Fridays going on for a very long time. NEXT: Disney Downplays Rogue One Box Office Expectations Rogue One: A Star Wars Story opens in U.S. theaters on December 16, 2016, followed by Star Wars: Episode VIII on December 15, 2017, the Han Solo Star Wars Anthology film on May 25, 2018, Star Wars: Episode IX in 2019, and the third Star Wars Anthology film in 2020.

The company is currently building a regional distribution center in Alamance County and is vetting sites around the state and Triangle, including Clayton. Guido Frigo Raleigh i By Chris Cioffi ccioffi@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story German grocer Lidl, one of the biggest supermarket chains in the world, is entering the Triangle’s crowded grocery store market. Lidl – pronounced “lee-dil” – broke ground in Wake Forest in August, and the company has plans for one store in Raleigh and two in Cary. It is also considering a site in Clayton, and a distribution center is already under construction in Mebane. The discount grocer has more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries. It hopes to open its first stores in the United States no later than 2018, according to company spokesman Will Harwood. The company’s arrival will give shoppers yet another option in a growing field of grocers, including Wal-Mart, Food Lion, Harris Teeter, Kroger and Publix. Its biggest competitor, though, might be Aldi, also a German company that already has several Triangle stores. Some of Lidl’s local plans call for stores near current Aldi locations. “Our expansion is driven by our belief that Lidl will be a great option and shopping destination for customers in the area,” Harwood wrote in an email. Construction has begun on a Lidl store at the intersection of N.C. 98 and South Main Street in Wake Forest. In April, the Raleigh Planning Commission approved site plans for a Lidl store near the corner of Old Wake Forest Road and Ronald Drive. Lidl has filed early planning documents on two Cary sites: near the intersection of Northwest Maynard Road and North Harrison Avenue and the intersection of Tryon Road and Kildaire Farm Road. In Cary, Lidl stores will be about 36,000 square feet, said Rob Wilson, the town’s planning manager. Aldi stores in Cary are about 16,000 square feet. Lidl is conducting a traffic study of U.S. 70 Business in Clayton as part of potential plans to build a store across from Wal-Mart. The company offers low prices because it buys products in bulk and displays them on shelves in shipping cartons, said Jon Springer, retail editor at Supermarket News, a New York-based magazine. The trade publication has been reporting on the company’s U.S. ambitions since 2013. “Because they buy this stuff in a small variety of items in massive quantities and merchandise them in a low-labor environment, they are able to offer market-leading prices,” Springer said. Lidl has already faced some opposition in the Triangle. In January, the Apex Town Council voted unanimously to deny a rezoning request on a 5-acre parcel owned by Lidl U.S. Operations at the corner of Olive Chapel Road and West Williams Street. Residents had said they were worried about traffic, noise and the smell of rotting produce in dumpsters. Springer said Lidl hasn’t shared much about its U.S. strategy, but rumors of the European chain’s arrival may be why companies like Publix and Wegmans are entering the North Carolina market. Wegmans has announced its intentions to open its first North Carolina store in Cary, with a second one a possibility. “The specter of Lidl coming to the Southeast is part of what’s motivating the heightened level of competition,” Springer said.

The New York City council is currently debating how to regulate the controversial company. Airbnb is a remarkable company with an incredibly bright future – the company just raised $555 million in financing, reports say. It's also run up against a buzz saw of political opposition and regulatory challenges in key markets across the country. Airbnb has proved that it can be a successful business even while facing a tough regulatory environment, but the potential to lose its ability to effectively operate in markets like New York and San Francisco could be a real problem, no matter how you try to spin it. To change its streak of bad political luck, Airbnb has looked to the playbook used by Uber, FanDuel and Draft Kings and other startups to rally customers to advocate on their behalf, even recently organizing clubs where hosts gather for grassroots political meetings. But this approach is unlikely to work for Airbnb because of the structure of its network, the challenge of getting hosts to speak up when they're not sure if they're operating legally, and because its opponents -- affordable housing advocates and hotel workers -- are sympathetic. Rallying hosts to advocate politically is challenging for several reasons, the worst of which is because Airbnb's scale occurs on the guest side, not the host side. And the guests, almost by definition, are not registered voters in the jurisdiction they're staying in. So they could advocate but no one would care. And in jurisdictions where Airbnb's legal status is unclear, it's going to be difficult to get a lot of hosts to raise their hands to advocate and invite scrutiny into whether or not they're obeying the law. However, there is a solution. Airbnb can turn this into a much broader fight about property rights, rather than the narrower interests of Airbnb hosts. Americans don't like being told what they can and can't do (that's how our country got started in the first place). If only Airbnb hosts are invested in this fight, there will never be enough ammunition or sympathy to succeed. But if renters and homeowners generally start to think "don't tell me what I can do with my couch," Airbnb could then mobilize a portion of them to make that case to legislators and regulators (via email, twitter, etc…). That changes everything. This is what suburban community leaders have done across the country on local property tax issues to great effect. It's what the choice movement has done ever since Roe v. Wade. And to use a more corporate example, it's what Walmart has done in fighting unfair zoning restrictions in cities. The polling has been clear that while consumers may or may not want to shop at Walmart, they almost universally feel that the decision should be theirs, rather than their City Council prohibiting Walmart from opening in the first place. Doing this effectively means aligning with other groups and movements who champion economic liberty (on the right, usually) and with tenants advocacy groups (on the left - and getting their support will be challenging). It means working with think tanks across the ideological spectrum to develop the concept of a new property right. It means identifying, through smart research and targeting, which voters are most likely to respond to a "don't tell me what I can and can't do" argument, beyond people who participate in Airbnb. Creating a new property right would require both a multi-year political battle across the country and a lengthy legal battle. It will cost tens of millions of dollars (if not more), but the cost pales in comparison to what Airbnb stands to lose in its valuation if it can't operate in markets like New York. It will also take a different approach and thought process by Airbnb's leadership than they've employed to date (more creative, less afraid of politics, less wedded to what they already know). But if they want to ensure their ability to operate freely for decades to come, it's also their best route, by far. Hopefully they'll take it.

(Mark Wilson/Getty Images) By Steven Mufson September 23 Follow @StevenMufson Conservative organizations are pouring money into the coffers of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which is far outpacing its Democratic rival in fundraising to elect candidates who will stand up to what they see as an activist Democratic agenda. The Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) had raised $15.7 million by early May, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog, well ahead of the $5.7 million collected by the Democratic Attorneys General Association. Founded in 1999, RAGA has recently ramped up its fundraising efforts; in 2014, it brought in $16 million, up from $470,000 in 2002, and it claims credit for helping to increase the number of Republican attorneys general elected by half a dozen or more. Recently GOP attorneys general have cast themselves as the last bulwark against federal government encroachment and have thrown themselves against President Obama’s policies on immigration, health-care reform, climate change and Labor Department overtime rules. RAGA has tapped into the fossil-fuel industry, health insurers and ideological donors from the right wing of the political spectrum for large infusions of cash. The top contributions, as of early May, included $1,445,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, devoted to blocking the appointment of liberal judges; $1,180,000 from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Institute for Legal Reform; $500,000 from Republican casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson; and $451,100 from Blue Cross Blue Shield, a large health insurance company that has been struggling to provide plans under the Affordable Care Act. The Judicial Crisis Network is backed by multimillion-dollar contributions from the Wellspring Committee; both are 501(c)(4) organizations, which do not have to divulge their donors. “The amount of money is staggering,” said James Tierney, a former Maine attorney general and an adjunct professor at Harvard Law School who blames the Citizens United ruling, which lifted limits on corporate political contributions. “But that’s because it’s legal, and it’s legal because the Supreme Court said it was legal.” Democrats have belatedly tried to duplicate the Republican model. Founded in 2002, the Democratic Attorneys General Association has recently added offices in San Francisco and Washington, and in May hired its first full-time executive director, veteran political strategist Sean Rankin. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, its top donor this year is Pfizer, with $125,000; eight others gave $100,000 each, including CVS Pharmacy, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Home Depot and Walmart, which also gave to RAGA. In 2014, the Democratic group’s largest contribution, $380,000, came from the Teamsters union. Rankin said his goals are to close the fundraising gap by relying more on small donors and to help Democrats “get in office, stay in office and do a better job while in office.” On the Republican side, energy companies have donated much of the money that has flowed into the group’s coffers. RAGA members have filed suit to block the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, intended to slash carbon dioxide emissions from oil, natural gas and, above all, coal. The GOP attorneys general, who have already secured an unusual stay from the Supreme Court, are set to argue Tuesday before the full bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. During the 2016 election cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, run by the Center for Responsive Politics, RAGA has received $400,000 from Ariel, a maker of natural-gas compressors; $353,250 from Koch Industries, the energy firm owned by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch; and $250,000 from Murray Energy, a coal-mining company whose chief executive has sharply attacked Obama. The American Petroleum Institute gave $50,000 in each of the past two years. Democrat Terry Goddard, a former Arizona attorney general, former Phoenix mayor and now senior counsel at the law firm Dentons, said he deplores the increase in campaign money to attorneys general, even though he believes that the legal officers are operating ethically. “Probably the worst thing is that it raises the idea in the minds of people that this is a pay-to-play operation,” he said. The Republican state attorneys general have attacked Democratic AGs over an investigation into whether ExxonMobil knew about the threat of climate change as early as the 1970s and whether the oil giant violated securities law by misleading the public and investors about the potential consequences. The New York and Massachusetts attorneys general have issued broad subpoenas in the matter, but Exxon, which says it has already provided New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman about 1 million documents, has complained that Schneiderman is violating the company’s freedom of speech. Republicans have accused Schneiderman of colluding with environmental groups and liberal nonprofits to come up with a plan to use the same strategy against the oil industry that was used against the tobacco industry. The flap was at the top of the agenda when RAGA held its summer meeting at the Broadmoor hotel in Colorado Springs on July 11. The first panel, attended by hundreds of corporate executives, was titled “Climate Change Debate — How Speech Is Being Stifled.” The meeting did not include any scientific experts on climate change. Instead the panel included a longtime denier of climate change, Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and Chet M. Thompson, president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, whose plants are major emitters of greenhouse gases. The AFPM gave RAGA $50,900 last year and has given $135,000 so far in 2016. “We’ve got reality on our side,” Ebell said. He called the investigation of Exxon an “inquisition.” Ebell’s group received about $2 million from Exxon in the 2000s before the company switched direction and stopped funding the small group. Challenging the overwhelming consensus among scientists that climate change is real, Ebell said that “the first thing they try to do is try to change reality. They try to change the facts.” He added, “The next thing they try to do is exaggerate the impacts.” “This is not about climate change, and it’s not about fraud,” Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange interjected, according to a recording of the event provided by the Center for Media and Democracy. “It’s about if elected officials should be able to turn the prosecutorial power of their states against their political opponents in contradiction of our First Amendment and our basic speech rights in this country.” Strange, who becomes RAGA chairman in November, told the group that he had “never received a penny from Exxon in any campaign I’ve run.” The oil giant, however, gave $50,000 to RAGA in 2015 and another $50,000 this year, according to filings by RAGA to the Treasury. Environmental groups say the RAGA meeting in July was no different from their own efforts; the Republican attorneys general plotted strategy with like-minded groups. The environmentalists say that they are exercising the free speech RAGA claims to be protecting and that they also have the right to petition government officials and to consult experts. Their meetings were not secret, they add. “This is much more like collusion,” said Nick Surgey, research director at the Center for Media and Democracy. “These corporations have leverage because they pay into RAGA. And most of their money goes to elections.” Much of RAGA’s strategy will revolve around television ads in states where the group hopes to make a difference. The group has booked $3.8 million in broadcast and cable TV advertising time for the final five weeks of the state attorney general campaign in North Carolina, where the Republican nominee, state Sen. Buck Newton, is in a tough race against Democratic state Sen. Josh Stein. The association has already spent, through its Mountaineers Are Always Free PAC, nearly $2 million on four rounds of ads in West Virginia, where it is highlighting the fight against the Clean Power Plan, which would hurt the state’s coal industry. And it has sent $2 million to Josh Hawley’s campaign for attorney general in Missouri, which allows direct contributions. RAGA plans further spending in those states as well as in Pennsylvania and Indiana. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

NorthwestMilitary.com Menu Home News Military Life Vets Restaurants Music & Culture Travel Guides PROMO View Full Site Back to News Homeless vet starts charity John Potter tackles veteran homelessness By Sonia Garza on September 23, 2016 Veterans Christian Charity is working to address and eradicate veteran homelessness in Thurston County. Photo credit: Veterans Christian Charity Veterans Christian Charity (VCC) is a local organization with a mission to eradicate homeless veterans from the streets of Thurston County. The man behind the cause, Jack Potter, began his journey Jan. 14, 2016, but it wasn't until April 13 that he found himself homeless. It was then that the organization began gaining attention in the community. Potter, a disabled veteran, wanted to earn extra income a month but found that nobody would hire him. "There's lots of guys in that spot," he said. "So I started to get these guys some extra money each month and it morphed into a full blown charity," he said. "Who can resist the irony of a homeless veteran running a charity for homeless veterans from the streets?" he laughed. Currently, Potter sleeps in a 6 x 10 foot trailer that also serves as his office. But his situation hasn't stopped his passion and progress for the mission. "We have given food and sleeping bags to the homeless," he said. He was also able to secure a room for a homeless couple. He arranged a job at Walmart for himself so he could pay for that housing. "That's the key to getting the homeless off the street. They have to have the income to pay for the housing," he said. VCC is partnering with Rainier Therapeutic Riding and 22 Too Many to address homelessness. "We are going to show what can be done when people pull together in a county, like Thurston County." The result is making waves in the business community. "Most people here in Thurston County don't want homeless veterans on the streets not because they don't want the homeless people on the street, but because they're veterans," he said.   Potter grew up in Spokane and served two years in the Army. "What's unusual is that I don't believe my enlistment has ended," he said. After talking with roughly 75 homeless veterans, he concluded that they feel the same way. "We signed up to serve our country and whether we still wear the uniform or not, we still do that," he said. Potter plans to open a mission to get the homeless off the street immediately, followed by opening a triage center to get veterans to sober up, get a shower, warm food, counseling, the ability to call/Skype home, and obtain a temporary mailing address. Once stabilized, they'll move to a program house where the veteran will dedicate five to seven years with school, a job or both. "It's about getting back to being a civilian." Potter's last goal for the program is to find 40 acres in Thurston County to set up an organic farm. "It will be a safe place to work in the dirt, help with the horses, and do all the things that a farm needs." He plans to give most of the food away to the local food banks and charities. Until then, Jack plans to continue taking it to the streets. "By helping these others I'm helping myself as well," he said. "But it's a totally new way of doing business. We go to the business community because homelessness is a community issue. It's their businesses that the homeless are sleeping in front of. We address it where it matters and not behind the scenes." VCC is planning a Pampered Chef cooking fundraiser in November with Hilary Richmond out of Spanaway. Their goal is to raise the $850 needed for their 501c3 designation, but they still need help. "We've got ten thousand businesses or so in Thurston County. The more help I get, the more businesses I can reach." "Most people don't know how to support the homeless. They give the money to the people on the street. That's a mistake. Find a charity and donate to them on a regular basis."

Outback Steakhouse is set to open the doors to its long-awaited location at the Dover Towne Center on Oct. 3. The restaurant will employ 85 workers and seat close to 230 patrons. Perhaps best known for its signature Bloomin’ Onion appetizer, Outback’s dinner menu offers an array of “full-flavored” steak cuts seasoned with a 17-spice blend, along with burgers, chicken, ribs and seafood. The new Dover location also will serve lunch, featuring some lighter fare with combos starting at $6.99. A full bar with two community tables will sell cocktails, wine and beer, including the Australian-style lager Foster's. “We’re excited to be the newest neighbor in the promising and expanding Dover Towne Center,” said proprietor Steve Adams, who coincidentally shares a name with an NBA player from New Zealand. The 13-year employee of Tampa, Florida-based parent company Bloomin’ Brands, previously worked for Outback’s location in Ogletown's Possum Park Mall shopping center off Del. 2. The chain also owns a location near Rehoboth Beach. STORY: Checkers speeding ahead with Delaware expansion STORY: Ted’s Montana Grill moves up opening, calls for applications Outback is the latest tenant to join Dover Towne Center, which replaced a Walmart store that had been vacant since 2011 when the retailer relocated a few miles north to a new $12.5 million Supercenter near Cheswold. The property was purchased in 2012 by the Onix Group of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania – with help from Birchwood Capital Partners in Baltimore. The partners began work last spring transforming the former blight into a thriving retail center. The project demolished nearly a third of the former 118,200-square foot building, divided the remainder into separate stores, added a new facade and expanded the parking lot to 630 spaces. Outback, which will occupy a 5,600-square-foot standalone building, signed on to join the shopping center last summer, along with five other national retailers. Ulta Beauty, Petco and apparel chain Five Below opened last spring, followed by Ross Dress for Less, Shoe Carnival and OshKosh B'gosh. Another pad site and 25,000-square-feet of retail space are still left to be filled, according to the website for broker KLNB Retail. Dover Towne Center is just one redevelopment success story for Dover, Mayor Robin Christiansen said. Buy Photo The Dover Towne Center at 1574 N. Dupont Highway, site of the former Dover Walmart, now has six tenants, including an Outback Steakhouse that will open on Oct. 3.  (Photo: GARY EMEIGH/SPECIAL TO THE NEWS JOURNAL) About a mile south, Burlington Coat Factory and Big Lots will hold grand opening celebrations Sept. 30 for their newest locations in Capital Commons, a large retail space that had been vacant since a long-standing Kmart shut its doors there in 2014. Both projects took advantage of several economic development incentives offered by the city. The Onix Group, for example, will receive a 10-year tax abatement on building improvements and a 50-percent reduction in permit fees, as well as a 50-percent discount on the cost of re-connecting the property into Dover's water and sewer system. “Sometimes you have to float some crumbs on the water to catch some fish,” Christiansen said. “And we have to scrap, scrape and claw to get every business we can because we're in competition with both the beaches and New Castle County.” Kent County has long struggled with jobs. The unemployment rate  lags behind its county neighbors to the north and south. The number of Kent County residents – particularly children – living in poverty also outpaces the rest of Delaware. Along with added retail options, major employers such as Kraft Heinz and Energizer – formerly Playtex – have been growing in recent years. Christiansen said he's hopeful the DE Turf Complex, an 85-acre youth sports center currently under construction near Frederica, will help drive further economic development in south Dover. “I see the possibility for new hotels and restaurants along Bay Road that want to take advantage of all the families visiting the complex,” he said.

The new restaurant will be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays, until 11 p.m. on Saturdays and until 9 p.m. on Sundays. A portion of the proceeds from the restaurant's opening day will be donated to the Food Bank of Delaware.

Mamata Banerjee's pet venture - marketed under her game-changer concept "Biswa Bangla" -- has thus been acknowledged as the "best turnaround story" by the country's biggest retail forum. The state government initiative under West Bengal State Handloom Weavers Cooperative Society (set up in 1945) has received the accolade given out by Indian Retail Forum (IRF) for all the innovative marketing and retailing strategies that helped Tantuja see profits for three years in a row, after being perpetually a loss-making company for the last 25 years. IRF focuses on navigating fastest growing major market in the world, Krish Iyer, president and CEO, Walmart India, who chaired the 13th edition of India's largest retail intelligence event, lauded "the Bengal government's efforts in turning Tantuja into a success story." Rabindranath Roy, managing director (MD), Tantuja, who returned to Kolkata on Friday after receiving the award, said, "We at the West Bengal Handloom Weavers Society have been constantly evolving ways to make Tantuja, not only get over its loss-making tag, but also establish it as a major brand in the national and international markets. It's good that our efforts have been acknowledged." Tantuja's tant sarees, synonymous with Bengal, have been available on the multinational online shopping store Amazon for the last two months. Tantuja had earlier tied up with Flipkart and sold products worth Rs 30 lakhs a year. Starting with a profit of Rs 25 lakh in 2013-14 after a gap of 25 years, Tantuja went on to make an operational profit of Rs 2.5 crore in 2014-15. In 2015-16, it reached a new high of an operational profit of Rs 3.3 crore against a business turnover of Rs 123 crore. The Bengal chief minister may not be agreeing to grant SEZ status to Infosys, thus barring the IT giant from foraying into the state, but her focus on small and medium enterprises has made fairytale revivals for once-sick handloom enterprises Manjusha and Tantuja. The latter's turnaround story is about to reach new highs with newer products, stores, online ventures and a more innovative marketing methods. Roy told TOI on Friday, "The newest product from Tantuja will hit the markets after the Pujas." He was referring to linen that is being manufactured by handloom units at Fulia in Nadia. Till 2013, Tantuja, established to promote and market craftsmanship of Bengal, was heavily subsidized by the micro and small scale enterprises and textiles department. At the behest of Mamata Banerjee, it was told to perform or perish. "The CM had a clear mandate: overhaul and make the sick industry perform," micro and small scale enterprises and textiles secretary Rajiva Sinha said. And the state government only agreed to provide capital expenditure - operational costs were to be generated from sales. The sale was tagged with Biswa Bangla, Mamata Banerjee's brainchild for promoting Bengal's art and craft at a global level, and aggressively retailed in upscale showrooms under its aegis. The clincher was tie-ups with Flipkart and Amazon. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

Flannel makes me think of lumberjacks. Lumberjacks make me think of the Northwest. So, let’s provide an update on some northwest Lawrence development. Yes, I really should think less. • Trump vs. Clinton. Pepperoni vs. sausage. They are all choices you may have to make in November. I’m getting word that Kansas City’s Spin Neapolitan Pizza will open its Lawrence location sometime in November. As we have reported, Spin is going into the new retail building just east of the Wal-Mart near Sixth and Wakarusa. As you can see below, that building is looking fairly complete from the outside. A representative with Spin alerted me to the likely November opening, but didn’t have an exact date to share yet. by Chad Lawhorn If you have forgotten about Spin, it touts itself as an artisan-style pizzeria, with Neapolitan crusts. That means hand-spun, thin crusts that are cooked in a stone oven. The artisan part also means a variety of toppings. Cheeses range from the traditional mozzarella to Asiago, feta and something called taleggio. Meats include staples like Italian sausage and pepperoni but also Italian bacon, Scimeca’s meatballs, and salami. In addition there are things like arugula, pine nuts, crushed glazed pecans, fig onion marmalade and sun-dried tomato relish that you can put on your pizza and whatever tie you happen to be wearing that day. The restaurant has been popular in Kansas City since it opened its first restaurant in 2005. We also have reported that Blue Moose Bar & Grill also will occupy a portion of the new Lawrence building. I haven’t heard an opening date yet for that facility, which is a Kansas City-based restaurant that serves a mix of sports bar dishes and more upscale dinner entrees. I would think November would be a good bet. • Keep your eyes open for a new hotel project near Sixth and Wakarusa. Nothing is finalized, but a representative with the Bauer Farm development group near Sixth and Wakarusa did confirm that a group has signed a letter of intent to locate a hotel in the development. As we have reported, the lot at the corner of Wakarusa Drive and Overland Drive — it is right behind the car wash — has been reserved for a hotel property. Bill Fleming, a Lawrence attorney with the development group that owns the lot, declined to identify the group or other details about the potential project, but said a letter of intent has been signed to build a hotel on the property. The deal is not yet done, however. More due diligence and city approvals will be required. We previously have noted that the lot could accommodate about an 80- to 100-unit hotel property. Fleming said interest from hotel properties had been strong. 38.9737273,-95.3073893 “I think it is another example of where Rock Chalk Park has helped the community,” Fleming said. The Rock Chalk Park Sports Complex, of course, is just down the road at Sixth Street and George Williams Way. This is the second hotel proposal in the last couple of months. As we have reported, an extended stay hotel is planned for the old Don’s Steakhouse property on the eastern edge of Lawrence along 23rd Street. I know many folks thought a hotel quickly would develop on the vacant, commercially zoned property near Rock Chalk Park, but that hasn’t been the case. Developers would welcome it, I’m sure, but I think most of the efforts continue to focus on bringing in a big box retailer for the site. I believe the thought process is that it will take a destination type of retailer to get some momentum going for commercial development in that area, which is still considered very much on the edge of town. • A pizza, a moose, a hotel room to sleep off both of them: Absolutely I’m going to need the assistance of a financial institution. As we have reported, MidAmerican Credit Union is slated to build a new facility right behind the CVS near Sixth and Wakarusa. Well, the project came together quickly and is now completed. The building has a bit of a distinctive look to it, as you can see below. MidAmerican Credit Union has built a new facility right behind the CVS near Sixth and Wakarusa. by Chad Lawhorn Another unusual feature is that it is a bank — well, credit union — without teller windows. The credit union is testing a new design in banks that uses a pod system. A customer representative meets you at the door and walks you over to a computer station where the representative and the customer complete the transaction together. • You may have noticed dirt work beginning on another piece of property along Sixth Street between Wakarusa and Folks. It is just west of the new apartment complex under construction, and just east of Starbucks. I can’t believe you already have forgotten what that will be: as we have reported, a Zaxby’s fried chicken restaurant. It is a chain that focuses on chicken fingers and chicken wings, with lots of sauce options. I’ll admit, I forgot what was going there too. There are so many new chicken places in town that I think the cholesterol is starting to clog my brain. • You also may have noticed dirt work just east of Sixth and Folks Road next to Central Bank of the Midwest. As we have reported, that will be a new dentist office. The city has approved plans for a $2.5 million building that will house Growing Smiles Pediatric Dentistry, plus have space for two other medical tenants. Smart. Nothing is tougher on teeth than a moose, although maybe the blue variety is more tender. • And finally, if you have a golf game like mine, it pays to know where all the window stores are located. The Pella Products store has located in the shopping center on the southwest corner of Sixth and Wakarusa. It is kind of next door to Eileen’s Colossal Cookies. The window store previously was located a bit east of Sixth and Kasold.

The former KFC spot near Sixth and Wakarusa was high on their list, but they faced competition for that building.
