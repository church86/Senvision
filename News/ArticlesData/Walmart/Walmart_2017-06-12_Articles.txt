Wilkes-Barre Township police told WNEP that some shoppers noticed a young child sleeping inside a vehicle with no one else with him and called 911. Police, EMS, and the township’s fire department all responded. “When we got there, there was a little boy in the back seat,” said Capt. Clyde Moyer with Wilkes-Barre Township Fire Department. “We were getting ready to pop the door open when the mom came out of Walmart.” According to police, Rachel Johnson, of Mountain Top, told officers that her 3-year-old son was sleeping when she and her three other children got to Walmart around 3:30 p.m. Monday. Not wanting to wake the child, she and the other children went inside the store. “That’s crazy, should not be happening. Take your kid with you,” said shopper Carrie Modzelewski of Wilkes-Barre. “You leave them in the car, anybody can come and grab them,” said a woman who didn’t want to give her name. “I take my grandchildren shopping and when they say, ‘I’m not going in that store.’ I say, ‘Yes, you are, if I have to carry you in there.'" Johnson told officers she locked the vehicle and used the remote start function to allow the car to run with the air conditioning on. However, police say vehicles started that way will shut off after 10 minutes. Johnson says she was in the store for a total of 20 minutes. “On a day like today, it’s so horribly hot out,” said Margeret Burke, from Nanticoke. “It wouldn’t be great to leave a 3-year-old alone anywhere.” Paramedics determined that the child was unhurt in the incident. Police say Johnson has been cited for leaving a child unattended and a referral has been made to Luzerne County Children and Youth.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) NEW YORK — At a Target in upper Manhattan, shoppers can pick from 19 types of ketchup, including well-known names like Heinz and Hunt's. At the Aldi next door, the three options range from 99 cents to $1.79. All are the chain's own brands, which doesn't seem to bother shoppers attracted by the low prices. "If you look at the ingredients, it's the same thing. A lot of people don't realize that," said Anabel Rosado, a bank supervisor who was browsing the snack aisle. Aldi and its European rival Lidl, which opens its first U.S. stores this week, including one in Winston-Salem, are hoping to change the way people shop with their smaller, no-frills stores filled mostly with house brands that tend to cost less. Whole Foods, which has fought the "Whole Paycheck" reputation, is also moving into the discount sector with an offshoot chain named after its 365 brand. The push could further pressure grocery giants like Walmart and Kroger, which are also contending with the growth potential of online grocers and have already been reining in operational costs so they can keep their prices competitive. Target is also trying to become better known for low prices as it works to boost its struggling grocery business. "We are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like our strategy," Steve Schmitt, Walmart's vice president of investor relations, said in May about the growth of the European chains. Aldi, which has 1,650 U.S. locations, has been remodeling stores to have a brighter feel and plans to expand to 2,500 stores in the next five years. The expansion plans were announced as another German discount grocer, Lidl, prepares to open its first nine U.S. stores on Thursday with plans to have 100 within a year. Already, the discounters have successfully taken market share in the U.K. grocery industry, according to Euromonitor International. There are four 365 by Whole Foods locations and 20 more in development. FAMILIAR PACKAGE, UNFAMILIAR NAME Walk into an Aldi store, and the products often come in packaging reminiscent of more popular brands. The chain's Millville Raisin Bran is in a purple box similar to the versions made by Kellogg and Post. Its Benton's cookies are in blue packages that resemble those of Chips Ahoy. Stocking shelves with store brands is a big part of how discounters keep costs down. Lidl also says it will have a mix of private-label brand names, which will account for 90 percent of the products in its stores. Whole Foods offers its 365 label across a variety of categories, more akin to the approach at Trader Joe's, which has also been steadily expanding its store count in United States. The growing popularity of store brands across the grocery industry is expected to help discounters. The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 percent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. "They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products," she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It's part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn't said how much. CHOICES, CHOICES Aldi, Lidl and 365 by Whole Foods challenge the idea that shoppers want the array of choices found at traditional supermarkets. While a standard Whole Foods may have around 30,000 products, a 365 store has about 8,000, which helps keep down overall operational costs. How wide the selection is can vary by item. Since people tend to be more particular about yogurt, the company says 365 may offer just as many choices as the average Whole Foods store. Jeff Turnas, head of 365 by Whole Foods, said the stores can cater to people who want to do their shopping more quickly. "We have tried to make the decision-making faster, easier," Turnas says. Aldi U.S. CEO Jason Hart also says his chain is deliberate about where it wants to offer more variety. He said people can find whatever products they might get at rival grocers, but there might just be fewer options within each category. He said people prefer that because too many choices "just add confusion." "Our format of retailing and our format of shopping is becoming more accepted in the mainstream," Hart said. For now, Kantar Retail estimates that the discounter category, which includes Aldi, Trader Joe's and dollar stores, has 6 percent of U.S. grocery sales. By 2021, it expects that figure to inch up to 8 percent. Walmart says the scope of its offerings — including its pharmacy and options like in-store pickup for online orders — sets it apart from the competition. The retailer notes it has been working on keeping prices down and that its customer traffic is up. Kurt Jetta, CEO of consulting firm Tabs Analytics, also said big-box retailers have the advantage of being able to draw a wider swath of shoppers by offering greater variety. Still, he said Aldi and Lidl might have more appeal than dollar stores with middle-income customers, in line with places like Trader Joe's. "They don't have the stigma attached to them," Jetta said.

Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, recently addressed the media on the importance of the ongoing work. “We think retail can play an exciting role in the jobs market overall as a point of entry for people, but also accelerate mobility for retailer workers. We want to help people move up the career ladder in retail,” McLaughlin said. The first strategy in the program has been to change the perception of retail jobs to a place of opportunity and try to shift or reframe the way people view jobs in retail, not only those who work in retail but also the way employers, community colleges and others view the sector, she added. Research has been funded into determining the skills that would be needed. The second strategy is focused on innovations in skill acquisition. The Foundation made grants to the National Immigration Board who worked in the Miami, Florida area around an English language acquisition program in the retail context, she said. The work also included using the New Venture Fund which the Walmart Foundation co-funded with other stakeholders to drive tech learning. The third strategy has involved engaging other retail employers to change the way they invest in their own people and to bring others to the table in their effort to shift the entire system, McLaughlin said. “Retail is in undergoing a massive transformation and we are right in the middle of it as it’s becoming a much more digitally enabled sector and to stay relevant for our customers we have to serve them in more unique ways. To do that we have to continue to invest in the skills of our people,” McLaughlin said. RETAIL JOB STABILITY A board of workforce professionals was also convened by Wal-Mart for a panel discussion on the topics of stability and mobility in the retail jobs sector. McLaughlin asked the panel to discuss their roles in the overall strategy of changing the way retail jobs are viewed by the world today. Andy Van Kleunen, CEO of the National Skills Coalition, served as the moderator for the panel. Kathleen McLaughlin, president of Walmart Foundation, recently addressed the media on work to change the perception of retail jobs. Van Kleunen said the national economy looks good with an unemployment rate of 4.3%, but that metric doesn’t disclose the kinds of jobs people are getting or what they earn or if those jobs hold an opportunity for advancement. He said the skills needed to secure a job and stay there long enough to build opportunity for advancement is much higher than any time in the past. He said that’s why many employers say they can’t find job candidates with the required skills in this so-called full employment state. He said retail and other hospitality and food service jobs have long been viewed as entry-level positions where people frequently move in and out of the jobs and changing that perception must begin from the inside. Rachel Schneider, senior vice president at Center for Financial Services Innovation, recently co-authored a study and spent time with families for a year to try and understand their financial decision making in terms of saving, borrowing and spending. “While the unemployment level is really low that is not telling you what is happening with some families over a course of a year. … We gathered cash flows data from families over time so that we didn’t just a have snapshot, but a more fluid looks at their financial picture. One of the big learnings was that while many families earn enough money throughout the course of a year to cover their expenses that earning is uneven and there are times when there are cash shortfalls,” Schneider said. She explained that families on average had five months out of 12 with major fluctuations in earnings, which were not attributed to tips or commissions, but it was the change in paychecks week-to-week or month-to-month of them doing the same job amid shift fluctuations. She said this creates a challenge for retail workers when they have to think about how to manage their spending. Schneider said it’s wrong to categorize some jobs as good and some as bad. She said manufacturing jobs were seen as deplorable at the dawn of the 20th Century as workers were underpaid, with terrible working conditions but they eventually became good jobs because for decades employers, government and workers all worked to make them better. “Today what we have is a lot of retail jobs and we need to figure out how to make those good jobs and drop the assumption that jobs are inherently better or worse than others,” she added. Retail is a huge force in the labor market, accounting for as many as one in four jobs, according to the National Retail Federation. But in recent months the sector has been losing jobs at an alarming rate amid store closures and retailer bankruptcies. The sector has shed more than 67,000 jobs between February and May, making it more difficult for many retail workers to achieve stability. To exacerbate the challenge, retail jobs pay about $8 less an hour than the average across the private sector, according to Robert Johnson, director of economic analysis at Morningstar. WAL-MART’S ROLE David Scott, senior vice president of talent and organization effectiveness at Wal-Mart, was also a panelist who spoke to the retailer’s efforts to play a bigger role helping workers reach job stability. “We at Wal-Mart do believe we offer a great first job, and then if people choose to stay with us that can become a career down the road. Stability involves financial wherewithal, scheduling and workplace environment,” Scott said. He adds that Wal-Mart is piloting a program now with its employees called “paycheck smoothing,” that allows employees to set aside money when they have earned extra. The funds can then be pulled out when they have a lower paycheck. Scott said those piloting the program like it. “Recently the Federal Reserve Board put out a study that said over half the population wouldn’t be able to handle over a $400 emergency such as car accident or medical crisis and we are looking at ways to help our employees do better budgeting and be more financially stable so that they can also be more participatory in serving our customers out in our stores,” Scott said. Schneider’s research found workers who are stressed about their finances are able to focus less on doing their jobs. Scott said Wal-Mart continues to tweak its scheduling system which is now called Customer’s First. He and his colleague Ellie Bertani, a director in HR strategy, said scheduling is critical to stability in the minds of retail employees. In 2013, Wal-Mart rolled a new scheduling program that allows store employees to pick up extra shifts at will as they became available. Bertani said the retailer is revamping the program but the premise is the same. She said consumers are moving to shop during off hours and they have to be served when they are in the stores. Bertani also said Wal-Mart ensures store employees get their schedules two weeks in advance so they can plan accordingly. Scott said stability in retail jobs is a bigger concern among consumers than mobility. However, he said Wal-Mart is still a place where someone can taken an entry-level hourly job and work their way to CEO of Wal-Mart Stores like Doug McMillon, or CEO of Sam’s Club like John Furner. Scott said many store managers began as hourly employees and today earn an average of $170,000 per year and manage 300 to 500 employees.

By Betty AdamsStaff Writer Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-621-5631 Share Comment Read Article Two of the people involved in a gunfire incident in the Augusta Walmart parking lot almost a year ago have been indicted on federal narcotics conspiracy charges. Diana Davis, also known as “Little C” and “CC,” 29, and her brother, Frankie Dejesus, 27, both of Rochester, New York, were charged along with eight other people. Additional names of those charged have been redacted from the indictment, indicating arrest warrants have been issued for some people. Frankie Dejesus Diana Davis The indictment was handed up by a federal grand jury May 17, 2017, but sealed until recently. All the suspects face a charges of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances, which are heroin fentanyl and cocaine base. Several are charged with possession with intent to distribute controlled substances and maintaining drug-involved premises from June 14, 2015 to March 9, 2017, in central Maine. Davis and Dejesus faced state charges after the June 26, 2016, incident, in which shots were exchanged between people in two cars in the parking lot at the Walmart at the Marketplace at Augusta, which was followed by an alleged shooter being attacked when he got out of one vehicle. No one was shot. Police said the incident was drug-related. The fracas was broken up after armed civilian bystanders intervened. Davis originally faced state charges of aggravated assault and pleaded no contest in December 2016 to a reduced charge of assault. She was found guilty automatically and sentenced to 100 days in jail, which she already had served. The prosecutor said Davis had no prior criminal record. Davis was arrested June 7, according to information in the electronic case files in U.S. District Court for the District of Maine. She was ordered held pending trial on the charge, which is indicated as “10-plus year drug offenses.” Attorney Ronald Bourget was appointed as her defense attorney in the federal case. Dejesus received a two-year deferred disposition after pleading guilty March 8, 2017, to a charge of reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon in connection with the Walmart incident. The special conditions of his deferred disposition require that he depart Maine by 4 p.m. the next day and return only for meeting with his attorney or for court proceedings. If he succeeded on the deferred disposition, he was to be sentenced to the time he spent in jail while awaiting trial, which is over eight months. If he is unsuccessful, the sentence would be determined by a judge and could be up to five years in prison. In exchange for his plea, charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault against him were dismissed by the state. Dejesus and Melina Snead, known as “Lady,” 23, also of Rochester, New York, were arrested June 9 in Rochester. Dejesus is set for arraignment Monday in U.S. District Court in Bangor. Snead and the others facing the federal conspiracy charges were not involved in the incident at Walmart. Here is a list of those who have been named so far: Jeffrey Johnson, 56, of Gardiner, is accused of using a residence at 200 Hideaway Acres, Chelsea; and Russell Truman, 49, of Gardiner is accused of using 21 Highland Ave., Gardiner, to distribute and use controlled substances. Darrell Newton, 37, also known as “Coast” and “D-Coast,” of Rochester, New York, faces a mandatory 20 years in prison if convicted of the class A conspiracy charge because he has a prior conviction. He is accused of having more than a kilogram of heroin and 280 grams or more of cocaine base. He and Brent Hercules, 29, also known as “Herc,” also of Rochester, New York, were arrested June 6 in New York. Jamie M. Betances, 30, also known as “Booger,” “Booga,” “Buga” and “Ice.” Betances was one of five people arrested in May 2017 in connection with an alleged drug ring in Somerset County. He is in state custody after pleading guilty to aggravated trafficking of scheduled drugs that occurred May 10, 2016, in Fairfield. Betances was ordered to serve an initial five years of a 15-year prison term, the remainder was suspended during a three-year probation. Alex Brumfield, 29, also known as “Bob” and “Izzo,” formerly of Rochester, New York, and more recently of Augusta, is set for arraignment Wednesday in Bangor. Attorney Joseph M. Bethony has been appointed to represent him. Brumfield is serving a 30-month prison term for dealing heroin. Donald Morang, 37, also known as “DW,” of Augusta, is serving a four-year state prison sentence for cocaine trafficking. He is represented in the federal case by Verne Paradie Jr. Betances, Brumfield, Truman, and Morang were already in state custody. Truman is serving an eight-year state prison term for drug trafficking. Truman is scheduled for arraignment at 1 p.m. Wednesday in Bangor by Magistrate Judge John Nivison. Attorney David Bate has been appointed to represent Truman. Betty Adams — 621-5631 [email protected] Twitter: @betadams Share Read or Post Comments Send questions/comments to the editors.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Abha Bhattarai By Abha Bhattarai June 13 Follow @abhabhattarai Walmart spent two years developing the Sweet Spark cantaloupe, picture on the right. (Courtesy of Walmart) Off-season cantaloupes, Walmart executives say, “taste like a piece of wood.” Which is why the world’s largest retailer recently set out to create a “designer” melon that tastes as sweet and flavorful in winter as it does in summer. The Sweet Spark, as it is called, has been in the works for two years and is up to 40 percent sweeter than the current winter fare sold at Walmart, Bloomberg originally reported this week. “We sell 10 times as many cantaloupes in the summer than during the fall and winter,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman. “When we looked closer, it was easy to identify why cantaloupe sales dropped off: They weren’t as good in the wintertime as they were in the summertime. This was our way of fixing that.” The company’s roll-out of its new cantaloupe comes as the company braces for competition from German discount grocers Lidl, which is opening its first U.S. stores on Thursday, and Aldi, which is investing $3.4 billion to open 900 locations by 2022. Both are known for offering sweeping discounts on groceries, which could mean bad news for Walmart, which has long relied on its formidable buying power to offer lower prices than its competitors. Walmart partnered with Bayer AG, the German agriculture giant that is in talks to buy Monsanto, to develop the new cantaloupe seed. The retailer tested 20 types of seeds and spent six months evaluating their fruit before coming up with the winning combination, Blakeman said. Walmart employees rated the fruit on attributes like taste, texture and aroma. (“People who tried it were very fanatical about it,” Blakeman said.) Employees also voted on the fruit’s name, which was whittled down from a list of 150 submissions. Walmart’s approach — to create an entirely new variety of fruit that fits its needs — is increasingly popular in the United States as grocers, faced with increasing competition and ever-growing demand for novelty produce, look for new ways to stand out, said Courtney Weber, a berry breeder and horticulture professor at Cornell University. “The goal is to have something that is special in some way,” Weber said. “From a plant breeder’s standpoint, our goal is to provide improved varieties of fruit — which can mean improving color, flavor, yield or disease resistance.” [Walmart is preparing to take on Amazon. But first, parachuting M&M’s.] Japan, where white strawberries have become the ultimate luxury item, is at the forefront of specialty-bred fruits, Weber said. The practice has also begun to take hold in Europe, , where fruit makers increasingly sell certain varieties only to certain supermarkets. And in the United States, programs like Walmart’s could ultimately help usher in a new wave of improved fruits and vegetables, according to Susan Brown, director of Cornell’s Fruit and Vegetable Genomics Initiative. “Often the problem now is that if we have a new variety of fruit, it’s very hard to convince retailers to try something new,” Brown said. “When a company like Walmart partners with breeders and growers, they know exactly what the market is for the new fruit, which actually helps everybody: Consumers, producers and breeders.” Creating its own breed of cantaloupe — and potentially enlisting a number of growers to produce it — made particular sense for Walmart because of its size, breeders said. The company currently has more than 4,600 stores across the country. (In 2011, cantaloupes contaminated with listeria — some of which were sold at Walmart — killed 33 people. Walmart later reached a settlement with 23 families for an undisclosed amount.) [Walmart is asking employees to deliver packages on their way home from work] “The problem that Walmart has is volume,” Weber said. “They’re such a big company and they need so much to fill their shelves, that their only real option if they want to have uniformity and to be able to have it everywhere, is to do it this way. It’s unlikely one company could grow enough cantaloupes for Walmart.” Cantaloupes, he added, were likely an obvious starting point because they are relatively resilient and sturdy. A more delicate fruit, like berries, would have required special care and handling, adding to their cost. The thicker skin on cantaloupe means it can be shipped and stored relatively easily, without fear of compromising quality. The Sweet Spark, which is not genetically modified, is grown in Guatemala and Costa Rica. It is currently sold in 200 U.S. stores, with an expansion planned for later this year. The company in recent years has expanded its line-up of organic fruits and vegetables to appeal to health-conscious customers. It has also forged exclusive partnerships to sell products like Oreo O’s cereal and Jelly Donut Oreos, and Blakeman says the company’s next goal is to develop a more flavorful tomato. “If you try to frame what we’re doing, it’s pretty simple: We’re trying to win customers,” Doug McMillon, presidnet and chief executive of Walmart, told reporters earlier this month. “We’re working on cost and price. We’re working on assortment.” Read more: A man is suing Hershey for ‘under-filling’ his box of Whoppers Lucky Charms cannot find the magic in natural ingredients — so it’s going full-on sugar bomb Flashlights sneakers: The ‘huge trend’ Walmart is betting on Anti-Trump groups have a new target: McDonald’s business business false after3th true Please provide a valid email address.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Wal-Mart's Latest Delivery Idea Is So Crazy It Just Might Work Wal-Mart is having its own employees make deliveries on their way home. It's the latest example of how the retail giant is using assets like its store network to fend off Amazon. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Jun 13, 2017 at 3:27PM After years of falling behind Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) in e-commerce, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is finally starting to play catch up. Over the last year, the world's largest retailer has made a number of aggressive moves to claw back market share from the e-commerce giant. It spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com last summer, bringing on board the start-up's proprietary price-saving technology and its founder, Marc Lore, one of the most respected minds in e-commerce. More recently, the retail titan bought a number of smaller online fashion retailers this year, including ModCloth, Moosejaw, and ShoeBuy, as it seeks to add more firepower to its e-commerce division. Wal-Mart also scrapped its membership-based Shipping Pass program and instead now offers free two-day shipping on all orders of $35 or more. And in April, the company started offering discounts on select items if customers pick them up in stores, leveraging its store footprint.Yet another initiative also makes use of its current assets. It's like Uber, but for Wal-Mart This time, Wal-Mart is tapping its own employees for delivery online orders, an innovation the company says is "one of a kind" for last-mile delivery. Pioneered by Jet.com founder Lore, the new program calls on store-based employees to bring packages to customers on their way home from work. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is currently testing the program at three stores, two in New Jersey and one in Arkansas, and it says the response from "associates and customers has been great," with many orders being delivered the next day. Lore said he'd like to ramp up the service to same-day deliveries. Ninety percent of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart store, so leveraging its store footprint, whether it be for pick-ups or deliveries, is a key part of the company's e-commerce strategy. The program is optional for store associates, who can choose the number, size, and weight limits of the packages they deliver, as well as what days they can make deliveries. Employees seem to like it as it gives them an opportunity to earn extra income.  Amazon launched a similar program, Amazon Flex, in 2015, hiring independent drivers to make deliveries. However, that program remains just a tiny slice of Amazon's delivery infrastructure, and it rates just 2.2 stars on Glassdoor, with only 32% of reviewers saying they'd recommend it to a friend. From a driver standpoint, it hardly seems like a success. Wal-Mart also notes an important difference between the two. Since Wal-Mart's employees are leaving from the same place as the packages and finishing at home, their total driving time is shorter, making it more efficient. Speed is the name of the game Last-mile delivery is a notorious headache for logistics and delivery providers like the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and UPS, which is why Amazon has begun building out its own supplementary delivery network. It's also established small warehouses in cities to support its Prime Now service, which offers delivery in as little as an hour for an extra charge. Amazon Prime has made two-day delivery the industry standard, and it's up to competitors to match it. Wal-Mart's decision to offer free two-day shipping with a $35 order minimum was a wise move, and the employee delivery program should also make it more competitive with Amazon.  Wal-Mart has 4,700 stores across the country, each with an average number of employees of about 300. If the program is popular enough with store associates, it could potentially handle $1 billion in e-commerce deliveries a year. That won't make Wal-Mart independent from delivery providers like the USPS, but it could make a difference for ensuring speedy delivery on key items and for saving money on the bottom line. There's no word yet on when Wal-Mart is going to expand the program to other stores, but I'd expect it to ramp up as soon as the company sees it benefiting a wide range of stakeholders. Expect more innovations like this from Lore and company as Wal-Mart continues to look for ways to narrow the gap with Amazon. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Not even Wal-Mart likes the cantaloupes it sells in winter. “They’re engineered to make a 3,000-mile trip, so they look good but taste like a piece of wood,” said Shawn Baldwin, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s senior vice president for produce and global food sourcing. “So we said, ‘Wouldn’t it be nice to have that summer melon taste in the fall?'” Wal-Mart says it typically sells 10 times more cantaloupes in June, when it can buy from U.S. farms, than it does in December, when the melons are grown farther south. Most retailers don’t have the mojo to do anything about it. Related With only 3% market share, Canadian discount grocers have ample room to grow: report From mouldy strawberries to poorly trained employees: Amazon still stumped by ‘treacherous’ $800-billion grocery market Amazon wants Cheerios, Oreos and other brands to make their products to be shipped, not sold at Wal-Mart But Wal-Mart is the biggest U.S. grocer. If it wants to sell a cantaloupe off-season that tastes as sweet and juicy as in summer — and keeps it a step ahead of discount competitors nipping at its heels — it gets to. The retailer teamed up with seed experts at German agriculture giant Bayer AG to help develop a bespoke melon that’s pleasing to the palate but still tough enough for the trek from warmer climes. Wal-Mart considered more than 100 varieties of seeds and tested 20. Wal-Mart employees spent six months grading the cantaloupes on attributes like flavor, texture and aroma. Wal-Mart had “a scientific, focused approach,” said Matthew DeCeault of Bayer Vegetable Seeds in California. Sweet Spark The winner was dubbed the Sweet Spark, after the yellow sunburst in Wal-Mart’s logo. The designer cantaloupes are available in 200 U.S. stores with a full roll-out planned for fall. Sweet Spark is not genetically modified. “I hate the name but that’s what the employees picked,” said Baldwin, who preferred Winter Wonder. The new cantaloupe is as much as 40 per cent sweeter than Wal-Mart’s current winter melons, according to the so-called Brix scale, which measures sugar content. It’s “very rare” for a retailer to invest in the exclusive development of a new variety of fruit, according to Rabobank International produce analyst Roland Fumasi, though growers often cultivate new breeds and offer them to a retailer for a short period.  For now, Wal-Mart has exclusive rights to sell Sweet Spark. The company will try to negotiate a long-term arrangement with Bayer. If that falls through, it’s possible the cantaloupe variety could be sold at rival retailers. Boosting Produce Sweet Spark is part of a push by Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon to boost Wal-Mart’s produce department, which is the first thing shoppers see when they enter the store. Customers who buy fruits and vegetables spend 55 per cent more on their trips, according to data tracker Nielsen. “In today’s saturated market, retailers need to find ways to stand out,” said Matt Lally, manager of Nielsen’s Fresh Growth and Strategy team. Wal-Mart is doing all it can to keep grocery rivals at bay. For now, at least, a juicy ripe cantaloupe in the dead of U.S. winter isn’t something easily delivered by Amazon.com Inc. The world’s biggest internet retailer is pushing into the grocery business and chasing Wal-Mart’s lower-income shoppers. But it can’t match its global food supply chain. Produce is a key weapon in Wal-Mart’s battle against Europe-based deep-discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded into the U.S. with prices on packaged foods, like soup and cereal, that often beat Wal-Mart’s. Up next: tomatoes. Wal-Mart’s Baldwin said he wants to replicate the blend of sweetness and acidity in the San Marzano variety of Naples, Italy. “When you’re as big as Wal-Mart, you can dictate a lot of what you want to see in produce,” said Kent Bradford, a professor and director of the Seed Biotechnology Center at the University of California at Davis.   Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Top Big Brand Stocks to Buy Now Disney, McDonald's, and Wal-Mart are big brands with investing appeal right now. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Jun 13, 2017 at 12:16PM Market volatility is inevitable. Stocks move, and every so often there's a flight to quality. When equity markets get rocky there's a natural inclination to shift one's portfolio into brand names that can stand the test of time. Let's take a look at Disney (NYSE:DIS), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). The three companies are routinely among the lists of top big brands, but they are also potentially big winners for today's opportunistic investor. Image source: Disney. Disney  The financial headlines when it comes to the House of Mouse tend to center around the struggles at ESPN. Millennials and older penny pinchers are cutting the cord, kissing their fat cable bills goodbye. Outside of premium movie channels, ESPN is the priciest component of the programming bundles offered by cable and satellite television providers. Disney's media networks division is big, including ABC, Disney Channel, and ESPN. It's the largest slice of the revenue-mix pie, and an even larger contributor when it comes to operating profit. However, Disney is making more with less. Media networks keeps growing at Disney, and the same can be said for its world-leading theme parks and a movie division that is dominating the box office for the third year in a row. McDonald's There was a time when the Golden Arches were starting to get rusty, but its prospects have been rosy since the introduction of all-day breakfast in late 2015 put an end to a two-year funk. Investors have been hot for McDonald's, too. The stock hit new all-time highs earlier this month, unlike Disney that's still trading 12% below the all-time high it set two summers ago. Wall Street sees the good times continuing. Last week it was Baird and Credit Suisse jacking up their price targets to $164 and $165, respectively. This morning it was Gregory Francfort at BofA/Merrill increasing his price goal from $165 to $175. Francfort sees McDonald's as one of the few restaurant brands that can increase franchisee economics through lower price points.  These aren't the best of times for the restaurant industry. Labor and occupancy costs are inching higher at a time when food costs have been stable, creating a wider value disparity between going out or eating at home. Thankfully for McDonald's the vast majority of its locations are franchisee-owned, so they're the ones fretting about the call for higher wages and escalating operating costs.  Wal-Mart The world's largest retailer by sales volume has unique advantages, making it one of the few retailers that can compete with the Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) juggernaut. Walmart stores use shrewd technology and economies of scale to keep prices low and inventory turning, passing on the savings to its shoppers through "roll-back pricing" and other aggressive price-whittling moves. Amazon may have surpassed Wal-Mart when it comes to market cap two years ago, but Wal-Mart generates more than three times the revenue as the dot-com darling. Wal-Mart isn't asleep at the internet wheel, acquiring Jet.com last year to become more competitive online. Amazon may be gaining, but it has been mostly at the expense of pricier Walmart rivals.  Battle of the brands Disney, McDonald's, and Wal-Mart have big names that aren't going anywhere, and investors are being rewarded for their patience. Disney, McDonald's, and Wal-Mart stocks yield 1.5%, 2.5%, and 2.6%, respectively.  The stocks may not seem cheap, trading between 16 and 22 times next year's profit targets. However, these are relative bargains compared to some of the lesser rivals that the market has bid up lately. Disney, McDonald's, and Wal-Mart deserve market premiums for their superior brands, and that makes them bargains even at today's elevated price levels.  Rick Munarriz owns shares of Walt Disney.

Freshman California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna and nine House co-sponsors are introducing legislation to put an end to the free ride. The Corporate Responsibility and Taxpayer Protection Act would levy a fee equivalent to the public assistance that a company’s employees are eligible to receive, with the intent to incentivize businesses to pay their employees enough so they don’t need public assistance. In 2013, Walmart alone cost taxpayers $6.2 billion for expenses such as food stamps, Medicaid, and housing assistance. One study released earlier this year estimated that taxpayers spent $152.8 billion in 2015 as a result of low wages. In an interview with The Intercept, Khanna said he introduced the bill partly to highlight the cost of low wages to those besides the employees themselves. “This also helps people focus attention on the consequences of corporate underpayment,” he told us. “The burden is not just on employees, it’s also on the taxpayer.” Walmart, meanwhile, is double-dipping in the corporate welfare. It’s able to keep wages low thanks to the benefits — a well-known phenomenon — but then it also cashes in on the other end, when those employees and others earning low wages spend their food stamps at Walmart. The company has disclosed in the past that it was the recipient of an estimated 18 percent of total food stamp spending. That’s $14 billion out of $80 billion in 2012. A bill like Khanna’s stands no real chance of passage in the current Congress, controlled by Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin on one end and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the other. But control of the House is very much in play in 2018, and the Democratic Party is being remade by a surge of enthusiasm and bottom-up challenges to the establishment. What kind of party eventually takes over is being fought over now, and bills like Khanna’s will be increasingly important as that internal struggle plays out. Walmart didn’t reply to a request for comment. Top photo: Cashiers work Christmas Eve at a Walmart in Clarkston, Wash.

Low prices, few choices: Discounters remake grocery shopping World by Candice Choi, The Associated Press Posted Jun 13, 2017 9:41 am MDT Last Updated Jun 13, 2017 at 10:20 am MDT In this Wednesday, May 31, 2017, photo, a customer approaches the entrance of an Aldi food market, in East Rutherford, N.J. Discounter Aldi, one of the no-frills European chains that offer low prices but far fewer options, and mostly its own brands, is putting the pressure on traditional grocers. Aldi expects to have 2,500 U.S. stores by the end of 2022. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) NEW YORK, N.Y. – At a Target in upper Manhattan, shoppers can pick from 19 types of ketchup, including well-known names like Heinz and Hunt’s. At the Aldi next door, the three options range from 99 cents to $1.79. All are the chain’s own brands, which doesn’t seem to bother shoppers attracted by the low prices. “If you look at the ingredients, it’s the same thing. A lot of people don’t realize that,” said Anabel Rosado, a bank supervisor who was browsing the snack aisle. Aldi and its European rival Lidl, which opens its first U.S. store this week, are hoping to change the way people shop with their smaller, no-frills stores filled mostly with house brands that tend to cost less. Whole Foods, which has fought the “Whole Paycheck” reputation, is also moving into the discount sector with an offshoot chain named after its 365 brand. The push could further pressure grocery giants like Walmart and Kroger, which are also contending with the growth potential of online grocers and have already been reining in operational costs so they can keep their prices competitive. Target is also trying to become better known for low prices as it works to boost its struggling grocery business. “We are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like our strategy,” Steve Schmitt, Walmart’s vice-president of investor relations, said in May about the growth of the European chains. Aldi, which has 1,650 U.S. locations, has been remodeling stores to have a brighter feel and plans to expand to 2,500 stores in the next five years. The expansion plans were announced as another German discount grocer, Lidl, prepares to open its first 10 U.S. stores on Thursday with plans to have 100 within a year. Already, the discounters have successfully taken market share in the U.K. grocery industry, according to Euromonitor International. There are four 365 by Whole Foods locations and 20 more in development. FAMILIAR PACKAGE, UNFAMILIAR NAME Walk into an Aldi store, and the products often come in packaging reminiscent of more popular brands. The chain’s Millville Raisin Bran is in a purple box similar to the versions made by Kellogg and Post. Its Benton’s cookies are in blue packages that resemble those of Chips Ahoy. Stocking shelves with store brands is a big part of how discounters keep costs down. Lidl also says it will have a mix of private-label brand names, which will account for 90 per cent of the products in its stores. Whole Foods offers its 365 label across a variety of categories, more akin to the approach at Trader Joe’s, which has also been steadily expanding its store count in United States. The growing popularity of store brands across the grocery industry is expected to help discounters. The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 per cent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. “They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products,” she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It’s part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn’t said how much. CHOICES, CHOICES Aldi, Lidl and 365 by Whole Foods challenge the idea that shoppers want the array of choices found at traditional supermarkets. While a standard Whole Foods may have around 30,000 products, a 365 store has about 8,000, which helps keep down overall operational costs. How wide the selection is can vary by item. Since people tend to be more particular about yogurt, the company says 365 may offer just as many choices as the average Whole Foods store. Jeff Turnas, head of 365 by Whole Foods, said the stores can cater to people who want to do their shopping more quickly. “We have tried to make the decision-making faster, easier,” Turnas says. Aldi U.S. CEO Jason Hart also says his chain is deliberate about where it wants to offer more variety. He said people can find whatever products they might get at rival grocers, but there might just be fewer options within each category. He said people prefer that because too many choices “just add confusion.” “Our format of retailing and our format of shopping is becoming more accepted in the mainstream,” Hart said. For now, Kantar Retail estimates that the discounter category, which includes Aldi, Trader Joe’s and dollar stores, has 6 per cent of U.S. grocery sales. By 2021, it expects that figure to inch up to 8 per cent. Walmart says the scope of its offerings — including its pharmacy and options like in-store pickup for online orders — sets it apart from the competition. The retailer notes it has been working on keeping prices down and that its customer traffic is up. Kurt Jetta, CEO of consulting firm Tabs Analytics, also said big-box retailers have the advantage of being able to draw a wider swath of shoppers by offering greater variety. Still, he said Aldi and Lidl might have more appeal than dollar stores with middle-income customers, in line with places like Trader Joe’s. “They don’t have the stigma attached to them,” Jetta said. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Movie Trailers June 16, 2017 to June 22, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 The Mummy (14A) 3D: 7:15p 2D: 1:00p/ 10:15p Baywatch (14A) 2D: 6:00p / 9:20p  Pirates of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (PG) 3D: 10:00p 2D: 6:45p Captain Underpants (PG) 2D: 6:15p / 9:50p Wonder Woman (PG) 3D: 9:35p 2D: 6:30p Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (PG) 2D: 7:00pm / 10:20pm 660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL Pilot uninjured in plane crash near Ponoka Just moments ago A ballgame of unity, spirit, friendly rivalry, won by Dems 40 minutes ago Crooked Hill Road exit sign altered to read Crooked Hillary Jun 15, 2017, 9:24 PM Trump to announce plan to stop cash flow to Cuban military Jun 15, 2017, 9:15 PM About 4,000 more US troops to go to Afghanistan Jun 15, 2017, 9:06 PM US to send almost 4,000 troops to Afghanistan Jun 15, 2017, 9:02 PM The Thursday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories Jun 15, 2017, 3:29 PM Crashes and gunfire in two-hour, 100-kilometre police chase in southern Alberta Jun 15, 2017, 3:26 PM Calgary man accused of filming women, posting images on Twitter granted bail Jun 15, 2017, 2:52 PM Libs pare rules changes to basics, won't formalize PMs question period Jun 15, 2017, 2:52 PM Former RCMP employee alleging sexual assault tells court she has PTSD Jun 15, 2017, 2:39 PM Montreal's oldest urban stable torn down, advocates promise to rebuild Jun 15, 2017, 2:20 PM BUSINESS SPORTSNET OIL & GAS ENTERTAINMENT Morneau warns government won't accept Senate changes to budget bill Jun 15, 2017, 3:26 PM Most actively traded companies on the TSX Jun 15, 2017, 3:10 PM Teck Resources lowers steelmaking coal price guidance after sales disruption Jun 15, 2017, 2:16 PM Evraz workers in Calgary vote to strike during contract negotiations Jun 15, 2017, 1:43 PM Husky Energy hired Natural Resource Minister Jim Carr's former chief of staff Jun 15, 2017, 1:12 PM Jonathan Drouin trade likely means more coming from Canadiens’ Bergevin Jun 15, 2017, 9:12 PM Analyzing what Jonathan Drouin adds to the Canadiens’ lineup Jun 15, 2017, 5:02 PM Kings’ Drew Doughty could ‘test the waters’ in 2019 free agency Jun 15, 2017, 8:18 PM Canadiens sign Jonathan Drouin to six-year contract extension after trade Jun 15, 2017, 5:53 PM Twitter Reaction: Canadiens make a big splash by acquiring Drouin Jun 15, 2017, 4:17 PM Environmental groups concerned pipeline project will increase tanker traffic Jul 26, 2016, 8:20 AM Oil prices poised to slide, crude glut continues Jul 26, 2016, 7:33 AM "Distasteful" ad prompts Canada Action to further distance itself from former volunteer Jul 25, 2016, 2:35 PM Oil spill forces Prince Albert to shutdown water intake Jul 25, 2016, 10:11 AM ConocoPhillips Canada plans to cut upwards of 300 staff, mostly in Calgary Jul 22, 2016, 1:01 PM PUBLISHERS WEEKLY Bestsellers Jun 15, 2017, 2:48 PM YouTube star charged with child porn ordered to stay offline Jun 15, 2017, 2:35 PM Czech sculptor Olbram Zoubek dies at age 91 Jun 15, 2017, 2:34 PM Margaret Atwood to get literary lifetime achievement award Jun 15, 2017, 2:07 PM US show of Saudi art aims to share ideas, test perceptions Jun 15, 2017, 1:55 PM Home About Us Contact Us Breaking News Alerts Advertise with us Advertise with us Privacy Policy Ad Choices Terms of Service 9912 Franklin Ave, Fort McMurray, Alberta T9H 2K5 © 2016-2017 Rogers Media.

The cantaloupe development is a part of a push by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon to boost the retailer's produce department.  (Jason Ivester / The Associated Press)   By Matthew BoyleBloomberg Tues., June 13, 2017 NEW YORK—Not even Walmart likes the cantaloupes it sells in winter. “They’re engineered to make a 3,000-mile trip, so they look good but taste like a piece of wood,’’ said Shawn Baldwin, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s senior vice-president for produce and global food sourcing. “So we said, ‘Wouldn’t it be nice to have that summer melon taste in the fall?’” Walmart says it typically sells 10 times more cantaloupes in June, when it can buy from U.S. farms, than it does in December, when the melons are grown farther south. Most retailers don’t have the mojo to do anything about it. But Walmart is the biggest U.S. grocer. If it wants to sell a cantaloupe off-season that tastes as sweet and juicy as in summer — and keeps it a step ahead of discount competitors nipping at its heels — it gets to. The retailer teamed up with seed experts at German agriculture giant Bayer AG to help develop a bespoke melon that’s pleasing to the palate but still tough enough for the trek from warmer climes. Article Continued Below Walmart considered more than 100 varieties of seeds and tested 20. Walmart employees spent six months grading the cantaloupes on attributes like flavour, texture and aroma. Read more:Canadian traditional grocers see slowing market share loss to Costco, Walmart Walmart had “a scientific, focused approach,” said Matthew DeCeault of Bayer Vegetable Seeds in California. The winner was dubbed the Sweet Spark, after the yellow sunburst in Walmart’s logo. The designer cantaloupes are available in 200 U.S. stores with a full rollout planned for fall. Sweet Spark is not genetically modified. “I hate the name, but that’s what the employees picked,” said Baldwin, who preferred the name Winter Wonder. The new cantaloupe is as much as 40-per-cent sweeter than Walmart’s current winter melons, according to the so-called Brix scale, which measures sugar content. It’s “very rare” for a retailer to invest in the exclusive development of a new variety of fruit, according to Rabobank International produce analyst Roland Fumasi, though growers often cultivate new breeds and offer them to a retailer for a short period.  For now, Walmart has exclusive rights to sell Sweet Spark. The company will try to negotiate a long-term arrangement with Bayer. If that falls through, it’s possible the cantaloupe variety could be sold at rival retailers. Sweet Spark is part of a push by chief executive officer Doug McMillon to boost Walmart’s produce department, which is the first thing shoppers see when they enter the store. Customers who buy fruits and vegetables spend 55-per-cent more on their trips, according to data tracker Nielsen. “In today’s saturated market, retailers need to find ways to stand out,” said Matt Lally, manager of Nielsen’s Fresh Growth and Strategy team. Walmart is doing all it can to keep grocery rivals at bay. For now, at least, a juicy ripe cantaloupe in the dead of U.S. winter isn’t something easily delivered by Amazon.com Inc. The world’s biggest internet retailer is pushing into the grocery business and chasing Walmart’s lower-income shoppers. But it can’t match its global food supply chain. Produce is a key weapon in Walmart’s battle against Europe-based deep-discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded into the U.S. with prices on packaged foods, like soup and cereal, that often beat Walmart’s. Up next: tomatoes. Walmart’s Baldwin said he wants to replicate the blend of sweetness and acidity in the San Marzano variety of Naples, Italy. “When you’re as big as Walmart, you can dictate a lot of what you want to see in produce,” said Kent Bradford, a professor and director of the Seed Biotechnology Center at the University of California at Davis.

At the Aldi next door, the three options range from 99 cents to $1.79. All are the chain's own brands, which doesn't seem to bother shoppers attracted by the low prices. "If you look at the ingredients, it's the same thing. A lot of people don't realize that," said Anabel Rosado, a bank supervisor who was browsing the snack aisle. In this Wednesday, May 31, 2017, photo, a customer approaches the entrance of an Aldi food market, in East Rutherford, N.J. Discounter Aldi, one of the no-frills European chains that offer low prices but far fewer options, and mostly its own brands, is putting the pressure on traditional grocers. Aldi expects to have 2,500 U.S. stores by the end of 2022. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez) Aldi and its European rival Lidl, which opens its first U.S. store this week, are hoping to change the way people shop with their smaller, no-frills stores filled mostly with house brands that tend to cost less. Whole Foods, which has fought the "Whole Paycheck" reputation, is also moving into the discount sector with an offshoot chain named after its 365 brand. The push could further pressure grocery giants like Walmart and Kroger, which are also contending with the growth potential of online grocers and have already been reining in operational costs so they can keep their prices competitive. Target is also trying to become better known for low prices as it works to boost its struggling grocery business. "We are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like our strategy," Steve Schmitt, Walmart's vice-president of investor relations, said in May about the growth of the European chains. Aldi, which has 1,650 U.S. locations, has been remodeling stores to have a brighter feel and plans to expand to 2,500 stores in the next five years. The expansion plans were announced as another German discount grocer, Lidl, prepares to open its first 10 U.S. stores on Thursday with plans to have 100 within a year. Already, the discounters have successfully taken market share in the U.K. grocery industry, according to Euromonitor International. There are four 365 by Whole Foods locations and 20 more in development. FAMILIAR PACKAGE, UNFAMILIAR NAME Walk into an Aldi store, and the products often come in packaging reminiscent of more popular brands. The chain's Millville Raisin Bran is in a purple box similar to the versions made by Kellogg and Post. Its Benton's cookies are in blue packages that resemble those of Chips Ahoy. Stocking shelves with store brands is a big part of how discounters keep costs down. Lidl also says it will have a mix of private-label brand names, which will account for 90 per cent of the products in its stores. Whole Foods offers its 365 label across a variety of categories, more akin to the approach at Trader Joe's, which has also been steadily expanding its store count in United States. The growing popularity of store brands across the grocery industry is expected to help discounters. The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 per cent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. "They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products," she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It's part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn't said how much.

The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 percent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. "They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products," she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It's part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn't said how much. CHOICES, CHOICES Aldi, Lidl and 365 by Whole Foods challenge the idea that shoppers want the array of choices found at traditional supermarkets. While a standard Whole Foods may have around 30,000 products, a 365 store has about 8,000, which helps keep down overall operational costs. How wide the selection is can vary by item. Since people tend to be more particular about yogurt, the company says 365 may offer just as many choices as the average Whole Foods store. Jeff Turnas, head of 365 by Whole Foods, said the stores can cater to people who want to do their shopping more quickly. "We have tried to make the decision-making faster, easier," Turnas says. Aldi U.S. CEO Jason Hart also says his chain is deliberate about where it wants to offer more variety. He said people can find whatever products they might get at rival grocers, but there might just be fewer options within each category. He said people prefer that because too many choices "just add confusion." "Our format of retailing and our format of shopping is becoming more accepted in the mainstream," Hart said. For now, Kantar Retail estimates that the discounter category, which includes Aldi, Trader Joe's and dollar stores, has 6 percent of U.S. grocery sales. By 2021, it expects that figure to inch up to 8 percent. Walmart says the scope of its offerings — including its pharmacy and options like in-store pickup for online orders — sets it apart from the competition. The retailer notes it has been working on keeping prices down and that its customer traffic is up. Kurt Jetta, CEO of consulting firm Tabs Analytics, also said big-box retailers have the advantage of being able to draw a wider swath of shoppers by offering greater variety. Still, he said Aldi and Lidl might have more appeal than dollar stores with middle-income customers, in line with places like Trader Joe's. "They don't have the stigma attached to them," Jetta said. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara) NEW YORK • At a Target in upper Manhattan, shoppers can pick from 19 types of ketchup, including well-known names like Heinz and Hunt's. At the Aldi next door, the three options range from 99 cents to $1.79. All are the chain's own brands, which doesn't seem to bother shoppers attracted by the low prices. "If you look at the ingredients, it's the same thing. A lot of people don't realize that," said Anabel Rosado, a bank supervisor who was browsing the snack aisle. Aldi and its European rival Lidl, which opens its first U.S. store this week, are hoping to change the way people shop with their smaller, no-frills stores filled mostly with house brands that tend to cost less. Whole Foods, which has fought the "Whole Paycheck" reputation, is also moving into the discount sector with an offshoot chain named after its 365 brand. The push could further pressure grocery giants like Walmart and Kroger, which are also contending with the growth potential of online grocers and have already been reining in operational costs so they can keep their prices competitive. Target is also trying to become better known for low prices as it works to boost its struggling grocery business. "We are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like our strategy," Steve Schmitt, Walmart's vice president of investor relations, said in May about the growth of the European chains. Aldi, which has 1,650 U.S. locations, has been remodeling stores to have a brighter feel and plans to expand to 2,500 stores in the next five years. The expansion plans were announced as another German discount grocer, Lidl, prepares to open its first nine U.S. stores on Thursday with plans to have 100 within a year. Already, the discounters have successfully taken market share in the U.K. grocery industry, according to Euromonitor International. There are four 365 by Whole Foods locations and 20 more in development. Familiar package, unfamiliar name   Walk into an Aldi store, and the products often come in packaging reminiscent of more popular brands. The chain's Millville Raisin Bran is in a purple box similar to the versions made by Kellogg and Post. Its Benton's cookies are in blue packages that resemble those of Chips Ahoy. Stocking shelves with store brands is a big part of how discounters keep costs down. Lidl also says it will have a mix of private-label brand names, which will account for 90 percent of the products in its stores. Whole Foods offers its 365 label across a variety of categories, more akin to the approach at Trader Joe's, which has also been steadily expanding its store count in United States. The growing popularity of store brands across the grocery industry is expected to help discounters. The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 percent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. "They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products," she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It's part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn't said how much. Choices, choices Aldi, Lidl and 365 by Whole Foods challenge the idea that shoppers want the array of choices found at traditional supermarkets. While a standard Whole Foods may have around 30,000 products, a 365 store has about 8,000, which helps keep down overall operational costs. How wide the selection is can vary by item. Since people tend to be more particular about yogurt, the company says 365 may offer just as many choices as the average Whole Foods store.

Check our People in Business Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Jeff Turnas, head of 365 by Whole Foods, said the stores can cater to people who want to do their shopping more quickly. "We have tried to make the decision-making faster, easier," Turnas says. Aldi U.S. CEO Jason Hart also says his chain is deliberate about where it wants to offer more variety. He said people can find whatever products they might get at rival grocers, but there might just be fewer options within each category. He said people prefer that because too many choices "just add confusion." "Our format of retailing and our format of shopping is becoming more accepted in the mainstream," Hart said. For now, Kantar Retail estimates that the discounter category, which includes Aldi, Trader Joe's and dollar stores, has 6 percent of U.S. grocery sales. By 2021, it expects that figure to inch up to 8 percent. Walmart says the scope of its offerings — including its pharmacy and options like in-store pickup for online orders — sets it apart from the competition. The retailer notes it has been working on keeping prices down and that its customer traffic is up. Kurt Jetta, CEO of consulting firm Tabs Analytics, also said big-box retailers have the advantage of being able to draw a wider swath of shoppers by offering greater variety. Still, he said Aldi and Lidl might have more appeal than dollar stores with middle-income customers, in line with places like Trader Joe's. "They don't have the stigma attached to them," Jetta said.

Candice Choi AP Photo Business June 13, 2017 11:31 AM Low prices, few choices: Discounters remake grocery shopping By CANDICE CHOI AP Food Industry Writer LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK At a Target in upper Manhattan, shoppers can pick from 19 types of ketchup, including well-known names like Heinz and Hunt's. At the Aldi next door, the three options range from 99 cents to $1.79. All are the chain's own brands, which doesn't seem to bother shoppers attracted by the low prices. "If you look at the ingredients, it's the same thing. A lot of people don't realize that," said Anabel Rosado, a bank supervisor who was browsing the snack aisle. Aldi and its European rival Lidl, which opens its first U.S. store this week, are hoping to change the way people shop with their smaller, no-frills stores filled mostly with house brands that tend to cost less. Whole Foods, which has fought the "Whole Paycheck" reputation, is also moving into the discount sector with an offshoot chain named after its 365 brand. The push could further pressure grocery giants like Walmart and Kroger, which are also contending with the growth potential of online grocers and have already been reining in operational costs so they can keep their prices competitive. Target is also trying to become better known for low prices as it works to boost its struggling grocery business. "We are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like our strategy," Steve Schmitt, Walmart's vice president of investor relations, said in May about the growth of the European chains. Aldi, which has 1,650 U.S. locations, has been remodeling stores to have a brighter feel and plans to expand to 2,500 stores in the next five years. The expansion plans were announced as another German discount grocer, Lidl, prepares to open its first 10 U.S. stores on Thursday with plans to have 100 within a year. Already, the discounters have successfully taken market share in the U.K. grocery industry, according to Euromonitor International. There are four 365 by Whole Foods locations and 20 more in development. FAMILIAR PACKAGE, UNFAMILIAR NAME Walk into an Aldi store, and the products often come in packaging reminiscent of more popular brands. The chain's Millville Raisin Bran is in a purple box similar to the versions made by Kellogg and Post. Its Benton's cookies are in blue packages that resemble those of Chips Ahoy. Stocking shelves with store brands is a big part of how discounters keep costs down. Lidl also says it will have a mix of private-label brand names, which will account for 90 percent of the products in its stores. Whole Foods offers its 365 label across a variety of categories, more akin to the approach at Trader Joe's, which has also been steadily expanding its store count in United States. The growing popularity of store brands across the grocery industry is expected to help discounters. The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 percent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. "They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products," she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It's part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn't said how much. CHOICES, CHOICES Aldi, Lidl and 365 by Whole Foods challenge the idea that shoppers want the array of choices found at traditional supermarkets. While a standard Whole Foods may have around 30,000 products, a 365 store has about 8,000, which helps keep down overall operational costs. How wide the selection is can vary by item. Since people tend to be more particular about yogurt, the company says 365 may offer just as many choices as the average Whole Foods store. Jeff Turnas, head of 365 by Whole Foods, said the stores can cater to people who want to do their shopping more quickly. "We have tried to make the decision-making faster, easier," Turnas says. Aldi U.S. CEO Jason Hart also says his chain is deliberate about where it wants to offer more variety. He said people can find whatever products they might get at rival grocers, but there might just be fewer options within each category. He said people prefer that because too many choices "just add confusion." "Our format of retailing and our format of shopping is becoming more accepted in the mainstream," Hart said. For now, Kantar Retail estimates that the discounter category, which includes Aldi, Trader Joe's and dollar stores, has 6 percent of U.S. grocery sales. By 2021, it expects that figure to inch up to 8 percent. Walmart says the scope of its offerings — including its pharmacy and options like in-store pickup for online orders — sets it apart from the competition. The retailer notes it has been working on keeping prices down and that its customer traffic is up. Kurt Jetta, CEO of consulting firm Tabs Analytics, also said big-box retailers have the advantage of being able to draw a wider swath of shoppers by offering greater variety. Still, he said Aldi and Lidl might have more appeal than dollar stores with middle-income customers, in line with places like Trader Joe's. "They don't have the stigma attached to them," Jetta said.

A photo of some of the evidence includes clothes, electronics and household items. (Courtesy | Three Rivers Police Department) By Brad Devereaux THREE RIVERS, MI -- Police called to a retail fraud report at Wal-Mart found suspected stolen items and meth inside a vehicle, arresting one man.  About 1:38 a.m. Tuesday, June 13, Three Rivers Police Department officers were called to Wal-Mart near the intersection of Millard and U.S. 131 for a retail fraud in progress.  Suspects fled in a car that police located nearby, the Three Rivers Police Department reports. The number of suspects involved in the retail fraud case is currently under investigation, police said.  Officers suspected narcotics were in the car and deployed K9 Jake. The dog alerted on the exterior of the car, police said, and officers found methamphetamine, scales, and paraphernalia inside. Police also found about $1,000 worth of merchandise suspected to be stolen from area stores.  Police arrested a 25-year-old Elkhart man and he was lodged at the S. Joseph County Jail on possession of methamphetamine and driving without a license, police said. Charges will be sought for possession of stolen property and retail fraud once the items are confirmed to be stolen, police said.  Some of the items had been claimed by an area retailer Tuesday morning, police said.  The St. Joseph County Sheriff's Office assisted the Three Rivers Police Department.  View Comments About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 MLive Media Group.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Here's Why the Best Is Yet to Come for Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The company has been gaining on a key rival thanks to one major move it made. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jun 13, 2017 at 10:41AM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has struggled during the so-called retail apocalypse. The chain never found itself in the same dire straits that some of its rivals did, but for a period it was reasonable to wonder if Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was going to be able to take a meaningful piece of its business. That's still a risk, but it's much less of one since Wal-Mart spent $3.3 billion buying Jet.com. That deal was incredibly rich -- probably more than the company had to pay to buy a money-losing start-up with around $1 billion in sales -- but Wal-Mart got something very important for its billions: Jet.com CEO Marc Lore. The serial entrepreneur, who previously sold Quidsi to Amazon, now runs Wal-Mart's entire digital operation. That's very good news for Wal-Mart shareholders, as Lore has injected start-up thinking into a mature company. That has already shown some payoff for the company, as it reported a 63% gain in online sales in Q1 2018, which the company said was mostly organic through Walmart.com. Wal-Mart is improving its internal flexibility to deliver digital orders. Image source: Wal-Mart. What has changed at Wal-Mart? Before Lore came on board, Wal-Mart was a bricks-and-mortar retailer that also had a website. It used store-first thinking that crippled its efforts to grow its digital presence. As the new e-commerce boss, Lore made the public change of scrapping the company's $50-a-year Amazon Prime knockoff, ShippingPass. That program, despite being half the price of Prime, wasn't working, and Lore made the bold choice to offer free shipping on any order of eligible items over $35. That deal may not entice many Amazon customers to switch, especially because Prime has over 50 million eligible items while WalMart.com has only about 2 million. It will, however, give Wal-Mart's customers a reason to use its website rather than Amazon. The biggest change Lore has made, however, is a top-to-bottom overhaul of how Wal-Mart thinks and how it organizes its operation. He had worked, with the support of CEO Doug McMillon, to revamp the company's supply lines and change its in-store system to facilitate shipping online orders, in-store-pickup, and store-based returns for online orders. "We're transforming to become more of a digital enterprise," McMillion said during the Q1 earnings call. "The change is starting to be visible to our customers as they use online grocery, Walmart Pay, Scan & Go at Sam's Club, and our Walmart app to skip the line when using our pharmacies and financial services in our U.S. stores." Why is this important for Wal-Mart? While Wal-Mart was never in danger of going out of business if it hadn't addressed its digital problem, it would have struggled to grow. By offering a viable alternative to Amazon, the company quite simply raises its ceiling, giving it more customers it can reach. That's something Amazon has clearly noticed, as the online leader recently lowered the price of Prime for lower-income customers from $99 a year to $5.99 a month with no long-term commitment. The program requires a valid electronic benefits transfer card to qualify for the discounted membership, and it certainly seems like a way to counteract Wal-Mart's efforts. This won't be easy The presence of Lore, who has shown he knows how to take on Amazon, gives Wal-Mart a chance, but it's not going to be a steady ride. Offering free shipping may win customers, but it hurts margin. Amazon has shown a willingness to make that sort of sacrifice, and if Wal-Mart does the same, it may suffer short-term pain to build long-term success.  Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Wilkes-Barre Township police say some shoppers noticed something very disturbing in the Walmart parking lot: a young child sleeping inside a vehicle with no one else with him. "That's crazy, should not be happening. Take your kid with you," said Carrie Modzelewski of Wilkes-Barre. They called 911. Police, EMS, and the township's fire department all responded. "When we got there, there was a little boy in the back seat," said Capt. Clyde Moyer with Wilkes-Barre Township Fire Department. "We were getting ready to pop the door open when the mom came out of Walmart." According to police, Rachel Johnson of Mountain Top told officers that her 3-year-old son was sleeping when she and her three other children got to Walmart around 3:30 p.m. Monday. Not wanting to wake the child, she and the other children went inside the store. "You leave them in the car, anybody can come and grab them," said one shopper who didn't want to give her name. "I take my grandchildren shopping and when they say, 'I'm not going in that store.' I say, 'Yes, you are, if I have to carry you in there.'" Johnson told officers she locked the vehicle and used the remote start function to allow the vehicle to run with the air conditioning on. However, police say vehicles started that way will shut off after 10 minutes. Johnson says she was in the store for a total of 20 minutes. People say with the soaring temperatures, they can't understand what she was thinking. "It's like what, 90 something degrees out, right?" said Ed Urban from Glen Lyon. "On a day like today, it's so horribly hot out," said Margeret Burke from Nanticoke. "It wouldn't be great to leave a 3 year old alone anywhere." "I wouldn't leave my dog in my car on a winter day, let alone my child on a hot summer day," said Bobbie Higgs from Nanticoke. The child was determined to be fine after being checked out by paramedics. Police say Johnson has been cited for leaving a child unattended and a referral has been made to Luzerne County Children and Youth. WNEP TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider   Welcome, {username} Profile | Login Fox News U.S. Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air ECONOMY Low prices, few choices: Discounters remake grocery shopping By CANDICE CHOI Published June 13, 2017 Associated Press Facebook Twitter Email Print NEW YORK –  At a Target in upper Manhattan, shoppers can pick from 19 types of ketchup, including well-known names like Heinz and Hunt's. At the Aldi next door, the three options range from 99 cents to $1.79. All are the chain's own brands, which doesn't seem to bother shoppers attracted by the low prices. "If you look at the ingredients, it's the same thing. A lot of people don't realize that," said Anabel Rosado, a bank supervisor who was browsing the snack aisle. Aldi and its European rival Lidl, which opens its first U.S. store this week, are hoping to change the way people shop with their smaller, no-frills stores filled mostly with house brands that tend to cost less. Whole Foods, which has fought the "Whole Paycheck" reputation, is also moving into the discount sector with an offshoot chain named after its 365 brand. The push could further pressure grocery giants like Walmart and Kroger, which are also contending with the growth potential of online grocers and have already been reining in operational costs so they can keep their prices competitive. Target is also trying to become better known for low prices as it works to boost its struggling grocery business. "We are certainly aware, paying a lot of attention, have a lot of respect, but we like our strategy," Steve Schmitt, Walmart's vice president of investor relations, said in May about the growth of the European chains. Aldi, which has 1,650 U.S. locations, has been remodeling stores to have a brighter feel and plans to expand to 2,500 stores in the next five years. The expansion plans were announced as another German discount grocer, Lidl, prepares to open its first 10 U.S. stores on Thursday with plans to have 100 within a year. Already, the discounters have successfully taken market share in the U.K. grocery industry, according to Euromonitor International. There are four 365 by Whole Foods locations and 20 more in development. FAMILIAR PACKAGE, UNFAMILIAR NAME Walk into an Aldi store, and the products often come in packaging reminiscent of more popular brands. The chain's Millville Raisin Bran is in a purple box similar to the versions made by Kellogg and Post. Its Benton's cookies are in blue packages that resemble those of Chips Ahoy. Stocking shelves with store brands is a big part of how discounters keep costs down. Lidl also says it will have a mix of private-label brand names, which will account for 90 percent of the products in its stores. Whole Foods offers its 365 label across a variety of categories, more akin to the approach at Trader Joe's, which has also been steadily expanding its store count in United States. The growing popularity of store brands across the grocery industry is expected to help discounters. The trend is partly because supermarkets have stepped up their own private-label offerings in recent years to control costs. Late last year, Kroger said its store brands reached 29 percent of items sold. Diana Sheehan, director of retail insights at consulting firm Kantar Retail, said more people turned to store brands during the recession. "They have gotten comfortable and started to embrace higher-quality private-label products," she said. Another difference at Aldi and Lidl: Presentation. The stores tend to have fewer aisles than usual U.S. supermarkets, and products are often stocked on the shelves in the boxes they arrived in. It's part of how they keep prices down. At Aldi, shoppers are also expected to bring their own bags unless they want to pay 10 cents for a plastic bag or 7 cents for a paper one. Lidl also said it will charge for bags, but hasn't said how much. CHOICES, CHOICES Aldi, Lidl and 365 by Whole Foods challenge the idea that shoppers want the array of choices found at traditional supermarkets. While a standard Whole Foods may have around 30,000 products, a 365 store has about 8,000, which helps keep down overall operational costs. How wide the selection is can vary by item. Since people tend to be more particular about yogurt, the company says 365 may offer just as many choices as the average Whole Foods store. Jeff Turnas, head of 365 by Whole Foods, said the stores can cater to people who want to do their shopping more quickly. "We have tried to make the decision-making faster, easier," Turnas says. Aldi U.S. CEO Jason Hart also says his chain is deliberate about where it wants to offer more variety. He said people can find whatever products they might get at rival grocers, but there might just be fewer options within each category. He said people prefer that because too many choices "just add confusion." "Our format of retailing and our format of shopping is becoming more accepted in the mainstream," Hart said. For now, Kantar Retail estimates that the discounter category, which includes Aldi, Trader Joe's and dollar stores, has 6 percent of U.S. grocery sales. By 2021, it expects that figure to inch up to 8 percent. Walmart says the scope of its offerings — including its pharmacy and options like in-store pickup for online orders — sets it apart from the competition. The retailer notes it has been working on keeping prices down and that its customer traffic is up. Kurt Jetta, CEO of consulting firm Tabs Analytics, also said big-box retailers have the advantage of being able to draw a wider swath of shoppers by offering greater variety. Still, he said Aldi and Lidl might have more appeal than dollar stores with middle-income customers, in line with places like Trader Joe's. "They don't have the stigma attached to them," Jetta said. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Advertisement Trending in US Hero homeowner holds escaped Georgia inmates at gunpoint until arrests Otto Warmbier has extensive brain damage, doctor says New York Times forced to correct editorial after Scalise shooting Georgia manhunt: Escaped inmates accused of killing guards arrested in Tennessee North Carolina receives shocking $100 million charge on water bill Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

Walmart however has put the still emerging technology to use in its training academies to help onboard managers and associates and give them some “hands-on” experience in a lab setting. Walmart has been piloting a solution from STRIVR Labs at a limited number of its training academies for the past few months, and based off of the success of the test will be rolling out the solution to all 200 of its training facilities by the end of 2017. “Imagine you’re a new Walmart store manager and you’ve never experienced a Black Friday,” Beth Harris wrote on Walmart’s blog. “Wouldn’t it be helpful to understand the dynamics of such a busy day before you ever had to actually manage your associates and customers through it? “We incorporated VR into 30 academies and we used it to train our associates to handle situations from the everyday, like managing the fresh area, to the rare, like Black Friday.” New associates, recently promoted associates and managers all attend Walmart’s Academy program. It is estimated that about 140,000 employees per year will utilize the VR headsets for training. “From our test, we’ve seen that associates who go through VR training retain what they’ve learned in those situations better than those who haven’t,” Harris wrote. For more information on how Walmart is leveraging VR to train associates watch the short Walmart-produced video above.

Customers can visit here or use the Walmart Grocery app to place an order, using their zip code to select a local Walmart store.  You can create your own grocery list and select a time that is convenient for you to pick up the order.  Once you arrive at the store, there are reserved spots for online customers to park. A Walmart employee will come out and load your groceries into your vehicle.  "At Walmart, we have always been known for saving our customers money, and with services like grocery pickup, we are also saving them valuable time," said Aimee Chafins, manager of the Walmart in Perrysburg. "Our customers have told us that grocery pickup is a game-changer. They are now able to complete their grocery shopping in a matter of minutes, between errands or on their way home from an after-school activity, without even unbuckling their seat belts." Walmart's grocery pickup service features 30,000 items.  Below is a list of local stores participating in the online pickup service: Walmart Supercenter, 10392 Freemont Pike, Perrysburg Walmart Supercenter, 5821 West Central Avenue, Toledo Walmart Supercenter, 485 Airport Highway, Wauseon Follow WTOL:   Download our app here.  Copyright 2017 WTOL.

Most retailers don’t have the mojo to do anything about it. But Wal-Mart is the biggest U.S. grocer. If it wants to sell a cantaloupe off-season that tastes as sweet and juicy as in summer -- and keeps it a step ahead of discount competitors nipping at its heels -- it gets to. The retailer teamed up with seed experts at German agriculture giant Bayer AG to help develop a bespoke melon that’s pleasing to the palate but still tough enough for the trek from warmer climes. Wal-Mart considered more than 100 varieties of seeds and tested 20. Wal-Mart employees spent six months grading the cantaloupes on attributes like flavor, texture and aroma. Wal-Mart had “a scientific, focused approach,’’ said Matthew DeCeault of Bayer Vegetable Seeds in California. Sweet Spark The winner was dubbed the Sweet Spark, after the yellow sunburst in Wal-Mart’s logo. The designer cantaloupes are available in 200 U.S. stores with a full roll-out planned for fall. Sweet Spark is not genetically modified. “I hate the name but that’s what the employees picked,’’ said Baldwin, who preferred Winter Wonder. The new cantaloupe is as much as 40 percent sweeter than Wal-Mart’s current winter melons, according to the so-called Brix scale, which measures sugar content. It’s “very rare” for a retailer to invest in the exclusive development of a new variety of fruit, according to Rabobank International produce analyst Roland Fumasi, though growers often cultivate new breeds and offer them to a retailer for a short period.  For now, Wal-Mart has exclusive rights to sell Sweet Spark. The company will try to negotiate a long-term arrangement with Bayer. If that falls through, it’s possible the cantaloupe variety could be sold at rival retailers. Boosting Produce Sweet Spark is part of a push by Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon to boost Wal-Mart’s produce department, which is the first thing shoppers see when they enter the store. Customers who buy fruits and vegetables spend 55 percent more on their trips, according to data tracker Nielsen. “In today’s saturated market, retailers need to find ways to stand out,” said Matt Lally, manager of Nielsen’s Fresh Growth and Strategy team. Wal-Mart is doing all it can to keep grocery rivals at bay. For now, at least, a juicy ripe cantaloupe in the dead of U.S. winter isn’t something easily delivered by Amazon.com Inc. The world’s biggest internet retailer is pushing into the grocery business and chasing Wal-Mart’s lower-income shoppers. But it can’t match its global food supply chain. Produce is a key weapon in Wal-Mart’s battle against Europe-based deep-discount chains Aldi and Lidl, which have expanded into the U.S. with prices on packaged foods, like soup and cereal, that often beat Wal-Mart’s. Up next: tomatoes. Wal-Mart’s Baldwin said he wants to replicate the blend of sweetness and acidity in the San Marzano variety of Naples, Italy. “When you’re as big as Wal-Mart, you can dictate a lot of what you want to see in produce,’’ said Kent Bradford, a professor and director of the Seed Biotechnology Center at the University of California at Davis.

Aldi, a Germany-based chain whose supermarkets offer deep discounts on a selected assortment of groceries, announced big expansion plans Monday, saying it will spend $3.4 billion to enlarge its chain to 2,500 stores nationwide by the end of 2022. That’s up from the current tally of 1,600 stores across 35 states, which Aldi has quietly amassed since it first entered the US in 1976. Aldi says the planned growth spurt will make it the third-biggest US supermarket behind Walmart and Kroger, serving 100 million customers per month. Walmart, which currently is the No. 1 player in the $800 billion US grocery market, with a 17 percent chunk of the total, will have to invest $3 billion to $5 billion over the next five years to maintain the lowest grocery prices. That’s according to Brittain Ladd, who has advised retailers — including Amazon — on strategy, supply-chain management and groceries. He has also has been studying Aldi since 2008. “Aldi is gunning for prices 21 percent below competitors in the US,” Ladd told The Post, saying his big-dollar spending estimate is what will be required for Walmart to “defend market share” in groceries. Aldi sells mainly private-label groceries and focuses on the top 20 percent of supermarket product lines that generate 80 percent of sales, according to Ladd. As such, Aldi stores average just 12,000 square feet, versus 50,000 square feet and up for traditional US supermarkets like Kroger. “A weakness in its discounter model is that they sell many fewer items than traditional grocery stores, requiring customers to shop at more than one retailer for all of their grocery needs,” he notes. Nevertheless, Ladd says that, when he worked for Amazon, he stressed the importance that the Seattle-based Web giant’s AmazonFresh grocery unit not underestimate Aldi. An Aldi spokeswoman told The Post that the chain “will continue to innovate” its product offerings, with plans that include more organic groceries. A similar German discount supermarket chain called Lidl has announced it is opening the first of 100 US stores this week, promising prices as much as 50 percent lower than the competition’s. Presently, Aldi does not handle food deliveries, but that could change soon, Ladd asserted. “I expect that Aldi will invest in e-commerce and duplicate their discount models online at some point in the near future,” he said. Walmart declined to comment, and Aldi did not return calls.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Better Buy: Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. vs. Amazon.com Wal-Mart is focusing on e-commerce, but is it a better bet than Amazon? Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Jun 12, 2017 at 9:38PM Don't look now, but Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) online sales grew faster than Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) last quarter. Wal-Mart reported a 63% increase in U.S. online sales last quarter, while Amazon managed just 24% growth year over year. Many point to Wal-Mart's acquisitions of Jet.com, Modcloth, Moosejaw, Shoebuy, and several other small e-tailers as the basis for its growth. But management says the majority of the growth stems from Walmart.com. Of course, most of Wal-Mart's sales come from its physical stores. Wal-Mart's total revenue increased just 1.4% in the first quarter but was more than three times as much as Amazon's. Meanwhile, Amazon has a market cap nearly twice as much as Wal-Mart's. So which makes a better buy for investors? Image source: Wal-Mart Wal-Mart is suddenly all about e-commerce Online shopping is an undeniable megatrend. E-commerce sales in the U.S. increased nearly 15% last quarter while brick-and-mortar sales increased less than 3%, just slightly faster than inflation. If Wal-Mart expects to grow sales, it needs to compete online. To that end, the company is investing heavily in new e-commerce initiatives. Not only is it buying up smaller e-commerce businesses, but it's also overhauling Walmart.com. The website now has 50 million items available for sale through its own stores and third-party merchants, up from 10 million at this time last year. At the beginning of the year, the company introduced free two-day shipping on over 2 million items for orders over $35. It's also looking for ways to leverage its physical stores -- offering discounts for picking up online orders in stores and using in-store employees to ship orders the last mile as they leave stores after their shifts. The efforts are starting to pay off, as seen in its first-quarter earnings results. But Wal-Mart is still well behind Amazon in the e-commerce space. Amazon is a much bigger threat to Wal-Mart's cash-cow brick-and-mortar business than Wal-Mart is to Amazon's online business. Image source: Amazon.com. Amazon is all about Prime Amazon Prime is one of the biggest driving forces behind the company's retail sales growth. Prime members are generally more loyal and spend more on Amazon, and their numbers are growing like crazy. By the end of the first quarter, Amazon had an estimated 80 million Prime members in the U.S. alone. That's double the number it had two years prior. Amazon has taken steps to make it easier for customers to become Prime members. It introduced monthly pricing last year, so customers didn't have to pay $99 upfront. Most recently, it started offering a discount for customers on government assistance. That move is aimed directly at Wal-Mart, which caters to more low-income households. Wal-Mart has tried to compete with Prime in the past. Its ShippingPass failed to catch on before it scrapped the project for free shipping earlier this year. Even now, Wal-Mart only offers free two-day shipping on 2 million items on its website, whereas Prime guarantees two-day shipping on over 50 million items on Amazon.com. And even as Wal-Mart uses its heft as the world's largest retailer to put pressure on suppliers and reduce prices, Amazon isn't afraid to slash its prices to win customers. Amazon is willing to forgo profits today for a bigger piece of the pie tomorrow. So which is worth buying? Although Amazon is executing on all fronts, its four-figure share price may scare off potential investors. Any way you look at it, Amazon is a much more expensive stock than Wal-Mart. While Amazon is successfully fending off Wal-Mart's e-commerce attacks, it's important to remember that e-commerce is still only a small part of retail. While online may account for the majority of growth, over 90% of sales in the U.S. happen in physical stores. Importantly, U.S. Census Bureau data indicates that those sales are steadily climbing slightly faster than inflation. In other words, Wal-Mart is set up to produce steady cash flows for investors through its thousands of physical stores for many years. Investors looking for that kind of stability, with a nice dividend payment to boot, may be well served by Wal-Mart. But if you're looking to invest in the growth of e-commerce, you will be better off with Amazon. Despite Wal-Mart's recent efforts, Amazon is very much at the forefront of e-commerce, and the competition isn't even close. It has numerous long-term advantages -- most importantly a growing Prime membership base -- that will allow it to continue gaining share in e-commerce, providing rapid revenue growth despite its relatively large size. What's more, the company has shown a willingness to enter new markets (such as cloud computing and consumer electronic devices) with significant sales potential to supplement its core retail business. Investors willing to pay a premium for growth will find few companies in a better position than Amazon. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.

Hourly Walmart workers who miss their scheduled shifts because they’re sick or having a family emergency risk getting fired under the company’s punitive policy on sick leave. The policy is particularly harsh toward women, who most often care for children and family members outside of work.  Each time a worker misses a scheduled shift ― the schedule is worked out three weeks in advance ― they earn a “point.” Accrue enough points and you’re fired, or as company spokesman Blake Jackson puts it: “You’re eligible for termination.” Jackson says that managers have discretion when deciding to hand out points, and if someone has a good excuse for missing a shift, they’re not penalized. But Walmart workers tell a vastly different story in a report released earlier this month from A Better Balance, a nonprofit legal advocacy group. The group surveyed about 1,000 of the company’s employees. Eighty-five percent said Walmart regularly punishes people for taking time off because of a disability or serious illness.  The report claims that Walmart often acts unlawfully, penalizing workers who should be protected under various federal laws. Workers said their managers would often ignore notes from doctors ― not even reading them before issuing points. Katie Orzehowski told HuffPost she missed a few shifts from her job at a Walmart in North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, after she had a miscarriage last year ― and was docked six or seven points. When she was back at work and discovered she was still bleeding, her boss said leaving work early would cost her a half point. Later that year, Orzehowski ― who makes $10.20 an hour ― came to work when she had the flu. “I’m thinking, ‘Oh jeez, I can’t afford to miss work,’” she said. It’s clear that these are not isolated incidents, but a pattern of similar stories we heard time and again. Elizabeth Gedmark, senior staff attorney at A Better Balance Walmart disputes Orzehowski’s story, which she also shared with The New York Times. “We do not have any information that would support that Ms. Orzehowski advised us of a medical reason for her absences. If that were the case, she could have used those medical records to apply for a leave or accommodation,” Walmart said in a statement. According to the Better Balance report, Walmart has a policy of not retaining, or even looking at, doctor’s notes from employees. Orzehowski said she brought in a note. “They’ll turn down every excuse you have,” she said. “The stories in our report speak for themselves. And it’s clear that these are not isolated incidents, but a pattern of similar stories we heard time and again,” Elizabeth Gedmark, a senior staff attorney at A Better Balance, told HuffPost. “We heard from hundreds of workers who have been punished for absences related to serious illnesses and disabilities. In particular, Walmart’s routine failure to accept doctors’ notes is a major focus of the report ― and exactly why they claim to not know about a worker’s medical condition.” Walmart said it hasn’t examined the survey in detail and notes that it cannot speak to the accuracy of the anonymous anecdotes in it. It’s important to consider that Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is not punishing workers for taking paid sick time. Most of these workers simply don’t get paid when they miss work ― though last year, the company did start allowing employees to earn paid time off (including vacation and sick time) if they work a certain number of hours. The company says the point system is necessary to keep workers from calling at the last minute and leaving their colleagues short-handed. Workers do need to miss work on occasion, and the company has “processes in place to assist them,” spokesman Jackson told HuffPost, emphasizing that Walmart complies with federal laws. “We have countless Walmart associates who successfully partnered with the company to authorize their absences from work,” the company said in a statement. “We believe we have the right training measures in place to help communicate our attendance, disability and pregnancy policies to our associates.” She was on her deathbed when I requested time off to be with her. My request was denied. Walmart said I would be fired if I took the time off. My mother died alone. Walmart worker quoted in A Better Balance's new report Yet even if the points system is administered with high discretion and within the bounds of the law, it still leaves workers in a terrible position. Employees say the system effectively scares them from taking sick time and adds stress to already stressful situations. Women, who are often responsible for children at home, are in a particularly tight spot. You can’t always plan in advance for when your child gets an ear infection or needs to be picked up early from school. The stories in the Better Balance report are heartbreaking: One worker said her manager threatened that she’d earn points if she took time off to be with her mother, who was getting hospice care. “She was on her deathbed when I requested time off to be with her,” this worker says in the report. “My request was denied. Walmart said I would be fired if I took the time off. My mother died alone in early April 2017. Not being with her when she passed was devastating.” Other employees describe receiving points for taking time off to handle chronic conditions like asthma or emergency medical conditions like a heart attack. A mother got points for taking her son to the hospital when he had pneumonia. “Giving a worker a disciplinary ‘point’ for being absent due to a disability or for taking care of themselves or a loved one with a serious medical condition is not only unfair,” write the report’s authors. “In many instances, it runs afoul of federal, state and local law.” A Better Balance, which has also filed a separate pregnancy discrimination lawsuit against Walmart on behalf of two employees, worked with the labor group OUR Walmart to conduct its survey via Facebook, targeting users who identified as Walmart employees. Walmart’s points policy likely wouldn’t comply with state law in Massachusetts, which passed a paid sick leave law just a few years ago. Employers in the state cannot take action against workers for using paid sick leave, explains Amanda Baer, an associate at the law firm Mirick O’Connell in Westborough, Massachusetts, who works on labor and employment issues. (Walmart said that it always complies with local laws.) The points system is especially tricky, Baer said. “You could have an employee who’s one point away from being fired, but gets the flu,” she said. “You don’t want your sick employees coming to work and getting everyone else sick.”  The policy also puts customers at risk: Who wants to get sick because you bought laundry detergent from a cashier with the flu? View photos Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg recently announced expanded leave policy at her company, setting a new example for other large public employers. (Philippe Wojazer/Reuters)More The United States is the only developed country that does not mandate that employers provide paid sick leave or maternity leave. But there are a few federal laws that give workers protections when they need time off. The Family and Medical Leave Act provides 12 weeks unpaid time off to employees at companies with 50 or more workers who have worked there for at least 1,250 hours. That time doesn’t have to be taken all at once. You can use FMLA time for a serious medical condition or to care for an immediate family member with a serious medical condition. Prenatal care and chemotherapy, for example, would both be covered under FMLA. If you’re out for three days or more from work, that should be covered under FMLA, explains Emily Martin, general counsel and vice president for workplace justice at the National Women’s Law Center. The key protection the law offers? Job security. “You can’t be retaliated against,” Martin said. An employer can’t threaten disciplinary action. And it’s your boss’ responsibility to recognize if you might qualify for FMLA, she added. Yet Walmart told just 23 percent of workers with absences that likely qualified them for FMLA leave that they were eligible for it, according to the Better Balance survey. The Americans with Disabilities Act also offers job protections for employees with disabilities who need reasonable amounts of time off. Other states and localities have laws in place that protect pregnant women from discrimination. Last year, Roni Gumbert was fired from the same Walmart in Pennsylvania where Orzehowski works for taking too much time off.  Like most working parents, the 33-year-old needed to leave work to deal with a family issue: Her 1-year-old was getting chronic ear infections, and needed to be picked up early from day care or even taken to the hospital. Meanwhile, Gumbert was also dealing with her 74-year-old father, who is suffering from Parkinson’s disease and early onset dementia. He landed in the emergency room more than once for falling down the stairs at his apartment building. Gumbert’s mother, who had been helping with child care, had died suddenly the year before. Each time she called in or was late, Gumbert was penalized ― receiving a point for missing a full shift and a half point for leaving early or arriving late. “I talked to the general manager and the store manager,” Gumbert told HuffPost. “Nobody was willing to be understanding.” Gumbert, who worked for the company less than a year, said she earned eight points before losing her job. According to Walmart, Gumbert’s manager gave her 10 points for 20 “occurrences,” the term for missed or late shifts.  The company wouldn’t provide further detail on why certain shifts were exempted, citing privacy concerns.  Other companies are moving toward more understanding leave policies. Earlier this year, Facebook expanded its leave policy to help workers who need time off to care for sick relatives or for bereavement. The company now gives all employees six weeks of family leave to care for ailing family members, plus three additional days to care for a family member with a short-term illness, like a child with the flu, and 20 days of bereavement leave ― twice as much as before. “People should be able both to work and be there for their families,” the company’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said in a Facebook post announcing the new policy. “No one should face this trade-off.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost.

Both eye-popping deals were about acquiring the competition. PetSmart saw an opportunity to grow sales with Chewy because 40% of shoppers buy products online for their pets, according to the 2017 Pet Owners Survey by the American Pet Products Association. The survey estimates pet sales of $69.36 billion this year, up 3.92% from a year ago. About $1 billion of 2016 sales was attributed to online sales. A recent report from analytics provider 1010data indicates PetSmart will benefit from an estimated 15% uptick in sales despite 75% of Chewy’s customers already shopping PetSmart. The report found Chewy’s shoppers spent $9 more per trip for an average $71 than at PetSmart. This deal is seen as a way for PetSmart to break out of a three-year flat sales pattern and command more market share in the pet category. This report also found Chewy.com had a conversion rate of 4.2% in 2016, better than the 3.7% conversion rate at PetSmart. Analysts agree PetSmart no doubt looked at Chewy the same way Wal-Mart viewed Jet’s smart basket technology. Walmart U.S. e-commerce CEO Marc Lore, who was part of the retail giant’s acquisition, has said acquisition of online players will continue to be part of the company’s growth strategy. He has not hinted that pet specialty is in play, but he did say there are many categories the retailer is looking at expanding its expertise in online and brick and mortar. FAST GROWTH ONLINE Talk Business & Politics asked retail insiders about a possible pet acquisition by Wal-Mart. Keith Anderson, senior vice president of Boston-based Profitero, said pet food is a large and fast-growing category online, which has to be garnering some interest from Wal-Mart and other omnichannel retailers. “Shoppers love it for the selection and convenience. They feel smart letting someone else transport the heavy bag to their home. For the same reason, the economics in this category are very challenging,” Anderson said. “Toys and treats are profitable, but dry dog food in heavy bags is very hard to make money selling online.” Anderson said subscription auto-replenishment can help by making demand more predictable, allowing for lower-cost ground shipping or expedited air freight. He said some retailers, like Target, have resisted selling pet food online, but instead, preferring to list product details and direct shoppers in-store. He said “selective distribution” is a big deal in the pet food industry, as premium brands need the availability of retail channels. “Premium brands typically restrict access to specialty retailers. For example, they dedicate a minimum percentage of their assortment to pet-related products or train staff a minimum of X hours on the benefits of pet nutrition. Some of these brands historically resisted or avoided distribution in supermarkets and mass channels for fear of commoditization,” Anderson explained. The rise of Amazon has changed that perception and premium pet brands have loosened their control of distribution as third-party sellers often sell premium pet products online, he said. “Regardless, Amazon has been able to attract brands (and) products that Wal-Mart and other mainstream mass retailers may have struggled with, “ Anderson said. NOT AS MANY ‘ATTRACTIVE’ OPTIONS Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, said the pet category is an attractive, evergreen business that Amazon and other digital players have already dented. “PetSmart was smart to snatch up Chewy’s but there aren’t as many attractive niche brand options in pet as there are in more developed digital categories like fashion and home. Pet products would be a logical digital add-on for Wal-Mart yet the dearth of established platforms may delay an acquisitive move for now,” she said. That said, “Either way, Wal-Mart would be smart to prioritize pet products online from both a price and convenience/quick delivery perspective, particularly frequently-purchased items such as food,” Spieckerman added. She said Wal-Mart already offers an expanded brand offering online, which is a step in the right direction, but lowering the free delivery threshold for some items would make the retailer more competitive online. Anderson pointed to several possible takeover targets in the pet speciality space. He said Chewy was the clear leader until PetSmart snapped it up. PetFlow, a New York-based pet specialty startup launched in 2011, was recently acquired by Phillips Pet Foods & Supplies last month. PetFlow has annual revenue around $72 million, according to Forbes. The sales price of this deal was not disclosed. Following are other possible targets. • Pet360 began in 1997 offering sales and services from the back of a truck, but that grew into PetFoodDirect.com — one of the first online pet stores. • Doctors Foster & Smith based in northern Wisconsin is a direct-to-your-door pet supply source that began with a catalog business as a side business for veterinarians. Today they have a growing online business and and one retail location in Rhinelander, Wisc. • Entirelypets offers online pet supplies and non-prescription pet medications. The vet operated site provides consumers with a wide selection of pet products. The site was launched in 1999. • 1-800-PetMeds is an online pet pharmacy owned by Delray Beach, Fla.-based PetMed Express. The company has a market capitalization of $730.17 million, and sales totaled $249.18 million last year.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 78.91 -0.99 -1.24% Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 180.06 -1.61 -0.89% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 964.17 -12.30 -1.26% Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA ▼ 135.08 -1.59 -1.16% Since its 2015 founding, Jet has carried a broad array of products under the Kirkland Signature brand, which is owned by Walmart rival Costco Wholesale Corp. A recent search for “Kirkland Signature” on Jet’s site yielded 229 results, ranging from 40-ounce jars of Kirkland cashews for $20.99 to 40-packs of organic roasted seaweed for $67.63. That’s about to change. Jet is phasing out Kirkland products, spokeswoman Meredith Klein said by email, although some Kirkland products fulfilled by third-party sellers will remain. The move comes as Walmart’s Sam’s Club chain works to boost sales by focusing on its own main store brand, Member’s Mark, consolidating about 20 different labels under that banner and adding 300 new products like sea salt caramels and all-natural pulled pork. Jet now carries hundreds of Member’s Mark products, part of a broader effort to integrate it into Walmart, even as it maintains its own distinct web presence separate from Walmart.com. While it made sense for Jet to initially carry Kirkland, “it’s definitely odd that it’s on there now,” said Laura Kennedy, an analyst at research firm Kantar Retail. “Jet is still moving through full integration with Walmart, and it’s something I’m sure Walmart was aware of when it acquired Jet.” It’s no surprise that Jet and Kirkland are intertwined, as Jet co-founder Marc Lore took inspiration from Costco, which popularized the members-only warehouse approach. Jet’s original business model was based on membership fees, with savings from buying in bulk passed onto the customer. Jet accounted for 5.5 percent of Kirkland’s online sales in the first half of 2016, according to analytics provider 1010data, behind Amazon.com Inc. and Costco.com.© Bloomberg/Bloomberg Jet Fueled Lore is now running all of Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce business, which last quarter saw 69 percent growth in merchandise volume, thanks to a major expansion of third-party products and offers like two-day free shipping. From now on, though, Walmart will have to get by without a boost from Kirkland, whose name is derived from the previous location of Costco’s headquarters in Washington. (Costco is now based in nearby Issaquah.) In a phone interview, Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said he wasn’t surprised the Kirkland products were being pulled, “given who acquired them.” Sam’s Club, which Walmart started in 1983, directly competes with Costco in the warehouse club retail format. Vodka, Maternity Clothes The Kirkland Signature brand made its debut in 1992 and spans everything from basics like bottled water and paper towels to vodka and maternity clothes. Sales of some Kirkland items exceed $1 billion, the typical threshold for success in the consumer-products world. More than 20 percent of Costco’s sales come from Kirkland products, and they’re now even available in China on Alibaba’s Tmall site, where international brands sell to Chinese consumers. “Costco’s Kirkland Signature is the best store brand there ever was,” said one writer at foodie bible Bon Appetit in August, the same month Walmart paid $3.3 billion for Jet. “You wouldn’t expect a brand that makes cashmere sweaters, batteries, and 900-count packs of baby wipes to also produce some top-notch food products.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

them picked up at any time of day or night with just the entering of a simple code Sara Roncero-Menendez 12 june 2017 Walmart knows that there’s nothing worse than having to stand in line to buy groceries when you have a ton of other chores to do. As such, it is testing out a giant self-service pick-up center to allow customers to pick out and pay for groceries online. Located in Warr Acres, Oklahoma, the giant 20-foot-by-80-foot kiosk gets employees to pack the groceries and have them ready for customers to simply take when they walk in. From there, the customers just have to provide the code they get at checkout and the groceries appear. The kiosk is equipped with freezers and coolers to keep the necessary food fresh and is open 24/7. Currently, there is no fee to use the service, but customers need to purchase at least $30 worth of merchandise in order to qualify.

Walmart spokespeople announced the store’s closing in a press conference on Monday (June 12). The store will officially close on July 14. However, different departments will be shut down earlier. The Walmart Tire and Lube is expected to close within the next two weeks, and the pharmacy is scheduled to close by the end of June. “It is the only Walmart in our county and will especially affect the availability of shopping for our low-income and elderly residents who will find it difficult, if not impossible, traveling to the Super Centers in the surrounding areas,” said Waldron Mayor Neil Cherry in a release. After the store closes, the closest Walmarts for Waldron residents are in Booneville, Mena and Greenwood. “The devastating effect will ripple through multiple levels of our community,” Cherry said. “The financial loss of 95 jobs, the effect on the employees’ families, and the reduction of sales tax revenues will be felt immediately.” Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Mercy Healthwatch Your latest health news.

Imminent Arrival Of Lidl Supermarkets Means U.S. Stores Are Renovating, Lowering Prices Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Imminent Arrival Of Lidl Supermarkets Means U.S. Stores Are Renovating, Lowering Prices Image courtesy of Lidl June 12, 2017 3:24 pm EDT By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup rhymes with needle lidl aldi walmart supermarkets grocery stores discount supermarket chains Walmart and Aldi are currently locked in a price war for national grocery domination, with Walmart demanding price cuts from suppliers to help it cut prices for consumers in turn. Yet the company’s price war will soon have a new front in some markets, as another German discount grocer, Lidl, opens its first U.S. stores. Both Walmart and Aldi, as well as other stores nearby, are figuring out how to beat a rival that hasn’t opened any stores on this continent yet. Think of Lidl as a combination of a standard supermarket and a bare-bones Aldi. The planned U.S. stores are large and airy, with wide aisles and some offerings of national-brand products that you’ll actually recognize. Lidl already has 10,000 stores in Europe, and plans to open as many as 100 stores in its first year in the U.S. Experts estimate that it could open 600 stores in the next five years if all goes well with the initial launch. Aldi stores are small and almost everything they stock is a private-label brand. That’s great for savings, since these brands don’t run any ads, but the small, older stores and unfamiliar brands turn some shoppers off. That’s why Aldi is investing more than a billion and a half dollars in renovating its stores, and investing $5 billion in opening even more stores in the coming years, perhaps hoping to establish itself in more markets before Lidl arrives. Walmart has been working to spruce up stores and pay workers more in recent years, and it will be able to offer customers greater convenience soon: More stores are getting dedicated pickup points for grocery orders, which will not necessarily be giant vending machines. The company is also working to get prices down and expand its store-brand offerings.

Gymboree has filed for bankruptcy, according to Forbes. These are among today’s must reads from around the commercial real estate industry. NREI Staff | Jun 12, 2017 D.C. and Maryland to Sue President Trump, Alleging Breach of Constitutional Oath “Attorneys general for the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland say they will sue President Trump on Monday, alleging that he has violated anti-corruption clauses in the Constitution by accepting millions in payments and benefits from foreign governments since moving into the White House. The lawsuit, the first of its kind brought by government entities, centers on the fact that Trump chose to retain ownership of his company when he became president.” (The Washington Post) Gymboree Files for Bankruptcy, Plans to Close at Least 375 Stores “Children's clothing retailer Gymboree filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday evening as it attempts to escape from a crushing amount of debt. The retailer will seek to eliminate more than $900 million of debt from its balance sheet. Gymboree, which was taken private by Bain Capital for $1.8 billion in 2010, has accumulated $1.4 billion in debt, according to bankruptcy filings. Gymboree will also close at least 375 stores, according to the filings, as it attempts to "right size" its brick-and-mortar footprint. It said it could close as many as 450 of its 1,281 stores and will run the rest as normal.” (Forbes) Public Sector Investors Favor Real Estate, Renewables—Survey “Public sector investors plan to raise exposure to real estate, infrastructure, green bonds and renewables over the coming year, while cutting holdings of low-yielding government bonds, an annual survey showed on Monday. The Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF) polled chief investment officers and reserve managers at 31 public sector institutions with combined assets under management of $4.21 trillion. With low or even negative returns from fixed income, and volatility in equity markets, there is growing appetite for illiquid assets that deliver steady, predictable returns.” (Reuters) No Full-Time Minimum Wage Worker Can Afford a 2-Bedroom Apartment in Any U.S. State “The absolute least that an employer is legally allowed to pay an employee for an hour's work varies across the country, but one fact remains constant: In no state does working 40 hours a week for minimum wage enable a person to rent a two-bedroom apartment. That's according to new research by the National Low Income Housing Coalition covered by The Washington Post. Across the country, it reports, even full-time workers would have to make about or more than twice as much to afford a home.” (CNBC) Walmart Under Siege as Germany’s Aldi Announces Major U.S. Attack Plan “Aldi is coming after Walmart's grocery market share, as the German discount retailers said it will invest $3.4 billion to expand its U.S. presence. The privately held German grocery store said it plans to increase its store base to 2,500 by 2022, the company said Monday. Aldi currently operates 1,600 U.S. stores. In February, the retailer announced it was investing $1.6 billion in its U.S. stores, with plans to remodel and expand more than 1,300 stores by 2020. The new openings are expected to create 25,000 jobs over the next five years and make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the U.S. behind Walmart and Kroger.” (The Street) Houston Ranks 4th in Nation for Industrial Real Estate Sales “Colliers International ranked Houston fourth among U.S. metro areas for volume of industrial transactions in the first quarter of 2017, putting the Bayou City above Northern New Jersey, a major national port area, and suggesting a relatively resilient local economy.  A current boom in industrial real estate has been fueled largely by demand for warehouse space for distribution of consumer goods as retail models shift towards e-commerce. Colliers said industrial real estate was the only real estate sector to post year-over-year sales volume gains last quarter.” (Chron) Macy’s Inc. Quietly Courts Buyers for Cincinnati Properties “Local department stores have been spared so far in a Macy's cost-cutting quest to close about 100 stores nationwide. But that doesn’t mean the company isn’t working on real estate deals in Cincinnati. At the International Council of Shopping Centers convention in Las Vegas last month, local real estate brokers were buzzing about the possible sale of Macy’s Florence Mall furniture store. Florence Mayor Diane Whalen has been working the grapevine and is convinced a deal is being explored.” (WCPO Cincinnati) WeWork Versus CoWrks: How Two Real Estate Scions Are Betting Big on the Co-Working Space  “Currently, there are more than 160 players in the co-working space who run more than 350 operational centres across tier-1 and tier-2 cities in the country, according to a report by Colliers International. The better-known names among these are InstaOffice, Awfis, BHive, Regus, Spaces, 91springboard, and Investopad. Co-working spaces have become a viable option for startup companies and professionals who cannot afford to maintain an office because of high rentals and deposits as well as maintenance hassles.” (YourStory) Overbuilding in Richmond? “Following several years of strong supply, Richmond’s multifamily market is shifting down a gear. Rents rose 1.6 percent year-over-year through April, continuing to trail the national average. With almost 20,000 units in the pipeline—more than a third of which are under construction—the metro is at risk of overbuilding. With $830 million in assets changing hands, 2016 marked the sixth consecutive cycle high. Investors are focusing mainly on value-add opportunities. There were roughly 7,800 units under construction as of April, and the metro is well on track to surpass 2016’s level of completions this year.” (Commercial Property Executive) Creative Markets for Property Rights Can Solve Many Problems “Property rights are at the core of the American success story. Businesses won’t invest in plants and equipment if they worry about losing the rights to the future profits generated by that property (see Venezuela). When we talk about somebody’s home being their castle, we are talking about the owner’s right to control her property. While the basic concept of property rights is generally well understood, what is underappreciated is how flexible property rights can be when markets are created for unbundled parts of those property rights. A perfect example of how useful unbundled property rights can be is air rights.” (Forbes) 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Aldi operates 1,600 U.S. stores and earlier this year said it would add another 400 by the end of 2018 and spend $1.6 billion to remodel 1,300 of them. The investment, which raises Aldi's capital expenditure to at least $5 billion so far this year, comes at a time of intense competition and disruption in the industry.  The chain has more than 40 stores in the St. Louis area.  German rival Lidl will open the first of its 100 U.S. stores on June 15. In May, Lidl said it would price products up to 50 percent lower than rivals. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11 U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said. The furious pace of expansion by Aldi and Lidl is likely to further disrupt the U.S. grocery market, which has seen 18 bankruptcies since 2014. The two chains are also upending established UK grocers like Tesco Plc and Wal-Mart's UK arm, ASDA. In May, Aldi Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters the chain intended to have prices at least 21 percent lower than rivals and would focus on adding in-house brands to win over price-sensitive customers.

Hart added that Aldi's prices were also up to 50 percent lower than traditional grocery chains, a move that appeared to follow rival Lidl's announcement on prices. The latest store expansion will create 25,000 U.S. jobs and make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the country behind Wal-Mart and Kroger Co., the German chain said in a statement. Aldi's 2,500 stores would equal about 53 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. outlets. "As we continue to expand and grow, our purchasing power continues to increase and allows us to bring products at better prices for consumers," Scott Patton, Aldi's head of corporate buying, said in an interview.

Aldi, known for low prices on its private-label items, plans to spend $3.4bn (approximately £2.7bn) over the next five years to open 900 supermarkets, the company said on Monday. The investment comes as its European discount rival, Lidl, prepares to open its first US stores this week, with plans for as many as 100 by the summer of 2018.  The US expansion by the German private-label giants could put more pressure on conventional retailers like Wal-Mart and Kroger to lower their prices. The new competition in the low-margin industry arrives during a deflationary spiral that has seen food prices drop for 17 straight months, the longest such streak in more than 60 years. Read more Aldi and Lidl to take £1 in every £7 spent at supermarkets “There’s a tremendous amount of value at stake that will shift to Lidl and Aldi,” said Ken Knudson, a Bain & Co. partner. “Traditional grocers can’t afford to lose sales right now given how competitive it is — it will be very disruptive.” Bain predicts that sales in the so-called “deep-discount segment” of the grocery business, which includes Aldi and Lidl, will grow as much as 10 per cent annually through 2020, five times higher than for traditional stores. The battle between the two grocers will intensify on Thursday, when Lidl opens nine stores in three states. Analysts have estimated that it could roll out as many as 600 US locations over the next five years. Read more Aldi and Lidl to take £1 in every £7 spent at supermarkets Aldi and Lidl close in on big four supermarkets after rapid growth Asda to slash grocery prices by 15% in latest round of price war Aldi says it will have 2,500 stores nationwide by 2022, which would make it the third-largest supermarket chain in the US, according to the company. Only Kroger and Albertsons, which also owns Safeway, would have more. Aldi has added more produce and boosted its organic and gluten-free offerings in recent years, as it tries to appeal to more mainstream shoppers. The company has also started offering fresh fish, improved its meat selection and increased its selection of national brands, part of a bid to shed its image as strictly a low-brow discounter. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to spend $1.6bn remodelling 1,300 of its U.S. stores.

Aldi was founded more than a century ago when Anna Albrecht opened a small store in Essen, Germany. Her sons, Karl and Theo, took over in 1948 and quickly expanded. In 1962, the name became Aldi, shortened from Albrecht Discount. That same year, the brothers split the chain into two companies —Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord — following a dispute about whether to sell cigarettes. Aldi Süd oversees the US operations, while Aldi Nord runs the popular private-label grocer Trader Joe’s. The arrival of Lidl this week won’t change how Aldi does business in the US, according to spokeswoman Liz Ruggles. “We’re doing what we’ve been doing to ensure we’re the low-cost leader. We’ll continue to maintain that — we’re very diligent.” Bloomberg More about: ALDI Lidl groceries Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

In May, Lidl said it would price products up to 50% lower than rivals.  Wal-Mart Stores, the largest US grocer, is testing lower prices in 11 U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15%.  Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said.  The furious pace of expansion by Aldi and Lidl is likely to further disrupt the US grocery market, which has seen 18 bankruptcies since 2014.  In May, Aldi chief executive Jason Hart told Reuters the chain intended to have prices at least 21% lower than rivals and would focus on adding in-house brands to win over price-sensitive customers.  "We're growing at a time when other retailers are struggling," Hart said in a statement.  He added that Aldi's prices were also up to 50 % lower than traditional grocery chains, a move that appeared to follow rival Lidl's announcement on prices.  The latest store expansion will create 25,000 US jobs and make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the country behind Wal-Mart and Kroger, the German chain said in a statement.  Aldi's 2,500 stores would equal about 53% of Wal-Mart's US outlets.  "As we continue to expand and grow, our purchasing power continues to increase and allows us to bring products at better prices for consumers," Scott Patton, Aldi's head of corporate buying, said in an interview.

How Amazon's Newest Venture Could Test Walmart Ken Perkins Fortune June 11, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share How Amazon's Newest Venture Could Test WalmartMore Amazon took its heated battle with Walmart to another level this week through its discounted Prime membership offering to consumers receiving U.S. government assistance. Discounted Prime is a direct attempt to garner share in what has been a lucrative business for Walmart: low-income customers. It also counters Walmart’s recent introduction of free shipping with no fees, curbside grocery pickup, and E-commerce acquisitions. According to Morningstar, nearly $1 out of every $5 in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits (more widely known as “food stamps” using EBT cards) was spent at Walmart last year, amounting to roughly $13 billion. Just 21 publicly traded brick and mortar retailers generated more than $13 billion in total sales last year, according to Retail Metrics calculations. Moreover, Amazon is tapping into a broader customer base of 43 million consumers that received $66.6 billion in annual SNAP payments. The E-commerce giant has the foresight and patience to convert many of these consumers that are in temporary need of assistance to what Amazon hopes will be lifelong Prime members. CEO Jeff Bezos has made Amazon’s intentions clear: “Our goal with Amazon Prime, make no mistake, is to make sure that if you are not a Prime member, you are being irresponsible.” This move was prompted by Amazon’s own success penetrating upper-income consumers, with 82% of households making $112,000 a year already Prime members, according to a Piper Jaffray study. It is also simply another component of its overall strategy to dominate every segment of retail. Low-income household Prime penetration is only 52% for consumers making under $41,000 and even lower in the under $25,000 segment, where many accepting government benefits reside. This offers Amazon higher growth potential and deals a blow to Walmart by luring a key customer to Amazon’s ecosystem. Amazon’s discounted Prime will likely make major inroads over time. Amazon is relentless, innovative, and executes at a higher level than virtually anyone in corporate America. Amazon’s share of online sales has grown from 25% in 2012 to 43% in 2016, according to Slice Intelligence. It can grow even further: Of consumers living at or below the poverty line, 74% have access to the Internet. This presents a huge opportunity to provide an affordable delivery service to this segment of the population. The cost of discounted Prime membership is roughly 5% of the average monthly SNAP assistance a consumer received in fiscal year 2017. Layer on top of this the further advantages Prime membership offers—music and video streaming, original content, photo storage, and doorstep delivery—and it becomes a difficult proposition to decline. Dovetailing nicely with the introduction of discounted Prime was the launch of Amazon Cash earlier this year. Amazon Cash offsets the lack of credit card ownership among the low-income population by allowing consumers to put cash into Amazon accounts at more than 10,000 physical locations throughout the U.S. This paves the way for more Prime purchases while providing further impetus to join the Amazon ecosystem. Targeting low-income Americans could prove a solid business strategy as well. The economics of Prime are such that frequent Prime users, while purchasing more, drive up shipping costs. Discounted Prime members are likely to shop less frequently, lowering shipping expenses while Amazon still receives their monthly membership fees. Positive public relations and goodwill from lower-income consumers are additional ancillary benefits Amazon may derive from discounted Prime. This would be another feather in the cap of a company that already boasts top-level customer service ratings. With discounted Prime, Amazon has taken the gloves off once again. It will almost certainly be successful. Walmart, dollar stores, grocers, and discounters are all on notice. Amazon presents an existential threat to the entire industry and retailers must sharpen every aspect of their business to compete. Ken Perkins is president of Retail Metrics.

Aldi operates 1,600 U.S. stores and earlier this year said it would add another 400 by the end of 2018 and spend US$1.6 billion to remodel 1,300 of them. The investment, which raises Aldi's capital expenditure to at least US$5 billion so far this year, comes at a time of intense competition and disruption in the industry. German rival Lidl will open the first of its 100 U.S. stores on June 15. In May, Lidl said it would price products up to 50 percent lower than rivals. Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the largest U.S. grocer, is testing lower prices in 11 U.S. states and pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, is expected to spend about US$6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said. Advertisement Advertisement The furious pace of expansion by Aldi and Lidl is likely to further disrupt the U.S. grocery market, which has seen 18 bankruptcies since 2014. The two chains are also upending established UK grocers like Tesco Plc and Wal-Mart's UK arm, ASDA. In May, Aldi Chief Executive Jason Hart told Reuters the chain intended to have prices at least 21 percent lower than rivals and would focus on adding in-house brands to win over price-sensitive customers. "We're growing at a time when other retailers are struggling," Hart said in a statement. Hart added that Aldi's prices were also up to 50 percent lower than traditional grocery chains, a move that appeared to follow rival Lidl's announcement on prices. The latest store expansion will create 25,000 U.S. jobs and make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the country behind Wal-Mart and Kroger Co , the German chain said in a statement. Aldi's 2,500 stores would equal about 53 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. outlets. "As we continue to expand and grow, our purchasing power continues to increase and allows us to bring products at better prices for consumers," Scott Patton, Aldi's head of corporate buying, said in an interview. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget (Reporting by Nandita Bose in Chicago; Editing by Richard Chang) Source: Reuters Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail More stories for you More information about Channel News Asia jump to top of page Sections Asia Pacific Singapore World CNA Insider Business Sport Lifestyle Technology Health Commentary About Us About Channel NewsAsia Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Advertise with us Contact Sales Online Advertising TV Advertising Get the news that matters in your inbox every morning!

By Betty AdamsKennebec Journal Follow on Twitter Email Writer 207-621-5631 Share Comment Read Article Two of the people involved in a gunfire incident in the Augusta Walmart parking lot almost a year ago have been indicted on federal drug conspiracy charges. Diana Davis, also known as “Little C” and “CC,” 29, and her brother Frankie Dejesus, 27, both of Rochester, New York, were charged along with eight other people. Additional names of those charged have been redacted from the indictment, indicating arrest warrants have been issued for some people. Frankie Dejesus Diana Davis Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → The indictment was handed up by a federal grand jury May 17, but sealed until recently. All the suspects face charges of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances, which are heroin, fentanyl and cocaine base. Several are charged with possession with intent to distribute controlled substances and maintaining drug-involved premises from June 14, 2015, to March 9, 2017, in central Maine. Davis and Dejesus faced state charges after the incident on June 26, 2016, in which shots were exchanged between people in two cars in the parking lot at the Walmart at the Marketplace at Augusta, followed by an alleged shooter being attacked when he got out of one vehicle. No one was shot. Police said the incident was drug-related. The fracas was broken up after armed civilian bystanders intervened. Davis originally faced state charges of aggravated assault and pleaded no contest in December to a reduced charge of assault. She was found guilty automatically and sentenced to 100 days in jail, which she already had served. The prosecutor said Davis had no prior criminal record. Davis was arrested June 7, according to U.S. District Court. She was ordered held pending trial on the charge, which is indicated as “10-plus year drug offenses.” Ronald Bourget was appointed as her defense attorney in the federal case. Dejesus received a two-year deferred disposition after pleading guilty March 8 to reckless conduct with a dangerous weapon in connection with the Walmart incident. In exchange for his plea, charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault against him were dismissed by the state. Dejesus and Melina Snead, known as “Lady,” 23, also of Rochester, New York, were arrested June 9 in Rochester. Dejesus is set for arraignment Monday in U.S. District Court in Bangor. Snead and the others facing the federal conspiracy charges were not involved in the incident at Walmart.

Comments If you watched last night's episode of Counting On, you bore witness to yet another Duggar wedding. And a Duggar engagement. Really, the only thing the episode needed in order to be Duggar-iest 60 minutes in television history was a birth and maybe a second coming. Most of the season premiere focused on Joy-Anna Duggar and Austin Forsyth getting married at one of those messive Southern churches with a Wal-Mart inside. (Note to people currently scrolling down to the comments to tell us there's not a Wal-Mart in the Duggars' church: It's a joke, bruh.) There was a brief, tangential subplot in which Joseph Duggar proposed to Kendra Caldwell, but for the most part, this was Joy-Anna's time to shine. In fact, with its steadily declining ratings, the Duggar gals and their frequent weddings are pretty much the only things keeping Counting On afloat. We won't bother to point out the irony in a show about a deeply patriarchal family being rescued by a generation of women ... or will we? Anyway, throughout their relationship, Joy-Anna and Austin have bucked tradition, and they kept the very mild rebellion going on their wedding day. Unlike those rumors about Joy-Anna and Austin breaking courtship rules, the latest rule violation wasn't one that the Duggars were eager to sweep under the rug. The couple proudly informed viewers that they threw supersition to the wind and laid eyes on one another before it was time to exchange vows: “I guess there’s a tradition of not seeing the bride on the wedding day until it’s time to see her in her dress,” Austin told the camera. “But Joy and I just do things different, and we needed to talk about some things and pray about some things, so we threw tradition out the window.” Yeah, not too scandalous, but then, the Duggars are probably pretty tired of scandals these days.  A nice act of incredibly innocuous insurrection probably gets a thumbs up from ol' Jim Bob. Heck, he might even split a non-alcoholic beer with the boy one of these days. Watch Counting On online to relive Joy-Anna and Austin's road to the altar.

A woman brandished a handgun at an employee of a northeast Arkansas Wal-Mart in an attempted robbery earlier this month, police said. The Jonesboro Police Department was called around 10:30 p.m. June 5 in reference to an attempted robbery at the Wal-Mart store at 1901 W. Parker Road. Tiasia Foster, 20, of Jonesboro entered the store and wanted to put $500 each on six prepaid Visa cards, an employee told a responding officer. “Don’t do anything stupid,” Foster reportedly told the worker after pulling the weapon out of the pocket of her hooded sweatshirt. Someone else, later identified as an 18-year-old Jonesboro resident, was with Foster at the time, a witness said. Both fled the store in a white passenger vehicle toward the KFC/Taco Bell on Parker Road, according to the report. No items were reported stolen in the attempted robbery. Foster, who was later arrested, remained at the Craighead County jail as of Tuesday evening, records show. The 18-year-old reportedly with her did not appear in an online inmate roster at that time.

The new book Big Hunger: The Unholy Alliance Between Corporate America and Anti-Hunger Groups argues that food banks and pantries don’t chip away at underlying issues that keep people food-insecure. Steve Holt @thebostonwriter Jun 13, 2017 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet A shopper fills her cart at the Food Bank For New York City Community Kitchen & Food Pantry of West Harlem. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters) In many metropolitan areas, the food bank is viewed as a vital and beloved community institution. Companies send teams of volunteers down around the holidays to sort through canned soups and boxed macaroni. Can drives at schools and offices warm the hearts of those who give and fill the shelves of food banks and pantries. To most, the food bank is utterly non-controversial, revered on both the political left and right for its steady work helping to feed the roughly 40 million Americans who sometimes wonder where their next meal will come from. The longtime Portland, Oregon-based anti-hunger activist Andy Fisher tells a different story in his new book Big Hunger: The Unholy Alliance Between Corporate America and Anti-Hunger Groups. Fisher, a founder of the National Food Security Coalition, writes that food banks and other anti-hunger organizations (as well as federal programs) are far too cozy with big corporations. He describes the result as “toxic charity” that has barely moved the needle on American food insecurity in more than 30 years. CityLab sat down with Fisher to hear more about why he views much of the emergency food system as unhelpful—and what can be done to improve it. How has our approach to addressing food insecurity changed over time? In the early 1980s, there was a large recession. The Reagan administration came in and slashed federal programs such as food stamps. There was a decline in manufacturing jobs. So what had been just a few food banks around the country grew dramatically to about 180 by the end of the decade. We began to really embark on a charity approach as a more serious attempt to address what was considered to be an emergency at the time—which is why it was called the “emergency food system.” But that emergency never really went away. It just became institutionalized, and there’s been a permanent amount of food insecurity around the country since then. That’s one approach. Another approach was welfare reform [under the] Clinton administration. That also reinforced the need for a charity approach because it lifted the government’s role in providing for basic income for the most impoverished people in the country. Since then, charity has become much more institutionalized. Nearly 5 billion pounds of food a year gets distributed through food banks. There are more than 200 food banks in the Feeding America network. They have become, in many ways, a dependent of the food industry. Related Stories Why Kids Go Hungry in the Summer Rural America Is Hungry The Hidden Epidemic of Teen Hunger Mapping the Effects of a $15 Minimum Wage on Food Insecurity I believe you coin a term in the book: the “anti-hunger industrial complex.” Unpack that for us. In 1961, before he left office, President Eisenhower gives a speech in which he warns the U.S. about the confluence of industry and government together to promote bellicosity, to promote war, as a tool to build the defense industry. I see in some ways a very similar thing in [the anti-hunger] world. I see the United States Department of Agriculture, which operates the federal nutrition programs [that distribute] around $85 billion worth of food and cash around the country—with the food industry, which depends very heavily on, for example, food stamps. For instance, Kraft says that one-sixth of its sales are food stamp-related. And anti-hunger groups, who play a key role in both advocating for federal nutrition programs and protecting those programs and food banks, who are distributing the waste from the food industry. All of those groups get a lot of benefits from these connections. From an anti-hunger perspective, they’re using their connections with industry to protect federal nutrition programs—especially the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—and find [industry] participation in congressional lobbying essential to passage of those programs. On one level it’s great that industry is doing that because they’re protecting federal nutrition programs, but on another level, they also lobby protection of what they consider consumer choice in those programs—such as the continued inclusion of soda and junk food in [SNAP benefits]. The other part of this is that industry provides donations to nonprofit organizations, in the shape of food, volunteers, or cash donations. Walmart is perhaps the most egregious example of this. Walmart doesn’t pay its workers very well. And because it pays its workers so poorly, they have to rely on food stamps and food banks to make ends meet. So then, Walmart goes ahead and uses its charitable donations to pay food banks, to pay anti-hunger groups to support SNAP—which enables [Walmart] to pay its workers low wages. And then it also redeems about 1 in 6 SNAP dollars around the country. Just as Eisenhower warned about the military industrial complex promoting bellicosity at the expense of peace, I think what we’re seeing is that the anti-hunger industrial complex is focused on maintaining hunger as a problem because people are benefitting from it rather than actively seeking to end the problem. You’re pretty tough in the book on big-city food banks in places like Boston, Chicago, Texas, and elsewhere. Why do I take aim at food banks? They have the resources, the staff, the expertise to be able to be more proactive—and they have the heft to be able to change things. They distribute 5 billion pounds of food. Each individual food bank has a multimillion dollar budget, so they can do better, they have to do better. To me, they’re really at the crux of the problem. They’re using those resources in a way that allows corporations to come in as problem solvers rather than problem causers—but to also not really address the root causes and to perpetuate the problem through just treating the symptoms of it. “This approach solves hunger for today. It gives people three days’ worth of food at the end of the month; next month, they arrive at the same damn situation.” But in the public imagination, food banks do a lot of good, right? You’re exactly right. They’re like hospitals. Everybody loves hospitals, or loves the local museum. They’ve become mainstream, they’ve become respectable. And they try to cultivate that respectability because many of them feel it gives them an “in” and a voice to be able to better advocate for their client. Partly, why I wanted to address this is to come back at the bipartisan, centrist, middle-of-the-road approach to addressing hunger. Government has, for the most part, abdicated its role in providing for people’s rights to food [through] cutbacks to SNAP and cutbacks to welfare. It doesn’t work. What I’m trying to call attention to is that this approach solves hunger for today. It gives people three days’ worth of food at the end of the month; next month, they arrive at the same damn situation. It doesn’t solve poverty, much less the issues around economic inequality and power. It doesn’t address the wages that people get paid, so they don’t have to go to the food bank. The second point is that it causes damage to people’s dignity. No one wants to be relying on charity, no one wants to feel like they can’t feed their families. Going to a food pantry and getting a box of food, or even being able to “shop” themselves, has an inherent indignity to it. I write about that in the book, about my own experiences as a volunteer in feeling that there’s this power dynamic between myself as a volunteer enabling people to get food. And I flipped it around and did it as a recipient, and it’s the same thing—it’s a horrible feeling. And I did it essentially as a journalist and a reporter, but to be doing it on a regular basis is totally disempowering. Where we’ve come with this after 35 or 40 years of doing this is that the way the public thinks we deal with hunger is through a food drive. They think that’s a solution to hunger, and it’s not. Fisher agues that a better food bank model would involve distributing higher-quality, fresh food. (Aaron P. Bernstein/Reuters) Is there a better way to do food banking? What examples have you seen across the country? There’s a lot better ways to do food banking. A lot of food banks are moving toward distributing higher-quality food. [The California Association of Food Banks has] something called the Farm to Family program that gleans fields and packing houses, and at some food banks two-thirds of what’s distributed is produce. So they’re giving out good stuff. That’s in recognition of the fact that produce is hard to get in many low-income communities. People can access chips and soda at their local corner store, but the produce is harder to find. Some food banks are starting to exclude unhealthy foods. In Santa Cruz, they’re not distributing soda. They’re taking it, but they’re pouring it down the drains. They’re not taking birthday cakes or candy. They’re measuring the quality—they’re tracking it. That’s something a lot of food banks are moving toward, which is fantastic. In Toronto, there’s a program called The Stop, which is a food pantry in a down-and-out neighborhood, that started to change the way it treated people. It calls its clients “members,” it feeds them lunch before they distribute food to reduce that “hangry” condition people have. They develop relationships with their members. They advocate with them for policy change. But they also think about their work as more relational rather than transactional, and I think that’s a really key part. In your view, what does the ideal food safety net look like? The way it works right now is we have two safety nets. We have a shredded federal safety net, which includes 15 food programs as well as unemployment insurance and other programs like the earned income tax credit. Entire pieces of it have been decimated over time. Underneath that shredded safety net is another safety net, which is food charity and food banks. “We need to be raising wages and supporting workers in a way that they can make a decent living.” It used to be in the public perception that the ones who were using the safety net were the very vulnerable: Those who didn’t have a job or were drug abusers; children, the elderly. Where we’ve run into problems in the last 20 or 30 years is folks who are relying on the safety net—SNAP and food banks—are people who are working. Sixty percent of the non-elderly who receive food stamps are in households where there’s at least one person working. The reason they’re on SNAP or visiting food banks is because wages are so low. The minimum wage peaked in 1968 and would be over $18 an hour if it kept up with productivity. That has combined to the point where SNAP has become a work support program. Work support programs used to be things like childcare. Now we’re subsidizing part of the cost of employment to companies. What needs to happen for us solve hunger in America? Conventional wisdom says that Trump got elected in places like Michigan and Wisconsin and Ohio and Pennsylvania because of the economic insecurity of the working class there. And my back of the envelope evaluation of that way we’ve addressed hunger parallels the decline of manufacturing. Manufacturing declined in the 1980s, food banks institutionalized, and the anti-hunger community never really challenged this idea of privatizing the solution to hunger and taking it out of the government’s hands. We as an anti-hunger movement never challenged the conditions that led to Trump getting elected. I argue that the anti-hunger community needs to have a vision where we fundamentally change the nature of food banking so it’s not transactional, it’s more relational. So it’s only in cases of emergency. It doesn’t have to be a permanent feature of the American landscape. We really need to focus on income inequality as a nation. We need to be raising wages and supporting workers in a way that they can make a decent living. That way, people can feed their families and don’t need to be subsidized by the government because they’re working low-wage jobs. So it’s a rethinking of the way we structure how people work in this country. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the amount spent on federal nutrition programs.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next STREETSBORO, Ohio - Amber Huffman told News 5 a man followed her mother and her around the Streetsboro Walmart Friday, eventually sticking his phone up her mother's dress. Huffman chased him while recording him on her phone, yelling: "He just took a picture of my mom under her dress." Huffman told News 5 she had a gut feeling about him before anything happened. "I noticed him following us," she said. Huffman said she shared her photos and video with police and Walmart, and that's how they were able to track down suspect Jack Manthey, 23. (See photo below). "He came to the station and after an interview admitted to what had taken place," Streetsboro Police Lt. Patricia Wain told News 5. Matheny is facing a voyeurism charge. "It is a misdemeanor. I suppose if you are a victim of a crime it may not feel as harsh as it should be, it is quite an invasion of privacy," Wain said. (Click NEXT PAGE to learn about the law) RELATED: Learn more about the law "My mom's dress was to her knees. He reached down, had his phone on selfie mode, and told cops he took a video!" Huffman said. The misdemeanor charge could mean jail time or a fine, but Huffman told News 5 she doesn't think the charge is harsh enough: "You shouldn't have to stop doing something like wearing a dress, because you're afraid someone is going to stick their phone up it and take a video." Huffman wants to see offenses like this one, especially in a digital age, taken more seriously. "I think he should be on the sexual offender list.

It's a tough time to be in retail. But Walmart is doing okay -- and CEO Doug McMillon is cashing in. The top executive's pay rose nearly 13% to $22.4 million during the company's fiscal year that ended on Jan. 31, according to a company filing. That's up from $19.8 million the year prior. Related: Mary Barra is the world's top-paid auto CEO McMillion has led Walmart (WMT) since 2014. Under his direction, the company has expanded its e-commerce footprint and managed to stay in the game against the likes of online shopping behemoth Amazon (AMZN, Tech30). In its most recent quarter, Walmart's online sales grew 29% from a year ago. Amazon increased total sales by 22%. McMillon also closed a deal to buy e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion last September. And he's joined President Donald Trump's economic advisory council. Walmart said in January it plans to create 10,000 new U.S. jobs at the top of the year. Though the additions represent less than 1% of the company's current American workforce, it runs counter to the layoffs and store shutdowns facing other retailers. McMillon's hefty paycheck is enviable, but not unheard of. In the same ballpark: General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra earned $22.6 million in 2016, up 30% if you exclude a one-time retention bonus she received the year before. Mark Fields of Ford (F) received $22.1 million in 2016, a 19% pay hike. And Randall Stephenson, the top exec at AT&T (T, Tech30), received $28.4 million, up 13%, according to a company filing.

Top Retailers>Kroger Analysts will watch margin line as Kroger reports Q1 How soon will consumers respond to improving conditions Jon Springer | Jun 13, 2017 Analysts expect sales at Kroger Co. won’t vary widely from the modest expectations the retailer set earlier this year, but they’ll be watching keenly to see how hard Kroger fought to get them. Cincinnati-based Kroger will report financial results for its fiscal first quarter Thursday, reviewing a period during which deflation eased but other traditional food retailers struggled and Walmart outperformed. Kroger, which reported a 0.7% decline in non-fuel comparable-store sales in the fourth quarter, in early March said it expected comps in the first quarter to remain slightly negative to flat. Its first quarter ended May 20. At issue, one analyst told SN Tuesday, is how willing Kroger will be to pass along increasing input costs while competition remains intense and pressure to narrow price gaps with the competition — particularly Walmart and the hard-discounter Aldi — remain. Kroger reportedly has been making deep price investments in some markets, which could strain the bottom line. “Comp sales will likely be modestly negative,” the analyst said, “but surrounding gross margins are going to be highly monitored by investors.” Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank in a research note last week noted that while deflation eased sequentially in the quarter, “we believe that sales worsened as Kroger stepped up — as planned — price investments and promotions, which may have had a temporary negative impact on sales, as it can take some time for traffic/tonnage to build.” Higgins said he expected comps to decline by 1.5% in the quarter, and non-fuel gross margins to decline reflecting reflecting stepped-up price investments and promotions that exceed cost savings. Higgins, however, said conditions would likely improve for Kroger as the year progressed Kelly Bania of BMO Capital agreed investor focus will be on the gross margins, which she said would likely to decline by 25 basis points in the quarter, in line with Kroger’s fourth quarter slide. She noted a “challenging environment” illustrated by sliding comps among peers in the period and significant investments from competitors like Walmart and Aldi. On the positive side, Kroger could benefit from competitive closures in places like Indiana (Marsh), the Southeast U.S. (Southeastern Grocers) and from supply-chain disruption among independents around Chicago. Along with better macro trends and more encouraging shopper survey data, Kroger comps could pull out of negative territory, according to RBC analyst Bill Kirk, who said Tuesday he was expecting flat comps. “We believe the fears surrounding Kroger are overstated or they are not new problems,” Kirk said in a research note. “With easing deflationary pressure and emerging structural advantages, we believe we are on the precipice of improved results. While there will be near-term gross margin pressure, we attribute it to the easing deflation rather than increased competition.” TAGS: Retail & Financial 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

MacQuillan, who is based in suburban Atlanta, said supply chain priorities should include collaboration with the right partners, having the appropriate people in place internally and externally, defining of focus areas in concert with consumers, placing the customer “at the center of everything we do,” and application of “metrics, data and insights.” MacQuillan said that, when she joined Kimberly-Clark two years ago, following 14 years with snack food and pet care conglomerate Mars Inc., the $18 billion-plus-a-year-in-sales company “did not have a supply chain,” but it now boasts eight supply chain organizations and five business units engaging some 30,000 supply chain employees worldwide, held together under guiding principles of simplification, standardization and collaboration. “We want to experiment, we want to learn, we want to fail,” MacQuillan said in urging advancement of “a supply chain that senses rather than a supply chain that reacts.” In one of several panel discussions, that philosophy was echoed by Tom Wainwright, Atlanta-based senior manager of regional operations for Richardson, Texas-headquartered climate control leader Lennox International Inc. “Failure is the best teacher,” Wainwright said, noting that distribution network team members are encouraged to ask questions and recognize faults. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world’s largest company, is looking to deploy data and technology in moving its supply chain forward, according to J. Brock Toole, general transportation manager at the Monroe, Georgia, logistics center of the Bentonville, Arkansas-headquartered mega-retailer.

Eric Pomerleau charged with dangerous driving after crashing car into a pole on June 4, 2016 CBC News Posted: Jun 13, 2017 12:10 PM AT Last Updated: Jun 13, 2017 4:18 PM AT Cst Eric Pomerleau returns to court after lunch break, at Miramichi court house. pic.twitter.com/esFGdqv127— @LetterickCBC A Miramichi Police Force officer was driving at least 72 km/h above the posted speed limit when he crashed his cruiser responding as backup to a call about a shoplifter who stole baby formula, his trial heard Tuesday. Const. Eric Pomerleau, who had a female New Brunswick Community College student in his vehicle on June 4, 2016, when it slammed into a pickup truck and then into a utility pole, is charged with dangerous driving. Miramichi provincial court ​Judge Natalie LeBlanc reserved decision until July 19. Police officer crashed car responding to baby formula shoplifter call, trial hears During closing arguments Tuesday, Crown prosecutor Christopher Lavigne said Pomerleau put life and property in danger. Lavigne urged the court to consider several factors, such as speed — 132 km/h along a stretch of the two-lane King George Highway that's zoned between 50 and 60 km/h — rapid acceleration and passing on a solid line. Pomerleau created an unpredictable situation, but wanted people to act predictably, said Lavigne. There was no emergency until the crash occurred, he said. The dangerous driving trial of Const. Eric Pomerleau, pictured here on left with defence lawyer T.J. Burke, continued in Miramichi provincial court on Tuesday. (Kate Letterick/CBC) Defence lawyer T.J. Burke countered that Pomerleau did not drive dangerously and should be acquitted. Speed alone does not constitute dangerous driving, said Burke, who did not present any evidence during the two-day trial. There was no evidence of erratic driving, said Burke. And a dashcam video from Pomerleau's car showed he did obey the rules, he said. Although two witnesses testified they did not hear sirens, Burke said the video showed other vehicles pulled over. Burke blamed the driver of the pickup truck, who was waiting to turn left, for failing to yield and causing the crash. Ian Russell, who was driving the truck, testified Monday that he was trying to turn left into his business and didn't see the police car until it was behind him. He said he pulled over to the right to get out of the way, but the police car tried to go around him on the right and crashed into the pole. Possibly not wearing seatbelt Data gathered from Pomerleau's cruiser showed it was travelling at 132 km/h one second before impact, RCMP collision reconstructionist Cpl. Michel Lanteigne told the court. The margin of error is plus or minus four per cent, said Lanteigne. The data also indicated the driver was not wearing a seatbelt, he said. But that information couldn't be proven, said Lanteigne, because he did not visit the crash site or examine the seatbelt. The alleged shoplifter was known to police, the court heard on Monday. An email about him had previously been circulated, advising officers he was known to sometimes carry a weapon, Const. Chris Hogan testified.

Jet To Stop Selling Costco’s Kirkland Signature Products Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Jet To Stop Selling Costco’s Kirkland Signature Products June 13, 2017 9:41 am EDT By Ashlee Kieler@akieler ditching the competition walmart jet rivals costco sam's club member's mark kirklands pulling the plug e-commerce If you like Costco’s Kirkland Signature line of store-brand products — encompassing everything from laundry detergent to vodka — but aren’t a Costco member, you’ve had the option of buying some Kirkland items online at Jet.com. But now that Walmart owns Jet, those Kirkland items will be going away. A rep for Jet confirmed to Bloomberg that the site will be phasing out its inventory of Kirkland products, though it will still allow third-party Jet.com marketplace sellers to continue selling Kirkland stuff. Despite calling Walmart home now, Jet has a history with the Kirkland and Costco brands, Bloomberg reports, as Jet co-founder Marc Lore took a page out of the members-only warehouse playbook when creating his e-commerce company. As you might remember, when Jet launched in 2015 it was as a sort of online members-only warehouse club, with customers paying memberships and buying products in bulk for a discount. When that business model failed to take off, the company ditched its $50/year membership system. Still, the site was apparently somewhat popular with Costco customers, as Bloomberg reports that Jet accounted for 5.5% of Kirkland’s online sales in the first half of 2016. While it’s taken nearly a year for Jet to drop Costco’s brand, it hasn’t taken that long for the company to pick up some of Sam’s Clubs’. Bloomberg reports that Sam’s newly pared down house brand, Member’s Mark, has already been integrated into the site. As for Costco, the company’s chief financial officer tells Bloomberg that “given who acquired them” he wasn’t shocked that Kirkland’s products were being removed from the site.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Kristine Phillips By Kristine Phillips June 13 Follow @kristinegWP Richard Jones (left) was released from prison after investigators found that another man, Ricky Amos (right) may have committed the crime of which Jones was convicted. (Kansas Department of Corrections) Richard Jones had a party with family and friends at his home in Kansas City, Mo., on May 31, 1999. It was Memorial Day and his girlfriend’s birthday. A few miles across the border, in Kansas City, Kan., three people had been driving around and smoking crack cocaine all day. They eventually ran out of drugs, so they drove to a neighborhood where they knew people sold crack. The three pulled up outside a duplex where a man they knew as Rick joined them. Rick sat in the front seat and told them to go to a nearby Walmart. He got out of the car and tried to snatch a woman’s purse in the parking lot. She fought, and Rick ended up taking her phone instead. The woman didn’t get a good look at her attacker before he and the others drove away. Neither did the store security guard. All they knew, according to court records, was that he was a thin, light-skinned black or Hispanic man with dark hair. Police and eye witnesses eventually believed that man was Richard Jones, and that he likely went by the nickname Rick. He was arrested months later and convicted of aggravated robbery the following year, despite his alibi that he never left his house that Memorial Day. One of the witnesses said the robber had a tattoo on his left arm; Jones didn’t have one at that time. He was sentenced to 19 years of prison. [In Texas, a man who didn’t kill anybody is about to be executed for murder] Jones sat behind bars, bitter and confused about why he was there, his attorney said. Finally, several years later, things began to make sense. Investigators discovered that the crime Jones was convicted of was very likely committed by another man — his doppelganger with a somewhat-similar first name. Ricky Amos had been in and out of prison since the 1990s, and at some point throughout the time that Jones was behind bars, the two men ended up in the same Kansas Department of Corrections facility. Inmates told Jones that a man who looks just like him was also a prisoner there. “Hey, you were in the cafeteria and you didn’t say hello to me,” others said, according to his attorney. Richard Jones (left) and Ricky Amos (Kansas Department of Corrections) The resemblance was uncanny. Their braided hairstyles, goatees, dark eyes, thick eye brows and complexion all look strikingly similar. “We were just like, holy crap,” said Alice Craig, Jones’s attorney. Craig, an attorney for the University of Kansas School of Law Project for Innocence, took over Jones’s case in 2015 — 15 years into his prison sentence and after Jones had lost in all of his appeals. He told her about his doppelganger. Slowly, things began to unravel. Craig and her team found out that Amos lived with his mother in Kansas City, Kan., not far from the Walmart store where the robbery happened. They were evicted sometime in May 1999, Craig said, so they moved in with Amos’s brother and his wife, who lived around the corner — in a duplex on West 41st Avenue, where the three addicts looking for drugs would later pick up the man named Rick. The eye witnesses, including the robbery victim and the security guard, have since changed their previous testimonies. After they were shown side-by-side photographs of Jones and Amos, they said they wouldn’t have been able to identify Jones as the real robber. [Execution in Texas called off as death penalty continues to dwindle nationwide] “I am no longer certain I identified the right person at the preliminary hearing and trial,” Tamara Scherer, the robbery victim, said in an affidavit last year. “If I had seen both men at the time, I would not have felt comfortable choosing between the two men and possibly sending a man to prison.” Edward Miller Jr., one of the three other people in the car the day of the robbery, never identified Jones. He also was not entirely sure about the identity or physical appearance of the man they picked up; he only remembers that he was “smelly and ratty looking,” he wrote in an affidavit. “I remember having my doubts at trial,” Miller said. “If I had been given these two pictures before trial, I would not have been able to tell them apart.” “If I were forced to pick one, it would be the man on the left,” he added, referring to Amos’s photo. John Cowles, a former assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case, said he no longer has a clear memory of it, but said new evidence strongly suggests that the wrong man was prosecuted. “The information provided to me by Ms. Craig has undermined whatever confidence I had at the time that the trial of Richard Jones resulted in a just result,” Cowles, who’s now in private practice, said in an affidavit. “It is not my place to reach a conclusion that the new information proves Mr. Jones’s innocence, but I do believe that it would be appropriate for Ms. Craig to pursue whatever relief might still be available to Mr. Jones.” [‘Like a slap in the face’: Mike Pence won’t act on wrongfully convicted man’s pardon request] Jones’s conviction was based solely on flawed eyewitness testimony, the greatest contributing factor to wrongful conviction, according to the Innocence Project. Equally flawed is the police photo lineup designed for witnesses to identify no one else but Jones, Craig said. It shows a picture of Jones, along with those of five other black men. He was the only one with light skin. In a ruling issued Wednesday, Judge Kevin P. Moriarty of the 10th Judicial District in Kansas wrote that no reasonable jury would convict Jones if he were to be tried again, especially with evidence linking Amos to the crime. Jones, now 41, was freed Thursday, just two years short of finishing his prison sentence. He spent 17 years behind bars, missing his children’s childhoods and the births of his grandchildren. The Midwest Innocence Project also worked on his case. Jones’s case became widely known after the Kansas City Star published a story last week. A GoFundMe page set up to help him and his family has raised more than $16,000 as of Tuesday morning. Posted by Midwest Innocence Project on Thursday, June 8, 2017 Amos has denied being involved in the robbery. Craig said he initially denied knowing the address of the duplex, but later admitted living there after he was confronted with a testimony from a young woman who knows him and his family. Regardless, Amos will not be prosecuted for the robbery because the statute of limitation for the crime has passed. Jones was not available for the interview Monday, but Craig said knowing about his doppelganger brought some relief. “He spent a long time in prison being pretty bitter about being convicted of a crime that he didn’t commit, and he knew he didn’t commit,” Craig said. “And he couldn’t figure out why these people would pick him out of a lineup.” Finally, he knows why.

Photo: Mason Trinca, Special To The Chronicle Can Movebutter spread across US amid heated grocery competition? 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Does America need another online grocer? The field is already a clash of the titans. Internet giants like Amazon and Google, retail behemoths like Walmart, Safeway and Target, and scores of brick-and-mortar stores like Whole Foods (often partnered with delivery services like Instacart or Postmates) are pursuing Internet food sales, a market that could surge to $100 billion by 2025, according to the Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen Co. Now a small San Francisco startup called Movebutter is jumping into the arena, offering direct-to-consumer delivery via FedEx with special boxes and dry ice to keep food fresh. It said it’s tested the concept for almost two years, initially in San Francisco (where it has a warehouse and uses couriers rather than FedEx). In recent months it’s added tests nationwide and now says it will deliver to all 50 states. Movebutter’s proposition: Smaller is better. It offers a carefully selected lineup of organic produce, meats, dairy, packaged foods and other staples. It describes the approach as a mashup of Apple and Trader Joe’s. Latest business videos “We are building the supermarket of the future,” said Chai Mishra, Movebutter CEO. “We took a reverse approach” from other online markets. Rather than offering the entire contents of a supermarket, some 40,000 to 50,000 items, Movebutter will launch with just 500. It carries just one “brand” of each: its own. Will that fly with Americans accustomed to a plethora of choices? The average supermarket has dozens of peanut butter options, for instance, while Movebutter will offer three: creamy, chunky and honey roasted. “I don’t think you can call this a grocery store with only 500 products,” said Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist at Golden Gate University. Still, she said, fewer choices can be a positive, as people are overwhelmed with options. “It’s exhausting to consumers to constantly research what they’re buying,” she said. “Trader Joe’s and Costco are beloved because they narrow options to what they know shoppers will love and shoppers trust their pricing to be fair.” But Movebutter lacks the reputation those retailers have built up, she and others said, and offers far fewer products. Mishra wants to make a virtue out of the minimalist vision. “Americans are also attuned to the concept of deserving the best items,” he said. “The majority of people want to know they’re buying the best item at the fairest price. At some point, you’re just paying for a Super Bowl ad or bright packaging; that doesn’t resonate with the audience.” Americans are also used to quick turnaround. Mishra said Movebutter orders will arrive within two days and the company will cover shipping costs, but many rivals already offer same-day delivery, and others are experimenting with it. Movebutter designed its own boxes using a material similar to Styrofoam, but “as biodegradable as possible.” Inside, dry ice and gel packs (also planned to be biodegradable by year end) keep meats and produce cold. “When people hear about it, they think it’s crazy: Ship fresh food across the country?” Mishra said. “But we can ship anywhere and be 100 percent certain the food will get there safe and sound. We’ve tested in places like Georgia (to prove) the food can stay in the box for three to five days in the hot sun and be fine.” Experts said that consumers might not cotton to that approach. “Over-packaging and waste is a huge problem both in terms of cost and push back for the shoppers who are concerned about sustainability of the planet — key drivers for Millennials and (Gen) Z,” said Phil Lempert, the food trends editor for NBC’s “Today” show who’s known as the Supermarket Guru. While Movebutter’s concept is interesting, it hasn’t yet shown how well it can execute, Lempert said. “They have a glitzy website with all the right words — but little to back it up,” he said, noting that the company’s Facebook and Twitter pages are relatively inactive, odd for a Bay Area consumer startup. Movebutter controls its whole supply chain, buying directly from suppliers, largely mom-and-pop concerns, and packaging food as its own brand, Mishra said. That’s why it claims its prices are about 25 percent lower than other organic grocers, even though it springs for the delivery costs, because it cuts out the middleman. “The implication I take is that compared to a traditional quality grocer like Kroger, Wegmans (or) Publix, the price is pretty much the same,” Lempert said. The company won’t disclose funding or staffing other than saying it has less than 100 headquarters employees. “In this age of VCs throwing money at food delivery” startups, that implies that the funding number must be small, Lempert said. Movebutter has one warehouse in San Francisco and soon will open two more, one each in Texas and New York. Of course, there’s already been an Internet-only grocer: Webvan, one of the biggest flameouts of the dot-com era. Mishra said Webvan’s mistake was offering too many items. “The operational complexity goes up with the number of items,” he said. “We work with way fewer items than anyone else. We’ve spent a lot of time finding the best suppliers and figuring out what customers are actually buying.” Mishra pitches Movebutter as a way to address the issue of “food deserts” — areas that lack stores carrying fresh food. While that’s a commendable idea, experts said, again, the company hasn’t explained how it will execute and hasn’t detailed its pricing. “My hunch is that this will cater to a markedly upscale clientele, a la Silicon Valley,” said April Rinne, an independent adviser focused on new business models. “I would be much more excited about Movebutter if they could show how exactly they will reach middle and even lower classes, who are significantly more disadvantaged when it comes to accessing nutritious, affordable food.” Carolyn Said is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The shares sold were in a trust established by Walton Enterprises LLC in 2015 to help offset potential increases beyond the 50 percent ownership level the family tries to maintain in Wal-Mart stock. The family put 194 million shares -- or about 6 percent of Wal-Mart's outstanding shares -- into the trust. The Waltons intend to use some of the shares to fund charitable contributions. The most recent two-day stock sale netted about $259 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Walton family members have now sold nearly 14.2 million shares out of the trust for about $1.1 billion since May 22.

Andrews June 13 Follow @travismandrews pic.twitter.com/nlb8ekDx41 — Carmen Sensei (@CarmenSierraaa) February 9, 2017 A white Texas police chief’s arrest of Miss Black Texas 2016 last month was not racially motivated, according to an investigation led by an attorney hired by the city of Commerce, where the incident occurred. The investigation was prompted by vastly different accounts of the incident that led a police official to be placed on administrative leave and that one local news station dubbed “the pageant queen vs. the police chief.” The report said that on May 20, Police Chief Kerry Crews was off-duty and shopping at Walmart when police received a call about a dispute between two motorists in the store’s parking lot. Crews later charged 23-year-old Carmen Ponder, a Texas A&M University student, for evasion of arrest. She was held in jail for 24 hours, according to the Dallas Morning News. Afterward, Ponder took to social media, telling her story on Twitter and on the Web page of her crowdfunding campaign titled, “Help me fight for my rights against injustice,” through which she sought $10,000 for “attorney’s fees and city charges.” (As of early Tuesday morning, she had raised $7,249.) “I spent 24 in jail,” she wrote. “My only crime … the color of my skin.” Her story was met with outrage. “Carmen Ponder was a victim of white male fragility, state violence, and racism,” The Root tweeted. “She wants to fight it all the way to trial if necessary. I think she is right. Lets support,” activist Shaun King tweeted. Ponder said she was driving behind a car that was stopping and swerving erratically before she passed it and parked in the Walmart parking lot. Later, that driver “began berating me with profanity demanding to know why I maneuvered past the vehicle,” she said on social media and in news interviews after her arrest. Ponder initially identified the other driver as the police chief, and said that he’d called her a “black b‑‑‑‑.” But she later acknowledged that the other driver might not have been Crews. The outside probe found “Chief Crews was not involved in the initial dispute between Ms. Ponder and the other driver.” “The investigation revealed that there was no evidence that Chief Crews made any racial statements to Ms. Ponder or to anyone else,” the statement read. “There is also no evidence that the arrest was racially motivated.” Lee Merritt, Ponder’s attorney, tweeted that the city “missed the point” in its statement, alleging that Crews arrested Ponder “under unjustifiable circumstances.” I'm afraid @CityOfCommerce missed the point. Chief Crews directed the unlawful arrest of @CarmenSierraaa under unjustifiable circumstances https://t.co/wuLugVL3Ss — S. Lee Merritt, Esq. (@MeritLaw) June 12, 2017 Merritt plans to hold a news conference on Wednesday at 10 a.m. to further address the investigation results. Crews has not given a statement.

Man Released from Prison 17 Years Later after Doppelganger with Same Name was Found 12.06.2017 at 6:55 pm By BellaNaija.com 6 Comments Ricky (Left) and Richard Jones (R) | Photo Credit: Kansas City Police Department Due to an eyewitness’ wrong identification, a Kansas man Richard Anthony Jones was sentenced to 19 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery in 1999. After serving 17 years of the term, he was released from the Kansas prison where he was held after a man who bears a striking resemblance with him was found. Jones was found guilty of a robbery in a Walmart store, although there was no DNA or physical evidence linking him to the crime. Back in May of 1999, two men picked up a man named ‘Rick’ at a house in Kansas City, Kansas and went to a Walmart to get money for drugs. Once they pulled into the parking lot, ‘Rick’ jumped out of the vehicle, wrestled a woman to the ground in an attempt to steal her purse, grabbed her cell phone, and got back in the vehicle. All of the witnesses described ‘Rick’ as a Hispanic or light skinned African American, but no one got a good look at ‘Rick’s face. Law enforcement identified the driver of the vehicle. The driver was taken to the police station to look at mugshots in an attempt to identify ‘Rick.’ Law enforcement typed the names ‘Rick’ and ‘Richard’ into their database. After viewing over 200 photographs, the driver eventually picked out Richard Jones. Witnesses only remembered that the suspect had light skin, so they all chose the only light-skinned man in the lineup: Richard Jones. He had tried to appeal his conviction but did not succeed. His hopes were raised again after other inmates in the prison where he was held told him about another inmate, Ricky that looks just like him. “When I saw the picture of my double it all made sense to me,” Jones said. He told Midwest Innocence Project (MIP), a non-profit organisation that helps secure the release of people who have been wrongfully convicted, about the development and they took it up from there.   Investigations revealed that Ricky lived near the scene of the crime – Kansas City, Kansas – and Jones lived in Kansas City, Missouri. Ricky not only has ties to the Kansas City, Kansas community, but also lived at the exact address where the suspect was picked up by the two men in the vehicle back in May of 1999. Jones’ lawyers also argued that Jones had said he was with his girlfriend and her family at the time of the crime. After the testimony of several witnesses, including the victim of the robbery, Judge Kevin Moriarty of the Johnson County District Court ordered Jones’ release. The witnesses testified that after looking at photographs of both men, they could no longer say Jones was the man who committed the crime. All four witnesses were asked to identify ‘Rick.’ Three of them did not even bother as they claimed that they couldn’t distinguish between the men. One witness did choose who believed to be the suspect — and he chose Ricky. All four witnesses admitted that they would not have been able to tell the difference between Richard and Ricky at the time of the robbery. The judge said no juror would have convicted Jones based on the new evidence. Ricky, however denied committing the crime. Jones’ lawyers said that he was identified after his photograph was picked out of a police database three months after the robbery. They described the list of photos as “highly suggestive,” stating that “None of the other photos matched the description provided by the witnesses.” A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help Jones adjust to life outside prison.

Hatfield said the decision to shutter the store -- which is located at 1359 W. Second St. -- is "isolated" and not* part of a round of store closings. She said the Bentonville-based retailer's review process considers a number of factors, including a store's financial performance as well as its strategic alignment with Wal-Mart's long-term plan. The closing will affect about 95 employees, who will be paid through Aug. 18. Hatfield said Wal-Mart will work with employees who are interested in transferring to another location and that severance will be offered to eligible full- and part-time workers. Pharmacy customers can continue to pick up their prescriptions at the store until 5 p.m. June 28. The pharmacy staff will work with customers to transfer their prescriptions to another location. The discount store opened in Waldron in 1982 and serves a community of about 3,500 people. -- Robbie Neiswanger *CORRECTION: Wal-Mart’s decision to shutter a store in Waldron is isolated and not part of a round of store closings, according to spokesman Anne Hatfield.

June 13, 2017 at 8:09 a.m. And how many mom and pop stores did they force out of business when they built their Made-in-China store? Sam is no doubt rolling in his grave at how his family has sullied his brand. Does anyone remember the commercials boasting that Walmart products were Made-in-America and their employees were all shareholders? Now they sell low quality low cost products from China and they keep their employees below full-time status so they don't have to pay benefits. Watch the documentary "The High Cost of Low Price," it will make you sick at how Walmart has destroyed communities and how they boast about it. ( permalink | suggest removal ) hah406 says...

June 13, 2017 at 9:40 a.m. There's a theme here that you always hear in Arkansas. ''Mr Sam" wouldn't like the way Walmart operates nowadays. I think Arkies love him cause he supposedly drove an old truck -- just like us! Mr Sam died in 1992. Did Walmart start putting mom'n'pop stores out business only after his death? He knew what he was doing all along. If he were alive today, he'd approve of anything that grew the business and increased profits. Why, it's the American way. You can't have it both ways. He might still be driving the old truck though. So what?

So we've already told you that if you grab one of them from Best Buy you'll receive either a $25 or $50 gift card. But now Walmart is topping that deal, both in value and in convenience. No pesky gift cards are involved here, the price you pay is simply lower. Do keep in mind though that only the iPad Pro 10.5 has received the Walmart offer treatment. If you want the 64GB Wi-Fi model, the normal price is $649 but the retailer is only asking you for $597. That's $52 left in your pocket, by the way. If the version with 256GB of storage is more to your liking, then you'll be saving $60 by pre-ordering from Walmart, where it's priced at $689 (compared to the regular price of $749).

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Pune’s retail real estate bounces back to business Pune’s retail real estate bounces back to business After closure of some malls, Pune’s retail market is receiving renewed interest and fresh investment is coming in to the mall space. By: FE Bureau | Pune | Published: June 13, 2017 6:36 AM International retail giants like Walmart and IKEA are also considering Pune to set new stores. After closure of some malls, Pune’s retail market is receiving renewed interest and fresh investment is coming in to the mall space. “Pune’s retail real estate sector is seeing significant churn and more global brands are lining up to expand their footprint,” said Mayank Sharan, local director, Retail, JLL India. The Pavilion on S B Road and Westend Mall in Aundh, which account for of 4.5 lakh sq ft and 4 lakh sq ft space respectively, plan to up their game with major international brands like H&M, Zara, Gant, Kenneth Cole, Brooks Brother, MAC Cosmetics and Superdry. Many global retailers are expanding their retail footprint in Pune and among them are H&M, Marks & Spencers, Decathlon and MAX, says JLL report. International retail giants like Walmart and IKEA are also considering Pune to set new stores. IKEA plans to acquire land parcels to execute entry into Pune in 2018-19, and Walmart is considering a suitable location to activate its stores. Both these retail giants will focus primarily on the brick-and-mortar model, but use e-commerce to supplement sales in the city, Sharan said. There has been some important supply augmentation on Pune’s retail real estate market recently, particularly WestendMall in Aundh and The Pavilion Mall on S B Road, which is slated to become operational in 2017, says a JLL report. The city’s retail market scenario was unfavourable in 2016 and a few malls were scrapped and proposed to be converted into office spaces. According to JLL India, the I?norbit Mall will soon be converted into a commercial space and has been taken over by Amazon to set up its IT/ITeS service. Kakade Centerport and Pulse Mall have been refurbished into office spaces. This was due to over supply in the Eastern corridor. Among the malls which have managed to crack the code and stay highly relevant are Phoenix Market City on Nagar Road, Amanora Mall in Hadapsar, Seasons Mall next to Magarpatta City and Kumar Pacific Mall on Swargate, says JLL India. Global High Street Mall, a newly launched centre in Hinjewadi Phase 2 has attracted considerable interest amongst retailers due to the ready available catchment, lack of a destination supply with the right ingredients. The centre which houses the largest PVR in Pune is due in Q4-2019. Nitesh Hub (formerly known as Koregaon Park Plaza) which now is operational on four floors and is witnessing considerable footfalls has plans of adding more brands and food offerings. According to JLL India, the rental landscape has changed quite a lot in 2017, with quality malls seeing considerable with rental increments while others displayed slower or no growth. Pune’s Grade A malls where supply is short and demand is high, rentals have moved upward by as much as 10-15% recently. Capital values in high-demand malls have also seen significant increase in 2Q17 over 1Q17, going as high as 10% in some cases. This has led to a renewed interest by mall developers to invest in relevant Grade A retail supply. No Comments.

Live Watch Man imprisoned for 17 years now freed after lookalike mix-up: 'I made it through' By Nicole Pelletiere Close Follow on Twitter More from Nicole Jun 12, 2017, 5:22 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayPolice Handout WATCH Man in prison for 17 years set free after his lookalike is found 0 Shares Email A man who spent 17 years behind bars for a crime he has always said he didn't commit is now free after a case of mistaken identity. The conviction of Richard Jones, 41, has been overturned after the Midwest Innocence Project and the University of Kansas School of Law helped uncover what is now believed to be a wrongful conviction due to eyewitness misidentification. "I hope and prayed every day for this day to come, and when it finally got here it was an overwhelming feeling," Jones said in an interview with ABC News' "Good Morning America." Jones was charged with aggravated robbery in Kansas City, Kansas, nearly 20 years ago after being accused of trying to steal a purse in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Roeland Park, Kansas. Jones had an alibi and no physical evidence, DNA or fingerprints ever linked him to the crime -- only two eyewitness identifications. Murder suspect mistakenly released from Chicago jail Innocent Pennsylvania man freed after spending 24 years in prison At the time, the witnesses told police that the suspect was either a light-skinned Hispanic or African-American man. Jones' photo was picked out of six mug shots by Tamara Scherer, the victim of the robbery, and Ronald Cohen, a security guard at the Walmart at the time of the robbery, according to a memorandum provided to ABC News by Alice Craig, Jones' attorney and professor at University of Kansas' Project for Innocence. Those eyewitness testimonies ultimately landed him behind bars at the Lansing Correctional Facility in Lansing, Kansas. The Kansas City Police and the Kansas Department of Corrections have not yet responded to ABC News' request for comment. According to Jones' profile on the Kansas Criminal Justice Information System, he was released as of June 8 in Johnson County. Jones, who adamantly maintained his innocence since his arrest 17 years ago, had tried unsuccessfully for 15 years to appeal his conviction, until he teamed up with the Midwest Innocence Project and the Project for Innocence at the University of Kansas School of Law. Jones said he told his attorneys that he had heard there was another man in incarceration who looked just like him. Interns for the project found photos of another inmate in the Kansas state system named Ricky Amos, 39. The two men were close in age, had similar skin tone, the same facial hair and cornrows. "Once I had seen his picture beside mine and I seen the resemblance me and him had, I just knew," Jones said. "It was understandable why other people would say the same thing." Last week, a judge ordered Jones' release after witnesses, including the robbery victim, admitted they couldn't tell the Jones and Amos apart. At his exoneration hearing, Jones saw his doppelganger for the first time. Amos has denied any involvement in the crime. "It was hard," Jones said. "I won't say it was easy because it wasn't, but I made it through." John Cowles, the original prosecutor on the case who is now a criminal defense attorney, said that Jones' conviction was based "solely on eyewitness identification." Jones' alibi placed him at his girlfriend Tia Kidd's house in Kansas City, Missouri, on the day of the crime. Tia Kidd and her sister, Lisa Kidd, testified on Jones' behalf but he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to 19 years. Jones' sentence included time for four prior unrelated offenses on his record. Cowles signed an affidavit after he said he was presented by The Innocence Project with the new evidence of the case where it involved Amos and the misidentification of Jones. "I realized that we had very unfortunately convicted the wrong man," Cowles told ABC News. "We spoke at the hearing and he was appreciative and I wished him luck." Amos was not incarcerated at the time the original crime took place, according to the Kansas Criminal Justice Information System. Because of the statute of limitations, Amos will not be charged for the 1999 robbery that Jones served time for, Cowles said. Alice Craig, Jones' attorney, said Kansas does not have a compensation statute -- meaning there is no law allowing compensation for people of wrongful imprisonment. There is no word if Jones will file a lawsuit against the state, she added. Jones said he is enjoying his family, keeping his faith in God and wants to work with The Innocence Project to give freedom to others who are wrongfully convicted. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Man imprisoned for 17 years freed after lookalike mix-up: 'I made it through' " Wife of alleged Virginia shooter: 'I can't believe he did this' " Escaped Georgia inmates captured in Tennessee, officials say " APNewsBreak: About 4,000 more US troops to go to Afghanistan " Pence hires outside counsel for Russia probe " 16 more indicted in Turkish embassy brawl " Suspect identified in China kindergarten explosion; 8 killed " Trump tweets about Clinton after news of obstruction of justice investigation " Man accused of killing 5 allegedly strangled teen with telephone cord " Georgia teen builds custom backyard roller coaster over 5 years " Couple who met at a camp for kids with cancer marry many years later " Summer vacation?

Walmart is delivering a huge blow to Costco Hayley Peterson Business Insider June 12, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share FILE PHOTO: Workers stock shelves in a newly built Walmart Super Center prior to its opening in Compton, California, U.S., January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Mike BlakeMore (Workers stock shelves in a newly built Walmart Supercenter in Compton, California.Thomson Reuters) Jet.com is ending its two-year relationship with Costco.  The ecommerce company, which was acquired by Costco rival Walmart last year, is dropping hundreds of Costco products sold under the Kirkland Signature brand from its website, Bloomberg reports.  The move could be a setback for both Jet and Costco. Jet was the third biggest seller of Costco products online in the first half of 2016, according to Bloomberg.  But it also makes sense for Walmart, which is trying to drive business to its own warehouse chain, Sam's Club, and its private-label brand, Member's Mark. Sam's Club says it recently "reinvented" its Member's Mark brand by consolidating a number of other private-label brands under that name and adding 300 new products to the label. "At one point, we had 21 private labels," Chandra Holt, vice president of private brands at Sam's Club, said in a news release from April. "So the first thing I set out to do was to simplify for our members."

GMR8 Birthday Club Mother turns daughter in for attempted Walmart robbery 2017-06-12T21:10:19Z Posted by Allison Munn, Anchor - Reporter BioEmail Connect Biography amunn@kait8.com Follow @allisoncmunn Tiasia Foster (Source: Craighead County Sheriff's Department) Less than 12 hours after appearing in court on theft charges, Jonesboro police say a woman attempted to rob an area Walmart. Her mother turned her in for the crime. Tiasia Foster, 20, appeared in Craighead County District Court Monday on aggravated robbery charges. Around 2 o'clock on the afternoon of June 5, Foster appeared in Craighead County District Court for allegedly stealing more than $1,000 from her job at Dollar Tree. She was released from jail on a $1,500 bond. According to a probable cause affidavit, around 10:15 p.m. that same day, Foster walked into the Parker Road Walmart, pointed a handgun at a clerk, and ordered the clerk to put money on gift cards. “The clerk and manager explained they couldn’t put the money on the card and the suspect fled the scene,” court documents state. Two days later, Foster’s mother Michelle Jackson went to the Justice Complex to identify the suspect as her daughter. “Jackson said she had taken the handgun that was used in the commission of the crime and hidden it,” court documents state. Jackson then gave the officer the handgun and said she would turn her daughter in on June 12. On that day, Foster went to the Justice Complex and admitted to the crime in an interview with police. During her probable cause hearing that afternoon, Judge David Boling set her bond at $1,500 cash or surety. It was stated during the probable cause hearing that Foster's bond was set so low for a number of reasons. The investigating officer said Foster was very cooperative when she went to the department to interview with police. They also stated she takes care of her 7-month-old child and her mother, who has cancer.  If convicted on the aggravated robbery charge, Foster could face 10-40 years or life in prison. Her theft charges carry the possibility of a $10,000 fine and/or up to 6 years in prison. She will appear in court on both charges on July 31. Copyright 2017 KAIT. All rights reserved.

Arkansas Grown is program that brands locally grown and made products sold in Wal-Mart’s stores across the state. The program is aimed at increasing local produce sales and supporting local farm jobs and operations. “Growing up on a farm in Northwest Arkansas gave me a deep understanding and appreciation for agriculture,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “The partnership between our state’s largest company, Wal-Mart, and our Arkansas Agriculture Department’s Arkansas Grown Program represents our state’s continued commitment to the success of our state’s largest industry and our many hardworking farmers and ranchers.” Wal-Mart said consumers will begin seeing Arkansas Grown signage in its stores in to easily identify locally grown produce and other products offered. During Monday’s announcement Arkansas Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward recognized Wal-Mart’s work in these efforts along with two local farmers who supply many stores across the country with their locally grown produce. “When consumers buy products featuring the Arkansas Grown logo they know that they are supporting farmers and ranchers from right here in Arkansas,” Ward said. “The Arkansas Agriculture Department is proud of our Arkansas Grown and Arkansas Made programs, and we are proud to partner with Wal-Mart stores located in Arkansas to help promote local foods and jobs.” Arkansas consistently ranks in the top 25 states in the production of 21 agricultural commodities including sweet potatoes and tomatoes. Agriculture means jobs and more and more, the “local food” movement means more jobs for Arkansas, officials said. “Our customers have told us that second to price, where products are made influences their purchase decisions,” said Cindi Marsiglio, vice president, U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart. “We are focused on buying great quality products that create jobs in communities across the U.S. It makes sense for our customers, our communities and our company.” According to a 2015 U.S. Grocery Shopper Trends Survey, more than 80% of surveyed grocery store shoppers reported purchasing local foods occasionally, while 9% reported purchasing local foods whenever possible. This is the not the first time Wal-Mart has made an effort to showcase products made in Arkansas. In June 2014, the retail giant told the media it was highlighting “Arkansas Made” products in its stores. That included everything from corn bought from farmers in Pea Ridge to salsa made and co-packed in Rogers from My Brother’s Salsa brand. In 2014 that program was left up to store operators to feature the “Arkansas Made” items with signage. In November Wal-Mart announced plans to double its locally grown produce sales in the United States by 2025. Wal-Mart said it more than doubled its locally grown produce sales between 2009 and 2015, from $404 million to $825 million, according to Ragan Dickens, director of sustainability communications for the company. Based on the 2015 number, Wal-Mart’s goal is to have local produce sales of at least $1.65 billion in 2025. At Monday’s event Wal-Mart officials introduced Matthews Ridgeview Farms, a commercial sweet potato farm operation in Wynne. “Matthews Ridgeview Farms is a growing, sustainable company with an exciting future,” said Autumn Campbell, sales manager at Matthews Ridgeview Farms. “The produce industry is ever changing and the sweet potato market is growing every year. We are excited that our healthy product can be purchased by our friends and neighbors in their neighborhood store.” Based on data from the Farm to School research study, Arkansas consumers spend $7 billion annually on food, and $6.3 billion of that amount is spent purchasing food from other states. State officials said it’s their hope Arkansas Grown will help keep more of the $7 billion within the state. Other grocers such as Springdale-based Harps Foods and Allen’s Food Store in Bella Vista routinely feature produce purchased from local farmers such as Vanzant farms in Lowell or McGarrah Farms of Springdale.

The health fairs will take place in more than 4.600 Wal-Mart locations across the country from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time. Wal-Mart said this year it’s teaming up with the American Diabetes Association in hopes of extending support for consumers who at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The American Diabetes Association said one in 11 Americans has diabetes and 86 million more — about one in three — are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. This year’s Wellness Day will offer free screenings that include blood glucose, vision (at select locations) blood pressure and body mass index tests. Product samples will also be available from vendors taking part in the event. Wal-Mart said its team of 10,000-plus pharmacists will also offer immunizations in stores at additional charges depending on insurance benefits — this is a service the pharmacies offer each day. This year after the June 17 event, the ABA will follow up via email with interested customers whose blood pressure and blood glucose tests indicated they may be at a greater risk for diabetes, providing suggested next steps and resources. “We’re more committed than ever to serving as an open door to affordable, accessible healthcare, and our Wellness Day program is a key piece of that,” said George Riedl, senior vice president and president, Walmart Health & Wellness. “We know that many of our customers have learned about an existing health problem for the first time at one our Wellness Day events, and that can be overwhelming. Wal-Mart is proud to be working with the American Diabetes Association to offer even more support to customers who may find themselves in this situation.” Since Wal-Mart’s first Wellness Day event, the company has provided nearly 1.1 million free health screenings to people across the country. These events have helped individuals uncover existing health problems, including high blood pressure, signs of diabetes and other potential illness. Just this past January, free screenings topped 338,000, Wal-Mart said. “An estimated 8 million people with diabetes are undiagnosed, and when left untreated, diabetes can lead to serious health complications including kidney failure, heart disease, stroke, blindness and amputations,” said Tamara Darsow, PhD, senior vice president, research and community programs for the ADA. “We are excited to work with Wal-Mart on this initiative and encourage as many Americans as possible to participate. Knowing your risk for diabetes is the first step to being able to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.” Wal-Mart said future Wellness Day events with the ADA are also planned for September, again in January and the spring of next year.

Follow @sbanjo Facebook Twitter Email Print Share May 18, 2017 12:18 PM EDT WAL-MART STORES INC -0.99 At Closing, June 15th 78.91 USD AMAZON.COM INC -12.30 At Closing, June 15th 964.17 USD In the cutthroat race for consumer dollars, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has pulled ahead.  Price Matters Walmart shares are beating the S&P 500 so far this year Source: Bloomberg Shares in the world's largest retailer rose 2 percent Thursday after it reported an eye-popping 63 percent year-over-year increase in the latest quarter in U.S. online sales, along with its eleventh straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth at established stores.  Growth Spurt Walmart's Jet.com purchase boosted U.S. e-commerce sales, which rose 63% in the latest quarter from a year ago Source: Bloomberg, Walmart It's been a decades-long journey, but it seems Walmart is finally getting serious about e-commerce. It has also managed to rev up sales growth -- at a time when Target Corp. and other competitors seem to be sputtering along -- by focusing on two key factors: low prices and food. And for good reason. Really, the only advantage Walmart still has over Amazon.com Inc. -- for now, at least -- is food. It makes up more than half of Walmart's U.S. sales; and now that the company is making online grocery ordering and in-store pick-up more widely available, food has also been driving Walmart's e-commerce sales. But the smartest thing Walmart has done lately is aggressively slash prices, reminding consumers why they shopped at the chain in the first place. Walmart began cutting prices last year in a bid to fend off the U.S. invasion of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Walmart's U.K. chain Asda got hammered by these companies across the pond, and Walmart has vowed to not let that happen again.  Cut Rate The price of an average grocery basket at Walmart in Philadelphia is now as much as 20% cheaper than some competitors; other markets show similar discounts Source: Wolfe Research The price cuts -- which have Walmart selling some basic goods such as bananas and milk at cost -- have also put serious pressure on competitors, including Target, dollar stores, and regional grocery chains. In some cases, an average basket of groceries can be as much as 20 percent cheaper at Walmart than at competing stores, according to Wolfe Research. Now other chains are fighting back with their own discounts, fueling a price war across the sector and contributing to the longest deflationary period for groceries in half a century.  The year-over-year change in prices for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' "food at home" category has been negative for 17 months in a row, the longest continuous stretch of deflation since 1956. Deflated Aside from the most recent recession, grocery prices haven't fallen this much since the 1960s Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Lower prices get customers in the door, and they have boosted Walmart's U.S. traffic. But the price declines have a negative impact on total sales and profits, pushing the average customer ticket this quarter down by 0.1 percent from a year ago and further straining margins.  Despite all this, Walmart's shares are up 25 percent in the past year. Unlike its food, Walmart's stock is no longer cheap, trading at 17.1 times forward earnings. That's well beyond the valuations of Target, The Kroger Co. and Dollar General Corp. And this has happened even as Walmart has stopped delivering the stellar earnings growth its investors once enjoyed. Walmart's Stock Price Gain In The Past Year 25% It's absolutely necessary for a company looking to reinvent itself in the age of Amazon to sacrifice short-term earnings gains for market share (that's pretty much what Amazon has been doing since inception). I've been arguing for Walmart to follow suit for years. But Walmart should keep in mind this retail race is not a sprint; it's a marathon.  Recent sales gains have bought Walmart time -- and leeway from investors. They don't seem bothered that Walmart's operating income has declined for 14 straight quarters. Nor do they seem concerned that its return on invested capital has fallen from the year before in five of the past seven quarters. They have shrugged at how, in the latest quarter, the amount Walmart spent on dividends and share repurchases dropped by 1.5 percent and 20.1 percent from a year ago, respectively. (Does this remind you of another retail giant?)  Too Big To Grow? Walmart has struggled to grow sales and profits at the same time Source: Bloomberg Walmart will have to keep outgrowing rivals in the face of an intensifying price war, growing competition from German discounters and Amazon's foray into fresh food. Otherwise, it won't be able to justify its hefty investments and paltry profits to investors for long. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners. Expanding its website to allow third-party sellers has also been a big factor.  To contact the author of this story: Shelly Banjo in New York at sbanjo@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Gongloff at mgongloff1@bloomberg.net Pony Up Pony Up Tencent has been extremely active over the past year, suprassing rival's deal values Source: Bloomberg Note: Data are for deals announced or completed in the past 12 months involving investors that were named.

By Emily McCombs It’s not often I find myself in a New Jersey Walmart, much less find inspiration there, but that’s exactly what happened when my mother, my son and I hit one for supplies during a recent family trip. I was wandering through the disorienting and oversized aisles when somewhere just past the Budweiser-printed cowboy hats, I came across this: This is a the huge selection of girls' Wonder Woman T-shirts currently available at Walmart. Not one of them is pink. pic.twitter.com/eR9qGiRN3j— Emily McCombs (@msemilymccombs) June 11, 2017 That’s a giant display of 16 freaking superhero T-shirts for girls ― superhero T-shirts reading things like “Strong” and “Girls Will Rule The World.” And, as previously noted, almost none of them are pink. First, I teared up with the surprise of it all. Second, I wished they came in my size. And third, I turned my head slowly toward my 5-year-old son, who apparently knew exactly what I was thinking because he automatically yelled out, “I’m not wearing one!” It was a moment that crystallized the one little thing that keeps me from fully enjoying the flood of Wonder Woman merchandise that’s become recently available to girls ― these T-shirts, the “Wonder Woman” line at Gap, Wonder Woman Barbie, among others. Girls around the country are being empowered and inspired by finally having a mass market female superhero and I couldn’t be more into it. They deserve it. We deserve it. But so does my son.  When I share that I wish places like Walmart and The Gap would make just a few of these T-shirts for boys, people respond that I can just put the girls’ shirts on a boy, which, of course, is technically true. (Although as moms of boys who prefer stereotypically “female” characters will tell you, there are sometimes prohibitive fit issues.)  But the thing is, my son is 5. I can’t put anything on him that he doesn’t want to wear. And when he sees a shirt in the girls’ section, with a tag that says “girl,” he doesn’t want to wear it. Blame the gender normativity that started coming home with him along with the regular cold and flu germs once he started school and became exposed to lots and lots of opinions and ideas about what boys and girls are supposed to like. (And blame the rest of our culture, advertising, media, etc. that started socializing him basically from before he was born. After all, I’m a tried and true feminist mom, but I’m just one woman.) So it’s not about whether or not my son can fit into a “girls” shirt. It’s about the fact that when you put Wonder Woman in the girls section, when you market strong female icons to girls only, what you end up with is a little boy who had the gall to tell me over breakfast the next day that he doesn’t think Wonder Woman is even “cool.” In fact, he thinks Hawkman (which has got to be the most ridiculously third-string example he could have even come up with) is much cooler than Wonder Woman, simply because she is for girls. Strong women shouldn’t be just for girls. Female role models shouldn’t be just for girls. And I can’t help but think that if those Wonder Woman T-shirts had been sold in both sections of the clothing store for my son’s whole life, he never would have thought they were.  It might be too late for Wonder Woman and my son. But it’s not too late for the next little boy to never know that the badass female cultural icon isn’t “for him.” Because it’s not just girls who need a strong female role model. It’s boys, too. You shouldn’t worry too much about my son, though. He may not be into Wonder Woman, but he proudly wears the ornate, sparkly mood ring I bought him. The kindergarten boys haven’t entirely won yet.  ALSO ON HUFFPOST Suggest a correction Emily McCombs Parents Editorial Director, HuffPost MORE: Feminism Wonder Woman Girls Gender Stereotypes Superheroes Why Little Boys Need Wonder Woman, Too CONVERSATIONS ABOUT US ADVERTISE About Our Ads Contact Us RSS FAQ Careers Archive User Agreement Privacy Policy Comment Policy ©2017 Oath Inc.

Facebook COO and "Lean In" author Sheryl Sandberg is one of the few. Her business acumen and life advice have allowed her to create a personal brand distinct from her boss Mark Zuckerberg and launched her name into conversations worldwide. While CEOs hold much of the media attention due to the weight of their responsibilities, hiring consulting company Topgrading gathered a list of the executives who support the CEOs of 25 American companies. Based on this year's annual Fortune 500 list, which collectively represent two-thirds of the U.S. GDP, here are the five executives from Topgrading's list who made it into the top 10 companies. Greg Foran, president and CEO of Wal-Mart U.S., shared the book "The Good Jobs Strategy" with his boss Doug McMillon (CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.), which McMillon then shared as one of his six most inspiring reads in 2016. When announcing Jeff Williams' promotion, Apple CEO Tim cook said, "Jeff is hands-down the best operations executive I've ever worked with. The Wall Street Journal called Williams a "longtime trusted lieutenant." Of course, Cook himself was once the No.2 to Steve Jobs, one of the most recognizable figures in business, before the Apple founder stepped down from his role as CEO in 2011 due to illness. show chapters Here's how Apple CEO Tim Cook faces the big issues    Thursday, 11 May 2017 | 3:35 PM ET | 01:19 Interestingly, most of the executives on Topgrading's list of 25 second-in-command business leaders work in tech-related fields, have been at their respective companies for at least 20 years and completed an undergraduate or graduate degree from Harvard. Since Berkshire Hathaway executives Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett met in 1959, the duo has been vocal about the importance of friendship, especially their own. "We've had so much fun in our partnership over the years," Buffett tells CNBC in a joint interview with Munger, who calls their partnership "almost hilarious, it's been so much fun."

Aldi, which has its U.S. headquarters in Batavia, Illinois, said it intends to spend $3.4 billion on the roll-out, which the company anticipates will add 25,000 jobs and serve 100 million customers. The expansion would make Aldi the third-largest grocery store in the United States, according to Supermarket News. Aldi currently operates 1,600 stores in 35 states. Its stores are typically smaller than those of other supermarket chains. The announcement sent shares of publicly traded companies with supermarket business lower in afternoon trading. Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) sank 67 cents to $30.11; shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT), the world’s biggest retailer, declined 41 cents to $79.01; and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) pared $1.23 to $179.15 a share. Aldi’s latest announcement builds on its earlier initiative in which the company said it would invest $1.6 billion in renovations for 1,300 stores. Aldi is betting that it can win in the discount grocery space that has been the realm of Wal-Mart. The company, which located its first stores in lower-income areas of the United States when it first came to the United States in the 1990s, is making a push to include more fresh foods and gluten-free options. “We’re growing at a time when other retailers are struggling,” said Chief Executive Officer Jason Hart in a statement. “We are giving our customers what they want, which is more organic produce, antibiotic-free meats and fresh healthier options across the store.” Aldi’s German rival, Lidl, said in May that it plans to open the first of its 100 U.S. stores on June 15, and it is ratcheting up the discount competition by saying it would price products up to 50% lower than rivals.

Man Released from Prison 17 Years Later after Doppelganger with Same Name was Found 12.06.2017 at 6:55 pm By BellaNaija.com 6 Comments Ricky (Left) and Richard Jones (R) | Photo Credit: Kansas City Police Department Due to an eyewitness’ wrong identification, a Kansas man Richard Anthony Jones was sentenced to 19 years imprisonment for aggravated robbery in 1999. After serving 17 years of the term, he was released from the Kansas prison where he was held after a man who bears a striking resemblance with him was found. Jones was found guilty of a robbery in a Walmart store, although there was no DNA or physical evidence linking him to the crime. Back in May of 1999, two men picked up a man named ‘Rick’ at a house in Kansas City, Kansas and went to a Walmart to get money for drugs. Once they pulled into the parking lot, ‘Rick’ jumped out of the vehicle, wrestled a woman to the ground in an attempt to steal her purse, grabbed her cell phone, and got back in the vehicle. All of the witnesses described ‘Rick’ as a Hispanic or light skinned African American, but no one got a good look at ‘Rick’s face. Law enforcement identified the driver of the vehicle. The driver was taken to the police station to look at mugshots in an attempt to identify ‘Rick.’ Law enforcement typed the names ‘Rick’ and ‘Richard’ into their database. After viewing over 200 photographs, the driver eventually picked out Richard Jones. Witnesses only remembered that the suspect had light skin, so they all chose the only light-skinned man in the lineup: Richard Jones. He had tried to appeal his conviction but did not succeed. His hopes were raised again after other inmates in the prison where he was held told him about another inmate, Ricky that looks just like him. “When I saw the picture of my double it all made sense to me,” Jones said. He told Midwest Innocence Project (MIP), a non-profit organisation that helps secure the release of people who have been wrongfully convicted, about the development and they took it up from there.   Investigations revealed that Ricky lived near the scene of the crime – Kansas City, Kansas – and Jones lived in Kansas City, Missouri. Ricky not only has ties to the Kansas City, Kansas community, but also lived at the exact address where the suspect was picked up by the two men in the vehicle back in May of 1999. Jones’ lawyers also argued that Jones had said he was with his girlfriend and her family at the time of the crime. After the testimony of several witnesses, including the victim of the robbery, Judge Kevin Moriarty of the Johnson County District Court ordered Jones’ release. The witnesses testified that after looking at photographs of both men, they could no longer say Jones was the man who committed the crime. All four witnesses were asked to identify ‘Rick.’ Three of them did not even bother as they claimed that they couldn’t distinguish between the men. One witness did choose who believed to be the suspect — and he chose Ricky. All four witnesses admitted that they would not have been able to tell the difference between Richard and Ricky at the time of the robbery. The judge said no juror would have convicted Jones based on the new evidence. Ricky, however denied committing the crime. Jones’ lawyers said that he was identified after his photograph was picked out of a police database three months after the robbery. They described the list of photos as “highly suggestive,” stating that “None of the other photos matched the description provided by the witnesses.” A GoFundMe campaign has been set up to help Jones adjust to life outside prison.

The Oklahoma-based tribe filed the lawsuit in April in tribal court. On June 8, the companies argued in federal court that the case doesn’t belong in tribal court and should be dismissed. Along with Walmart, the lawsuit names CVS, Walgreens and major drug distributors in the U.S. The lawsuit blames pharmacies and distributors for “consciously oversupplying the market in and around Cherokee Nation with highly addictive prescription opioids.” According to the Tulsa World, more than 350 Cherokee citizens died from opioid abuse between 2003 and 2014.

But many Americans are not yet familiar with the discount grocery chain, here are some tips before you arrive. Bring your own bags Not only to you bag your own groceries, but you need to provide your own bags. If you forget, Aldi is more than happy to charge you for theirs Make sure you have a quarter in your pocket The shopping carts are locked up and you need a quarter to take one. You get your quarter back when you return it. This helps prevent the staff from having to chase after carts in the parking lot. Don't expect a big selection Aldi's selection is just a fraction of a typical supermarket. Limiting inventory helps limit prices. Check store hours before you arrive Store hours are often limited to keep labor costs down during slow periods of the day. Look for Aldi-exclusive brands The company claims their private labels can save you 50% off of the nationally recognized names.

A man was shot early Monday on Knollwood Drive in Parma, police said.(File photo) By Jane Morice, cleveland.com jmorice@cleveland.com PARMA, Ohio -- A woman was arrested Monday after a man walked into a Walmart near the Brooklyn-Parma border with a gunshot wound in his chest. Parma police were called about 12:15 a.m. to the 5200 block of Knollwood Drive, between Brookpark Road and Westview Drive, Parma police spokesman Capt. Kevin Riley said in a statement. A 29-year-old woman called police to say that she had shot a 35-year-old man, Riley said. The woman told them that the shooting victim had left after the shooting scene. Police received a call from the victim moments later after he walked into the vestibule of the Brookpark Road Walmart and collapsed, Riley said. First responders rushed the victim to MetroHealth, Riley said. His current condition is unknown. The woman was taken into custody, but she has not been charged as of Monday afternoon, Riley said. The circumstances of the shooting remain under investigation, Riley said. The relationship between the accused shooter and the victim has not been released.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 1 Stock I Can't Wait to Buy on Sale Will the bull market ever end? If it does, here's what these analysts will be buying. Brian Stoffel, Tyler Crowe, and Timothy Green (TMFCheesehead) Jun 12, 2017 at 11:04AM The bull market we are experiencing has gone beyond just about anyone's wildest predictions. Since the nadir of the Nasdaq in March 2009, it has almost quintupled -- and that's not including dividends! While that's great news for folks invested along the way, it puts those with new money in an odd position: Buy now, near market highs, or wait until an inevitable dip? Image source: Getty Images We here at The Motley Fool are distinctly not in the group that calls for trying to time the market. At the same time, we realize the utility of a healthy watch list of stock candidates to buy in a market swoon. Below, three of our analysts talk about why they're ready to snatch up shares of Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Canadian National Railways (NYSE:CNI), and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP)...once prices fall. I could be in for a long wait for this one to go on sale again Tyler Crowe (Canadian National Railway): I have a pretty long wish list of companies I want to own, but I just can't quite get over the hurdle of paying a high premium. The idea is that when we have the next epic market pullback -- despite what this bull market makes us believe, they still happen -- I will buy a bundle of these businesses with incredible economic moats at much better prices than what I can buy them for today. One company that hovers at the top of this list is Canadian National Railway. Canadian National Railway is the quintessential high economic moat business. Rail is a transport method that can move goods at almost orders of magnitude less cost than truck or air freight; the barriers to entry for new players are almost insurmountable; economies of scale give immense benefits to the big fish; and companies that do own particular rail lines have near monopolistic control. It's incredibly hard envisioning a world 20, 30, or even 50 years from now where rail isn't playing a pivotal role in transportation.  Canadian National Rail takes those competitive advantages and amplifies them as the only railroad company in North America with lines connecting the Atlantic, Pacific, and U.S. Gulf Coasts, and is the most efficient operator in the business. Considering all these things, it's no wonder that shares of Canadian National trade at a pretty lofty enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 13.  The one thing to know about rail stocks, though, is that they very much track economic growth. When the economy hits a rough patch, shares of railroad stocks tend to get hit pretty hard. When that happens, I think there is a decent chance I will be able to pick up shares of Canadian National Rail at a much better price than what I would pay today.  Still waiting for this e-commerce star to stumble Brian Stoffel (Shopify): Perhaps I'm a glutton for punishment. Just three months ago, I called out Shopify -- a company providing a software as a service (SaaS) platform for companies to build an e-commerce presence -- as a stock I was waiting to buy on sale. The sale never arrived. Shares are up 61% over that short time frame. Obviously, buying back then would have been better than waiting. So why I am taking the same approach? There are two reasons: first, the company already occupies over 3.5% of my real-life holdings. Second, I know that the market's strongest growers over the long run often suffer harrowing falls. The company itself is absolutely on fire. Because switching costs are so high for any small or medium-sized business once it signs onto Shopify's platform, each additional customer's revenue is very stable. Throw in add-on services and there are multiple levers that can help Shopify continue to grow sales in the decade to come. Shopify's first quarter results are a big reason shares have advanced so much. Revenue jumped 75%, buoyed by add-on merchant services. Gross margins expanded by 270 basis points. And gross merchandise value -- a measure of how much people are selling via the company's platform -- advanced over 80%. Now, if the market could just cut me a little slack, I could make it an even stronger driver of returns moving forward. A retail giant that's fighting back Tim Green (Wal-Mart Stores): It can be difficult to imagine a world where Amazon.com isn't the undisputed king of online retail, given how dominant it is today. But Wal-Mart, the Amazon of its day in some ways, is aiming to disrupt the disrupter. The company is shaking things up, offering free two-day shipping on orders over $35 and offering discounts on certain online orders picked up in-store. Wal-Mart is even testing paying its store employees to drop off packages on their way home from work, all in an effort to slash shipping costs. These initiatives are paying off. Wal-Mart's e-commerce sales grew by 63% year over year during the first quarter, more than double its rate of growth during the previous quarter. At the same time, the company's stores are performing well. U.S. comparable sales rose 1.4% during the first quarter, with traffic rising by 1.5%. Wal-Mart even managed to grow per-share earnings, a sign that heavy investments in higher wages and e-commerce were the right call. I think Wal-Mart is doing exactly what it needs to do to compete in a world where retail sales are increasingly shifting online. The market seems to agree, pushing shares of Wal-Mart up 13% over the past year. Wal-Mart stock isn't all that expensive, trading for about 18 times 2016 earnings. But I plan on waiting for a lower price, given that a price war with Amazon won't be cheap. As you can see below, Brian already owns shares of Shopify, but Tim and Tyler can't wait to get their hands on Wal-Mart and Canadian National shares, respectively. All three would be good to put on your own watch list for the next market swoon. Brian Stoffel owns shares of Amazon and Shopify. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. Tyler Crowe has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon, Canadian National Railway, and Shopify. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

If you don't know Aldi, that will probably change by 2022. The low-cost grocery chain was already planning on expanding its 1,650 stores to 2,000 by the end of 2018. The company now says it will be at 2,500 locations by the end of 2022 thanks to a $3.4 billion investment. Reuters reports that count will make it the third largest grocery chain in America. Kroger—which also owns Fry's, Ralphs, and Harris Teeter—has about 2,800 supermarkets; Walmart is at about 4,700. The German company focuses on private-label goods, as Trader Joe's does—so no Kraft macaroni and cheese—and says it aims to give customers organic produce and meat raised without antibiotics. How the AP paints the move: more competition for traditional grocers, Walmart, and organics-focused chains like Whole Foods. CEO Jason Hart in May told Reuters its prices were in some cases half of what supermarkets charge. "We're growing at a time when other retailers are struggling."

It's a love/hate relationship. I do save money, but the produce quality is not great. I've had strawberries that are sour and hard and never ripen. Some fruit and veggies seem to go from under ripe to rotten without ever reaching its peak. Occasionally I'll find good produce, but I generally only shop there for packaged foods now. They have the same price as s SAMs or Costco, just in smaller quantities. dukebravo Jun 12, 2017 6:23 PM CDT I shop at Aldi and love it. I'm not driven by cost, although that's a nice bonus. Their private label stuff is usually impressive, there are lots of great European products I would not find and try otherwise, and tons of fresh and organic choices. One of my favorites: 12 oz fozen ahi tuna steaks, portion packed, for $4.99. Can't be beat! Aka Mogg Jun 12, 2017 2:53 PM CDT The big chains in L.A. are a big disappointment. Ralph's, Von's and Albertson's all try for an upscale appearance but sell run of the mill big brand products (themselves trying to throw off the reputation for decades of poor quality, unhealthful ingredients and high prices) and the thing I find most disappointing is their produce, which is abysmal. Smaller local groceries have not been able to compete and so have higher prices on off brands and imports and typically bad produce, too. Trader Joes is a fair improvement although the prices tend to be high and the selection limited. A broad inventory of reasonably priced quality foods and a well run, well stocked produce department would be a Godsend. We don't need the fancy lighting, boutique departments and uniformed staff.

Digital Trends Home > Gaming > How to pre-order the Xbox One X How to pre-order the Xbox One X Xbox One X is available for pre-order on Amazon, GameStop, and more By Gabe Gurwin — Updated June 13, 2017 1:04 pm Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you The Xbox One X console releases on November 7 for $500. Here's how to make sure you have it in your hands on the first day. Microsoft fully unveiled the Xbox One X at its E3 press conference on June 11, and what it showed was the most impressive piece of gaming hardware we’ve ever seen from the company. Capable of playing games at native 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, it could easily become the go-to platform for third-party developers moving forward. It’s also the smallest Xbox console ever made, which should give you plenty of extra space for a 4K, HDR-capable television. The console arrives on November 7 for $500. But how can you get your hands on one? Here’s how to pre-order the Xbox One X. Amazon Amazon doesn’t currently have Xbox One X pre-orders in stock, but the website has set up a product page of the console that allows you to add it to a wish list. Previously, the page also had an email notification button so Amazon users could be notified the second the console became available, but this isn’t currently on the page. We suggest checking back here often for any updates to the listing. GameStop Retailer GameStop doesn’t actually have a final listing for the Xbox One X console yet, but it does have a sign-up page for updates on the console, still referred to on the website as “Project Scorpio.” Just enter your name, email address, and phone number here to receive a message as soon as pre-order details are available. If GameStop’s plan is anything like what it did with the Nintendo Switch launch, expect to see several higher-priced bundles as well, featuring additional games that make use of the Xbox One X’s increased horsepower. Walmart Walmart’s website currently has a final listing for the Xbox One X, complete with its $500 price tag and an in-stock alert button so you can be notified as soon as the console is available for pre-order. Walmart has been pretty good about quickly resupplying its console stocks, as well, so don’t fret if you don’t manage to pre-order the console in its first “wave.” Target Like with Walmart, Target has a final listing for the Xbox One X available on its website. Though there isn’t an email notification system in place for the item, you can add it to a gift registry in order to let any loved ones know that you’re interested in getting it. Best Buy Best Buy’s Xbox One X page is almost identical to Walmart’s with a notification alert system so you can receive a message as soon as the console is available, as well as a gift registry. Best Buy was the first major retailer to have pre-orders available for the Nintendo Switch earlier this year, so be sure to keep an eye out for surprise announcements — you can easily cancel your order if you decide to buy it somewhere else later on.
clock menu more-arrow Melissa Deckert and Nicole Licht Longform Fear of the Future in Texas A road trip through the hipster coffee and craft beer drag of Tea Party country by Bijan Stephen@bijanstephen Jun 12, 2017, 8:28am EDT tweet share pin In late December, as the country was beginning to reckon with the national convulsion that was the presidential election, I flew from New York City to Tyler, Texas, a smallish town in the eastern part of the state. From the air, Tyler is a tight constellation of lights twinkling against the heavy dark encircling it, the aptly named Piney Woods: lush, humid, and Bigfoot country. On the road, from my rented red compact, the contrast was starker — I felt as though I was driving through the oil that’s trapped beneath the surface of East Texas, which, along with cotton and farming, is what drew settlers here in the first place. The roads are wide and curve gently, and I was the only pair of headlights drifting through the night. Tyler also happens to be my hometown. I came back to take a road trip that would lead me in a 365-mile route through Houston and Austin, ostensibly to eat and drink and shoot the shit with friends who came home for the holidays. But mostly I was here to take the temperature of the place in the quiet days before Donald Trump’s inauguration as president. My destinations represented a blueing political inclination — from the bloody crimson heart of Tea Party country in Tyler to the cornflower dot on the map in Houston, where Texas’s demographic future rests, to Austin, a liberal sapphire near the middle of the state. The future is a scary thing to most people, but to me it always seemed like Texans were more afraid than anyone else; the state was always on the forefront of sweeping demographic changes — Houston is “majority minority,” to borrow a ridiculous phrase, and, by some measures, is the most diverse city in the country — and is also uniquely afraid of losing its heritage. This, I think, has to do with the state’s independent history: Texans still like to boast, incorrectly, that their state can secede whenever it wants. Nostalgia more than anything powers these fantasies. In itself that isn’t a bad thing; people here settle in the same spot their ancestors did, defending the same patch of land from intruders, and modernizing only the few traditions that demand it. The rub is that outsiders are drawn to that independence, that nostalgia. The state’s promise to its residents is simple: You keep what you can carve out of the soil. We won’t help you, but we won’t interfere either. It’s appealing in so many ways to people looking for a fresh start, a place to call home, a place to have great-grandchildren and give back to your community. But the promise only ever extends to certain people, and Southern manners dictate this never becomes explicit. In Tyler, it looks like a surgically segregated population. The dividing line is Gentry Parkway: to its north are the black and Hispanic people the rest of the town never seems to think about. Texas is a state at war with itself. Writing now, December feels like a world away. I mean, what were we even listening to? (Billboard suggests “Closer,” by The Chainsmokers and Halsey.) My memories of the time are oddly clouded — remembering it feels like watching a movie through glasses with dirty lenses, or like trying to observe fish in an algae-strangled pond. I suspect this amnesia is a result of how quickly the awful predictions made in the wake of Donald Trump’s election were proven wrong, and how everything has seemed to turn out for the worse. There is an ascendant streak of nastiness in this country, one that historically precedes brutality; America is a deeply racist country, and Texas is a bellwether. A month ago in Houston, James Scott Lee II, a suspected member of the Aryan Brotherhood — a white supremacist prison gang that’s been around for 53 years — took to the streets to kill a random black man. “I hate niggers and I’m gonna kill me one today,” Lee said, while he threatened the other man with a knife. About a week before I landed in Texas in December, the Texas Observer began tracking “hate incidents” across the state, because of a spike in race-related violence after the November election. The list is updated regularly. I spent my first day in Tyler mostly in the front seat of Jamie’s car, a black Infiniti he’s had since at least our junior year of high school. It was the day after Christmas, and the town was quieter than usual; there wasn’t much traffic. We fell into the usual pattern. He drove, fiddling with the music, while I made conversation. Today the car is filled with the detritus that accumulates during a long drive: Jamie had risen in the wee hours to make his way west from Auburn, Alabama, a nine-and-a-half-hour journey. He was heavier than he used to be, because he owns an internet consultancy which leaves him no time to cook for himself, he said; his hair was as red as I remembered, though, and his driving — very fast, very methodical — reminded me of the nights we’d go exploring in empty neighborhoods and on dead-end streets. Tyler is a place unremarkable in every aspect, and that, paradoxically, is its most remarkable feature; it is the apotheosis of the American suburb, leaning its ass out against the untamed wilderness of the prairie. Fast-food restaurants and Walmarts blinked by outside, as Jamie pointed out new stores in suburban retail complexes that, to me, all looked the same. When we did this in high school, the sights were similar: Taco Bell, McDonalds, Whataburger, small Walmart, larger Walmart. A yard in Tyler, Texas There are generations of people in Tyler, especially in the few families that have their names on everything in town. They built the town and established its customs. The first, and earliest, is evident in the founders’ decision to keep the city away from Texas’s highway system: Thou shalt have no riffraff, especially not those who might blow in and out like tumbleweeds. The people there are rooted. They stay. My parents, Caribbean immigrants and no great fans of the place, made Tyler their home for just about twenty years. They left their youth there, and then they lit out for California. Everything in Tyler flows from this first rule. Because of it the place does not care what’s en vogue; it acknowledges no new trends. There are debutante balls. And everyone has a very long memory. Being the high school prom king is an identity you can inhabit for the rest of your life, if you want to. Which is why it feels like a lacquered place, culturally speaking, even if it doesn’t necessarily appear that way; each year is a thin coat that preserves whatever’s beneath. And in that light, 2017 and 1940 don’t look that different, if you’re there and you glance at it a certain way. Of course, that only goes for the privileged parts of town. In the other parts, the public schools are abysmal and violent, and there are no sidewalks, I’m told, because the city declines to fund them. This all generally went unacknowledged, which is so purely American, or at least as American as baseball and apple pie. It’s a symptom of a larger conservative pathology: Ignore everything in the past or present that doesn’t directly — or seemingly directly — threaten you. On the Texas State Historical Association website’s section for Tyler’s history, for example, it’s how slavery and its effects only get three sentences in a 1,479 word piece: As in much of East Texas, the city's economy was heavily dependent on slavery. In 1860 more than 35 percent of the total population of 1,021 were slaves. Not surprisingly, Tyler residents voted overwhelmingly for secession, and local men volunteered for army service in large numbers. During the Civil War Tyler was the site of the largest Confederate ordnance plant in Texas, and in 1863 a large Confederate prison camp, known as Camp Ford, was built four miles to the northeast. With so much of its wealth invested in slavery, Tyler and Smith County suffered from an economic depression in the early post war period. There’s no mention of slavery on the city’s Wikipedia page. There’s not even a history section. In middle school, every kid looked forward to their visit to Camp Ford. I distinctly remember feeling haunted when I got home. Which is something I’ve also felt on some roads in Tyler — mostly the ones that dead end in dark woods, where no light seems to filter through the trees, no matter how bright it is. Places that seem to have a history but no memory. While Jamie and I were driving around the city killing time, he got me up to speed on the new developments in town while he drove us to On The Border. Jamie got the unlimited enchiladas. Actually unlimited, too — he got a full second order before tapping out. I had chicken tacos, and I could tell the artisanal boom has passed this particular chain outpost by: The bland chicken, slathered in some kind of cheese, was at least twice as greasy and salty as it needed to be to qualify as comfort food, while the rice was just overcooked enough to signal it had been prepared in an assembly line. As we ate, we covered the usual subjects — politics, religion, old memories. We decided to text Eric, another old friend, and he showed up about half an hour into our meal; Eric returned to Tyler after graduating from college in upstate New York, and was now studying to be a nurse. He didn’t waste time before asking who we’d voted for. Jamie said he’d voted for Gary Johnson as a protest — his business, self-owned and -operated since college, had turned him into a hardcore libertarian — and Eric said, after a tense pause, he’d voted for Hillary Clinton. Same, I said. It was a relief to hear Tyler hadn’t turned my friend who still lived there into a Republican fanatic, as it’s done with most everyone I knew there, at least since high school. During the 2008 election, discussing politics in my high school had become a minefield. Most of my peers inherited their parents’ political views, and many of them had found the Tea Party’s energy seductive. At the same time, we all had access to the internet; my classmates were being polarized more quickly than ever. That was also the year my chemistry teacher informed us that “global warming” was a myth, and then played a documentary that purported to prove it. I distinctly recall a biology substitute teacher — normally a gym instructor and football coach, who at the time lived in the school’s athletics field house — who taught our class that the Earth was only 5,000 years old, and that fossils weren’t real. (Jamie still has the notes.) On the other side of the spectrum, the anatomy teacher taught undercover contraception against the wishes of the administration, which would have us believe that abstinence was the best form of birth control. (That class was always popular.) The next day, I met Peyton, a friend from high school, for lunch. He’s a salesman and soccer coach these days, but still has an unbotheredness I remember from school. He lives with his girlfriend in an honest-to-god house, and his rent is perhaps a third of what passes for normal in New York. He seems content, and told me as much over lunch at Happy’s Fish House, a spot that serves massive plates of expertly fried seafood. It’s newish, with kitschy sea-inspired decor — bits of rigging, pulleys, fish on plaques. The food is Southern, but there’s a definite bayou influence; the Louisiana state border is only about 45 minutes east of where Peyton and I were sitting. He filled me in on the gossip while I munched on a fried shrimp po’ boy and worked my way through some hush puppies. After lunch we drive downtown to the new coffee shop, The Foundry, which happens to be inside a church; the nitro cold brew is delicious, and also the first I’d ever had in town. We sat outside — it was literally 74 degrees and sunny, which is unfathomable in late December — and we talked about our ambitions. Peyton told me he wants to start a T-shirt business, and also a high-end craft whiskey distillery, maybe using a moonshine recipe he knows. I told him what I was looking for, and mentioned just how different the town seemed. Tyler felt positively progressive, or at least appeared that way because it had suddenly started acquiring the trappings of a larger city — a craft beer brewery, more than one venue for bands, a nascent startup scene. (Just then, a man on a fixie rolled up, dismounted, and flounced into the coffee shop; he wouldn’t have looked out of place in Austin, Brooklyn, or Paris.) This was important, because Tyler is the only place I know where aesthetics can reliably predict politics. Peyton agreed, and told me a lot had changed, politically speaking. Despite Rep. Louie Gohmert and Sen. John Cornyn’s political dominance — Gohmert is a member of the Freedom Caucus, the far-right, ultraconservative wing of the Republican party; in 2013, the National Journal ranked Cornyn, the senior senator from Texas, the 14th most conservative member of the Senate — not as many people as you’d think are fans of Trump, Peyton said. Especially not the youths. To me it seemed dubious that a place known for hardline conservatism could change so dramatically within a decade. According to former NPR journalist Tasneem Raja, though, who moved down to Tyler a few years ago, I’m not imagining things. “There’s a real feeling that Tyler is moving in a new direction,” she said when I reached her by phone a few months after I’d returned to New York. “The old guard is losing their grip.” These days, Raja and her husband publish The Tyler Loop, a local interest website. It’s their way of setting down roots. “Gohmert represents the sort of old guard Tyler,” Raja continued. But for the first time, people feel that the congressman’s reelection isn’t a given. “You hear people saying: ‘For the longest time, I thought I was the only one,’” she told me. “They kind of kept their heads down, and it felt unsafe: personally, socially, politically. That isn’t the case anymore.” They have, Raja said, strength in numbers. Tyler – Houston Every road has its own personality, because speed is a character trait; there are some that move you the way molasses drips, and others that are white-knuckle contests of survival. In Texas, the drivers have a calm disregard for other vehicles that fluctuates based on their size. A rule of thumb: the smaller your car, the more disregard you generate. It’s a variation on another pillar of Texan society — the implicit threat. You can’t hurt me, but I can hurt you. My own car was very small. I played Hell Hath No Fury at the beginning and the end of the three-hour drive south to Houston, because it’s a fitting accompaniment to driving in Texas: Clipse’s coke-rap masterpiece is all about implicit threats, and the ability to make that violence explicit. That ethos, too, is part of the state’s language, built into the way people down here communicate with each other. Even simple things are rendered in the language of violence; it stems from the wariness independence requires. You can’t protect your homestead if you let everyone in willy-nilly, because that’s a good way to get robbed. If you remind everyone who comes by you’re not to be fucked with — whether that’s with a gun or with your fists — you can ensure people play by the rules. This logic extends from properties to bodies, and it’s why the bars down here crackle with a peculiar energy. The night before I left Tyler, I went with Eric to Rose City Draft House, a newish craft beer spot with 57 taps. While we were filling each other in on the last four years, a fight broke out between a man and a woman I presumed was his girlfriend, directly in front of our table. As best I can tell, it started because she told him she wanted to go home, and he was mad she’d distracted him from his conversation with a buddy. He was perhaps twice as large as her; he physically loomed over her and began to yell. When he was done she walked away, back to her friend. The man turned to his friend and continued his conversation. The bar didn’t quiet down. Nobody but me seemed to notice anything had happened at all. Houston Houston is gigantic: nearly two and a half million people spread across 667 square miles, which makes it the fourth most populous city in the country and the largest city in the south. When you’re driving in, the city doesn’t loom on the horizon like New York or Los Angeles; the highway deposits you directly in the disconcerting mass of it. I was there to visit my friend Abigail. She’s been bouncing between New York, Boston, and Houston since graduating from school a few years ago. In Texas she lives with her family in one of the tonier parts of the city, on a tree-lined street in a neighborhood tucked away from urban bustle. When I pulled into her driveway, five or six of her giant lurchers (a mix of various hound breeds, most notably the Scottish deerhound, I learned) ran to greet me. We made dinner reservations at Underbelly, which people say is one of the best restaurants in Houston, with drinks at Anvil — a posh bar — first. Abigail is singular, generous, and private. I see her when I’m in her town, and vice versa, often enough that it’s always a pleasant surprise to see her. At Anvil, she ordered a tequila and I got a Manhattan; she was a bit manic that night and I was looking for an adventure, so we ordered a second and Abigail struck up a conversation with the woman next to her, Giovanna, who looked like she was waiting for a date (she was, but he was a flighty soccer player) and decided to join us for dinner at Underbelly. We got a table for three and ordered wine; the menus were written inside the covers of old children’s books — mine was literally called “The Value Of Responsibility,” and featured a black cartoon man side-hugging a Gumby-looking skyscraper? We shared some unremarkable meat, cured in a room abutting the bathrooms, and it was fine. Later we went to the club, which was also fine; at certain hours every club is the same, no matter where it is or who’s inside. What’s better than fine is going to Whataburger, a Texas-born chain, at the very end, at whatever hour it is, and gorging on warm cheesy salty meaty burgers. Hangover palliative at Avalon Diner in Houston Abigail and I recovered the next morning at the Avalon Diner — their motto, “Justly Famous since 1938,” feels like an understatement; the place is a monument to the mysterious power of a perfectly tuned diner breakfast — and didn’t talk politics until later, at the Menil, an oil-moneyed free art museum, when her friend joined us and I had to explain race in America in front of the Picassos. Which is something I feel like I can’t escape in Texas. In New York I rarely have to explain myself, and I’m almost never called on to speak on behalf of Black People In America. Down south, people seem to feel more entitled to my time and energy than they do anywhere else, especially if they’re a friend of a friend who feels comfortable enough to ask me what they wouldn’t dare ask someone else. Abigail apologized for the guy later. The Picassos were beautiful, though. One of them was a portrait of Abigail’s grandmother, done in pencil; she watched over the three of us as we left the exhibit. I brought up the rear and didn’t look back until the city receded in my rearview mirror. Houston – Austin Clipse again. I supplemented with podcasts, this time, because it makes me feel like there’s someone in the passenger seat. The three-hour drive west was easy enough — Google says there are only five directions to follow to get to Austin. Which means that the time becomes an opportunity to meditate. Driving in Texas is different than most of the rest of the country, because it’s hard to comprehend how big and empty it is. If you take the highways, you can spend hours before you see another town; country roads, on the other hand, take you through countless forgettable, one-stoplight towns. The landscapes are beautiful but unchanging, at least in the eastern part of the state — heavy woods give way to pasture, and back again. I lost myself in the rhythm of the highway, and didn’t notice I’d reached the outskirts of Austin until the speed limit dropped and a fog descended. Austin I arrived at sunset. I’d left myself two days here, because Austin is supposed to be fun — and it was, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was in a budget version of Los Angeles. I spent a lot of time in my car, alone, observing the way the city moves in the last days of a climactic year. To Tylerites, Austin is the city on a hill, a place to aspire to. (The most popular t-shirt at Racquet and Jog, the most popular sporting goods store in Tyler, reads “Keep Austin Weird.”) It’s slow in the morning, even though brunch spots are packed early, I noticed over a sublime waffle sandwich from Forthright — smoked bacon, Gruyère, eggs over easy, topped with maple syrup. I have two friends from high school here, Eric T. and Jerry, and I saw both of them before I left. They’re different now from when I knew them in Tyler — it’s like they’re more curious than they were, or perhaps more accurately, they are more cognizant of what life can be like. What I’m trying to describe is a flowering: an opening to the world, and a new understanding of all the different lives they could lead. The sense that there’s a single path, established by strictly policed norms, has vanished. Jerry traded Tyler for Austin after high school. He went to the University of Texas here and studied mechanical engineering. When we went out for bulgogi burgers at a place he recommended, Burger Tex 2, I got the distinct impression that he’s happier here than anywhere else. Burger Tex 2 is a hole in the wall that has Korean “takes” on classic American dishes, which mostly means adding a lot of kimchi. This burger was unlike any I’d had before, and I mean that in a totally neutral way. Jerry told me about his life here — his brother just started at UT in engineering, like him, and his sister is back in Tyler, he said. The conversation never turned to politics, which I was thankful for — and I’m thankful for how easy it still was to speak to him. The burger left me full for the rest of the night and the next morning. Austin is a place that can tell you who you are, if you don’t happen to know already — there’s an identity there to inhabit, a mode of being. It’s hip, funky, and inescapably Texan, which is undemanding and easy to tailor to your personality, especially if you’re moving to escape a more repressive corner of the state. My friend Eric T. from high school said as much. He moved to Austin because he and his girlfriend wanted to get out of Tyler. He’s happy there too, happier than I’ve ever seen him: they’ve started to build a life together, a warm little family. I dropped in on them on my last evening in Texas. We watched movies and TV and played with the dogs. I think we talked a little about politics, but what I remember most is feeling safe in their apartment — or, if not safe, less apprehensive of the future. I left for New York City in the wee hours of the next morning, while everything was still quiet, and I could pretend nothing would change. Correction: Whataburger is Texas-born, but not Texas-only.

The luncheon will be held Aug. 22 at the Embassy Suites in Rogers. It is sponsored by Intrust Bank. “I’m excited to help recognize some of our community’s emerging leaders; leadership is a process, and what got you to where you’re at today isn’t always what will keep you there or get you to the next level,” Hasan said. “Leaders must continually grow themselves while also looking for ways to use their influence and platform to help lift up others — that’s the secret to building a lasting legacy within your family, company and community.” Hasan is the chief culture, diversity and inclusion officer for Wal-Mart, working to bring a more global perspective to the retail giant’s diversity efforts, with a focus on maintaining an inclusive workforce within the company. He was appointed to the role in 2015. He joined the company in 2008, as senior vice president of strategic services for Walmart Technology. Before joining Wal-Mart, Hasan worked at Dell Inc. for 11 years where he held several leadership positions in IT for teams in Texas, Shanghai, Taipei and Singapore. He also served as general manager for Dell’s IT development centers in Brazil and India. Prior to Dell, Hasan had a 14-year career with ENSERCH Corp., an oil and gas company based in Dallas. While there, he gained experience in several departments including IT, human resources, rates and regulatory affairs and customer service. Hasan holds a master’s degree in business administration from Amber University in Dallas and a bachelor’s in business administration, with a concentration in computer science, from Temple University. Ben Hasan Beginning in 1997, the Business Journal has annually honored 40 outstanding professionals under the age of 40 who live and work in the six-county coverage area of Benton, Washington, Carroll, Madison, Sebastian and Crawford counties. They were nominated as best in class by their peers in all industries. This year’s Forty Under 40 issue will be available on newsstands and online Monday, Aug. 21. “We had more than 100 individuals nominated for this year’s class, which is the most broad and varied we’ve had in some time,” said Business Journal editor Paul Gatling. “Just looking at the pool of nominations already reads like a who’s who of Northwest Arkansas and the Fort Smith metro, but we can select only 40, and that will be no small task for our staff. “I want to congratulate all our nominees, but also more importantly point out this isn’t a one-shot deal. If you nominated someone who isn’t selected this year, nominate them again next year.” Corporate tables and advance tickets for the Forty Under 40 event are available by calling 479-725-0394, or by visiting NWABusinessJournal.com.

The privately held German grocery store said it plans to increase its store base to 2,500 by 2022, the company said Monday. Aldi currently operates 1,600 U.S. stores. In February, the retailer announced it was investing $1.6 billion in its U.S. stores, with plans to remodel and expand more than 1,300 stores by 2020. The new openings are expected to create 25,000 jobs over the next five years and make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the U.S. behind Walmart and Kroger (KR)  , serving 100 million customers a month.  The retailer said it was "bucking the trend plaguing many retailers by accelerating its growth of new stores with a total capital investment of $5 billion in new and remodeled stores over the next five years." Aldi's plan comes as fellow German discounter Lidl is set to open its first 10 stores in the U.S. on Thursday, June 15. Lidl plans to open 200 stores in the coming years. In May, Lidl said it would price products up to 50% lower than rivals. Aldi for its part also plans to keep prices significantly lower than traditional food retailers. "We're growing at a time when other retailers are struggling. We are giving our customers what they want, which is more organic produce, antibiotic-free meats and fresh healthier options across the store, all at unmatched prices up to 50 percent lower than traditional grocery stores," ALDI's U.S. CEO Jason Hart said in a statement.  He told Reuters in May the chain intended to have prices at least 21% lower than rivals and would focus on adding in-house brands for price-sensitive customers. Aldi and Lidl have been known to upset local markets. In the U.K., the low-cost competitors have upset the traditional grocery store market. Sales at Aldi grew by 19.8% and Lidl racked up an increase of 18.3% in the 12 weeks to May 21, according to data from Kantar Worldpanel, while traditional supermarkets saw sales grow by just 1.6%. The German chains' rapid growth took their combined market share to a new high of 12%. Walmart isn't just sitting on the sidelines however, executives are preparing to compete with the German companies, as well as its U.S. peers. "The work that's been done to be positioned to compete started happening two years ago," Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told the Wall Street Journal in May. Walmart's shares fell 0.2% to $79.24 at Monday's end. Visit here for the latest business headlines.

State police at Schuylkill Haven reported on the incident and declined to name the victim but released the following details of the scam. The victim received a email from a person to see if she would like to be a Walmart secret shopper. When the victim inquired about the program, she was promised between $450 and $900 per month for her to shop. The victim was then sent at “assignment” via 2 day USPS shipping. The package included a check for $2,970 with the instructions that the victim keep $450 and use the remaining money to purchase Walmart gift cards, photograph the security numbers on the cards and email the pictures of the cards to the suspect. The victim complied, purchased the gift cards in $500 increments and sent the pictures of the cards. Two days later another package arrived from the same suspect with a check from a different bank but for the same $2,970 with the same instructions. The victim purchased additional cards and sent photographs of them to the suspect. The next day the first check cashed by the victim was returned for being from a closed account. By the time the victim received the notice she had already purchased 8 sets of $500 gift cards which had been drained of the money. Anyone with information concerning this incident is asked to contact Trooper Daniel P. Hillbish at 570-739-1330.

But, just looking at revenue numbers doesn’t give a full picture on how these companies compare – and many investors care much more about a different performance metric: profit. Thankfully, today’s data visualization from Ishtyaq Habib shows the top 100 biggest companies by market value, but uses circles to represent both the revenue and profit for each company. There’s also an interactive version of the same chart here as well, which highlights the specific numbers for each company highlighted. APPLE = A MONEY-MAKING MACHINE The first noticeable difference in this version? It’s that Apple is unparalleled in its ability to make money. In fact, Apple’s 2016 profit of $45 billion is far bigger than any other company, including Berkshire Hathaway ($24 billion), JPMorgan Chase ($24 billion), Wells Fargo ($22 billion), Alphabet ($19 billion), Samsung ($19 billion), Toyota ($17 billion), Johnson & Johnson ($16 billion), or Walmart ($14 billion). The only companies that can compare with Apple were Chinese banks like ICBC, Agricultural Bank of China, or China Construction Bank, but in many ways these state-owned enterprises are on an entirely different playing field, anyways. Also impressive: Apple’s profits are bigger than the revenues of massive companies like Coca-Cola ($41.5 billion) or Facebook ($27.6 billion). MARGINS, SCHMARGINS Unfortunately, not every company can make a 21% profit margin on $217 billion of revenue like Apple. Other organizations need to rely on razor-thin margins and volume to make things work. Walmart only brought in $14 billion of profit off of a whopping $485 billion of revenue – a margin of just 2.8%. Meanwhile, fast-growing Amazon was in a similar boat with margins of 1.7%, largely provided by its wildly successful AWS service. Lastly, it is also worth noting that some on the list did not make a margin at all. These are mostly companies that are suffering from the challenges of down cycles in natural resources. Chevron and mining giant Glencore, for example, were two of the Top 100 Companies that both lost money in 2016, while BP essentially broke even.

 Things are getting pretty tough for traditional supermarkets Wolf Richter, Wolf Street Jun. 13, 2017, 6:01 PM 3,756 facebook linkedin twitter email print An Albertson's store in California. REUTERS/Fred Prouser Today, Albertson’s explained in an amended S-4 filing for a debt exchange offering just how tough things have gotten for traditional supermarket chains. As is so often the case, there is a private equity angle to it. Albertson’s was acquired in a 2005 LBO by a group of PE firms led by Cerberus. In January 2015, it acquired Safeway to eliminate some competition. It then wanted to sell its shares to the public. But in October 2015, as brick-and-mortar retail began to melt down, it scrapped its IPO. The filing’s most revealing data are same-store sales on a quarterly basis through Q4, 2016, comparing year-over-year sales growth at stores that have been open in the current and prior year. I added the red line to show the trend since Q3 2015: Wolf Street The S-4 supplied some reasons for the decline: Our identical store sales decrease in fiscal 2016 was driven by a decrease of 1.9% in customer traffic partially offset by an increase of 1.5% in average ticket size. During fiscal 2016 our identical store sales were negatively impacted by food price deflation in certain categories, including meat, eggs and dairy, together with pressure to maintain competitive pricing in response. The two key factors boil down to competition, precisely what the Safeway acquisition was supposed to have eliminated: A “1.9% decline in customer traffic.” “Pressure to maintain competitive pricing in response.” In other words, starting in Q1 2016, competition pushed previously strong same-store sales growth off the cliff. Given a series of acquisitions by Albertson’s over the years, total sales rose. The following are sales for the 12-month periods: Through Feb. 2015: $27.2 billion Through Feb. 2016: $58.7 billion (includes Safeway) Through Feb. 2017:  $59.7 billion (includes 29 Haggen Stores and 76 A&P stores) At the end of 2013, the company had 1,075 stores. It then acquired, divested, opened, and closed numerous stores. By the end of 2015, it had 2,271 stores. And by the end of 2016, it had 2,324 stores. So in 2016, the net store count increased 2.3% but revenues inched up only 1.7%. Hence the decline in same store sales. During those three 12-month periods respectively, the company had losses before income taxes of: $1.38 billion, $541 million, and $463.6 billion. And it had total debt of a breath-taking $12.3 billion as of February 25, 2017, up from $3.7 billion in 2013 before the acquisition of Safeway and the other chains. It’s not going to get better anytime soon. On Sunday, Aldi announced it would invest $3.4 billion to expand its base in the US to 2,500 stores by 2022. The privately held discount-grocery chain headquartered in Germany already has over 1,600 stores in the US. It also owns Trader Joe’s, which has an additional 464 grocery stores. In February, Aldi had announced that it would add 400 stores by the end of 2018 and spend $1.6 billion to “remodel and expand” 1,300 of its stores by 2020. This would bring its newly announced investment in the US to $5 billion. The expansion will make Aldi the third-largest grocery chain operator in the US behind Wal-Mart and Kroger, the company said. And it’s going to compete on price. “As we continue to expand and grow, our purchasing power continues to increase and allows us to bring products at better prices for consumers,” Scott Patton, Aldi’s head of corporate buying, told Reuters. Another German grocery store chain, deep-discounter Lidl with 10,000 stores in 27 European countries has plans to open as many as 600 stores in the US, it revealed in May. Its first store will open on June 15. It expects to have 100 stores along the East Coast a year from now. It said it would undercut competitors by up to 50%. This threat by arch-competitor Lidl stimulated Aldi’s thinking; CEO Jason Hart Hart said in a statement that Aldi’s prices also would be about 50% below those of traditional grocery stores. Aldi has always focused on in-house brands to obtain the deepest price cuts. The company’s shares aren’t publicly traded, and quarterly earnings reports don’t cause any kind of ruckus. Kroger, the largest supermarket chain in the US, booked a sales increase of 5% in 2016, but its net income fell 4.5%, and its shares, after a series of earnings disappointments, are down over 25% from the end of 2015, even as the rest of the stock market was booming. Then there’s Wal-Mart Stores, the second largest grocery seller in the US. It’s experimenting with lower prices in 11 states and is hounding its vendors to undercut their competitors by 15%. According to analysts cited by Reuters, it’s willing to spend $6 billion on these efforts. Target too has been plowing more aggressively into the grocery market. Online grocery sales are taking sales away from brick-and-mortar locations. Amazon is now more than just dabbling in it. Everybody wants into this $630-billion-a-year market. Alas, over the past six years, sales at grocery stores are up a total of 14%, not adjusted for inflation, according to the retail trade report by the Commerce Department. Over the same period, the Consumer Price Index for food rose 14%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So in inflation-adjusted terms, over the past six years, “real” sales have been flat. The price war will be a godsend for consumers, at least for a while. But what gives? Shares of Whole Foods Market have fallen 42% since late 2013 as it grapples with the new environment. And there have been 18 bankruptcies among US grocery store chains since 2014, according to Reuters, including Marsh Supermarkets and Central Grocers in May and Fairway Group Holdings, parent of the “iconic” New York chain Fairway Market, a year ago. This is the environment that over-indebted Albertson’s and its private-equity backers hadn’t planned on finding themselves in. Beyond PE firm Cerberus, the backers include real-estate investors Klaff Realty and Lubert-Adler, REIT Kimco Realty, and shopping center owner Schottenstein Stores. To unload the company in an IPO on the unsuspecting public and conniving institutional investors managing the unsuspecting public’s money, the backers must have a buoyant and blind stock market because for equity investors, this must be one of the most toxic combinations: a brick-and-mortar supermarket chain in the age of online sales that was bought by a PE firm, loaded up with debt as it became a supermarket roll-up, in a stagnant market that is attracting the biggest deep-discounters from around the world. And this, after years of asset stripping by PE firms and hedge funds. Read the original article on Wolf Street. Copyright 2017. Follow Wolf Street on Twitter.

His release came after his look-alike showed up behind bars. Richard Jones served 17 years for a 1999 purse snatching outside a Walmart in Kansas City. While locked up, he learned about Ricky Amos and how much they look alike. The two even have the same first name. Then, lawyers with the Midwest Innocence Project convinced a judge last week that Jones' conviction was based on one eyewitness and that there was no physical evidence. Jones said he is now ready to move on. "Everything that happened, there's nothing I can do to change it. I move forward and I look forward to the future and what's going on with me now, and I just feel like this is giving me a platform to speak for people who can't speak for themselves," he said. There is no word yet from the prosecutor's office as to whether they plan to charge the other suspect for the crime.

We previously knew that Future, Migos, Trey Songz, Bruno Mars and Tamar Braxton were scheduled. But now BET makes it official with the second wave of artists including Chris Brown, Lil Wayne, DJ Khaled, Big Sean, Post Malone, Roman GianArthur and Jessie Reyez. Comedian Leslie Jones (Saturday Night Live, Ghostbusters) will host the evening, New Edition are set to receive the Lifetime Achievement Award and Chance The Rapper will receive the Humanitarian Award presented by Walmart. You’ll also recognize some of the presenters that night, like Cardi B, Issa Rae, Jamie Foxx, La La Anthony, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Queen Latifah. When it comes to awards show nominees, Chance, Solange and Migos each have four nominations. Awards show wins are nothing new for Chance, who already walked away with a few Grammys this year including Best New Artist and Best Rap Album. Drake and Kendrick Lamar are also up for awards. Drizzy is nominated in categories like Best Male Hip-Hop artist and the Coca-Cola Viewers’ Choice Award while K. Dot is also nominated for Best Male Hip-Hop Artist and Best Collaboration (“Freedom” with Beyoncé). Jay Z should be proud of his lady Beyoncé, who holds the lead for BET Awards nominations with seven.

The latest feature will put more cash into subscribers' pockets. The online retailer announced Tuesday it has launched Amazon Reload, a cash back program for Prime subscribers. The program works by giving users 2 percent cash back when they make purchases, with cash loaded into a gift card balance. To set up the Amazon Reload feature, subscribers need to tie a bank account and driver’s license to the account along with an existing debit card number. Amazon said the company asks for both services so it can choose the faster payment option for any given purchase. Read: How Walmart Is Speeding Up Its Delivery Processes To Compete With Amazon The update is the latest move by Amazon to diversify its secondary payment options. Previously, Amazon launched the Prime Rewards Visa Card, which offers a handful of larger cash back options for various purchase types. Earlier this spring, Amazon also started Amazon Cash, which allows users who don’t have a credit or debit card to add cash to their Amazon accounts by going to a local participating retailer. Amazon Cash partners include VG's Grocery, CVS and Speedway. Last week, Amazon also announced special pricing for Amazon Prime for users who are on government assistance. Qualifying users can get a full Amazon Prime subscription at a discounted rate of $5.99 per month, down from the standard $10.99 rate. Many of these moves come as Amazon further seeks to bulk up its Prime program to both retain current subscribers and seek new ones. At $10.99 per month or $99 per year, the service provides numerous benefits to users, including free two-day shipping along with access to other side benefits like Amazon’s Prime Video service — home to its streaming catalog and critically acclaimed originals like “Transparent” and “Catastrophe” — and Prime Reading for Kindle users. Read: FTC: Amazon Refunding $70M Of Unauthorized In-App Purchases Made By Children The program is also a significant boost to Amazon’s bottom line. In financial documents from February, Amazon reported Prime subscriptions brought in around $6.4 billion in revenue in 2016.  Amazon’s focus on Prime also comes as it tries to fend off competition in the online shopping space from Wal-Mart, which has been bolstering its online presence aggressively, acquiring online retailer Jet in 2016 and briefly experimenting with its own Amazon Prime-like program, ShippingPass. While Wal-Mart dropped the program earlier this year, it has started offering free two-day shipping with a $35 minimum, which encouraged Amazon to do its own price drop for non-Prime subscribers.

Convict Richard Jones’ just happened to earn him his freedom. The Kansas City, Mo. man was recently released from prison after serving nearly 17 years for a 1999 robbery, according to The Kansas City Star. He found out via other people that there was another prisoner in the facility who looked just like him and shared the same first name. He told lawyers and they started looking into it, according to the Star. They learned that the man’s name was Ricky. Ricky Amos on the left, and Richard Jones on the right. “We were floored by how much they looked alike,” Jones’ lawyer Alice Craig said. Jones always maintained his innocence, according to Fox 4 Kansas City. The day of the robbery, he said he never left his house, having a party with friends and family, The Washington Post reported. But eyewitnesses and police identified him as the light-skinned, thin black or Hispanic man who tried to steal a woman's purse in a Kansas City, Kan. Walmart parking lot, then stole her cell phone and drove away. The lineup that was used to identify Richard Jones as the robber. He looks almost identical to Ricky Amos, who lived on the Kansas side of Kansas City at the time, in a house where two men told police they picked up a man named “Rick" and drove to Walmart the day of the robbery, NBC News reported. After seeing both Amos and Jones, both the robbery victim and a security guard who was an eyewitness said they weren’t sure they picked the right person, according to The Washington Post. Even the former district attorney who prosecuted the case said in an affidavit the newspaper obtained that while he doesn’t remember it well, that the new evidence leads him to believe that Jones shouldn't have been convicted. In his decision last Wednesday, Johnson County Judge Kevin Moriarty said that the robbery victim never saw the thief’s face, according to NBC News. "No reasonable juror would have convicted [Jones] in the light of the new evidence," he said. Jones’ family was elated. "I didn't know what he looked like anymore, because he was so young when he went there," his father Fred told Fox 4 Kansas City. According to the Innocence Project, which works to free the wrongfully convicted, eyewitness testimony plays the largest role in convictions that are later overturned by DNA testing. A GoFundMe campaign has been started to help Jones reconnect to society and with his family.

Sears Holding Corp made the announcement on Tuesday, saying the retailer is close to meeting its goal of "saving $1.25 billion in costs this year," according to Reuters.  Eddie Lampert, Sears' chairman and CEO, started making drastic changes to the company's structure back in February with hopes to save the giant retailer amid serious competition from companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon, according to CNBC.  "We are making progress with the fundamental restructuring of our operations that we initiated in February," Lampert said in a statement. "We remain focused on realigning our business model in an evolving and highly competitive retail environment. This requires us to optimize our store footprint and operate as a leaner and simpler organization." The company said it's aware of the impact on its employees.  "While the total number of people who are directly affected represents a small fraction of our total headcount, we are conscious of the impact on individual employees," Sears said. "We don't take eliminating positions lightly," a Sears spokesman said in a memo. "However, in our efforts to become a more competitive retailer and return our company to profitability, we need to look for ways to streamline the organization. The reductions are taking place across various areas of the company. They represent a mix of positions in various business units and roles across the organization."

Digital Trends Home > Deals > You can score these seven must-have PlayStation 4… You can score these seven must-have PlayStation 4 games for $20 or less By Lucas Coll — Updated June 13, 2017 11:24 am Share Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Think inside the box with these tricked-out shipping container homes These are the 10 greatest Porsches ever made Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Update: Changed prices to reflect the latest deal offers. The PlayStation 4 has really hit its stride in the past couple years with the release of new models like the PS4 Pro and Slim. If you’re thinking of buying a PS4, or if you recently scored one of the awesome PlayStation 4 bundles available right now, we’ve collected some must-have games for the system. The best part? Each of these awesome titles comes in at just $20 or less. Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain Metal Gear Solid exploded onto the scene in 1998 when the first 3D entry in the series launched on the original PlayStation. Hideo Kojima’s “tactical espionage action” game became an instant classic, and 2016’s Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain concludes this epic story. Built on Kojima’s powerful Fox engine, Metal Gear Solid V adds an open-world spin to the stealth gameplay that defines this franchise. The Phantom Pain offers more than enough sneaking around, shooting, and explosive action to keep you busy for hours, and after the campaign is finished, you can spend even more time enjoying the multiplayer experience of Metal Gear Online. A digital download copy of Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is now available on Amazon for just $20. Buy on Amazon Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor Game of the Year Edition Based on Peter Jackson’s sweeping cinematic interpretation of Lord of the Rings, Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor offers a deeper look at the dirty underbelly of Tolkien’s fantasy universe. This game not only breaks new ground with its darker exploration of the world of Middle Earth, but features innovative new AI technology that lets enemy Orcs adapt to your actions throughout the game for a unique player-driven experience. The Game of the Year Edition includes the core game along with extras such as five new missions, unique runes and skins, and new challenge modes. Grab your sword and prepare to do battle with Sauron’s evil forces in Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, now just $20 on Amazon. Buy on Amazon Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin The Dark Souls franchise needs no introduction. FromSoftware’s horror-fantasy epic was a smash hit that prompted several award-winning sequels. Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin takes you for another hair-raising and teeth-gritting ride, this time into the land of Drangleic, as you battle vicious demons, hordes of the undead, and even other players in the quest for souls. The epic campaign blends seamlessly with the game’s multiplayer component, allowing you to cooperate with or challenge other gamers online. Known for its steep difficulty, Dark Souls is recommended for only the bravest of adventurers. Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin contains all of the DLC expansions along with the original game, and can be yours for $18 from Amazon. Buy on Amazon Bloodborne If you can’t get enough of the rage-inducing masochistic gameplay of Dark Souls, then you have to play Bloodborne, another fantastic entry from the creative minds at FormSoftware. Bloodborne takes Lovecraftian horror to a whole new level, and is set in a unique Gothic fantasy world where you battle it out with diseased, mad, and nightmarish creatures. Cooperate with up to two of your friends to explore and fight your way across numerous dungeons where great treasures – and great horrors – await you. Unlike the multiplatform Dark Souls series, Bloodborne is exclusive to the PlayStation 4 and is one of the standout titles for this system. Grab this must-have action RPG for just $15 from Walmart and brace yourself for a descent into madness. Buy on Walmart Fallout 4 Fallout is one of the longest-running franchises around and still somehow manages to exceed our expectations with each new release. Fallout 4 is no exception, and its massive open world gives you total freedom to fight and scavenge your way across a post-apocalyptic wasteland in an alternative universe where civilization has been devastated by a worldwide nuclear war. You emerge as the lone survivor of Vault 111, and you are free to employ whatever means necessary in order to survive and thrive in the radioactive ruins of the U.S. Customize your character, join factions, level your skills, and even build your own base in Bethesda’s epic follow-up to 2008’s Fallout 3. Fallout 4 offers a true next-gen experience and can be yours for $20 from Amazon. Buy on Amazon Doom The new Doom is a game that few people saw coming. Id Software and Bethesda had a big task ahead of them when they announced a reboot of the decades-old franchise that defined an entire genre. Expectations soared, and thankfully, Doom met and even exceeded hopes when it dropped last year to massive sales and universal critical acclaim. While 2004’s Doom 3 was an awesome and first-person shooter, its slower gameplay and survival-horror elements strayed a bit from the classic Doom formula. Id’s new Doom takes the franchise right back to its roots, throwing a stranded space marine – you, the player – into a whirling maelstrom of slaughter and chaos as you battle alone against the armies of Hell. You can enjoy the next-gen graphics and heart-pounding FPS action of Doom for $20 from Amazon. Buy on Amazon LittleBigPlanet 3 Most of the titles in our roundup are aimed at mature audiences, so we’ve made one special pick for kids and adults alike who want to relax with some lighter fare. The LittleBigPlanet series has jumped its way into our hearts with its fun platforming gameplay and charming cast of characters, and the latest entry in the franchise, LittleBigPlanet 3, is another PlayStation exclusive that is sure to please. Sackboy, our favorite little knitted hero, returns along with a cast of plushy new friends. Explore the colorful world of Bunkum as you jump, climb, fly, and solve puzzles using all-new abilities, and enjoy countless hours of additional gameplay with custom levels designed by other players in the LittleBigPlanet community. You can now grab LittleBigPlanet 3 for just $16.50 from Walmart. Buy on Walmart

The report found hospital, university systems and Walmart are frequently among the largest employers. It’s a little different in Colorado, where hospitals, universities and retail chains are competing with an airport that is larger than some major cities. “Encompassing 53 square miles of land, (Denver International Airport) is twice the size of Manhattan Island, and is larger than the city boundaries of Boston, Miami, or San Francisco,” the airport website states. Altogether, it takes 35,000 people to keep the airport up and running. Walmart is the largest employer in three of Colorado’s border neighbors: Arizona, Wyoming and Kansas. In Utah, Intermountain Healthcare takes the top spot. In Nebraska, it’s the University of Nebraska and in New Mexico, the University of New Mexico is the largest employer.

Retailers said they were coordinating with packaged consumer goods makers independently.

Members of the Retailers Association of India, including Future Retail, Walmart India, D-Mart, Hypercity and Reliance Retail on Tuesday met at the Mumbai office of Kishore Biyani’s Future Group. The meeting was held to discuss the implications of GST and decide on industry concerns to be brought before the government, the association’s CEO Kumar Rajagopalan said. “The current tax rate is less than the weighted average tax rate we were paying earlier,” Jamshed Daboo, managing director of Trent Hypermarket Ltd, said. “Prices have to come down...Before the rates were out, I can understand there was speculation but now that they are out, it is quite evident where the prices will go up and where they will come down.” “We are going to reduce our prices by 2% to 20%,” said Biyani, who owns Future Consumer Ltd. “That is the opportunity, to bring down prices for everyone,” he said, adding that overall, “the consumer’s basket of goods will become much more price-effective”. Retailers’ biggest concern is to ensure that margins are not hurt as they reduce prices. Retailers said they were coordinating with packaged consumer goods makers independently. “We deal with them individually but we all have a common objective—that whatever margin we used to get should be protected (as prices come down),” Biyani said. The retailers’ body is also taking three key concerns to the government, relating to display of GST rates on goods, home delivery charges, and GST on packaged staples. “When you see a Rs20 Coke bottle and with a 40% tax rate, the consumer may feel that Rs8 in taxes is too much,” Biyani said. Second, retailers want home delivery charges to be levied as a flat service tax, instead of basing the tax on the highest rated item in the delivery basket. Finally, the industry also wants branded packaged commodities, which will attract a GST of 5%, to be charged at the zero rate applicable to unbranded loose staples including rice, wheat and other cereals.

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link Richard Jones, after spending 17 years wrongly incarcerated, is finally a free man after a tragic case of mistaken identity cost him everything. Two years ago, Jones, who professed his innocence even after receiving mandatory-minimum sentencing, found hope for his case after he heard from other inmates that he had a “twin” in Lansing Correctional Facility.  Jones was convicted of aggravated robbery after a purse-snatching incident by a trio of men at a Kansas Walmart left a woman with minor injuries when her cell phone was snatched. The accused maintained that he was home with his family at the time of the incident, but witness accounts identified him as a participant, leading to a conviction in the wake of numerous appeals.  When Jones learned of his unrelated look-alike, he desperately reached out to both the Midwest Innocence Project and the Project for Innocence at the University of Kansas. The groups were able to follow up on the lead, eventually identifying the look-alike as Rick Amos. Authorities believe that both the remarkably similar appearances and the similar names, Rick and Richard, led to the grave confusion.  Kansas Department of Corrections Speaking to the Kansas City Star (via NBC News), Jones conveyed his struggle and his relief, saying, "When I saw that picture, it just made sense to me. They say you can’t see the picture clearly if you [are] in it, but if I was outside this picture, I would have seen the same thing." Upon his release, Jones was reunited with his daughters, one of whom was an infant at the time of Jones arrest 19 years ago.  Midwest Innocence Project As of now, the look-alike, Rick Amos, is currently incarcerated for other crimes and has not been charged with his participation in the robbery or assault. However, his resume is one of a career criminal, having been a charged and convicted of robbery, sexual assault, and possession of controlled substances. Jones had a criminal record at the time of his arrest, after charges relating to stolen steroids in 1994.  Jones feels vindicated, but also understands the confusion. "When I saw that picture, it just made sense to me. They say you can’t see the picture clearly if you [are] in it, but if I was outside this picture I would have seen the same thing,” he said.    Recently on GOOD The Cast Of 'Dodgeball' Reunite For A Rematch To Benefit A Great Cause Those who donate can compete in the rematch...as a good guy or bad guy.  Sports Penn Collins An Intoxicated Man Left His Car Behind And Left This Honest Plea For The Police Most of us have been in this exact situation Communities Penn Collins The Roomba Creator’s New Robot Automatically Weeds Your Garden The coolest garden gadget ever.

Born to the late Doctor Joseph and Nancy Elizabeth Hornsby Estes on November 10, 1927, in Kent, Alabama, she was the youngest of 6 children. Wilmer married Lester “Dinky” Simpson on June 1, 1948, and moved to Opelika where she raised her family. She retired from Opelika Manufacturing Company in 1974, and later went to work at Wal-Mart, in Opelika and in Auburn, in various departments, where she retired again in 1990. Then at age 63, she went back to school to train in nursing, her true life’s passion. She became a CNA, providing in-home-health-care in Opelika and Auburn and volunteered with Lee County Hospice. In 2005, Wilmer moved to West Point, Georgia, where she continued her in-home-health-care in West Point and LaGrange. There she also volunteered with Chattahoochee Hospice. Only when her vision failed her, did she retire one last time in 2011. In June of 2015, she moved to Arbor Springs in Opelika where she quickly discovered old friends and made new ones. While she lived in Opelika, Wilmer was a member of Central Baptist Church and then moved her membership to First Baptist Church of West Point. Wilmer was preceded in death by her husband of 49 years, Lester Simpson; 3 sisters, Mary Frances Estes, Helen Estes Cottingham, and Mildred Estes Stobaugh; and 2 brothers, Carthel Estes and Howard Estes. She is survived by her daughter, Debra Simpson Robertson of West Point, Georgia and her son, Ronald Simpson of Opelika. A memorial service was held at Jeffcoat-Trant Funeral Home & Crematory at 2:00 p.m. CST on Saturday, June 10, 2017, with Reverend Tom Tucker officiating. Visitation was held one hour prior to the funeral from 1:00 – 2:00 p.m. CST. The family feels sure that Wilmer would have appreciated any charitable gifts be made to Arbor Springs Health and Rehab Center or a Hospice of your choice.

While serving his time, Richard Jones repeatedly denied having committed a crime. Attorneys recently discovered Jones had a doppelganger, a man who looked extremely similar to him and had a similar name: Ricky Amos. Read:  Who Is Lawrence Patrick Sullivan? Joker-Lookalike Speaks Out After Arrest On Gun Charges On Thursday, Jones was released from prison after witnesses admitted they could not tell the difference between the two men and could no longer be sure Jones was guilty of the crime. Seeing the photo helped Jones understand what confused him for so many years, he told the Kansas City Star on Friday. Ricky Amos (left) and Richard Jones (right). Photo: Kansas Department of Corrections “When I saw that picture, it just made sense to me,” Jones said. “I want people to know that this does happen. It doesn’t get the type of attention that it should get,” he said to WDAF on Saturday. The case against Jones was dismissed, as announced by Johnson County District Attorney Steven Howe on Monday. Jones, a Kansas City, Missouri resident, was charged with aggravated robbery in 1999. An attempted purse-snatching in a Walmart parking lot left a woman with a scraped knee while three men ran away with her cell phone. Jones was charged and convicted of the crime, despite his constant claims that he did not commit the crime, which took place in Kansas City, Kansas. Jones said he was at home with his family the day it occurred. The mandatory sentencing resulted in a 19-year prison sentence, which Jones appealed whenever possible. In 2015, other inmates at Lansing Correctional Facility told Jones there was another inmate who heavily resembled him. The other man had a similar sounding name, Rick. Jones reached out to attorneys at the Midwest Innocence Project and the Project for Innocence at the University of Kansas Law School. They found Ricky Lee Amos, Jones’s doppelganger who lived in Kansas. The two men looked similar when their booking photos were placed side-by-side. They have the same facial hair and corn rows, they are both close to 6-feet-tall and weigh roughly 200 pounds and they are about the same age. Amos has been linked to the address where the crime began. The house was where two men told police they picked up ‘Rick’ and drove to Walmart on the day of the robbery. Amos has denied involvement in the robbery. The statute of limitation for aggravated robbery is five years, so even if he were guilty, he could not be charged. Amos is currently incarcerated in Sedgwick County, Kansas after being sentenced on April 13 for twice not registering as a sex offender related to a 2003 sexual battery charge. Amos has been in and out of prison throughout the years on robbery charges, drug possession, sexual assault and other offenses, according to the Kansas Department of Corrections' records. Alice Craig, an attorney with the University of Kansas Innocence Project, has worked for the past two years to help release Jones. Last December, she filed legal action that led to his release on Thursday. The original conviction rested on eyewitness testimony and potential racial bias, she said as reported by NBC News. “No reasonable juror would have convicted [Jones] in the light of the new evidence,” said Johnson County Judge Kevin Moriarty in his decision on Wednesday. The woman relied on skin tone when she picked out the police photo of Jones, said Moriarty. The other witness, a Walmart security guard, chased the car to identify its license plate number, but he did not see the crime itself. The two other men in the car who said “Rick” was the robber admitted they were high on drugs.

I found that needle in the haystack.” A GoFundMe page to help Jones “assimilate back into society and allow him to spend time reconnecting with his family and friends” has raised over $17,000 since it was created on Friday.

What drives supermarket shoppers round the bend—figuratively and sometimes literally? Apparently, it’s a lack of checkout lanes. That’s what we learned from a recent survey of 50,218 Consumer Reports readers, completed by the Consumer Reports National Research Center. According to the results, 21 percent complained about grocery stores with too few checkout lanes and long waits.  The good news is that 46 percent of respondents had no gripes at all about the markets they frequent. But among those who did have complaints, about 10 percent grumbled about congested aisles, 9 percent about too few choices, and 7 percent about the poor selection of local products. You can see the full results of our survey in our Grocery Store and Supermarket Ratings. But here’s a snapshot of what our readers told us.  Stores With the Least Complaints If one of these supermarkets is near you, you may be interested in knowing that only about 23 percent to 30 percent of our readers had a complaint about them, making them the least complained about in our ratings.  Dierbergs Market. This Missouri-based market, which traces its roots to a country store founded in 1854 in West St. Louis County, garnered the lowest level of customer complaints of the 62 grocery stores in our survey. Just 23 percent of shoppers had any gripes at all about the family-owned chain. Shoppers at Dierbergs, which mainly has stores in the St. Louis metropolitan area, also had plenty of praise, rating the store highly for its cleanliness, store-prepared food, and quality of its local produce. Publix. According to Publix’s website, you could walk into a Publix blindfolded and know where you are. Why? Publix says its stores smell like freshly baked bread and also seem friendly and welcoming. Not surprising, then, that staff courtesy got an excellent rating in our survey. That also might be a reason only 27 percent of the store’s shoppers had any complaints, according to our survey. Like Dierbergs, this big, southeastern chain got our highest marks for store cleanliness and store-prepared food.  Wegmans. At this East coast family-owned market, which tops our ratings overall, only about 28 percent of customers had a complaint. The store received our highest scores for checkout speed, cleanliness, store-prepared food, and quality and choice of produce. Our readers also told us they appreciated its selection of healthy options, which according to the website include natural and organic foods, premium teas, and gluten-free products. Partly for these reasons, according to the company, last year more than 7,800 people contacted Wegmans asking for a store in their community.  Fareway Stores.  Fareway’s name may have a lot to do with how few complaints our readers had about the grocery store. Since its inception in 1938, the mission of the store has been to include "a wide range of fare—or foods" and to treat customers and employees fairly. Our survey respondents seem to believe Fareway has stuck to its core values. The store, which is based in the Upper Midwest, got high marks for the courtesy of its staff. Like Wegmans, only 28 percent of shoppers had any complaints. And shoppers ranked Fareway’s prices and meat and poultry quality as being excellent. Festival Foods. This Wisconsin-based grocer says its goal is to treat customers like family. Shoppers here have little doubt that Festival Foods does that. Here too, only 28 percent of respondents had any complaints about this chain. Respondents gave the store the highest marks for staff courtesy as well as store cleanliness and the quality of its prepared foods. Lowes Foods. Lowes says it supports local farms and businesses, which is probably one reason so many of our survey respondents liked the store, giving it high marks for the quality of the local produce it sells. Only about 30 percent of respondents who shopped here had at least one complaint. The chain, which has stores in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, did well in our survey on a number of fronts, including checkout speed and cleanliness. Hy-Vee. The company’s longtime slogan, "Where there’s a helpful smile in every aisle," apparently rings true for most customers. Just 30 percent had any issues with this Midwestern employee-owned chain. The company says it’s committed to fostering healthy lifestyles, and our readers liked the store’s natural and organic products as well as the courtesy of its staff. Stores With the Most Complaints Walmart Supercenter. This was by far the most complained-about purveyor of groceries. About 74 percent of Walmart shoppers had at least one complaint about the national discounter. Not surprising, then, that Walmart Supercenter landed at the bottom of our supermarket ratings. Though it ranked very well for competitive prices, our survey respondents complained about Walmart’s checkout speed, staff courtesy, and store cleanliness. In addition, they griped about the quality of the produce, the lack of variety, and the quality of the meat and poultry. A number of other stores also generated complaints from many of the shoppers we surveyed. The following stores had at least one 56 to 59 percent from their customers:     Pick ’n Save, based in Wisconsin Safeway, with stores nationwide Target/Super Target, with stores nationwide Aldi, a discount chain with stores nationwide Tops Friendly Markets, with stores in New York, Vermont, northern Pennsylvania, and central Massachusetts Stop and Shop, a nationwide retailer  Martin’s, with locations in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia More on Supermarkets and Grocery Stores • The Grocery Shopping Revolution • Grocery Stores With the Best Produce • Grocery Stores With the Best Prices • Save Time and Money Food Shopping • Online Grocer Ratings  More from Consumer Reports: Top pick tires for 2016 Best used cars for $25,000 and less 7 best mattresses for couples Copyright © 2006-2017 Consumer Reports, Inc.

Photo: Liz Teitz/The Enterprise Image 11 of 11 Dogged by debate: Both realities and misconceptions fuel pit bull reputation 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Stephanie Jones loves taking her dogs - a pit bull mix and a Rottweiler - out in public to demonstrate that so-called "aggressive breeds" can be well-behaved and friendly. But when Ashley Phillips sees a dog that looks like a pit bull at a store or a restaurant, she tenses up, recalling the two dogs that killed her 5-year-old son two years ago. The women are two of the faces of the fierce debate over the dog breed, known both as vicious attackers and gentle family pets. "Bully breeds," including varieties of bull terriers and the American bully, often are classified as "pit bulls." Such animals are frequently assumed to be innately aggressive and inclined to attack, leading to bans in apartment complexes and stores and higher insurance premiums. While not all pit bulls are aggressive, high-profile attacks help fuel a blanket view that the dogs are dangerous, which creates a variety of unanticipated challenges for owners. When pit bulls attack Fueling the breed's bad reputation is the harsh reality of pit bull attacks, which are often extremely violent and highly publicized, even though they're relatively uncommon. Phillips' 5-year-old son, Tanner Smith, was mauled to death in Vidor by two pit bulls in 2015 while she visited a friend. Phillips believed Tanner was outside with her friend's father but later learned he was not at home at the time, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Tanner was found in the yard after he was attacked. Two years later, Phillips is still nervous around dogs and said she supports keeping all dogs out of public places, especially pit bulls. "Any breed that could kill someone should not be welcome in a public place," she said. "People will say Chihuahuas, weenie dogs, are more aggressive, and they might be more aggressive, but they're not going to kill someone." The breed's popularity in Southeast Texas worries her as well, she said. "I can't say that I enjoy going to the grocery store, Wal-Mart or anywhere like that, because every time I turn my head, there's a pit bull, and it brings back all those things I had to personally see of my own child." Michelle Watts, who lives in Orange County, spent part of Memorial Day weekend in the hospital with her son, Tyler, after a neighbor's pit bull attacked him. The 11-year-old was riding his bike when he had his third run-in with the dog in two months, which escalated from biting his pants, to a minor cut, to severe wounds that required stitches. She reported the bite to the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and the dog is currently quarantined. OCSO did not respond to requests for comment. Watts said Tyler is still recovering and worries that the owner is not required to enclose his yard with a fence. The owner defended his dog and said it was secured, but declined to be quoted. "All dogs can bite," Watts said, "but when this one does, it's a lot worse. Why risk somebody's life because you can't put your dog up?" Facts and myths Most dog bites that Beaumont Animal Services responds to involve bully breeds, said supervisor Matthew Fortenberry, but that's not necessarily because they're naturally more aggressive than other breeds. "They're a very common breed for ownership in this area," he said, "so the percentage (of bites) by nature, is going to be higher." Bully breeds' physical characteristics, including their boxy heads and stocky builds, can make them look inherently aggressive and can fuel misconceptions like their jaws "lock" when they bite or they're bred to kill. Their size and strength also make their bites more damaging than small dogs, like Chihuahuas, which are more prone to bite people but inflict fewer serious injuries. I. Lehr Brisbin, an animal behavior specialist and researcher at the University of Georgia, said there is no proof of any "locking mechanism," based on examinations of the breeds' skulls and teeth, and their strength is not disproportionate to their size. Pit bulls are the most commonly chosen breed to be trained to fight, a characteristic that can be passed on through generations, said Jen Robinson, a trainer at Beaumont Animal Services. She said that creates "fighting bloodlines" among some, but not all, pit bulls. It's not always immediately clear which dogs aren't from "fighting stock," which is why temperament testing is necessary. Beaumont Animal Services shelter director Susan Toney said they monitor dogs' behavior, their interactions with staff and other animals and look for triggers that set them off to determine their temperament. Costs of ownership Those who own and love their pit bulls face unanticipated challenges because of the breed's reputation. Texas prohibits breed-specific bans, so cities and towns can't pass local ordinances outlawing pit bulls, but companies that set their own policies often consider pit bulls a risk. Heather Holcombe bought her dog, Sapphire, a bright blue-eyed bully breed, six years ago. "She's been my baby ever since," she said, watching the dog calmly trot alongside her at Beaumont's Ida Reed Dog Park. As Holcombe looked for a place to live that would accept Sapphire, she ran up against restrictions on "aggressive breeds," until she found a rental house in Beaumont whose owner was willing to take them after meeting Sapphire. "Ninety-nine percent of apartment complexes or rental properties won't allow pits," said Beaumont Animal Services' Toney. Those restrictions frequently stop people from adopting the dogs, she said. A number of local apartment complexes have broad "no aggressive breed" policies, which typically include Rottweilers, German shepherds and chows, along with pit bulls. Others require that the owner bring the dog in for a meeting or ask for a picture of the dog before being approved as a renter. While homeowners can choose to own any dog they please, they will likely pay more for insurance if they own a pit bull. "Certain breeds are identified as being potentially more aggressive," said Wade Maclean, an agent with Farmers Insurance in Beaumont, "so there may be a surcharge on somebody's homeowner's policy" because they present an additional risk to the company. Charles Cole, owner of Beaumont's Cole Insurance TWFG, said that insurance premiums can go up 10 to 40 percent for pit bull owners, depending on the company. In other cases, an insurer might provide a policy that excludes coverage of anything related to the dog, requiring owners to carry a separate liability policy, he said. Toney said the Beaumont Animal Shelter tries to address the possible restrictions before the dogs are adopted so they won't be returned. The shelter makes potential owners check their relevant insurance policies before taking a bully breed home. They also conduct home visits, because not all owners or families are suited for the powerful, energetic breed, she said. Most Southeast Texas dog-friendly businesses don't have prohibitions on specific breeds, though the national PetSmart chain has been widely criticized for banning "dogs of the 'bully breed' classification" from its Doggie Day Camp programs, including "mixed breeds that have the appearance or characteristics of these breeds." Cuddly or killers? While banning the breed from public places might seem an obvious solution for those who fear running afoul of a fighting dog, it wouldn't cut down on at-home attacks like Watts' or Smith's. Nor have bans been found to be effective, according to experts. A 2010 study in the Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association found that breed-specific legislation is ineffective, because it would require removing too many dogs from a community to actually prevent bites. Cities and towns would have to remove 100,000 dogs to statistically reduce the risk of one dog bite, according to the study. Restrictions raise questions about their value because they require classifying the dog based on its appearance, which isn't always a guaranteed way to identify pit bulls, especially with the popularity of mixed-breed dogs. Pit bull enthusiasts like Jones, who has owned bully breeds for more than 20 years, say the bans perpetuate negative stereotypes and make it harder to prove that not all pit bulls are "bred to kill." "I love to bring them out wherever I can to shed good light on the breed," she said. "They're smart, gentle dogs, very driven to please." Some pit bulls are "cocker spaniels in disguise," Toney said, while others have been mistreated or not socialized properly, especially if they're owned as guard dogs or for dogfighting. "What they're taught, how they're brought up, and if they're trained and socialized" have more to do with their behavior than their breed itself, Toney said. Watts, whose family has a labrador, said she's been accused of bashing pit bulls but said the bigger issue is ensuring owners follow leash laws and ordinances. "It doesn't matter what kind of dog it is, it's being a responsible animal owner," Watts said.

Officer Jeronimo Yanez, who is Latino, is charged in the July death of Philando Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria worker whom Yanez had pulled over in a St. Paul suburb. Yanez said he thought Castile resembled a robbery suspect, and that once stopped, Castile disregarded his commands not to pull out his gun. Prosecutors argue Yanez never saw a gun and overreacted. FILE - In this July 25, 2016, file photo, a memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence in St. Paul, Minn., protesting the July 6, 2016 shooting death of Castile by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez. Closing arguments began Monday, June 12, 2017 in in a Yanez' manslaughter trial in the fatal shooting of Castile.(AP Photo/Jim Mone, File) The case is among several across the United States in recent years that have increased debate about race and policing. Here are some other high-profile deaths of blacks during police encounters: ___ SAM DUBOSE Prosecutors are retrying former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing in the killing of the unarmed motorist during a traffic stop near the campus in July 2015. The jury deadlocked after his first murder trial. He faces 15 years to life if convicted. Tensing's body camera captured much of the encounter, although the two sides dispute what conclusions can be reached. Tensing's attorney says DuBose was using his car as a deadly weapon. The university fired Tensing, restructured its public safety department and reached a $5.3 million settlement that includes free undergraduate tuition for DuBose's 13 children. ___ SYLVILLE SMITH Former Milwaukee police officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown, who is black, is charged with first-degree reckless homicide in Smith's death, which ignited riots on the city's north side. The shooting happened in August 2016 after Heaggan-Brown and his partner stopped a rental car that police say was driving suspiciously. Once the car stopped, police say Smith ran away holding a gun. Prosecutors say Smith fell and Heaggan-Brown shot him once in the arm as he was getting up, still holding the weapon while facing the officer. They say Heaggan-Brown's second shot came after Smith had thrown his gun over a fence. Heaggan-Brown, 25, said he thought Smith was reaching for another gun in his waistband when he fired again. The trial is underway this week. ___ JORDAN EDWARDS The U.S. Justice Department said in May that it's investigating the fatal shooting of the 15-year-old by a white police officer in a Dallas suburb. Edwards was shot April 29 by Balch Springs police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. Balch Springs police had originally said the vehicle was reversing "in an aggressive manner" toward officers, who had responded to a complaint about underage drinking. But Police Chief Jonathan Haber later said video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away. Oliver is free on bond. ___ TERENCE CRUTCHER An Oklahoma jury on May 17 found Officer Betty Jo Shelby not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the Sept. 16, 2016, death of Terence Crutcher, 40, shot shortly after Shelby arrived on a street to find Crutcher's SUV stopped in the middle of the road. Shelby testified that she was afraid because Crutcher didn't obey her commands and appeared to reach inside his SUV. Prosecutors told jurors that Shelby overreacted, noting that videos from a patrol car dashboard and a police helicopter showed Crutcher had his hands in the air and did not have a weapon. ___ ALTON STERLING Federal prosecutors announced May 3 that they would not seek charges against two white police officers who were involved in a deadly encounter with Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, last summer. Sterling, 37, was shot to death on July 5, 2016, as two white officers pinned him to the pavement outside a convenience store where he had been selling CDs. The killing was captured on cellphone video and circulated widely online, sparking demonstrations across Baton Rouge. U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson said Sterling was armed during the confrontation and the investigation didn't find enough evidence to pursue charges. State authorities are investigating to decide whether to bring charges. ___ KEITH LAMONT SCOTT A prosecutor cleared a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer in the September 2016 fatal shooting of Scott, 43, killed while sitting in his vehicle in the parking lot of his apartment complex as officers sought another man. A police review board decided that Officer Brentley Vinson followed proper procedure. Police video showed officers shouting for Scott to drop a gun numerous times Scott's family said he did not have a gun. Charlotte-Mecklenburg District Attorney Andrew Murray cited evidence that Scott was armed, including a store's surveillance video, DNA recovered from a handgun and a Facebook conversation from the man who said he sold the stolen gun to Scott. ___ JAMAR CLARK Clark's November 2015 shooting death sparked weeks of protests in Minneapolis. Two white officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest the 24-year-old when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark's hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them. ___ RICKY BALL Former Columbus, Mississippi, police officer Canyon Boykin, who is white, was indicted in September for manslaughter in the shooting death of Ball, 26. Boykin, awaiting trial, said he fired because Ball appeared to point a gun at him during a foot chase in October 2015. The city fired Boykin, saying the officer violated policy by not turning on his body camera, by inviting his fiancée to ride with him and by making derogatory social media posts about African-Americans, women and disabled people. Boykin has sued the city, claiming violations of his constitutional rights. Ball's family has sued Boykin, the city and other police officials for wrongful death. ___ JEREMY MCDOLE McDole, 28, was sitting in his wheelchair when he was shot and killed in September 2015 in Wilmington, Delaware, after police received a 911 call about a man with a gun. A bystander's cellphone footage showed officers repeatedly telling McDole to drop his weapon and raise his hands, with McDole reaching for his waist area before shots erupted. The Delaware attorney general's office decided against criminal charges against four Wilmington police officers involved, although investigators concluded one officer showed "extraordinarily poor" police work. In January, a federal judge approved the city's $1.5 million settlement with McDole's family. ___ WILLIAM CHAPMAN II Former Portsmouth, Virginia, police Officer Stephen Rankin was sentenced last October to 2½ years in prison for fatally shooting Chapman while responding to a shoplifting call outside a Wal-Mart on April 22, 2015. Prosecutors allege Rankin killed the unarmed 18-year-old "willfully, deliberately and with premeditation." Some witnesses said Chapman was combative, and one said he knocked away Rankin's stun gun. Rankin, who is white, was fired. ___ WALTER SCOTT Prosecutors are recommending decades in prison for white South Carolina police officer Michael Slager, who shot Scott in the back as the motorist fled following a traffic stop. Slager pleaded guilty on May 2 to a federal charge of violating Scott's civil rights. A judge will determine his sentence, which could range from probation to life in prison without parole. Scott's shooting in April 2015 was captured on cellphone video and seen worldwide. ___ FREDDIE GRAY The 25-year-old man was shackled but alive when he was put in a Baltimore police van in April 2015. He came out with severe neck injuries, and his subsequent death led to rioting. Six officers were charged initially, but prosecutors in July 2016 dropped all remaining charges after acquittals and a hung jury. Gray's family agreed to a $6.4 million settlement with the city in September 2015. __ ERIC HARRIS Former Tulsa County volunteer sheriff's deputy Robert Bates, 74, was sentenced in 2016 to four years in prison for second-degree manslaughter in the April 2015 death of Harris, 44, who was unarmed and restrained. Bates, who is white, has said he confused his stun gun with his handgun. That shooting led to the temporary suspension of the reserve deputy program after a report found poor training of the volunteer officers, a lack of oversight, and cronyism. Bates is appealing his conviction. ___ TAMIR RICE The 12-year-old was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer near a gazebo in a recreational area in November 2014. Officers were responding to a report of a man waving a gun. The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers' cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled Rice's family's lawsuit for $6 million. Cleveland in May fired Loehmann and suspended Garmack for 10 days. The officers' union said it will challenge the discipline, calling it politically motivated. ___ AKAI GURLEY Rookie New York City police officer Peter Liang was convicted of manslaughter last year in the November 2014 death of 28-year-old Gurley. Liang, an American of Chinese descent, said he was patrolling a public housing high-rise with his gun drawn when a sound startled him and he fired accidentally. A bullet ricocheted off a wall, hitting Gurley. A judge reduced the conviction to negligent homicide and sentenced Liang to five years' probation and 800 hours of community service. The city settled with Gurley's family for $4.1 million. ___ MICHAEL BROWN The unarmed 18-year-old was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury declined to indict Wilson, and the U.S. Justice Department opted against civil rights charges. Wilson later resigned. The death of Brown led to months of occasionally violent protests and became a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement, which rebukes police treatment of minorities. ___ LAQUAN MCDONALD Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in November 2015, on the same day that the city, under a judge's orders, released dashcam video showing McDonald, a 17-year-old man, being shot 16 times on Oct. 20, 2014. Van Dyke, who is white, has pleaded not guilty. The video prompted local and federal investigations. The Justice Department determined in January that Chicago police have a long history of civil rights violations and excessive force. The Chicago Police Department has since released a new use-of-force policy that requires officers undergo de-escalation training and imposes stricter rules on when they can fire their weapons at fleeing suspects. ___ ERIC GARNER The 43-year-old man died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes. A grand jury declined to indict that officer, or any others involved in the arrest. The city agreed to pay a $6 million civil settlement. ___ REKIA BOYD Chicago police officer Dante Servin resigned in May 2016 after the police superintendent said he should be fired for killing Boyd four years earlier. Servin was off-duty when he shot the 22-year-old unarmed woman. She had been walking down a street with her friends when he told them to be quiet, and he fired when he thought he saw a gun. Prosecutors charged Servin with involuntary manslaughter; a judge acquitted him in April 2016, saying he'd been improperly charged. The city settled a wrongful-death lawsuit in 2013 with Boyd's family for $4.5 million.

Testimony began Thursday, June 8, 2017, in Tensing's retrial on murder and voluntary manslaughter charges, while in Minnesota, closing arguments are scheduled Monday, June 12, 2017, in the trial of St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez, charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of Philando Castile during a July 6, 2016, traffic stop. (AP Photo/Tom Uhlman, File) FILE - This undated file photo provided by the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office shows Sylville Smith. In August 2016, a north side Milwaukee neighborhood erupted in violence following the fatal shooting of Smith, by Milwaukee police officer Dominique Heaggan-Brown. Jury selection kicks off Monday, June 12, 2017 in the trial for Heaggan-Brown, who was charged in December with first-degree reckless homicide in Smith's death.

Edwards was shot April 29, 2017, by Balch Springs, Texas, police Officer Roy Oliver, who was fired and charged with murder. Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle that was moving away from officers. The Justice Department investigation is separate from the district attorney's prosecution, and could end in a wide variety of outcomes - some civil, some criminal. Oliver was fired three days after Edwards' death. Oliver is free on bond.

A jury on Wednesday, May 17, 2017, found Shelby not guilty in Crutcher's death. His death was among a series across the U.S. involving black people in recent years that spurred a national debate over race and policing. (AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki File) FILE - This undated photo released by Javille Burns shows her brother, Jamar Clark, who was fatally shot in a confrontation with police on Sunday, Nov. 15, 2015, in Minneapolis. The officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, were trying to arrest Clark when he was shot once in the head. He died a day later. Some witnesses said Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, but federal and state probes concluded that he was not. Investigators said Ringgenberg felt Clark's hand trying to grab his weapon and shouted to Schwarze, who then shot Clark. Prosecutors decided not to charge either white officer, and an internal police investigation cleared them. (Jamar Clark/Javille Burns via AP, File) FILE - In this Dec. 1, 2014 file photo, Tomiko Shine holds up a poster of Tamir Rice during a protest in Washington.

The boy had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot right after their cruiser skidded to a stop, just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The city settled his family's lawsuit for $6 million.

Memphis Police Department canceled the City Watch Alert for Tai'yanna Strong on Tuesday. The alert was issued Sunday, a week after she went missing. Details surrounding where and how Strong was located have not been released. Sunday, Strong's parents were desperate for her to come home. “In my mind, she is where I don't want her to be and that's in some type of danger,” said her father Alvin Strong. A video from a Memphis Walmart showed the missing teen leaving the store with another man who appears to be in his late teens or early 20's. Strong appeared injured in the video. Strong was grounded for the last several weeks by her parents and left her home June 4 at around 5 a.m.  Investigators said she was possibly seen Friday morning (June 9) at the Walmart on Whitten Road. She left the store with a man in his late teens or early 20s. Strong reportedly looked nervous and had a deep scratch on her neck.  “She went to the room,” Alvin said. “She opened the door. I am sitting right here playing Xbox. She come out the room with a look on her face like my child is dead or something.” For the last week, her family has searched for Strong, taking to social media to spread the word. “I just told everybody share, share, share,” Alvin said. “I need all my Facebook friends and family to be attentive and looking out.” Copyright 2017 WMC Action News 5.

This season, stores have focused even more on offering new services and apps ... to cater to increasingly time-starved smart-phone, savvy parents to help them save time and money for the annual shopping ritual. (AP Photo/St. Joseph News-Press, Sait Serkan Gurbuz, File) (The Associated Press) Expand School might be out for the summer, but some parents may are already be thinking about what supplies they’ll send their children back to school with next term and where they’ll be making those purchases. Continue Reading Below Retail sales during the much-anticipated back-to-school shopping season of July and August are expected to grow 4% to $857.18 billion from last year’s record-breaking levels, according to data released by research firm eMarketer on Tuesday.   While Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and other big-box retailers have in the past been destinations for parents shopping for the latest on-trend folders and backpacks, eMarketer expects e-commerce platforms to continue gaining market share as older students head online before going back to the classroom. It projects e-commerce will grow 14.8% to $74.02 billion, representing about 8.6% of total retail sales during the back-to-school season. “Younger consumers that shop in preparation for going back to high school and college actually prefer shopping online, so e-commerce growth should continue for the foreseeable future,” said eMarketer senior analyst Yory Wumser in a statement.   A pick-up in sales of apparel and accessories, books and video, computers and electronics, office equipment and sporting goods items are all expected to be areas of increased interest during the season. At the beginning of the 2016 cycle, the National Retail Federation categorized the back-to-school season as one in which families would “stock up” on more new items rather than “make do” with reused supplies from the previous school year. However, by mid-August, families with children enrolled in kindergarten through 12 grade had only checked off about half of the items on their lists. NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said then the delay in completing shopping to-dos was a result of consumers wanting to take advantage of last-minute deals as retailers brought in new fall merchandise.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT That trend helps illustrate the way Great Recession-scarred consumers have become conditioned to expect sales and deep discounts. In the midst of the shopping season last year, 48% of surveyed parents said they were influenced by coupons, up five percentage points from the prior year, while others said they planned to take advantage of in-store promotions and advertising inserts, and 53% said they would head to discount stores to finish prepping for the new school year.   E-commerce giants like Amazon (AMZN) have increasingly become go-to destinations for shoppers wanting to find the best deals on everything from the latest gadgets to home goods and even apparel. The move online has, in recent years, pressured traditional bricks-and-mortar stores as they offer deeper discounts – often resulting in thinner margins – to better compete with nimble online giants.

Agata Blaszczak-Boxe Contributing Writer LiveScience.com June 13, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Hair Regrowth Products for Women & Men: Who Pays More?More Products aimed at regrowing hair cost more when they are marketed to women than when they are marketed to men, a new study finds. Researchers found, for example, that one popular product, Rogaine, cost 40 percent more when it was marketed to woman than when it was marketed to men. One foaming Rogaine product marketed to women cost $11.27 per 30 milliliters (mL), but a product of the same strength and with the same ingredients that was marketed to men cost $8.05 per 30 mL. This isn't the first time that researchers have uncovered gender-based price differences for consumer products. Indeed, this price mark-up practice for products marketed to women has a name: the "pink tax," said study co-author Dr. Jules Lipoff, an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania. [7 Bizarre Drug Side Effects] But in the case of hair-loss products, the product involved contains a medication, called minoxidil. This phenomenon — of gender-based price differences in medications — has not been reported before, Lipoff told Live Science. In the new study, published June 7 in the journal JAMA Dermatology, researchers looked at hair-loss products sold at 24 national chain pharmacies — including CVS, Kroger, Rite Aid, Target, Walgreens and Walmart — in four states: Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio and Indiana. The researchers examined the prices, compositions and other information related to a total of 41 products. All of the products contained minoxidil, an over-the-counter topical medication approved for treating hair loss. The researchers looked at a total of 14 products marketed to women and 27 products for men. In the study, the researchers considered that different products contained different concentrations of minoxidil. In one part of the study, the researchers compared the prices of "extra-strength" products sold to men with the prices of "regular-strength" products sold to women. In both cases, the products were to be applied twice daily. They found that the prices of these two types of product were almost the same: about $7.60 per 30 mL, on average, even though the "extra-strength" product contained 5-percent minoxidil and the "regular-strength" product contained 2-percent minoxidil. In other words, women were being asked to pay the same amount for a product that contained a lower concentration of minoxidil. And when the researchers looked at the prices of products that contained equal concentrations of minoxidil, they found that those marketed to women were significantly more expensive. In this case, the products in question were a 5-percent minoxidil Rogaine foam product marketed to men and 5-percent minoxidil Rogaine foam products marketed to women. For men, the 5-percent solution was to be applied twice daily, and for women, the 5-percent solution was to be applied once daily. All in all, the products marketed to women were about 40 percent more expensive than those that were marketed to men, they concluded. [Busted! 6 Gender Myths in the Bedroom & Beyond] This means that "Although women use minoxidil foam once daily compared with twice daily for men, the group of people (women) who require the same medication less often are paying more for each dose," the researchers wrote. Even though there may be differences in the costs of testing the product, submitting it for approval and marketing it to women versus men, "it remains that women are paying significantly more than men for an identical medication," the researchers wrote. There is, however, a simple way for women to overcome this issue, Lipoff said. "There is nothing that restricts women from just buying the other product," he said. "I can say as a general rule, when I think Rogaine for women would be indicated, I have no hesitation in telling them to use the Rogaine for men."  Marc Boston, a spokesperson for Johnson & Johnson, the makers of Rogaine, said that the price of its Unscented Foam product, which contains 5-percent minoxidil, is the same for the men's version as it is for the women's version. "Both men's Rogaine Unscented Foam and women's Rogaine Unscented Foam are priced the same when sold in the same size volume, can for can, both on our Rogaine brand retail web page and when we sell to retailers," Boston told Live Science in an email.  In the study, the researchers focused on prices at retail stores. They did not include Rogaine's website in their analysis. Originally published on Live Science.

The Gillette News Record reports 23-year-old Lydia Marie Cormaney was arrested on June 5 after trying to leave Walmart with nearly $1,900 worth of merchandise. Court records say investigators later found thousands of dollars’ worth of stolen items in her dorm room. Cormaney told officers she began shoplifting after being forced to move into a new dorm room, away from her roommate who had many of the household items. She said she was caught once when she tried to leave Walmart with three flat-screen televisions. Cormaney made an initial court appearance on June 8 and did not enter a plea. A preliminary hearing is set for Wednesday.

Jenelle Evans has been fighting for custody of her first-born son for years. This Teen Mom 2 star decided to sign over the rights to Jace when he was just a few weeks old to her own mother so she could care for him. Barbara felt it was the best thing for Jace, as he was in need of healthcare and she could provide it for him through her work at Walmart. Just a few weeks ago, Jenelle finally got her court date, and she went to court to learn whether the judge would be granting her full custody. Sadly, the judge agreed with her mother and Jace had to stay with her, but Barbara could no longer keep Jace from Jenelle. This week, she finally got to spend some time with Jace, and she decided to take him on a solo vacation so they could have some valuable mother-son time together. According to a new set of tweets, Jenelle Evans is now defending her decision to take Jace on a trip alone with her son. As it turns out, Evans faced a lot of criticism for supposedly leaving her other kids at home, as if she was neglecting them to spend time with Jace. I love all my kids equally. Sometimes each of them like their one-on-one time with me. Sorry if you don't agree. ????????‍♀️ — Jenelle Evans (@PBandJenelley_1) June 13, 2017 As Jenelle Evans points out in her tweets, Jace deserved to go on a trip with his mother alone. Right after Evans went to court, it was revealed that Barbara had been keeping Jace from his biological mother, and Jenelle hadn’t seen her son for over five weeks. This bonding time is valuable for them, as they are rebuilding their relationship. Jace has revealed that he wants to live with his mother, so it makes sense for them to have some bonding time together. He shouldn’t feel as if he’s neglected by Jenelle at all despite losing in court. Really want to know more about Laboraide??

But this year, something is remarkably different when it comes to Foggy Bottom and the resources needed for America’s civilian forces around the world. A resounding chorus of voices — from the battlefields to the halls of Capitol Hill, from houses of worship to the boardrooms of our country’s CEOs — is singing off the same song sheet. And their message is loud and clear: cutting one-third of our footprint around the world would endanger our national security, threaten our economic prosperity, and profoundly weaken our moral leadership around the world. Most profound has been the steady drumbeat of our nation’s most decorated combatant commanders testifying on Capitol Hill over the past several months, underscoring the critical role that diplomacy and development contribute to protecting America. The fact that these active duty commanders have joined with the voices of Defense Secretary James Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, and more than 120 retired three- and four-star generals and admirals is significant, but not surprising. They know better than most that the military alone cannot keep our nation safe.   I was moved when I heard the voices of more than 100 evangelical and Catholic faith leaders who wrote to Congress saying, “we cannot turn our backs on those in desperate need.” Most recently, 225 chief executives and business leaders from the likes of Coca-Cola, Land O’Lakes, Cargill, UPS, Walmart, and hundreds more from across the country added their voice, reminding us that engagement overseas is about jobs here at home and that strategic investments in the State Department and USAID “make America safer and more prosperous.” But this powerful chorus can also be heard on Capitol Hill with nearly 200 lawmakers from both sides of the aisles on record opposing these steep cuts. From the Freedom Caucus to the Progressive Caucus, members raised alarm bells about the risks to America’s interests if we pull back from the world — and they don’t seem to agree on anything. The reality is that cuts of this nature impact America’s interests at their core. Whether it’s the proposed cuts of 66 percent to the Republic of Georgia — an ally who is on the frontlines pushing back on Russian aggression — or gutting our assistance to nine Latin American countries who could run to China, America’s leadership is on the line. What will a 26 percent cut to global health programs mean for our ability to swiftly respond to the next Ebola? I suspect these are some of the questions that lawmakers will pose in the hearings this week. What is most unusual is not citizens rising up, but the unusual chorus of voices. For more than 30 years, I’ve organized bipartisan coalitions in support of America’s global leadership. I learned a lot over the years, helping found the Congressional Human Rights Caucus as a young Hill staffer and galvanizing a diversity of ideological support. I had a front row seat to district-by-district grassroots mobilizing as political director of AIPAC. Yet today, as the founder and head of the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC), I’m in awe of the profound demonstration of political power, including Republicans, Democrats, and Independents, along with our nation’s military, faith, humanitarian, and business leaders standing together in support of America’s diplomats and development workers. This week more than 500 influential leaders from our “strange bedfellows” coalition from around the country will come together in our nation’s capital for the USGLC’s State Leaders Summit. It will be my greatest privilege to join veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside small business leaders and pastors as they share their stories from Main Street with their elected officials on why America’s global leadership matters. But they also will speak to the need for effective, accountable, results-driven, and robust international affairs programs. They will share the story of the decade-long bipartisan efforts to transform how our nation delivers results for the American people. From the Millennium Challenge Corporation to Feed the Future and Power Africa, a transformation has taken place from providing merely a hand out — which we thank goodness do at times of humanitarian crisis — to providing a hand up. But there is more reform that is needed and our nation is well-positioned to continue building on this success with the nomination of Ambassador Mark Green to lead USAID. At a time when some voices are calling for America to pull back from the world, I still remember a reporter asking me how I would grade a Republican presidential candidate that was vocal in his disdain for “nation building.” While the 2000 presidential campaign is long gone, President George W. Bush became one of the greatest champions for American leadership in the fight against global poverty — with more than 11 million people alive today because of the HIV/AIDS program launched during his presidency. So I remain an optimist, as I see lawmaker after lawmaker learn, engage, and reach that same conclusion: development and diplomacy matters. As the focus returns to the budget this week for the State Department and USAID, I know that when citizens raise their voices, members of Congress listen. And this chorus of citizen voices is not just singing loud and clear — but they’re also keenly listening to what policymakers have to say, because when it comes to America’s global leadership the stakes couldn’t be higher.

Blog Elon Musk: Galactic pioneer or asphalt cowboy? Business What rate volatility? ‘Tepid and anemic’ freight demand tampers assumed impact of ELDs Aaron Huff | @AaronHuffCCJ | June 13, 2017 Bandera, Texas-based Barton Logistics, a user of Trucker Tools’ integrated Load Track platform, is able to streamline its freight matching and tracking process. Every Wednesday, Diane McHaney downloads rate data from DAT Solutions into spreadsheets. As the pricing analyst for Barton Logistics, a nonasset transportation company based in Bandera, Texas, she applies statistical tools to identify trends in spot and contract freight markets. Of particular interest is the mode — the most frequently occurring value in the data set. Also important is the standard deviation of DAT’s rolling 15- and 30-day spot market rate data. Both of these statistical tools help identify early signs of rate volatility. One year ago, this ongoing analysis led McHaney and Criss Wilson, Barton’s vice president of operations, to predict that rates would increase dramatically prior to December 2017 as more carriers came into compliance with the electronic logging device mandate. Pricing would be much higher, they surmised, as ELDs took capacity away from small fleets and owner-operators by lowering their utilization. Both now believe their predictions were wrong. “We have learned that quite the opposite of that is happening,” McHaney says. As more carriers implement ELDs, rates actually are less volatile, she says. Related 2017 ELD Buyers’ Guide Since the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s late 2015 release of its final rule for using electronic logging devices, there’s been a rising swell of ... “(ELDs) are not having any effect right now,” Wilson says. “There is nothing that leads us to believe there is any volatility in the market right now.” Wilson believes that any rate increases will come from the demand side of the equation, but demand so far this year has been “tepid and anemic,” he says. The last time Wilson saw positive volatility was last November and December. This was to be expected during the peak retail season, but then rates “tanked” after the second week of January, he says. Spot market rates have recovered gradually since but remain at a low average of $1.40 to $1.50 per mile. Surprisingly, there has been more volatility with contract rates, where the mode “is all over the place,” Wilson says. But the volatility is not widespread, and the DAT rolling 30-day average for contract rates has “pretty much flat-lined,” he says. The data leads Wilson to believe that any volatility in contract rates is short-lived and limited to certain geographic regions. As for why the ELD mandate has not impacted rates as many believed it would, Wilson points to “an underlying structural change going on in the market.” What changed? Motor carriers are acting more like freight brokers, he says. Many of the top freight brokers in the market today began as motor carriers. These asset-based transportation companies have grown their brokerage divisions rapidly by managing more freight in lanes that their carrier operations no longer can service due to higher costs and lower utilization, some of which can be attributed to the use of ELDs, Wilson says. Asset-based transportation companies hold a marketing advantage with shippers since they directly control their equipment and drivers, but brokerage and third-party logistics providers have leveled the playing field with technology. Nonasset companies can provide shippers with the same supply chain visibility — if not better, Wilson says. Barton would like all of its carriers to use freight-tracking apps from Trucker Tools and MacroPoint. “Carriers that resist using these free tools are not likely using ELDs, either,” he says. Wilson estimates that less than half of the carriers that work with Barton have not implemented ELDs yet, based on their pushback when required to use tracking tools. “If you haul for Barton Logistics, you agree to use tracking tools,” he says. Status quo — for now From what TransRisk has seen in the data the futures provider uses from DAT Solutions, spot-market rates are coming back up, says Craig Fuller, TransRisk founder and CEO. ELDs aren’t likely to have much of an impact on trucking rates prior to December 2017, says Craig Fuller, founder and chief executive officer of TransRisk. Fuller believes any impacts are more likely to be seen in the spot market – until March 2018. Although enforcement is supposed to begin in December, the execution of the mandate likely will be different by state, Fuller says. True enforcement may not begin until more insurers start requiring carriers to provide proof of ELD compliance before selling policies, he says. Fuller has a vested interest in rates becoming volatile because of ELDs and other factors. He founded TransRisk to offer a “trucking futures market” to shippers, brokers and carriers seeking to hedge rate volatility risk. Similar to futures and derivatives markets for other industries, contracts with TransRisk will be settled financially rather than exchanged for actual goods or services. “A truck will not show up at your door because you bought a future (contract),” he says. Fuller got the idea for TransRisk in 2014 while consulting for a high-tech brokerage firm and day-trading on the side. He researched a futures market for maritime transportation called the Baltic Exchange. TransRisk provides rate data and information to its market participants. From what Fuller has seen in the data the company uses from DAT, spot-market rates are “slowly but surely coming back up,” but there has not been much volatility caused by ELDs or any other source. Anecdotally, carriers that have implemented e-logs have indicated they’ve lost between 2 and 6 percent utilization, he says. Even if the overall trucking industry were to lose 2 percent of its total capacity in the next 12 months, the rate impact would be minimal, Fuller believes. But if 6 percent of capacity were taken out of the market, the impact on rates would be “exponentially more” because of how the supply chain works, he says. Shippers likely would overbid rates to move their loads more quickly. Fuller says trucking capacity may decrease by a “couple percent” in 2018 because a small segment of the industry – primarily small fleets and owner-operators – could lose their profit margins due to hours-of-service compliance. The ELD rule’s full impact will be difficult to gauge, he argues, since other variables could play a factor for the remainder of 2017 and into 2018, including e-commerce growth, changes in trade policy, government spending and more. While owner-operator analyst Todd Amen agrees that any bump in rates from the ELD mandate will come later than initially thought, he foresees a slightly different timeframe. Amen is president of ATBS, the country’s largest owner-operator business services firm that works with about 40,000 drivers — the well from which the company draws its mileage and income data. “We believe a rate increase is coming, not by the end of 2017, but in 2017 and into 2018,” says Amen, who predicts ELD implementation will spur rate growth until about mid-2018 and that rates could grow by as much as 10 percent during that time. Some indications that rate volatility could begin ahead of the December 2017 mandate are starting to appear. In May, Walmart sent a letter to motor carriers and 3PLs participating in its annual bid. The retail giant noted that a “high variance in rates” was submitted for its truckload bid. In response, the company announced it would invite additional nonincumbent parties to participate in a third round. Historically, Walmart has conducted only two rounds of bidding before awarding lanes. While the Walmart bids may show signs of carriers re-evaluating their rate structures because of ELDs, they also show the pressure that Walmart and other retailers are facing to compete with Amazon’s rapid growth. Making up lost productivity One possible reason why e-logs have not had a measurable impact on capacity may be that fleets also use other technologies alongside their ELD applications. Pete Allen, executive vice president of sales for MiX Telematics, says that sophisticated fleets are leveraging their investments in e-logs with companion applications that help maximize fuel efficiency and safety. MiX is one of many ELD providers that offer platforms with performance applications — including video event recorders and route planning tools — that help fleets generate additional returns on investment. Fleets that use a simple ELD solution for compliance alone are “missing out on the opportunity that the mandate is bringing,” Allen says. “ELDs are not designed to improve productivity, but fleet management technology is.” ELDs alone can offer some returns by eliminating time that drivers spend filling out logs and the subsequent back-office administration. They also can increase drive time by 15 minutes a day or more, since ELDs record duty status activities to the minute rather than in 15-minute increments on paper log grids, Allen says. Better in the end “Electronic logs woke us up and made us understand we were losing money. We had no choice but to give up or raise our rates.” Steve Rush, president of Wharton, N.J.-based Carbon Express For Carbon Express, e-logs have been a catalyst for profitable growth during the past nine years. The Wharton, N.J.-based company has grown from 23 trucks to more than 50 during that time. Steve Rush, Carbon’s president, credits e-logs for forcing management to become both profitable and safe by re-evaluating the fleet’s lane profitability. The company raised rates in lanes where it could and grew its brokerage division to transport loads that it couldn’t service profitably with its own assets. “Electronic logs woke us up and made us understand we were losing money,” Rush says. “We had no choice but to give up or raise our rates.” Carbon’s customers have taken notice of the company’s culture and stability and “want to know that when the ELD mandate hits in 2017, you are going to keep on going,” he says. Carbon made another significant change in 2010. To increase both capacity and revenue, it replaced its fleet of sleeper cabs with daycabs. The decision gave the company 20 percent more capacity than competitors that run sleeper cabs, but it came with the added cost of hotel rooms for drivers. “When we got rid of sleeper cabs, we did it to get more business,” Rush says. “At the end of the day, we also saw what hotel rooms did for our drivers. It improves their self-respect and dignity.” Rush credits e-logs and hotel stays, along with increased driver pay, for an annual turnover rate in the single digits. Drivers have “got it down to a science” of where to stay along their routes, he says. Carbon planners use real-time driver log data from the fleet’s Omnitracs mobile platform in its TMW Suite dispatch system to match loads with drivers and provide them with consistent schedules and sleep patterns. Carbon also uses the data for pricing. The company charges premiums for delivery appointments after hours and on weekends that could require adjusting drivers’ schedules and sleep patterns. “People want a routine that fits them,” Rush says. Carbon pays drivers by the hour for loads of less than 250 miles and a mileage rate for longer hauls. The company also pays for all pickups and deliveries, and drivers get a bonus when circumstances require them to take a 34-hour reset on the road. “We firmly believe that the combination of going to e-logs and running legally, coupled with the elimination of sleeper cabs from our fleet and putting our drivers in hotels, has been the driving force in our success in the areas of safety, low driver turnover and the enhancement of our drivers’ self-esteem,” Rush says.

Richard Jones walked out of the Johnson County jail Thursday afternoon after his lawyers convinced a Johnson County judge Wednesday that his conviction was based on just one eyewitness. “It’s unbelievable, I ain’t seen myself being here,” Jones said as he walked out of the detention center. “It’s been 17 years. Something I ain’t do, but I’m thankful. I’m blessed.” It was an emotional moment Jones never thought he’d see: hugging family, friends and strangers who helped prove his innocence. “I just know that I have friends for life,” he said. “They family to me, not friends, they family, I’m just grateful.” “We work on cases all the time trying to get people out, and sometimes we’re successful, sometimes we’re not,” Jones’s attorney Alice Craig said. “This was actually a good day for us.” Jones’ lawyers with the Midwest Innocence Project showed these mug shots to the judge claiming the other similar looking man should be charged with the crime.

The publication notes that Fortune 500 companies represent two-thirds of the U.S. GDP with $12 trillion in revenues, $890 billion in profits (up $50 billion from 2016), $19 trillion in market value (up $2 trillion from 2016), and employ 28.2 million people worldwide. With $486 billion in 2016 sales, Walmart topped the list for the fifth consecutive year, while other household names comprised the majority of the top 75. Here's the overall top 10: Rank Company 2016 Revenue 2016 Rank 1.  Walmart $485.87 billion 1 2.  Berskshire Hathaway $223.60 billion 4 3. Apple $215.64 billion 3 4. Exxon Mobile $205.00 billion 2 5. McKesson $192.49 billion 5 6. UnitedHealth Group $184.84 billion 6 7. CVS Health $177.53 billion 7 8. General Motors $166.38 billion 8 9. AT&T $163.79 billion 10 10. Ford Motor $151.80 billion 9 All the 2016 top 10 companies repeated in 2017, with six of them holding the same position. Let's take a look at where industrial manufacturing and distribution companies — including those on Industrial Distribution's Big 50 List, along with other relevant companies to the industrial supply market — made their mark on this year's Fortune 500, which actually extends to 1,000. Bolded companies were on ID's 2016 Big 50 List: 12. Amazon.com - $135.99 billion (2016: 18) 13. General Electric - $126.66 billion 23. Home Depot - $94.60 billion (2016: 28) 40.

Airgas - $5.31 billion (No. 7 on Big 50, 2016: 484) At No. 282, Grainger was the first industrial distributor to crack the list, with $10.14 billion in 2016 revenue. It moved up three spots from a year ago. It's been a steady climb up the list for Grainger, which was No. 391 in 2006 and rose to 328 by 2011. Its biggest jump was from 2012 to 2013 when it jumped 23 spots. This year's mark is Grainger's highest since Fortune started tracking the list's ranking history in 1995. At No. 364 and $7.52 billion in sales, HD Supply fell 44 spots from last year. It first appeared on the list in 2013 at No. 330. At No. 373, WESCO International checks in at $7.34 billion in sales and 16 spots down from a year ago. WESCO was No. 448 in 2010 and peaked at No. 349 in 2014. It first cracked the Fortune 500 in 199 at No. 485. Airgas made the list at No. 489, down five spots from 2016 with $5.31 billion in sales. Airgas — now an Air Liquide company — narrowly missed the Fortune 500 in 2015, but returned in 2016. The company first made the list in 2010 at No. 474, but didn't reappear until 2014 at No. 498. Beyond the top 500, notable industrial distributors and other companies on Fortune's list of 1,000 includes: 574. Watsco - $4.22 billion 582. Beacon Roofing Supply - $4.13 billion (2016: 837) 589. Flowserve - $3.99 billion (2016: 539) 591. Fastenal - $3.96 billion (No. 10 on Big 50, 2016: 607) 603.

Kaman - $1.81 billion (Parent to Big 50 No. 20 Kaman Industrial Technologies, 2016: N/A) Fastenal jumped up 16 spots from last year, while MRC Global tumbled 185 as it and many other distributors and suppliers tied to oil & gas customers struggled through much of 2015 and 2016. MRC has fallen a combined a whopping 278 spots since it was No. 488 in 2015). Meanwhile, MSC Industrial fell five spots from 2016, Applied Industrial Technologies fell 26 spots and NOW Inc. — which does business at DistributionNOW — fell 183 spots. It was the same story for many well-known industrial suppliers. Flowserve fell 50 spots from 2016; General Cable fell 59 spots; Timken fell 24 spots; Lincoln Electric fell 36 spots; Kennametal fell 106 spots and H.B. Fuller fell 36 spots. Snap-on managed to climb 12 spots from 2016. Coming Soon: The 2017 Industrial Distribution Big 50 List Preparations are underway for this year's annual Big 50 List. ID newsletter subscribers can expect to see an email invitation in late June to fill out our annual Big 50 survey, which we use to compile the list. Like the Fortune 500, the ID Big 50 List is based solely on each company's previous full year sales. So for most companies, their 2017 ranking will be based on 2016 sales. The Big 50 will first be unveiled via a video countdown presentation in late August, followed by its feature in the September/October print issue and an online article.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) The Eastman Chemical Co. -- one of the largest chemical manufacturers in the United States, which like many U.S. firms supported the Paris climate accord -- discontinued membership in one of the few trade groups that argued to the Trump administration that the landmark climate deal was not worthwhile. Leading up to President Trump's announcement in June, hundreds of businesses publicly pledged support of the Paris accord. But more discreetly, the Industrial Energy Consumers of America told the White House that Paris disadvantaged U.S. manufacturers, arguing in two letters sent to the Trump administration -- one in April and another in May -- that "IECA fails to see the benefit of the Paris Climate Accord." But that was not the public position of every IECA member on the Paris agreement, including Eastman. In the case of Eastman, the disagreement was strong enough to warrant leaving the trade group. "While we valued the IECA's work in areas unrelated to climate change, the organization's action is so at odds with Eastman's position that we also cannot reconcile continued participation in IECA with our commitment to sustainability," David A. Golden, a senior vice president and chief legal and sustainability officer at Eastman, wrote to the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, an international human-rights organization that queried Eastman and other IECA members about their Paris stance following IECA's lobbying effort.  "As such," Golden wrote, "this week we discontinued our IECA membership." In an email statement to the Washington Post, Golden confirmed Eastman’s withdrawal from the IECA, adding that the company aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production by 20 percent by 2020 from 2008 levels. The Business and Human Rights Resource Centre published that and other letters it received from IECA members late Monday. The center made its inquiries after the Natural Resources Defense Council pointed out the discrepancy between IECA's stance and that of some of its members on the Paris agreement earlier this month. Paul Cicio, president of IECA, said the trade group speaks only for itself and not for its companies. Indeed, IECA’s letters to the White House disclose: “Climate policies vary by company.” “We did not say we oppose the agreement or support the agreement.” Cicio said. “We simply said we ‘fail to see the benefit.’” Cicio added that members receive drafts of letters and have the opportunity to weigh in on language. “There does not have to be an agreement by all,” Cicio said. “Majority views prevail.” Eastman's decision to leave the trade association highlights the rift that has developed in the American business community over Trump's decision to exit the Paris accord. Many large consumer-facing companies, like Apple, Gap and Levi's, asked the Trump administration to remain in the climate agreement that is largely popular with its employees and customers, publicly pushing their position in full-page newspaper ads. Meanwhile, some energy-intensive firms, which would bear the brunt of greenhouse-gas regulations, supported U.S. withdrawal from Paris, though most often less publicly.  The rift is playing out in trade groups such as IECA — which represents a diverse set of chemical, metal, paper, glass and cement manufacturers — that find themselves caught in the middle of the two camps. It’s unclear how many groups fall on either side of the divide within IECA, as it doesn’t publicly disclose its members. (The members revealed by the NRDC came from a list it obtained.) "It reminds me of over 80 companies that left the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which similarly opposes any climate-based regulation," Gregory Regaignon, research director at the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre, told me by email. "While some who left ALEC were mum about their reasons, Google, Enterprise, Shell, Unilever, Wal-Mart and others were explicit that they left over disagreement with ALEC’s policies."  Those policies, Regaignon said, include stances on climate, voter-ID, worker rights, healthcare and public safety laws. Eastman was not the only IECA manufacturer that sought to clarify the record. Owens Corning, which manufactures insulation and roofing materials, distanced itself from the trade group after the Paris decision. "We are members of many industry organizations that provide value to our company and our customers," Owens Corning told the human-rights nonprofit. "We virtually never find ourselves in alignment with all the positions of any industry organization, including IECA in this case." International Paper, one of the largest pulp and paper companies in the world, also put itself at arm's length from IECA. Previously, the company had said it aims to reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by a fifth from 2010 levels by the end of the decade, "We were not involved in the development of the letter and do not agree with the organization's decision to send it," the company wrote. "We participate in IECA mainly to access the organization's vast reservoir of energy data and reports." SABIC, or the Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation, a chemical manufacturer, also said that it "did not review or approve" the IECA letter sent directly to President Trump in May before it went to the White House. A majority of SABIC shares are controlled by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which ratified the Paris accord in November shortly before Trump's election. But while disagreeing with IECA's stance, the three companies have remained part of the group. This story has been updated.

SIGN UP NOW POWER PLAYS EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt chatting with Germany's environment minister (EPA/GIORGIO BENVENUTI) THE LONG GOODBYE TO PARIS CONTINUES: -- The waves generated by President Trump's splashy decision to leave the Paris agreement are rippling beyond just the climate-change issue and into other areas of environmental policy. Scott Pruitt, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, withheld signing off on large portions of the communique sent out Monday by the environmental chiefs of G-7 nations, who met in Italy over the weekend. As a result, the United States was relegated to a footnote in the climate-change section of the official G-7 report, as this New York Times reporter notes: "The U.S. is now left as a footnote to climate action and that's very sad," said the Canadian environment minister. https://t.co/p2C2khVzMX— Hiroko Tabuchi (@HirokoTabuchi) June 12, 2017 The United States (unsurprisingly) did not "reaffirm strong commitment to the swift and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement," as the other six G-7 nations did. But it also (surprisingly) did not affirm some relatively benign international environmental agreements. The Post's Chris Mooney reports:  But by withdrawing its assent from the entire section on climate change, the United States also did not endorse the relatively uncontroversial Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which aims to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs, which are used in air conditioners and other industrial products and also drive climate change. Nor did it endorse efforts by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to cut emissions from the global aircraft fleet. The EPA did not comment on Pruitt's decision regarding this other language. While it may not be the beginning of any new U.S. policy regarding the Montreal Protocol, it is at very least a continuation of a starkly different tone from the Trump administration on international agreements. Here is a must-read from The Post's Ellen Nakashima on the threat hackers allied with the Russian government pose to the U.S. electric grid: The malware, which researchers have dubbed CrashOverride, is known to have disrupted only one energy system — in Ukraine in December. In that incident, the hackers briefly shut down one-fifth of the electric power generated in Kiev But with modifications, it could be deployed against U.S. electric transmission and distribution systems to devastating effect, said Sergio Caltagirone, director of threat intelligence for Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that studied the malware and issued a report Monday. And Russian government hackers have shown their interest in targeting U.S. energy and other utility systems, researchers said. “It’s the culmination of over a decade of theory and attack scenarios,” Caltagirone warned. “It’s a game changer.”       A teen Inupiat Eskimo goes ice-hopping in N.W. Alaska. (Getty) -- The Trump administration cannot squash the kids-vs.-Trump climate trial. At least not yet. Chelsea Harvey reports for The Post: "Late last week, a federal judge denied a Trump administration move to prevent a major climate change lawsuit from going to trial. The case, being brought by 21 young people against the federal government, is now closer to a full-fledged trial that will pit the Trump administration against children and young adults who insist the government is undermining their future through climate change inaction. It’s a 'very significant' decision, according to chief counsel for the plaintiffs, Julia Olson, executive director of advocacy group Our Children’s Trust. 'This allows us to keep moving forward to trial.'" -- A new New York Times interactive asks the question: "How Much Do You Know About Solving Global Warming?" DECONSTRUCTION SITES Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke enjoys a horseback ride in the Bears Ears National Monument in May 2017. (Scott G Winterton/The Deseret News via AP) Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has made his recommendation on the Bears Ears National Monument. The verdict: President Trump should “revise the existing boundaries” of the area his predecessor designated with protective status under the 1906 Antiquities Act. The Trump administration should also ask Congress to give Native American tribes authority to co-manage "designated cultural resources." But that decision isn't final. Zinke also recommended holding off on a final decision until all 27 national monuments designated by President Obama are reviewed. Meaning environmental and Native America activists will fight on for another day.   I recommend the monument, especially the areas of significant cultural interest, be comanaged by the Tribal nations. https://t.co/OdIKxG7ZWQ— Secretary Ryan Zinke (@SecretaryZinke) June 12, 2017 Utah's congressional delegation supported the move: "When I hear of a national monument, I think of a statue, not millions of acres of land."-- @JennaLeeUSA #BearsEars #utpol pic.twitter.com/Wv8tUS8TrJ— Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) June 12, 2017 The tens of thousands of archaeological sites in Bears Ears, which catalog the history of indigenous people in the area but recently have been subject to vandalism, attracted the attention of the Obama administration. The Post's Darryl Fears and Juliet Eilperin offer a window into the fraught politics of public land disputes: During the afternoon news conference, Zinke said he and a deputy assistant spoke with Native leaders, a majority of whom support the Bears Ears designation and fought the monument’s review at every step. “Overall, in talking to tribal leadership… they’re pretty happy and willing to work with us,” he said. The statement brought a quick rebuke from representatives of the Navajo Nation. “I haven’t been happy with him since day one,” said Davis Filfred. “I don’t know what that word happy is.” Filfred said he told Zinke, and later his assistant, whom the secretary did not name, that the coalition of Ute, Navajo, Hopi and Zuni tribe leaders who fought 10 years for a monument designation wanted no change. He said Zinke is apparently speaking with the leader of a small Navajo faction that opposed the monument but isn’t part of the nation’s leadership. “We don’t want it to be rescinded,” Filfred said. “We wanted it left alone. Right now, what I’m hearing is this is only a recommendation. But when they do make that move, we’re ready as a Navajo nation for a lawsuit, and all the other tribal leaders are ready. We have others who are ready for litigation. This is uncalled for.”   The senior culture writer for Buzzfeed News has more: Here's an overview of the 100,000 sacred sites in Bears Ear & why they need protecting:https://t.co/QPlZRgVD4w— Anne Helen Petersen (@annehelen) June 12, 2017 -- On Monday, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs approved Trump's nominee to run the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Brock Long.  Early on, the Trump administration earned a reputation for nominating Cabinet members with seemingly little experience relevant to the agency they would run. Think of Ben Carson, a neurosurgeon atop the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Or of Betsy DeVos, the philanthropist picked to run the Department of Education. Perhaps drawing from President George W. Bush's disastrous decision to fill FEMA with leaders inexperienced in emergency preparedness, Trump took a different tack with FEMA and erred on the side of expertise. Long is an experienced emergency manager, most recently having worked as director of the Emergency Management Agency in Alabama, a state that has dealt with its fair share of hurricanes. -- After receiving complaints from chemical companies, Scott Pruitt has decided to delay implementing a chemical-safety rule issued by the EPA under the Obama administration, The Hill reports.

Tuesday, Jun 13, 2017 Search Archive Chinese Chinese Japanese French Spanish Russian Arabic Korea German Portuguese HomeOpinionsBusinessMilitaryWorldSocietyCultureTravelScienceSportsSpecial CoveragePhotoVideo English>>Opinion What Americans don't get about China By Dori Jones Yang (People's Daily Online)    17:16, June 13, 2017 In China, almost every major city has a subway, new, clean, and graffiti-free. Even though most riders are Chinese, the speaker system makes announcements in both Mandarin and British-accented English. At each stop, passengers are reminded to “mind the gap” between the platform and train. “Mind the gap” is good advice also for Americans who have not visited China lately. During a recent three-week, six-city trip around China, I was surprised by its widespread economic prosperity—no longer based on cheap labor or exports. Flights between cities were full—not of foreign tourists but almost entirely of Chinese travelers. The lobby of the fanciest hotel in Shanghai—the Grand Hyatt in an 88-story skyscraper—was packed with locals eager to pay US$200 or more for a single night of luxury. The view from the high-speed train showed large-scale agribusiness, highly mechanized, and block after block of high-rise apartment buildings ready to house the farmers now leaving once-grueling jobs in the fields. What a contrast from China’s crowded countryside in the 1980s, when I covered the country’s economy for Business Week. This time, I didn’t see a single charming coolie hat or water buffalo. Common American perceptions of China—fueled by then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric of unfair trade practices—are sadly out of date. More than 81 percent of China’s GDP is now fueled by its own domestic demand, not by Walmart’s made-in-China toys and sporting goods. That’s up from 64 percent ten years ago. Wages are rising in China, so that cheap-labor factories are forced to relocate to Mexico or Vietnam. Most of my husband’s relatives, poor thirty years ago, now own several condos and new cars. One just bought a second home on the tropical island of Hainan. Another invited us to a luxurious wedding in Nanjing with a huge banquet, gorgeous bridal outfits, and live entertainment with a professional singer, bubbles, and a stage show. What really struck us was how well-off ordinary Chinese are now. My husband’s nephew, raised in a rural home with no running water, now owns a Nanjing company selling sound-proof booths for hearing tests. A friend’s son, once unable to gain college admission in China, now sells his own brand of cosmetics and employs two hundred people. My husband’s niece’s husband quit his job as a newspaper editor to run a winery started. He produces two thousand bottles of red wine, and the quality—as judged by our wine-happy American relatives—is up to international standards. These products are all sold only in China. With an annual growth rate of 6.7 percent and a population of 1.37 billion, who needs to think about exports? Our San Francisco son-in-law expressed envy that Chinese entrepreneurs faced such obvious odds of success. Construction cranes dot the skyline of China’s major cities—too many to count, as the urban population booms. We rode to the top of the 128-story Shanghai Tower, the world’s second tallest building; it’s higher than any skyscraper in the United States. Highways are packed with Mercedes, BMWs, Toyotas, Fords, and—one of the most prestigious models—Buicks. Most are made in China, with joint venture partners. Shiny shopping centers are popping up everywhere, many with imported designer brands like Gucci, Guerlain, Burberry, and TUMI. In Shanghai, we visited a Tesla dealership, next door to a shop selling high-end drones. A huge two-story Apple store dwarfed the one at home, and at a Sony store we tried out the latest virtual reality headset. Even Chinese tea and pineapple cakes are packaged as high-end products. 【1】【2】 (For the latest China news, Please follow People's Daily on Twitter and Facebook)(Web editor: Chen Lidan, Bianji) Add your comment Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Source: (Cleveron) Business Business {{1497356520000 | amCalendar}} {{commentsTotal}} Cleveron, a company in Viljandi that produces automated package machines, has received €2.2 million from investors in the form of a loan with the option to a stake in the company. The money is needed to keep up with Cleveron's quickly growing American business. Founder and CEO of Cleveron, Arno Kütt, told ERR that there were fewer than ten investors behind the sum, and that all of it came from Estonia. The company has three years to make a return on the loan it received. Attached to the loan is the option to a stake in Cleveron. If the investors wish to do so, they can acquire a small stake in the company, Kütt confirmed. The share in that case is below 5 percent of Cleveron's total equity. The company is using the investors' money mainly to grow its business in the United States. In autumn last year, Cleveron opened its first package robot in a Walmart supermarket, and the company has confirmed that it wants to sell 15,000 such machines to the U.S. market. Walmart lets customers order ahead. They can then pick up their shopping from the automated packaging machine. As Kütt explains, the company has grown very quickly in the U.S., which is why they needed additional capital. For Cleveron this is the first round of investment raised like this, though in 2008 the Estonian Development Fund along with other investors contributed €1 million to Smartpost, Cleveron's predecessor. Smartpost's machines were later bought by Finnish company Itella, and as the Smartpost brand was part of the deal, the company moved on to its new name, Cleveron. According to Kütt, Cleveron currently has no plan in place how to raise money in the future. At the same time, they had also considered getting the company listed at the Tallinn exchange, he added.

Carmen Ponder says Commerce police arrested her after a confrontation with a motorist who made a racist and sexist comment toward her. Ponder identified the driver as Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews. She says officers arrested her as she left a Wal-Mart and told her to apologize to Crews, which she refused. The Fort Worth law firm Lynn, Ross and Gannaway found no evidence that Crews made any racial statements to Ponder or to anyone else. Ponder's attorney, Lee Merritt, says the investigation failed to address Ponder's allegation that Crews had her arrested illegally. Crews has been on administrative leave since the allegations surfaced May 25. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

ORIGINALS Exclusive interviews, news and more Blue Sky Innovation Blue Sky Originals ShipBob raises $17.5 million to help small businesses ship stuff faster Hilary Higgins / Blue Sky Founders Dhruv Sazena and Divey Gulati at ShipBob Founders Dhruv Sazena and Divey Gulati at ShipBob (Hilary Higgins / Blue Sky) Amina ElahiContact ReporterBlue Sky Innovation ShipBob, a Chicago-based company that aims to help e-commerce sellers ship their wares at Amazon-like speeds, raised $17.5 million, it announced Tuesday. Bain Capital Ventures led the Series B funding, which also included participation from existing investors Hyde Park Venture Partners, Hyde Park Angels, FundersClub and FJ Labs. The funding comes about a year after ShipBob raised a $4 million Series A round led by Hyde Park Venture Partners. Since that funding, ShipBob has added two regional warehouses — in Los Angeles and San Francisco — in addition to the ones it already owned and operated in Chicago and New York. ShipBob holds clients’ inventory in its warehouses and packages and ships orders for them. Dhruv Saxena, ShipBob’s CEO and co-founder, said companies can get deliveries to customers faster if they’re shipping from small regional warehouses, rather than one central hub. He said companies can, in some cases, get orders to customers same-day or next-day. That can be a major factor for the e-commerce businesses ShipBob serves, which range from 150 orders a month to more than 10,000 a day, Saxena said. “That is what we are betting on, is that the Amazons and Walmarts of the world are spending millions of dollars to optimize supply chains,” he said. “If these smaller guys don’t adapt, they will be left behind.” ShipBob charges sellers a prenegotiated fee per shipment, as well as a fee for storing inventory based on how much space items require. Sellers pay ShipBob $35 each time they send a shipment from the manufacturer, as well as $5 per month for bins of items and $40 per month for pallets of items. Saxena said the company hooks into top selling platforms such as Shopify, Amazon and BigCommerce. Its customers include Chicago-based custom furniture company Interior Define, which uses ShipBob to send fabric samples to interested customers, and personal safety device startup Guard Llama. ShipBob also continues to serve crowdfunding successes as well, he said. He declined to comment on the company’s revenue. The company, which was founded in 2014 and went through the Y Combinator accelerator the same year, employs 35 in its Chicago office, with new additions to its sales and marketing teams in the past year. Saxena said he plans to grow to about 100 or 125 employees in the next two years. He plans to hire for sales, marketing and engineering roles. ShipBob also employs about 15 to 20 full-time workers in each of its 50,000- to 80,000-square-foot warehouses, he said. In addition to adding to its core headcount, Saxena said the company intends to add more warehouses across the U.S. He said it will continue to pick locations as it has in the past: by analyzing order data and seeing where there’s the most demand. Until now, ShipBob has seen the most shopper density around the country’s most populous cities. Saxena said the addition of more sellers could change that, and acknowledged regions such as the south and southeast could be served by ShipBob warehouses. aelahi@chicagotribune.com Twitter @aminamania Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, Chicago Tribune Sports Breaking Eat.Drink.Do.

Video game publishers have gone on an incredible run so far in 2017. What's sparked the rally and can it continue? David Kretzmann and Dylan Lewis (TMFPencils) Jun 13, 2017 at 6:04AM In the past 12 months, some of the best-performing stocks on the market are video game producers, with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) being the No. 1 performer in the S&P 500, up a staggering 60%. In this episode of Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analysts Dylan Lewis and David Kretzmann look at the industry overall, and dive into the three biggest players that make up the vast majority of it: Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ:TTWO). Find out how each company has accomplished such incredible growth, how things like microtransactions and mobile games have affected the industry, and some of the biggest risks and opportunities for each company. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on May 26, 2017. Dylan Lewis: Welcome to Industry Focus, the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. It's Friday, May 26, and we're grabbing our controllers to navigate the red-hot world of video game stocks. I'm your host, Dylan Lewis, and that is David Kretzmann hmm-ing on the side. David Kretzmann: This is why we pay you the big bucks, Dylan. Lewis: I thought you might like that intro. Sometimes I try to not give you a heads-up about what I'm going to come in with, and see if I can catch you on surprise like that. Kretzmann: I was impressed. Nicely done. Lewis: David, I had you on last week. We talked about two tech names that were not doing so hot, Twilio and Yelp. Today, we're flipping it over. You're back with me this week to talk about a sector and a couple companies that have just been on fire so far in 2017. Kretzmann: Yeah, some of the best-performing stocks of the year, including Activision and Electronic Arts, essentially that video game space which, as you mentioned, over the past year, and certainly year to date, they've been some of the best performers so far. Lewis: And I know that this is a category that I think some investors dismiss. It's either something they can't really wrap their head around, because it is, in a way, new media. But, like you said, Activision Blizzard is actually the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 year to date, up over 60%. Take-Two Interactive, which we'll also touch on today, and Electronic Arts, both up over 40% year to date. So, this is certainly a category worth paying attention to if you're an investor. Kretzmann: Yeah, not too shabby at all. I think Activision Blizzard was actually the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2014 or 2015 as well, so it isn't just this year. Over the last three to five years, all of these have been incredible investments. Lewis: And when you hear about those types of gains, I think a lot of investors have to look at it and say, "Is it too late to build up a position? What does this market look like? We've already seen a huge surge; are games going to look this attractive moving forward?" We will try to answer that today, at least a little bit. Why don't we start out with the big fish in the space, Activision. I think a lot of Fools are probably familiar with this company. It's been a recommendation for quite some time, as you mentioned, going back to 2014. But, I think it's been involved in the premium services for over a decade. Kretzmann: Yeah. Lewis: And gamers might know this company for its Overwatch and Warcraft franchises, among some others. Recent quarter, the company hit new records for revenue, EPS, and cash flow. David, what's been fueling all that growth for them? Kretzmann: You teed that up nicely. The company, essentially, has three different segments. You have Activision, which is probably best known for Call of Duty and Destiny, those shooter action games. Then, you have Blizzard, which is best known for the online multiplayer games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Then, a couple years ago, they acquired King Digital, which is mobile gaming, most famously Candy Crush. Lewis: I feel like you can see someone playing Candy Crush on any metro commute, it's always there. Kretzmann: It has some incredible staying power, we can talk about that. The main highlight for me this quarter, that Blizzard segment is really doing well thanks to Overwatch, which is now the eighth billion-dollar franchise in the company's overall portfolio of game franchises. That's pretty incredible for just a year. And it's Blizzard's fastest-growing new franchise ever. It's reached over 30 million players globally in less than a year after launch, it launched in spring of last year. That Blizzard segment, thanks to Overwatch, is doing really well. You're seeing their monthly active user count continue to tick up steadily thanks to Overwatch. Lewis: This is, in some ways, kind of like the social media platforms we talk about, where there is that MAU number you can look at an addition to some of the more financial metrics, and get a sense of how these platforms and games are doing. Kretzmann: Yeah, absolutely. One of the things to keep in mind with these video game companies is their quarter-to-quarter results and year-to-year results will be lumpy depending on the timing of a game release. Call of Duty, I'm not sure what sequel they're on, probably seven or eight at this point, but that's obviously huge. Pretty much anything that has Call of Duty on [it] will sell well, even if the reviews aren't all that great. So, that is something to keep in mind. Depending on when you have these new games developed and launched, you will see those numbers ebb and flow. But all in all, you do want to see that user count and overall user engagement continue to tick up over time, because that usually leads to pretty good financial results. Lewis: In some ways, it's kind of like the movie studio business. You find something that resonates with your audience, and you milk, you keep putting out titles in that franchise, because you know it's a story, or the characters, or a storytelling approach, or something like that, that people just love, and they can't get enough of. So, you see that yearly releases or every other year releases for a lot of these titles. Kretzmann: Yeah. That's been an overarching theme and revolution of the video game space. If you go back five or 10 years, primarily, you would go into the store and buy the physical disc of the game. In that case, the shelf life of the game wasn't necessarily that long. You needed to get that physical disc in front of customers, whether it was at Wal-Mart or GameStop or wherever. And if you didn't do well at that initial launch, then the shelf life of that game probably wouldn't be too long. But, the shift toward digital, where people are downloading the games, they're able to do microtransactions within the games, they're able to download extra maps or levels of the games over time, then all of the sudden you can buy a game in 2014 and still be playing it today, still be paying money as a player and a user of that game. That's part of the reason why you're seeing the profitability of all of these companies we're talking about today continue to tick up over time, because that digital revenue is high margin. Once you get those users and you're able to continue to engage with them over time, it doesn't cost a lot to sell another map to them digitally, where people can just download over the internet. Lewis: And you can push updates to those users, too, right? Kretzmann: Yeah, you're seeing a lot of live events and live updates and things like that. These games are very much a living entity. It's not like you're just buy one physical disc and then that's the only edition you have going forward. It will continue to evolve over time. Lewis: And you see that in the company financials, too. Looking at the most recent quarter for Activision, online sales were up 50% year over year, and they now make up 80% of revenue, which is crazy. And some of that is the transition to digital away from physical with those games. I think some of that is also the acquisition of the King Digital property, and everything they have under their umbrella. One of the things that is interesting with Activision is, particularly relative to these other video game publishers, they actually have a surprising amount of goodwill on their balance sheet. About half their assets are in goodwill. For people who might not remember, goodwill is an intangible asset often tied to the difference between what you can actually tie value to and what you pay for something in an acquisition. Other times it's brought in with brand value and things like that. They bought King Digital for $6 billion a couple years ago, and that is part of that huge goodwill number. And I think a lot of people are wondering how that acquisition looks and what the property is doing for them. Kretzmann: Yeah, to me that's the biggest question mark still with the company. When Activision acquired King back in late 2015, and that acquisition was announced, King had about 475 million monthly active users, almost half a billion, which is more than Twitter and a lot of these other social networks, so that's an incredible number. But that slow and steadily ticked downward each quarter up until now, where now it's at about 350 million monthly active users. But there are some bright spots there. The ratio of daily active users to monthly active users, so, essentially, the hyper-engaged users, is at a record high. And the people who are paying for the games are paying more each quarter. So, it's kind of like you have this small but growing base of really engaged people who are just playing Candy Crush like crazy, and they're paying a lot to upgrade through the game, and different things like that. Those people are paying more. That's how management will spin it. But I think overall, the question there is, how easy is it for them to replicate that success with Candy Crush, or is that all it's about. One thing that was interesting in the conference call this quarter was, they mentioned that Activision and King will be partnering up, and they'll look to build a Call of Duty mobile game. I think that could justify the acquisition to me even more than just bringing Candy Crush under your umbrella. But if they're able to use King's expertise in developing mobile games, and transition Call of Duty into the mobile space, that could be really interesting, and I could see that justifying the premium that they paid. Hopefully that would help them avoid having to write down that goodwill and admit that they paid too much for King. So, some things to like there, but for me, that's probably the biggest question mark with Activision, still to be determined. Lewis: Looking over at one of the other big players in the gaming market, Electronic Arts is something that sports fans probably know very well, are very familiar with. They make some of the most popular sports games out there, including FIFA and Madden. They have tons of other franchises. Like Activision, EA is really enjoying the fruits of that transition to digital. You see it in their margins. Kretzmann: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Their total sales in this most recent quarter was up 17%. Their digital sales up over 30%. And now their digital sales are over 60% of revenue. You're seeing their margins over the past few years, it's so clear, and it's a nice trend to see those margins on the top and bottom line, trending up. And the biggest contributor to the digital sales is what they call "Ultimate Team." This is within their sports franchises, whether it's Madden, NFL, FIFA, NHL, NBA Live. And Ultimate Team is kind of the combination of fantasy sports games like fantasy football or fantasy basketball and collecting trading cards. So, you're essentially building a team, and you get these different packs with players and other things. Over time, you're building a team, you're able to trade players, and it takes into account all sorts of things. If you're building a team, a FIFA Ultimate Team, it takes into account the demographic of the player. So, will a Brazilian soccer player get along with an Italian player? It takes into account all these different chemistry items. Last year, management said there were 2 million trades happening in FIFA Ultimate Team every second. So, the level of engagement of people who step into Ultimate Team is staggering. Lewis: And the idea there, to clarify for listeners, is, I have an Ultimate Team, you have an Ultimate Team, and we have players who are looking to optimize the rosters, or maybe you have a player that I'm a particularly huge fan of and want. Kretzmann: Right, exactly. You can trade and try to upgrade your team over time, and then you can buy the virtual currency, and maybe acquire certain players or certain packs or something. And you're competing against other players. In the sense of fantasy football where you draft your team and you're following those players, you're trying to fine-tune your team and you're competing against other people, this takes fantasy to a live-action level, where you're actually able to physically play the game, you're able to manage your team over time, and that's something that's really resonated with the players of these games. So that now makes up about 30% of their total digital revenue, that Ultimate Team segment. So, I really like how they're focused on that competitive gaming aspect, e-sports, is actually something that comes up a lot. Activision wants to become the ESPN of e-sports, and really focus on that elite level of players who are literally getting paid to play video games, and people will watch people play video games. Electronic Arts is more focused on individual players competing with one another, and I think they've done a really nice job of creating a really compelling, live, constantly updating experience where you're competing with tens of millions of people around the world, whether it's in FIFA or Madden. And so far, that's been a huge driver of their digital success. Lewis: And you look at that, and you're like, well, this is something that they just could not have done before the internet enabled gaming to really take off. Back in the model of 15 years ago, where people were buying discs and they weren't on consoles that were connected, you were playing with your friends in your house. And it was nice because people had to buy the discs, but they didn't have all of these additional purchases that people could be making. The microtransactions, it seems, are becoming a growing and growing segment for a lot of these video game producers. Kretzmann: Yeah. In the case of Ultimate Team, I think it launched in 2009, and initially it was an add-on feature that you needed to pay more for. So, you would buy the disc, and then you could buy access to this feature. But now with something that comes free initially, so anyone can join. But once you're in, you tend to be locked in, and you stick with it. And then I think a good amount of people end up spending money there. So, obviously, with Electronic Arts, that sports area is where they dominate. I also really like what they're doing to expand into the action and shooter genre, which are the biggest genres within the video game space. They have Battlefield 1, which was a huge hit last year, and that's performing better than the sequel to Battlefield 1, which is called Battlefield 4, which is a little confusing, I'm not sure how they came up with the names there. But, essentially, they're seeing higher engagement with Battlefield 1 than they were seeing with its predecessor over a comparable period. So, that's always nice to see. They also have, essentially, a decade licensing agreement with Disney to pump out Star Wars games. Coming up this year you have Battlefront 2, which looks like a very compelling game. The first Battlefront reboot that Electronic Arts did a couple years ago, it got kind of timid reception from fans, but it looks like they've incorporated a lot of the feedback, and people are really excited about that game, so I think that will be a big hit for them. And, obviously, as you have more Star Wars movies coming out over the next few years, I think that puts them in a golden position. That also goes to mobile. There's the Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes mobile game, which is sort of a similar concept to Ultimate Team, where you're able to trade the different characters and collect the characters, kind of a collecting fantasy game. The average user spends 162 minutes a day playing that game, and that number has steadily ticked up over the last year. I mean, that's about two and a half hours a day for the average user on that game. I don't know what that means for productivity in the world.  Lewis: I would love to see that metric for Fools. [laughs]  Kretzmann: I know. We could count it as research, though, so we have that perk. But, just, the level of engagement that they've been able to create just shows that they're producing some incredibly compelling content. By comparison, I think the average power user of Candy Crush is spending more like 35 minutes a day. In the case of this Star Wars mobile game, be careful when you download that, because you might lose a lot of time out of your day. Lewis: Yeah, I don't know if I can afford that kind of time-suck. David, last but only least in the sense of market cap, we're looking at Take-Two Interactive. This is the publisher behind the Grand Theft Auto series, the NBA 2K franchise, so they have some sports exposure there. Take-Two is currently a fraction of the size of these other publishers. I think they're about a quarter to a fifth of the size of EA and Activision Blizzard. So, they're a little bit smaller, the profile is a little bit different there. I know the company recently announced a minor roadblock in the delay of its release of Red Dead Redemption 2 title. Can you talk little bit about what's going on with the company, and whether or not that's something people should worry about? Kretzmann: Yeah. Red Dead Redemption 2 was originally supposed to come out late summer, early fall this year, 2017. They've delayed that release until spring 2018. Initially, that would raise a yellow flag, but taking a step back here. Take-Two Interactive has two major studios. They have 2K, does a lot of the sports franchises like NBA 2K, WWE. Then, they have Rockstar, which is the studio behind Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption. And Rockstar has a history, going back 15 years or so, of delaying virtually every major game that it comes out with, so this is really just par for the course. So, it's nothing to me that's very concerning. They're basically saying, we want to make sure this is the best we can possibly make it. And part of the reason they're delaying it is more and more people are getting the latest generation of consoles. So, you have PlayStation 4, Xbox One, that hardware is a significant upgrade from the previous generation of gaming consoles. So, they're saying, we can make this game even better to adapt to that later hardware. So, for me, I would much rather they delay it six months or even a year, and make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be, rather than putting out a product that they feel is subpar. I think that's part of the reason why Grand Theft Auto has been an incredible franchise. Speaking to the power of this transition to digital, the last Grand Theft Auto was released in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V. But it still makes up 38% of the company's total sales today. That just shows you, more and more people are continuing to buy the game and play the game, and management says, Grand Theft Auto online, that online experience, continues to surprise us and beat our own expectations. With Take-Two Interactive now, about a quarter of their revenue comes from what they call recurrent consumer spending. I feel like they could come up with a better phrase than that. Lewis: I have to ask you what it means. Kretzmann: That's not a surprise. It's made up of the money that players will spend on virtual currency within the games, downloadable add-on content within the games, and microtransactions. Essentially, any money that players are spending in the game once they own that game. That's 25% of the revenue now. Again, that's very high margin, sticky revenue. Lewis: It's all digital, right? Kretzmann: Right, it's all digital. That just shows that, once players do download or buy these games, they're staying very engaged, and they're spending more money over time. In the case of Grand Theft Auto, you have a four-year separation between when the last title came out, but it's still contributing over a third of your total revenue. That's pretty astounding, and I think that's part of the reason that Take-Two is a little bit riskier. They still have a lot of dependence on Grand Theft Auto. But I don't see that drifting down at any point. There have been over 80 million units sold now of Grand Theft Auto V. So, it has an incredibly long shelf life as a franchise. In the meantime, you have Red Dead Redemption, which, the first one got rave reviews, there's a lot of anticipation for Red Dead Redemption 2, and since they're delaying it a few more months to make sure it's really the highest quality it can be, it'll probably be a pretty successful game. NBA 2K continues to have incredible engagement each year when they come out with a new NBA titles. Again, all these companies are excelling at finding ways to make really compelling games that are engaging over a long period of time. I think as you're transitioning to this digital area, that's really the key. All three of these companies are doing a really nice job at that. Lewis: I get the sense in this conversation that, really, there's room for all of these companies to succeed, they all have their separately carved out niches. There's obviously going to be competition, particularly with sports licensing, for games, with Take-Two and EA, as those contracts come due. But, the sense that I get is, there's room for all these players to play. Kretzmann: I think so. This is a global game as well. I don't know the exact breakdown for all the companies. But in the case of Electronic Arts, well over half their revenue comes from outside the U.S. FIFA is really a global phenomenon. Lewis: It's huge abroad. Kretzmann: Huge, yeah. That also means that can make it even more compelling if you're directly competing against literally tens of millions of players around the world. So, it makes it really interesting as a player to have that kind of opportunity to engage with players that way. I forget what your question was. Lewis: It seems like plenty of room to operate for all of them. Kretzmann: Yeah, the global market is huge. And as the economy worldwide improves, and steadily over time, the world economy is becoming more productive, people will have more leisure time. So, really the main competition for any of these kinds of companies are Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, YouTube, wherever you spend your leisure time, that's really the competition there. I recently watched an interview with Reed Hastings, the founder and CEO of Netflix, and he said the biggest long-term threat for Netflix is if, at some point, there is some content that's just so compelling that people get bored sitting down watching just something, dormant. That gives you a sense for how these media companies should be thinking about the long term. But I think people love being entertained, they love the chance to compete and connect with friends and other people around the world. I don't see this slowing down anytime soon. And, in the meantime, you have stuff, which, this is hard for me to wrap my mind around, but e-sports. You actually have people watching other people play video games. And that's something that's that was especially popular in Asia, but now in the U.S. and Europe, you're also seeing that on the rise, and more and more companies looking to sponsor, advertise at e-sports tournaments. So, I certainly see a long-term runway for this space, to continue doing well. Lewis: I know that I was certainly guilty of thinking of e-sports as being more of a niche, novelty phenomenon. And it's clear that it has staying power, and it will be a huge tailwind for a lot of these businesses. It seems like a lot of things are moving in the right direction for these companies. Not surprisingly with the run these stocks have gone on, they're not cheap by any means on a typical P/E basis for valuation. All of them above market multiples right now. I teased that I would have to ask you if you had a favorite among the lot. Is there one that you particularly like, or think is a little bit better positioned right now, maybe a more attractive valuation, something like that? Kretzmann: I'll probably give you a long answer here. The short answer is I like all three, I personally own all three, full disclosure there. Take-Two Interactive is really interesting if you're looking for a little bit higher-risk, high-reward situation. As you mentioned, they're quite a bit smaller than EA or Activation. They don't have quite the breadth of franchises that those two leading companies do. But, what I'm really impressed with is, even though they delayed Red Dead Redemption 2 to essentially the next fiscal year, they're still guiding for record profitability for this coming year, even though they don't have any other major titles slated to be launched this year. I think that's really impressive. And based on the guidance that management gave, they're only trading in about 18 times forward earnings. So, that's one that I'm taking a closer look at, because based on today's numbers, it does look a little bit pricier, but despite that major game delay to next year, they're still looking to do just fine. Activision is really interesting. I would look more and more at Activision as a miniature Disney, the way that they are approaching it. They want to become the ESPN of e-sports, so they have a new e-sports segment that's about a couple years old now. And they actually brought on the former head of the NFL Network and ESPN to head up this new e-sports segment under Activision Blizzard's umbrella. They recently launched a consumer goods segment, so, trying to bring that intellectual property to toys and -- Lewis: Merch. Kretzmann: Yeah, stuff like that. So, really following Disney's footsteps there. They see opportunities for advertising, especially with those 350 million monthly active users on the King Digital mobile games. And they also have a movie and TV studio. So, they're trying to build out a cinematic universe for Call of Duty, which might be in the works over the next couple years. Lewis: They've tried doing that a little bit with Warcraft, right? Kretzmann: A little bit. That Warcraft movie wasn't under their own studio, that was an external studio, so they can't be blamed too much for that. It got kind of poor reviews. But, they do have a kids show, Skylanders Academy, based on their Skylanders game. The first season launched on Netflix last October, the second season is launching this year, and Netflix signed it on for a third year, so that's a promising start. But, with all those different segments, you can see that Activision probably has the biggest vision of all these different companies, just in terms of seeing their IP extending well beyond just the video games themselves. So, if I had to pick one of them, it would probably be Activision. But I like the position that all of these are in. Take-Two, higher risk, high reward, I would probably make that a smaller position. EA, I love what they're doing with Ultimate Team, that competitive gaming aspect, especially with the sports games. I think having the access to that Star Wars IP and being able to pump out those games, I don't see how that doesn't do really well over the next few years as more Star Wars movies come out. And Activision has a whole breadth of different opportunities for them, and how they extend that IP beyond video games. So, I like all of them, but I think if you forced yourself to pick one, Activision would probably be the one. They pay a small dividend since 2010. They're just the bigger idea of the three. And why not just go with all three? Lewis: Get a basket of video game stocks? Kretzmann: Why not? Lewis: David, anything else on video games or the industry before I let you go? Kretzmann: No, I think that does it. I think this is a really attractive space. I personally don't play a whole lot of video games and I certainly don't watch other people playing video games, so I can understand, especially if you're not a younger investor, this might be a little bit more of a foreign industry to you. But, this is something to watch. I think these companies, these game franchises are going where customers are headed. People want engaging, compelling content, and these companies are delivering that. So, it's well worth the look as an investor. Lewis: That's a nice thing to end on there. Listeners, that does it for this episode of Industry Focus. A little housekeeping note before we wrap up: I hope everyone has a good, long weekend.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: These 6 Retailers Are Actually Thriving While the so-called retail apocalypse has hurt or even killed many chains, these retailers are doing well. Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Jun 13, 2017 at 6:00AM Some stores are open and thriving despite the retail market's general struggles. Image source: Pixabay.  The retail world has been reeling. Chains including Sears, J. Crew, and Claire's remain locked in a fight for survival, while others such as J.C. Penney and Macy's are struggling mightily. Some retailers including H.H. Gregg, Wet Seal, and Gander Mountain have disappeared, gone bankrupt, or brought in outside investors to save some of their locations. Most blame these failures on the rise of the internet. That's certainly a reason many retailers have failed, but not every chain has moved in the wrong direction. Some have proven immune to internet competition, while others have adjusted and found a way to compete. Costco has been steady in the face of digital competition. Image source: Costco. Costco While Costco (NASDAQ:COST) never puts up explosive growth, the chain moves ever-steadily forward. The warehouse club has been consistently growing its member base (which is where it makes most of its money) and has been increasing its number of locations by around 25 stores each year. In its most-recent quarter the company saw 6% comparable-store sales growth in the United States and 5% worldwide. Through three quarters of its fiscal 2017 the chain has posted 3% same-store growth in the U.S. and globally. Costco has simply not been phased by the growth of the internet. It has so far operated pretty much as it always has, delivering steady growth, strong earnings, and reliable predictability. Going forward, that's unlikely to change, and the chain may even be able to add some growth as it steps up its online efforts. Dollar General has been adding about 1,000 stores a year. Image source: Dollar General. Dollar General In the retail apocalypse, discounters have generally done well, and Dollar General (NYSE:DG) has led the way. It's not that the chain has impressive same-store sales growth. That metric climbed by only 1% in its most-recent quarter, and the chain predicts flat to 1% growth this year. But the company has discovered an appetite for its offerings and created a steady model that has tremendous room for growth. Dollar General added 900 stores in 2016 and plans to open 1,000 or more this year. That should keep the chain growing after a year in which it posted revenues that grew to $22 billion from $20.4 billion the previous year. Wal-Mart has managed to overcome some recent struggles. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart While Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has had its struggles in dealing with online competition, the company has recently found its way. The chain put up stellar Q1 numbers, including raising overall revenue 1.4% to $117.5 billion and increasing U.S. same-store sales by 1.4% on a 1.5% increase in traffic. In addition e-commerce sales grew by a stunning 63% over the same quarter last year. Much of the chain's digital success can be attributed to its putting Jet.com CEO Marc Lore in charge of its full online operation. Lore fostered a start-up mentality and has helped the chain move from being a physical store first to one that meets customers however they are looking to be served. Nordstrom has thrived in past by growing its online business. Image source: Nordstrom. Nordstrom Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) has proven to have a very loyal customer base that has helped the company thrive even in the current challenging retail market. In Q1 the company raised its EPS from $0.26 last year to $0.37 in 2017 while net sales grew by 2.7%. Comparable-store sales did fall by 0.8%, but the company now does an impressive amount of its business -- about 25% -- through its website. In addition, total customer counts rose during the quarter. Best Buy has been an unlikely turnaround story. Image source: Best Buy. Best Buy Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) may be the most surprising company to see on this list. At one point the chain was basically left for dead. It had fallen victim to being used as a showroom where customers would look at merchandise and then order it online from someone else. CEO Hubert Joly has brought the company all the way back however by refocusing its stores and aggressively cutting expenses. He also recently declared that the company was no longer in its "Renew Blue" turnaround stage. "We are energized about our opportunities and the strategy we are pursuing," Joly said in the chain's Q1 2018 earnings release. "We believe we are uniquely positioned to help our customers in a meaningful way with our combination of multi-channel assets -- including our online, store and in- home capabilities, and I love how our teams are mobilized to deliver on our mission and Build the New Blue." Discount stores have generally done well in this retail environment. Image source: Getty Images. T.J, Maxx and Marshalls The TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) have two things that consumers seem to be willing to venture out to stores for: low prices and a bit of shopping as a destination. These chains -- Marshalls, T.J. Maxx, and HomeGoods -- are all discounters with revolving merchandise. You never know what you will find at what price, which makes it easier for consumers to justify leaving the house. That's a formula that saw the chain grow sales 3% in Q1 2018, which followed a fiscal 2017 where they climbed by 10%. In addition the chain saw Q1 EPS climb from $0.76 last year to $0.82 this year giving the company a 10%-12% increase in EPS for the the full year. In addition the chain expects 1%-2% same-store sales growth in fiscal 2018, while it also plans to add to the 50 new locations it opened in Q1. Daniel Kline has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Still reeling from recent bloody terrorist attacks in societies in which most people were previously shielded from retaliation for the horrendous violence they performed on foreigners, the world faces an even greater threat from an empire falling from global domination while its minority controllers manipulate their people into accepting behaviors which would call for clinical isolation or solitary prison confinement if practiced by an individual. The continued forcing of more citizens into an alleged asylum of near dementia endangers far more than what some of us call “our” democracy. This manic state in which a minority believe themselves controllers of their nation’s material life has existed since America’s electoral origins, but we have always been under the domination of the wealthiest minority in the country and the national democracy thought to be “ours” by so many has never included a majority of our people. Even the most rudimentary understanding of arithmetic  – let alone history – reveals this fact without necessity for a degree in mathematics. In fact, any schmuck with a calculator can do the math. There has never been a presidential election in the history of the USA in which a majority of the electorate chose the winning representative of minority capital. And most recently, while millions held their noses to cover the stench of voting for the despicable or the deplorable lesser evil offerings, far more voted for neither. 231 million Americans are deemed part of the electorate, which means being 18 and older and with enough mental capacity to select burgers, pizza, guns, tacos, pet food or political candidates at the market. If we can afford them. Of that number, more than 165 million chose neither the republicrat nor the demublican. That’s far more than double those exercising the alleged power of the majority and voting, as usual, in the minority. Our alleged political democracy is even less so than our economy, which is really a dictatorship of a tiny minority. In fact, it’s even worse since all of us are forced into the economy and cannot choose to opt out, like voters, while its control falls to an even smaller cabal than the one running the political system. They are part of the same anti-democratic minority that dominates politics, but there is a bit more room for small entrepreneurs to get a foot in the door of economics than is possible in politics. There are very few gourmet-taco-street vendor political parties and those radical minorities choosing to contest for the presidency and national offices are given as much chance by the system as a mom and pop store has going up against Amazon or Wal-Mart. The breakdown of the political economic system has been in process for hundreds of years, decades, or the past few months, depending on the consciousness and vocabulary of the critic, and has become so much more serious that minority ownership, and thus a major part of the manipulated-by-media public, is reduced to wondering which boogie man – Putin? Trump? Napoleon? – is to be blamed for the state of collapse. Thus the frenzy to impeach the rich, arrogant clod who got to the white house despite established power’s desire not to have him there. They first got rid of the potentially democratic menace of Bernie Sanders but were not equal to the task of dumping an even greater threat from one of their own whose arrogant and ignorant honesty strips the cosmetic façade from the ugliness of so much reality. The social disease revealed is too much for those who must label him a pathological liar because they cannot, refuse to, or are incapable of facing reality. This egotistical fool may well be the most honest resident we’ve ever had at the public housing we call the white house and that honesty is partly why established power views him as danger because he neither minces capital’s words nor even tries to cover up its horror with the usual political double talk that calls bloody murder peace and blatant dishonesty the truth. Trump’s victory is making a mockery of the fiction of American leadership in morality, which serves as euphemistic foundation for the empire’s bloody horrors of mass murder and national destruction performed while calling itself global director of ethical culture and insisting the rest of the world follow its immoral lead. And getting even the previously thoughtful among its home population buying into the most inane explanations for why their world – the one called “our” democracy – is in a state of near collapse. It supposedly has everything to do with foreign intervention in “our” multi billion-dollar democratic process. You know, the one that reduces half a million citizens to living in the street while we moan about Trump’s sexism, or reduces 20% of our children to lives of poverty while we visit therapists to discuss our depression over Trump’s xenophobia, or stresses out a population that can afford to go into debt for luxury goods while most americans are in debt in order to survive. You know, that massive dysfunctional family that worships weapons, cosmetics and pets while nearly half its population is low income or poor? The one that’s saving refugees escaping wars we organize, finance, start, and perpetuate? It’s as though the people on the Titanic were at each other’s throats to get a new captain for the sinking ship. Maybe an African American transsexual Jew could keep it afloat? If a savior captain isn’t available, maybe some toilets shared by the crew and the paying guests will do the trick? One thing’s for sure: once we get rid of the Russians, the Koreans, the Iranians, the Palestinians, the Chinese, and much of South America and especially this captain, the boat will rise to the heavens and everything will be just fine. America has become an even dumber reality show than the one that helped put this president in charge of the circus. Further comic relief from TV and cartoonist clowns won’t help. We need a transformation of our political economy that starts from the roots of the problem. They have to do with our origins, our history and our behavior, not those of particular CEOs of capital’s national corporation, and very little if anything to do with any foreign nation. If we’re even mildly serious about a threat being marketed as Climate Change, we’d better stop listening to the people responsible for it who offer toothless reforms like the Paris Accords, and work for the radical and revolutionary political and economic change we need to solve not only that long range problem, but far more short term ones that threaten us right now.

Tuesday Jun 13, 2017 at 12:01 AM Jessica Weston City Editor Jessica_Weston9 Should council prioritize finishing the Downs Street project, repaving the Senior Center parking lot or rehabbing Pinney Pool? That was the question debated at the Ridgecrest City Council meeting June 7. The topic was tax allocation bond (TAB) funds. Economic Development Manager Gary Parsons gave a run-down on what happened to $24.9 million in TAB funds and how much remained. Also discussed was what to do with the remaining funds. That was when the debate began. Up for grabs potentially is up to $1,137,075 of the original TAB allocation of $24.9 million. This represents $911,027 left over from the Walmart project, $53,115 from the streets budget and $172,933 left in the economic development projects budget, according to Parsons. Another  $3,243,722 remains to be spent on parks. A spirited discussion over city priorities ensued and lasted nearly an hour and a half. “I strongly disagree with anymore going to roadways,” Councilwoman Lindsey Stephens said. She added that “streets already has a funding mechanism [Measure V], but quality of life currently has no funding mechanism. It doesn't make sense to me when roadways have already received the lion's share of the money and they have a funding mechanism in place for us to continue to give more to roadways when we know that this other department is in dire need.” Stephens spearheaded the recent Freedom Park Splash Pad project approval and seemed to be strongly supporting rehabilitating Pinney Pool. Mayor Peggy Breeden and Mayor Pro Temp Michael Mower spoke up in favor of the other projects. Both argued that fixing Downs Street is very much a quality of life issue for the community. Mower said Downs Street is his pet project and he wants to see it completed before he leaves office. Breeden, meanwhile, repeatedly said that the current configuration presents a significant safety issue. “I agree that Downs is probably the most important safety issue we have,” she said. She suggested finding other possible funding sources for the pool and the senior center. “If one of those children get hit walking across the street [to and from the Charter School] and we've known the potential was there and did nothing about it," Breeden said. "It seems to me that we are setting ourselves up for a horrible lawsuit.” She brought the topic up again later. After noting that she was not trying to be negative, Breeden said, “If one child gets hit or killed trying to go across Downs, we will have a hard time explaining why we thought [something else] was more important than that.” City Engineer Loren Culp appeared to agree. “[In terms of] public safety, the greatest liability you have in the city are your streets, your roadways, and you do have a very substandard section. I think you have a known liability and a need and a requirement as a city to address those issues.” Mower also spoke up in forcefully in favor of finishing Downs Street as the highest priority. “I think that if we put it out to a vote of the people, the people would vote for Downs Street,” he said. Mower said he also supported repaving the Senior Center parking lot. “I might be riding that bus to the Senior Center one of these days,” he said with a laugh. Mower ultimately proposed using the economic development money ($172,933) on the senior center parking lot and moving the rest of the special projects money ($911,027) to the streets account. “If I would have known we were going to be talking about doing the [Pinney] pool, I would have voted against the splash pad last time,” he said early on. Complicating the issue is the fact that Community Development Block Grant funds already exist for the senior parking lot, but will not be available for some time. It was unclear whether the funds could be used for another project if the city used TAB funds to fix the parking lot. Stan Rajtora also spoke up in support of prioritizing repaving the senior center parking lot. “My wife [Carol Vaughn] reminded me tonight — believe it or not, she doesn't talk much about the city council — if one senior citizen is walking from the road to the senior center, trips, falls and breaks a leg the liability associated with that could actually be worth more than the cost of re-doing the whole parking lot," Rajtora said. "It could save some senior citizen — it might be one of us — a lot of harm.” Others spoke out in favor of looking into spending funds on rehabilitating Pinney Pool and bringing it back up to compliance with the ADA. No cost estimate was available at council time, but Parks and Recreation Department Recreation Manager Jason Patin said fixing Pinney Pool was at the top of his priority list if he had the funds to spend. Resident Mike Neel spoke up in favor of spending any extra funds on roads. “The business of government is not all this quality of life feel good stuff. It is suppressing the evil-doer and taking care of your infrastructure . . . anything you spend on that falling-apart pool is throwing money away. It needs to be filled with dirt and done with and buried. It's had its life.” “I think we all agree the senior center parking lot is a high priority,” Stephens said. Other questions about the Downs Street project were whether it could be done in time to meet time requirements for TAB fund expenditures and capital vs. soft cost expenditures. Another issue with the project is the long-standing dispute with Southern California Edison over who should pay to have their poles moved. Culp and City Manager Dennis Speer said the current strategy is for the city to pay initially while continuing efforts to get payment eventually from SCE. The agenda item was a report/discussion item only, so no action was taken on it. Stephens suggested doing more research and bringing the item back before council. “I would like to know for sure on the Downs Street [project] if we can get that money spent in the [required] amount of time,” she said. “I think we just need to see more information.” Ultimately, council decided to investigate the total cost to rehabilitate Pinney Pool, as well look into as a realistic timeline on the Downs Street project and confirm it would not require soft cost expenditures before the next discussion. The Daily Independent will report more on this story as it unfolds.

Aldi, known for low prices on its private-label items, plans to spend $3.4 billion over the next five years to open 900 supermarkets, the company's Illinois-based U.S. division said Monday. The investment comes as its European discount rival, Lidl, prepares to open its first U.S. stores this week, with plans for as many as 100 by the summer of 2018. The U.S. expansion by the German private-label giants could put more pressure on conventional retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co. to lower their prices. The new competition in the low-margin industry arrives during a deflationary spiral that has seen food prices drop for 17 straight months, the longest such streak in more than 60 years. "There's a tremendous amount of value at stake that will shift to Lidl and Aldi," said Kent Knudson, a Bain & Co. partner. "Traditional grocers can't afford to lose sales right now given how competitive it is -- it will be very disruptive." Bain predicts that sales in the "deep discount segment" of the grocery business, which includes Aldi and Lidl, will grow as much as 10 percent annually through 2020, five times higher than for traditional stores. -- Bloomberg News Accounting woes shake up Fuji Xerox TOKYO -- Fuji Xerox, the Japan-based joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm Holdings, said Monday that its chairman and three other executives were stepping down over accounting problems discovered at its operations in Australia and New Zealand. Kenji Sukeno, president and chief operating officer of Fujifilm Holdings, which owns 75 percent of Fuji Xerox, bowed and apologized at a news conference along with other Fujifilm executives. "We will strengthen corporate governance at Fuji Xerox," Sukeno said. Fujifilm had been investigating the way Fuji Xerox sales managers in New Zealand and Australia reported income from photocopier leases. A committee of lawyers and accounting specialists hired by the company concluded that the managers had overstated revenue by about $340 million in the five years through 2016, Fujifilm said Monday. How much a customer pays Fuji Xerox for a leased photocopier depends in part on how heavily the customer uses the machine. When the billings fell short of projections, managers in New Zealand and Australia reported inflated numbers in order to meet revenue targets, the committee of investigators found. A whistleblower inside Fuji Xerox, whose name has not been released, initially identified problems at the New Zealand unit in 2015. Fujifilm first disclosed the investigation in April, saying it was investigating what it believed then to be a $200 million accounting discrepancy. -- The New York Times Car-loan bonds from '15 showing losses NEW YORK -- Bonds issued in 2015 of bundled subprime auto loans are by one key measure on track to become the worst performing in the history of car-loan securitizations, according to Fitch Ratings. This group of securities is experiencing cumulative net losses at a rate projected to reach 15 percent, which is higher even than for bonds in 2007, Fitch analysts Hylton Heard and John Bella Jr. wrote in a report Thursday. "The 2015 vintage has been prone to high loss severity from a weaker wholesale market and little-to-no equity in loan contracts at default due to extended-term lending, a trend which was not as apparent in the recessionary vintages," said the analysts, referring to lenders' stretching out repayment terms on subprime loans, sometimes to over six years, to lower borrowers' monthly payment. That becomes riskier in the tail end of the loan, after the car has mostly depreciated and borrowers may be left owing large balances. Credit-rating companies that assess the auto debt packaged into bonds have raised concerns in recent months about rising delinquencies and defaults. -- Bloomberg News Pipeline under Great Lakes passes test MACKINAW CITY, Mich. -- Enbridge says an oil pipeline beneath the Straits of Mackinac in northern Michigan has passed pressure tests required in a Justice Department agreement following a 2010 oil spill in southwestern Michigan. The tests took place Saturday on one pipeline that's part of Line 5. The Canadian company pumped the line's west segment with water and kept pressure high for 8 hours. Enbridge officials told reporters in a conference call Monday that the line is fit for service and no leaks were found. A second pipeline, called the east segment, will be tested soon. The pipelines where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan converge were built in 1953. Line 5 carries about 23 million gallons of crude oil and liquid natural gas daily between Superior, Wis., and Sarnia, Ontario. -- The Associated Press Viking fund investors will get $8B back GREENWICH, Conn. -- Viking Global Investors, the hedge fund firm founded by Andreas Halvorsen, is returning about $8 billion to investors as Chief Investment Officer Daniel Sundheim departs to pursue his own business interests. Sundheim, 40, who joined Viking as an analyst and rose through the ranks in his 15 years there, is leaving at the end of the month, according to a letter Viking sent to investors on Monday. Ben Jacobs and Ning Jin, two longtime portfolio managers, will take over the central portfolio as co-CIOs, the firm said. Viking manages about $30 billion, making it one of the largest hedge funds in the world. The firm plans to return some of that money in August to allow its traders to hold smaller, more liquid positions, according to the letter. Viking said it has already sold off the necessary portion of its holdings. "We are determined to set the firm up for continued strong performance and long-term success and have decided to reset to a smaller size," Halvorsen said in the letter, adding that Viking "looks forward to opportunities for collaboration" with Sundheim. Sundheim is leaving because the firm couldn't find a role for him that would give him the flexible investment mandate he was looking for, according to the letter. He's been helping with the transition for months, Viking said. -- Bloomberg News Business on 06/13/2017 Print Headline: Business news in brief Tweet ADVERTISEMENT More Business Bubble concerns arise as passive investing's ...

Miss Black Texas 2016 Carmen Ponder claimed she was harassed in May by a North Texas police chief who called her a 'black b****,' before being unlawfully detained and arrested. Ponder, 23, sued the police force and said she wanted police accountability and formal charges to be filed against Commerce Police Chief Kerry Crews. The Fort Worth law firm Lynn, Ross and Gannaway has now said it found no evidence that Crews made any racial statements to Ponder or to anyone else. Miss Black Texas 2016 Cameron Ponder says she was unlawfully detained and arrested in May  She said police chief Kerry Crews called her a 'black b****' after she allegedly drove around him while he was teaching his daughter, 14, how to drive  But Ponder's attorney denounced the conclusion on social media, saying she should not have been arrested in the first place. 'Chief Crews directed the unlawful arrest of [Ponder] under unjustifiable circumstances,' Ponder's lawyer, Lee Merritt, wrote in a tweet. '#MissBlackTexas being called a 'Black [expletive]' by some racist was bad. Being arrested by Crews for not apologizing was UNCONSTITUTIONAL!' Now, an investigation has found that there is no evidence Crews made any racial statements towards her  In a statement, the city of Commerce said: 'While there may be additional items for consideration and possible recommended action, race-based claims will not be a factor.' In her account, Ponder said she was driving to Walmart on May 20 when a black pickup truck cut in front of her and began driving erratically.  She said the car was braking and accelerating dangerously, and she worried it was a drunk driver.  Ponder wrote that she put her blinker on, pulled around to pass the truck and drove into the superstore parking lot.  According to Ponder, the black truck followed her into the lot and pulled up next to where she'd parked her car.  She said the passenger, who she later identified as Crews, got out of the truck and started yelling and screaming that he was teaching his 14-year-old daughter how to drive, saying Ponder shouldn't have passed his truck. Ponder wrote that she ignored the man at first, but eventually turned to tell him 'it's illegal' about a 14-year-old driving, before walking into the store. 'That's when he screamed "oh whatever, you black b****."'  Ponder wrote about the interaction on Twitter, and explained how it started when she was driving to Wal-Mart on Saturday and black pickup truck cut in front of her and began driving erratically She said when she walked out she saw Crews there and was quickly charged by several other officers in street clothes.  'One guy showed me his police badge and started screaming at me. He told me this guy was his chief and I better apologize to him now. I told him I was going to do that and was walking to my car,' she explained.  Next, one of the men grabbed her by the arm and pulled her roughly back into WalMart, telling her she was being detained. When police came, she said: 'I began walking to the policeman when the aggressive guy pulled me by my arm again, told the cop that I was resisting arrest and demanded he arrest me.'  Ponder was then handcuffed and booked into jail, where she spent 24 hours. She was charged with evading arrest RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Tiger Woods had potentially deadly mix of Vicodin and Xanax... Boy, six, dies in hospital after crashing a motorcycle he... Share this article Share Her lawyer told NBC New York that she had bruises from where she was grabbed.  Ponder was then handcuffed and booked into jail, where she spent 24 hours. She was charged with evading arrest.  Authorities told NBC that Crews was placed on administrative leave. Ponder is calling attention to the incident to hold the officer accountable, and has started a crowdfunding page to raise money for her attorney's fees.  She wrote on a youcaring.com page that she will not take a plea deal and is 'more than willing' to take the case to trial. 'My only crime...the color of my skin,' she wrote.  Ponder's You Caring page also says she is a Dean's List student at Texas A&M University- Commerce and an intern with the Hunt County District Attorney.   Read more: Miss Black Texas: I Was Arrested Over 'Color of My Skin' | NBC New York Help me fight for my rights against injustice-Carmen Ponder | Emergencies & Disasters - YouCaring Share or comment on this article e-mail 51 shares Most watched News videos Hero congressman injured shielding boy gives tearful press conference Rappers shot at by police during 'carjacking' in music video Adorable moment duck and chicken fight with corgi Rescue dog thinks life is just paw-some in new home Suspect arrested for murders of mother and her daughters in Ohio Incredible police bodycam captures explosion inches from fireman Baseball gunman says he's tired of being 'pushed around' Woman plunges to her death due to faulty elevator shaft Bill Cosby arrives for court as his fate rests with the jury UPS employee fatally shoots two and injures several others Trump visits wounded congressman at Washington hospital Passenger crashes through window during knife attack on KC bus Boy, 14, accidentally kills his twin brother by shooting...

(Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Three Albuquerque Police Department officers on Monday received the Bill Daniels True Blue Award for individual acts of compassion that went above and beyond the scope of their normal duties. Receiving the award during a ceremony at the Albuquerque Police Training Academy on North Second Street were Thomas Nadas, Paul Haugh and Ladio Canales. Detective Thomas Nadas Detective Nadas has been with APD for four years. He was providing security at a South Valley homeless shelter as part of a chief’s overtime arrangement when the shelter’s electricity went out, leaving 20 hungry people missing out on a meal. Nadas went to a nearby McDonald’s restaurant and bought food for the entire group. Haugh, with APD for 10 years, was on patrol in Southeast Albuquerque when he came upon two young boys who were upset because their locked bicycles had been stolen from outside an area Walmart. Haugh, who was familiar with the two children, said he knew it would be a long summer without their bicycles. He had the boys accompany him inside the store, where he let them pick out two new bikes, which he paid for with his own money. APD Officer Ladio Canales Canales, a 12-year APD veteran, was working graveyard shift when he encountered a woman panhandling near Coors and Quail NW. The single mother of two young children said she was hungry and trying to feed her family. Canales had the woman and her family meet him at a local restaurant, where he bought them a meal and sat with them long enough to learn their circumstances and what the woman needed to get back on her feet. He subsequently bought and delivered groceries and other necessities to the family and guided the woman about where to go to apply for social services, including Medicaid. The True Blue Award is sponsored by the Daniels Fund, which was founded 17 years ago and has since provided $800 million in educational scholarships and grants to nonprofits in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. The first True Blue Awards were presented last year in Denver. The Albuquerque officers received a plaque and a $100 gift certificate good at a number of area restaurants.

Aldi, Lidl enter US grocery wars | Bangkok Post: business News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More BUSINESS Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive E-PAPER SIGN IN About E-Paper Subscribe Free Trial Report problem Contact us Business homepage Business news Telecom Finance Tourism & transport Find company & suppliers Exchange rates More World Gold prices IT Auto Property Business > World Aldi, Lidl enter US grocery wars 13 Jun 2017 at 10:00 3,696 viewed0 comments NEWSPAPER SECTION: BUSINESS | WRITER: BLOOMBERG NEWS The interior of an Aldi grocery store is pictured in Wheaton, Illinois. REUTERS - + New York: A decades-long supermarket battle in Europe is moving to the United States, adding to the competitive pressure in an industry embroiled in a deflation-fueled price war. Aldi, known for low prices on its private-label items, "plans to spend $3.4 billion over the next five years to open 900 supermarkets,'' the company said on Sunday. The investment comes as its European discount rival, Lidl, prepares to open its first US stores this week, with plans for as many as 100 by the summer of 2018. The US expansion by the German private-label giants could put more pressure on conventional retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Kroger Co to lower their prices. The new competition in the low-margin industry arrives during a deflationary spiral that has seen food prices drop for 17 straight months, the longest such streak in more than 60 years. "There's a tremendous amount of value at stake that will shift to Lidl and Aldi," said Ken Knudson, a Bain & Co partner. "Traditional grocers can't afford to lose sales right now given how competitive it is -- it will be very disruptive." Bain predicts that sales in the so-called "deep discount segment" of the grocery business, which includes Aldi and Lidl, will grow as much as 10% annually through 2020, five times higher than for traditional stores. The checkout area of a Lidl supermarket, which will open on Thursday, is pictured in Culpeper, Virginia on June 6. EPA The battle between the two closely held grocers will intensify on Thursday, when Lidl opens nine stores in three states. Analysts have estimated that it could roll out as many as 600 US locations over the next five years. Aldi says it will have 2,500 stores nationwide by 2022, which would make it the third-largest supermarket chain in the US, according to the company. Only Kroger and Albertsons Cos, which also owns Safeway, would have more. Aldi has added more produce and boosted its organic and gluten-free offerings in recent years as it tries to appeal to more mainstream shoppers. The company has also started offering fresh fish, improved its meat selection and increased its selection of national brands, part of a bid to shed its image as strictly a low-brow discounter. Earlier this year, it announced plans to spend $1.6 billion remodeling 1,300 of its US stores. Aldi was founded more than a century ago when Anna Albrecht opened a small store in Essen, Germany. Her sons, Karl and Theo, took over in 1948 and quickly expanded. In 1962, the name became Aldi, shortened from Albrecht Discount. That same year, the brothers split the chain into two companies -- Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord -- following a dispute about whether to sell cigarettes. Aldi Süd oversees the US operations, while Aldi Nord runs the popular private-label grocer Trader Joe's. The arrival of Lidl this week won't change how Aldi does business in the US, according to Liz Ruggles, a spokeswoman. "We're doing what we've been doing to ensure we're the low-cost leader," she said.

Man freed from prison after finding new suspect – who looks just like him by: Crystal Bonvillian, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Updated: Jun 12, 2017 - 5:41 PM KANSAS CITY, Mo. - A Missouri man who served 17 years for an attempted purse snatching that he consistently denied committing has been released after he and his lawyers found an alternate suspect in a prisoner who looks just like him.  Richard Anthony Jones, of Kansas City, served almost 17 years of his prison sentence before his conviction was overturned on Wednesday. The Kansas City Star reported that Jones had been sentenced to serve just under 20 years in prison for the 1999 crime, which occurred outside a Walmart in Roeland Park, Kansas. “Everybody has a doppelganger,” one of Jones’ attorneys, Alice Craig, told the Star. “Luckily, we found his.” Jones was convicted based on eyewitness testimony, despite having an alibi that placed him across the state line in Missouri at the time of the crime. Eyewitness misidentification is the leading cause of wrongful convictions, according to the Midwest Innocence Project, which worked with Craig and the Paul E. Wilson Project for Innocence at the University of Kansas’ School of Law to obtain Jones’ release.  Craig said that the witnesses were given one photo lineup in which Jones was the only light-skinned person pictured.  In a second lineup, four of the six suspects had blue eyes, which also did not align with witness descriptions of the man they saw commit the crime. The lineups were done three months after the fact, KCUR in Kansas City reported. Jones was arrested five months after the crime. Despite there being no physical evidence linking him to the crime, he was convicted and sent to prison.  “If you believe it just happens to certain people, people with criminal histories and things of that nature, it doesn’t,” Jones told KCUR after his release. “It can happen to anybody. And it took me to go to prison to see that.” >> Read more trending stories Jones heard multiple times from fellow inmates over the years about another prisoner who not only could pass for his twin, but who also had the same first name. The Star reported that, though he never ran into the other inmate while behind bars, Jones passed the information off to his lawyers.  Craig told the Star that their investigation found evidence that the other potential suspect lived near the scene of the crime in 1999. Jones lived across the state line in Kansas City.   The attorney said she and her colleagues were stunned when they saw a photo of the other man. The man, who like Jones is a light-skinned man of color, has the same hairstyle, mustache and goatee, and a similar facial structure.  “We were floored by how much they looked alike,” Craig told the Star.  When Craig and Innocence Project attorneys showed photos of Jones and the other man to the victim, witnesses and even the prosecutor in the case, they all said they could not tell the men apart.  “This court has no doubt, although that isn’t the standard, that a jury would not be able to reach a determination that this defendant was guilty,” Johnson County (Kansas) District Judge Kevin Moriarty said during the hearing in Jones’ case, KCUR reported. “This court does not believe any reasonable jury could have made such a decision in this case. The alternate suspect, whose full name has not been released, testified Wednesday at Jones’ hearing. He denied being the man who committed the crime in 1999, the Star reported.  Jones told KCUR that he did not believe that he would be set free until the judge spoke the words. He said hearing it was “a beautiful thing.” The newly exonerated man now has to get reacquainted with his family, including his children.  “When I got locked up, my kids were kids and now they’re grown,” Jones told the radio station. “That gives you an idea of what type of time people are doing and the type of time a person can do for a crime they didn’t commit.” A GoFundMe page set up to help Jones now that he is free raised more than $12,000 in two days.  Richard Anthony Jones Kansas Department of Corrections via AP © 2017 Cox Media Group.

(Hubei Integrity Auction Company) Share Written by Echo Huang Obsession China's Transition June 12, 2017 The anti-corruption campaign initiated by China’s president Xi Jinping in late 2012 has generated arrests, trials, at least one novel, and a slew of television dramas, as well as prompted civil servants to turn in the expensive gifts showered upon them to curry favor. A major recent auction of the spoils—possibly one of the last big ones due to the crackdown on gifting—showed the strange range of these presents: Rolex watches, naturally, but also underwear, pajamas and discount-store gift cards. At the auction in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, some 280 bidders purchased goods amounting to 994,000 yuan ($146,000), local newspaper Chutian Metropolis Daily reported (link in Chinese) on Saturday (June 10). One man, who declined to be interviewed by Chutian, bought a Rolex watch for 40,000 yuan ($5,884) and a Cartier watch for 32,000 yuan ($4,707). A Walmart gift card with a store value of 1,380 yuan ($203) was sold along with two other store gift cards at 2,300 yuan ($338).   A Rolex watch displayed on the website of the Hubei Integrity Auction Company. (Hubei Integrity Auction Company) The Hubei Integrity Auction Company, the local firm that conducted the auction, gathered over 500 items for the sale, according to the company’s website (link in Chinese). The company’s CEO told Quartz that the company didn’t guarantee the authenticity of the products—and buyers have to bid in person. “All the customers must be on the scene to bid and many did seem to be professional buyers who came with examining tools,” said Xia on the phone, only giving her last name. “Some of the products have been in storage for more than 10 years.” People online wondered who might have the money to bid on the items being auctioned. “Would common people dare to buy these commodities?” asked a user of social media platform Weibo. Others felt turning in and selling the items didn’t go far enough in fighting corruption. “Can we find out who gave the items in the first place? Or would the officials be cleared after handing these in?”asked one (link in Chinese) on China’s social media platform Weibo. Auctions like this one have taken place periodically in the last decade, but more so in recent years. Earlier, Hubei Integrity participated in two auctions that netted more than half a million dollars for the state treasury. In November, the company participated in an auction event in Wuhan with the local anti-corruption department of the Communist Party and the city’s finance bureau. That auction sold a total of 222 items, including 690 gift cards worth 880,000 yuan ($129,466), state publication People’s Daily reported. Another one took place in March. But the auction company CEO says that gifting is down, and that therefore major auctions are coming to an end. “A big-scale auction like the June one is unlikely to happen again,” says Xia, “I believe that as our Party continues tightening discipline, there will be fewer bribes.” Visen Liu contributed reporting Most Popular Open-minded people have a different visual perception of reality Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
