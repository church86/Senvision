Sections Deseret NewsUtah Utah Skimming schemes keeping law enforcers busy By Pat ReavyDeseret News@DNewsCrimeTeam Published: April 5, 2017 8:25 p.m. Updated: 1 hour ago 1 Comment View 1 Item Ravell Call, Deseret News FILE - Lt. Von Steenblik of the Centerville Police Department talks with the media south of Kemmerer, Wyoming, Wednesday, May 18, 2016. Steenblik said there are groups that travel around the country to either steal credit card information or use the information they've already illegally obtained. CENTERVILLE — A Wal-Mart gift card. A gift card from a Mexican restaurant. A hotel room key card. What Centerville police say these items recently seized from a hotel room have in common is that rather than being able to buy only food or get into a room, the magnetic strips on all of the cards were re-encoded with someone else's credit or debit card number and could be used just like a regular credit card. It's just the latest example of what law enforcers statewide say is a continuously growing problem: skimming. "Especially this last year. We’re seeing people come from out of state and doing this," said Centerville Police Lt. Von Steenblik. During an investigation in March, two men were observed by store security at Wal-Mart in Centerville, 221 W. Parrish Lane, making "suspicious credit card transactions," according to a search warrant unsealed in 2nd District Court. "(Loss Prevention) advised that the males purchased gift cards with multiple credit cards, which she believes were cloned. The LP have been involved with several investigations involving traveling groups using cloned credit cards and from her experience believed that is what the two suspects  were doing. LP had also been alerted by at least two other Wal-Mart stores about these same two individuals doing the same thing at their stores," the warrant states. Police were called and searched both the men and their hotel room. Investigators found more than 40 gift cards, a machine that re-encodes magnetic strips and an Xbox that detectives believe was being used like a computer to access the internet, according to the warrant. Sixteen of those cards "were found to have been re-encoded with a different financial transaction card account number." Because this type of crime has become more frequent, Steenblik said Centerville police had been working with Wal-Mart security closely, teaching them how to identify potential card skimmers and then document their transactions using store security cameras. "How many people go in and buy 25 gift cards at a time? You just don’t. That’s the give-away,” he said. "And they just keep buying them until they get declined and then they move on to the next credit card number." Steenblik said there are groups that travel around the country to either steal credit card information or use the information they've already illegally obtained. "A lot of them that we were seeing that have come through over the last six to nine months through Centerville are Cubans, and they’re coming out of the Miami area,” he said. Over the weekend, Cottonwood Heights police arrested two men from Florida who were caught allegedly installing a card skimming machine in a gas pump. That arrest comes on the heels of the arrests of two teen boys from Romania by the Utah Highway Patrol earlier this year on I-70 near Richfield. According to a search warrant affidavit filed in the case, the teens were allegedly "traveling cross-country in order to skim credit card and personal information using the skimmers, laptop, cellphone and electronic storage devices found in their possession." Similar incidents are being reported around the country. • Two men from Italy and Romania were indicted Tuesday on charges they ran an elaborate, large-scale, credit-card skimming ring in several Middlesex, Massachusetts, towns along the Route 128 corridor, according to the Bedford Patch. • The Louisana secretary of agriculture reported on March 30 that 15 credit card skimming devices were found at gasoline pumps in different parts of the state over the past month, collecting about 4,000 credit and debit card numbers. • The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department reported in March that at least 80 people had their bank card information compromised by a card skimming device at a gas pump in the tourist town of Big Bear, California, according to ABC 7. Steenblik said a person's credit card information is obtained by one of two ways. One is buying a number off the "dark web." Those numbers, he said, are collected during high-profile security breaches such as what happened with Target and Arby's. The other way is by installing card skimming machines, such as at gas pumps or ATMs. A person then buys a re-encoding machine, which can be purchased off the regular internet, Steenblik said, and puts the stolen number on anything that has a magnetic strip. "It can be a gift card, it can be any card that has a magnetic strip,” he said. A room key card can then be used, essentially, as a credit card. Most victims don't realize they've been victimized until after the fact because their credit card is still in their wallets. They have no idea the information from it has been stolen. Steenblik said the scammers will then typically go to big box stores and purchase either gift cards or iPads and phones. Gift cards can be spent, re-encoded or pawned off, he said, which is why they are so popular. Plus, they're small and easier to steal and conceal, Steenblik said. Skimming is part of a "really big operation" that is similar to organized crime, he said. The ones that are caught in Utah are typically at the bottom of their group. "They drive in or fly in, get a rental car, and go up and down the I-15 corridor doing this,” he said. But when they're caught, Steenblik said they rarely talk. And those who do talk to investigators only know the person who hired them by their first name, and the only contact they have with them is through a phone that has since been discarded. Once they bail out of jail, they typically flee. "Some of them get bail posted for them, and then they’re gone. We see very few of them come back to court,” Steenblik said. 1 comment on this story Investigators believe the "bigger fish" in the operation aren't actually in Utah, which is why local police agencies rely on assistance from the U.S. Secret Service to help with the cases. U.S. Attorney for Utah John Huber said Wednesday that his office has seen skimming scams for years. "Cyber is the new frontier of crime. This is the manifestation of that. This is a cybercrime. They’re using technology to rip people off,” he said. Steenblik said the best thing local law enforcers can do for now is to train stores on how to recognize skimming.

Keith Noonan, Dan Caplinger, and Jason Hall (keithnoonan) Apr 5, 2017 at 6:49PM When it comes to owning strong, well-run companies, Warren Buffett's preferred holding time is "forever," but the man known as the Oracle of Omaha will sell a stock when he thinks that the money would be better utilized elsewhere. Read on to learn why our writers thinks Mondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) could be the next stocks to be unloaded by Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B). Image source: Getty Images. Will Buffett lose his appetite for this stock? Dan Caplinger (Mondelez International): Among the positions that Warren Buffett has in his portfolio, some clearly carry more conviction than others. Mondelez International is on the low end of Buffett's holdings list, with his company reporting holdings of just 578,000 shares of the food giant, worth only a bit more than $25 million. That might sound like a lot, but when you consider the many positions that Buffett owns that are worth hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars, the small stature that Mondelez enjoys within his pantheon is much clearer. Rumors had surfaced that more extensive Buffett holding Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) might want to merge with Mondelez to take advantage of greater scale in the food industry; that might ordinarily explain a small position in Buffett's portfolio. Yet if any such rumors seemed credible in the past, that credibility largely evaporated when Kraft Heinz instead decided to offer $143 billion to purchase industry rival Unilever (NYSE: UL) (NYSE: UN). Unilever rejected that proposal, and given that Buffett has denied the Kraft Heinz and Mondelez rumors in the past, there's little reason to think the issue will come back up now. Mondelez has also seen some struggles recently. In its most recent quarterly report, the food giant said revenue fell 7% from year-ago levels, leading the company to perform more poorly on the bottom line than investors had expected. CEO Irene Rosenfeld pointed to "significant economic disruptions, political uncertainties, and slower global category growth" for the poor performance, although she also emphasized that her views on the company's longer-term growth prospects were sound. In the end, Mondelez is little more than an afterthought in Buffett's portfolio. Buffett might well end up selling the position to help fund a more promising acquisition elsewhere. Wal-Mart loses its luster Keith Noonan (Wal-Mart): After reducing its position in Wal-Mart by roughly 90% last quarter, it's not a stretch to imagine that Berkshire Hathaway will liquidate the rest of its stake in the world's largest retailer. Buffett's company has held Wal-Mart shares since 2005, but began rapidly unloading the stock last year -- bringing its holdings in the retail chain down from $3 billion in mid-2016 to roughly $100 million by the end of the year. Increased competition from online retailers, and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in particular, was apparently at the heart of Berkshire's decision to shed Wal-Mart shares. Buffett has indicated that the retail sector now looks too challenging. That suggests he will have little reason to hold onto Wal-Mart, and his recent comments back the idea that his company will sell the rest of its position in the big-box retailer -- if it hasn't already. Check out Buffett's take on Amazon from a recent interview on CNBC's Squawk Box: It's an entity that's gonna have everybody in their sights. And they have got delighted customers. And it's extraordinary what they've accomplished. And a lot of people like the delivery. That is a tough, tough, tough, competitive force. He went on to say that, while Wal-Mart has strengths that could aid the company's crucial push into online selling, he also thinks "the online thing is very hard to figure out." So, between the recent divestiture and Buffett's own comments on the tough competitive retail climate, there's a good chance that Berkshire will complete its exit from Wally World in the near future. Wal-Mart's time may be past for Buffett Jason Hall (Wal-Mart): I agree with Keith and think Berkshire will soon sell off the last of its Wal-Mart stake. Furthermore, there's a good chance that Buffett has already sold off all of "his" Wal-Mart stock; the small position (less than $100 million in shares) the company still held at last reporting is likely in the portfolio managed by one of Berkshire's other two portfolio managers. Why has Wal-Mart lost favor at Berkshire Hathaway? In short, Wal-Mart's competitive advantages in scale and distribution may not be as valuable as they once were. The fact is, fewer people are choosing to go to physical stores, and this trend seems far more likely to accelerate than it is to slow. In the past, Wal-Mart has been able to fuel growth by expanding into new segments, such as groceries, as well as expanding its store base. But at this stage of the game, the dynamic has shifted: Wal-Mart is being forced to play defense simply to maintain current sales, as online competition ramps up, and the power of the company's massive distribution network is watered down by the high fixed expense of its underperforming retail stores. At the same time, there's an argument to be made that Wal-Mart is actually worth buying; it trades at 16 times last year's earnings, and pays a 2.9% dividend yield. But when it comes to long-term prospects for the retailing behemoth, I think its best days are behind it. Dan Caplinger owns shares of BRK-B. Jason Hall owns shares of AMZN and BRK-B.

The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Gina Rodriguez in Luna Equal Pay campaign Credit: LUNA Bar via YouTube Equal Pay Day on April 4 turned into a lasting marketing opportunity, thanks to LeanIn.Org, founded by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, and partners that include Procter & Gamble Co., Clif Bar & Co.'s Luna bars and Lyft. To raise awareness that women on average are paid 20% less than men, for example, P&G is offering a 20% rebate on up to $50 of its products purchased through April 30. Luna is offering 20% off bars purchase through lunabar.com through April 11. And Lyft is donating 20% of fares for rides on April 4 in 240 cities to women's organizations. Local businesses in 25 cities offered 20% discounts that day too. But underpayment of women isn't just a one-day or one-month marketing opportunity, it appears. The American Association of University Women is part of a "Lady Dollars" campaign taking a somewhat opposite approach to illustrate the problem, including a Google Chrome extension that will automatically add 20% to the prices of products at online retailers, starting with Walmart.com and Amazon.com. You don't actually have to pay those prices, but it's an illustration, and one that will be updated for Mother's Equal Pay Day (May 23), Black Women's Equal Pay Day (July 31), Native American Women's Equal Pay Day (Sept. 25) and Latinas' Equal Pay Day (Nov. 2). Luna's equal pay campaign is showcasing Gina Rodriguez, including a 90-second video in which the "Jane the Virgin" actress practices boxing and discusses equal pay. Luna Brand Director Ritu Mathur said Ms. Rodriguez "felt very authentic," in part because she was already speaking out as an advocate for women. The Clif Bar brand has long advocated for equal pay and representation through programs including its women's cycling team getting the same pay a men's team would and running the Lunafest women's film festival. Luna plans to donate up to $100,000 to fund wage negotiation workshops throughout the year. It also hired many women leads on the project including, among others, director Alexis Spraic and Executive Producer Tieneke Pavesic at production house Farm League, and at digital agency AnalogFolk Creative Director Carren O'Keefe. Meanwhile, Dress for Success, which specialized in programs aimed at empowering women, on April 4 kicked off a campaign called #OpenDoorProject by FCB. The organization is asking women to post a photo of their shoe holding a door open, and then thank the woman -- or women -- who opened the door to their success. Burger King's Froot Loops shake  Credit: Burger King Burger King's latest limited-time product isn't a burger, fries, or even a new flavor of chicken fries. Instead, it's introducing a Froot Loops shake made with vanilla-flavored soft serve, pieces of Froot Loops cereal and a "sweet sauce," as the idea of ice cream mixed with a cereal that lists sugar as its first ingredient apparently isn't quite sweet enough. The BK tie-in is believed to be the first-ever collaboration between the home of the Whopper and a Kellogg's cereal. BK already features Kellogg Co.'s MorningStar Farms brand in its veggie burger. The shake will be available starting April 17 at a suggested price of $2.99. Intel is deploying what might be the best use case of its 360-degree technology through a partnership with the NFL. Stadiums in Houston, San Francisco and Baltimore will showcase Intel's FreeD technology, which freezes video so users can rotate the picture and see big plays from any angle. Fans will be able to use the tech by visiting the NFL's official website. Broadcasters, meanwhile, will showcase the 360-degree feature during games, Intel said. The complex FreeD technology is made possible through dozens of 5K HD cameras that are connected to Intel servers via fiber-optic cables that stretch for miles, Intel said. A 15- to 30-second clip generates about 1 terabyte of data. There is a small caveat, however: Producers will select and package replays, not fans or broadcasters, Intel said. The technology made its first debut during last year's Super Bowl, the company said. Dean Foods' DairyPure was the big new-product winner of 2016, according to IRI, which tallied $1.2 billion in sales for its milk brand in all measured outlets for the year. The brand was new, but the products weren't, as DairyPure was a nationwide consolidation of several regional dairy brands in a marketing campaign led by Curiosity Advertising Cincinnati that began in May 2015. GSK's over-the-counter switch of prescription allergy drug Flonase was No. 2 overall and the big non-food winner with $316.5 million in IRI-measured 2016 sales. Procter & Gamble Co. landed five products in the top non-food launches of 2016, with entries from Gillette, Tide, Crest, Tampax and Old Spice. But Walmart also flexed its muscle in an unusual way on the list, with one of its exclusive brands, The Pioneer Woman Collection, coming in No. 6 in non-food at $79.1 million in sales. Henkel's Persil ProClean determent also cracked that list just below at $45.2 million in 2016 sales, despite having only been distributed at Walmart during the early part of the year. While big players did well at the top, IRI notes that 80% of top-ranking brands and 64% of new-product dollars came from small and midsize manufacturers. Credit: J.Crew It's the end of an era at J Crew Group Inc. -- an era that favored orange-red lipstick and thick black-frame spectacles. Earlier this week, the retailer announced the December departure of Jenna Lyons, who has spent more than a quarter-century at the New York-based company, most recently serving as president and executive creative director since 2012. The chain, which has struggled with souring sales in recent years amid rising competition from fast-fashion players and ecommerce disruptors, does not plan to replace Ms. Lyons. Years ago, the creative was responsible for infusing the 34-year-old apparel brand with a much-needed nerdy chic -- Ms. Lyons' preference for combining patterns like stripes and florals and ability to combine formalwear with casualwear helped propel J. Crew into the spotlight, but such trends -- once fairly innovative -- have faded in recent years. Calling all would-be fashion models. Denim brand NYDJ, a Los Angeles-based outfit founded in 2003, is taking its campaign casting call to the road. This month, the brand will host opportunities at various malls for aspiring models to be featured in the brand's Fit is Everything fall campaign. The company plans to visit three malls throughout April in its search for loyal consumers ready to strike a pose. The move is the latest in apparel brands' strategy to use authenticity and realness in their marketing as a way to better connect with actual customers. Lastly, here's the latest on some marketing personnel changes at Heineken USA. The beer marketer has promoted Felix Palau, formerly VP-marketing for Tecate, to senior VP-marketing for its flagship Heineken brand. Ralph Rijks, the former Heineken VP, "is returning to Holland with his family," according to Heineken. Esther Garcia has been promoted to replace Mr. Palau on Tecate.

Amazon’s market cap is nearly double Walmart’s. (Amazon Photo) Despite reporting a staggering $481.3 billion in net sales last year, Walmart’s value still doesn’t even come close to Seattle e-commerce giant Amazon. Amazon’s stock exceeded $900 per share for the first time this week, bringing its market cap to more than $430 billion. Walmart’s shares are trading at about $72 per share, with a market cap of $219 billion. The discrepancy was first noted by CNN Money. You know you’re dealing with a real Goliath when it makes Walmart look like David. Of course, it’s not entirely fair to compare the two. Amazon is able to fund its e-commerce business with a multi-billion dollar cloud computing operation, a lineup of devices (including the Echo), a film studio, and other ventures that keep its brand ever-present in the minds of consumers. That arsenal makes Amazon a worthy adversary for Walmart and competition between the two has been brewing for years. Walmart has tested several free shipping options to compete with Amazon Prime and in February Amazon quietly reduced its own free shipping minimum for non-Prime members to $35, matching Walmart’s minimum. In 2016, Walmart, acquired Amazon competitor Jet.com to bolster the retailer’s e-commerce presence. The move is apparently paying off, with Walmart reporting a 29 percent increase in online sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. All that’s to say that despite Amazon’s huge lead in market cap, the competition is still on.

Austin police said Raquel Perez, 26, arrived at the Walmart at 12:48 p.m. on May 5, 2016 with her children, one 21 months old, the other 3 years old. By watching surveillance cameras at the store, investigators were able to pinpoint her movements. Perez was viewed on camera shopping in the store and returning to her car to put things in her trunk at 12:55 p.m. She reentered the store and went to the nail salon at 1 p.m. At 1:55 p.m., witnesses heard the children crying in the backseat of the car and called 911. According to an arrest warrant, the children were in the locked car with the windows rolled down about one inch for at least 75 minutes before they were found. The witnesses were able to instruct the 3 year old how to unlock the door and took the children to the store’s security office. An Austin firefighter who responded to the 911 call took a temperature reading of the car’s interior and found it to be 100 degrees even after the doors were opened for several minutes. Police said, while they were attending to the situation outside the store, Perez left the nail salon at 2:05 p.m. and was seen walking around inside shoplifting. She did not leave until 2:23 p.m. As she did, she set off the store’s anti-theft devices. She only returned to the store to ask about her children after placing the stolen items in her car, continued in the court documents. When an officer contacted her nearly a week after the incident she told them she didn’t want to discuss it. Authorities issued an warrant for her arrest on April 4, 2017–nearly a year after the incident. Perez is not currently in jail. NBC4’s sister station KXAN is working to learn why the Austin Police Department filed official charges against her nearly a year after the incident. Timeline of events: 12:48 p.m. – Perez parked and walked into the store 12:55 p.m. – Perez left the store and put things in her car 1:00 p.m. – Perez reentered store and went to nail salon 1:55 p.m. – Witnesses called 911 after finding children 2:05 p.m. – Perez left salon, began shoplifting around store 2:23 p.m. – Perez left store, put stolen items in car, returned to store to ask about children Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

Austin police said Raquel Perez, 26, arrived at the Walmart at 12:48 p.m. on May 5, 2016, with her children, one 21 months old, the other 3 years old. By watching surveillance cameras at the store, investigators were able to pinpoint her movements. Perez was viewed on camera shopping in the store and returning to her car to put things in her trunk at 12:55 p.m. She reentered the store and went to the nail salon at 1 p.m. At 1:55 p.m., witnesses heard the children crying in the backseat of the car and called 911. According to an arrest warrant, the children were in the locked car with the windows rolled down about one inch for at least 75 minutes before they were found. The witnesses were able to instruct the 3-year-old how to unlock the door and took the children to the store’s security office. An Austin firefighter who responded to the 911 call took a temperature reading of the car’s interior and found it to be 100 degrees even after the doors were opened for several minutes. Police said, while they were attending to the situation outside the store, Perez left the nail salon at 2:05 p.m. and was seen walking around inside shoplifting. She did not leave until 2:23 p.m. As she did, she set off the store’s anti-theft devices. She only returned to the store to ask about her children after placing the stolen items in her car, continued in the court documents. When an officer contacted her nearly a week after the incident she told them she didn’t want to discuss it. Authorities issued a warrant for her arrest on April 4, 2017–nearly a year after the incident. Perez is not currently in jail. WOWK’s sister station KXAN is working to learn why the Austin Police Department filed official charges against her nearly a year after the incident.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Apr 5, 2017 at 1:41PM There's no question who the king of retail is these days -- at least according to Wall Street.  Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), the e-commerce player that grew up with the internet, now carries a market cap of $425 billion, nearly double that of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), the most valuable brick-and-mortar retailer. Amazon managed to achieve that status, which makes it one of the most valuable companies in the world, with much less revenue than Wal-Mart, and barely any profit until two years ago. Instead, Amazon's premium is based on its extraordinary growth and the network of competitive advantages that have evolved out of its Prime membership service, its network of fulfillment centers, and Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart, however, has finally begun fighting back under CEO Doug McMillon. The company has scaled back on new store openings to invest in current ones and raised wages to improve service. It's also accelerated its grocery pickup service with plans to have nearly 1,000 kiosks in store parking lots by the end of the year. More importantly, the company signaled its focus on e-commerce by spending $3.3 billion on Jet.com last summer, which brought in Jet Founder Marc Lore. Since then, the company's e-commerce sales have accelerated as it's made smaller e-commerce acquisitions like Moosejaw and ModCloth, and has begun offering free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more. Though Wal-Mart is still widely considered the underdog in this retail battle, the company is not without advantages. Here are three of them. 1. Profits  Thanks to Jeff Bezos's long-term mantra, Amazon has been able to earn a valuation above $400 billion with little to show on the bottom line as Wall Street has given it a special allowance. Wal-Mart's profits not only underpin the stock's value, but also give the company the ability to outbid Amazon for potential acquisitions and more money to invest in growth. Last year, Wal-Mart had $13.6 billion net income compared to Amazon's $2.4 billion. On a free cash flow basis, Wal-Mart had nearly $21 billion against $9.7 billion for Amazon. Though Wal-Mart pays out about $6 billion annually in dividends, the company still has about $15 billion in cash flow left over. Those profits also give the company an advantage in a potential price war with Amazon, which seems increasingly likely as the e-commerce giant pushes aggressively into groceries. Wal-Mart could better survive such a competition as it has a larger profit cushion. Wal-Mart's own investors also seem more willing to give it some leeway to invest in itself, as the company has previously said that profits would ebb as it hikes wages and cleans up stores. After a dip following the announcement, the stock has rebounded.  2. Store network Amazon built its empire on e-commerce, but the company is increasingly looking to brick-and-mortar real estate to drive growth. It's opened up pop-up shops in malls to sell gadgets and a handful of AmazonBooks stores which sell books as well as gadgets, and it's experimenting with different brick-and-mortar grocery formats including Amazon Go and AmazonFresh Pickup. Wal-Mart, on the other hand, has already blanketed the country with stores, claiming that there's a Wal-Mart within 5 miles of 70% of the U.S. population. At one point, e-commerce was seen as more efficient than brick-and-mortar retail, but the high shipping costs involved in last-mile delivery mean that retailers often make higher margins on in-store sales than online. That store network has given Wal-Mart an advantage with services like grocery pickup, which it can implement by simply adding kiosks to store parking lots, unlike Amazon which has to build such facilities from scratch. Wal-Mart's stores can further assist the company's e-commerce distribution and support services like buy online/pick-up in store. 3. Size Despite Amazon's impressive revenue growth, Wal-Mart is still much bigger, with nearly four times the revenue of Amazon. That gives the world's largest retailer a level of clout with suppliers that is hard to match. According to Recode, both Wal-Mart and Amazon are putting the squeeze on suppliers in an effort to lower their own prices and win market share.  Amazon, as part of its focus on growing grocery sales, has been pressuring suppliers like General Mills, Mondelez, and others to adapt packaging to e-commerce, which could mean eliminating colorful boxes and changing materials to make such items lighter and smaller to save on shipping. But Wal-Mart still controls nearly 10% of non-automotive retail spending in the country, meaning when it talks suppliers listen. Despite the growth of e-commerce, the vast majority of retail sales still take place in stores. Though Amazon's growth is certainly appealing, Wal-Mart is too big for the consumer packaged goods companies to ignore. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Called Amazon Cash, the feature allows cash-carrying consumers to add funds to their Amazon.com balance by presenting a bar code to a cashier at a network of partner retailers. Users tell the clerk how much cash to add, between $15 and $500 at once, and the funds arrive instantly in an Amazon.com stored-value account. Systems like this are not new, and earlier models relied on consumers setting up a cash load online and then presenting a printed receipt, as was the case when Walmart introduced a similar service in 2012. Amazon's twist is keeping the experience decidedly digital, allowing consumers to store a reusable Amazon Cash bar code in Apple's wallet app or on the home screen of Android devices. Bloomberg News Amazon Cash debuted Monday in the U.S., and the initial retailers include CVS, Speedway, Sheetz, Kum & Go, D&W Fresh Market, Family Fare Supermarkets and VG's Grocery. Besides bearing similarities to Walmart's Pay with Cash service, Amazon Cash also resembles PayPal's MyCash card, which charges a nominal fee upfront for digital in-store prepaid loads to PayPal's account, and is a major part of PayPal's efforts to build a market among underbanked consumers. The key differences for Amazon: There are no consumer fees, and there is no physical card. "It's a bit of a defeat for PayPal, which is increasingly catering to the needs of the unbanked and would had loved to do a deal with Amazon to enable the unbanked to purchase there," said Rick Oglesby, president of AZ Payments Group. Amazon Cash also shares traits with PayNearMe, which works with a similar network of retailers but markets its service more for bill payment than e-commerce. Amazon's service could also be an alternative to prepaid card companies such as Netspend and Green Dot, whose products can give unbanked consumers access to e-commerce. "Amazon's service is open to anyone who has a mobile phone," said Richard Crone, a payments consultant. The system adds authentication through the phone credentials, the Amazon login and the consumer showing his or her phone at the retailer, he noted. "It pushes the entire prepaid market to up its game." Amazon can also pair the program with its strategy to build a brick and mortar footprint by tying some elements of traditional retail with its e-commerce brand. Amazon is building Go, an experimental store that doesn't require a checkout, instead using in-store sensors to charge a user's Amazon account for in-store shopping. Amazon is also opening a chain of bookstores, and is expanding its distribution and fulfillment network in the U.S. Amazon did not reveal terms of its deals with retailers, and did not return a request for comment by deadline. The launch of Amazon Cash comes at an unwelcome time for the traditional brick-and-mortar industry, as Amazon becomes larger than most big-box chains combined, and many big-box chains face traffic slumps and closures. "Consumers can access to Amazon for whatever you want to buy. And if Amazon takes this to its move to open stores, they can squeeze out even more," Crone said. "It would be like Trader Joe's for Amazon." John Adams John Adams is Executive Editor of PaymentsSource.

Austin police said Raquel Perez, 26, arrived at the Walmart at 12:48 p.m. on May 5, 2016 with her children, one 21-months old, the other 3-years old. By watching surveillance cameras at the store, investigators were able to pinpoint her movements. Timeline of events: 12:48 p.m. – Perez parked and walked into the store 12:55 p.m. – Perez left the store and put things in her car 1:00 p.m. – Perez reentered store and went to nail salon 1:55 p.m. – Witnesses called 911 after finding children 2:05 p.m. – Perez left salon, began shoplifting around store 2:23 p.m. – Perez left store, put stolen items in car, returned to store to ask about children Perez was viewed on camera shopping in the store and returning to her car to put things in her trunk at 12:55 p.m. She reentered the store and went to the nail salon at 1 p.m. At 1:55 p.m., witnesses heard the children crying in the backseat of the car and called 911. According to an arrest warrant, the children were in the locked car with the windows rolled down about one inch for at least 75 minutes before they were found. Walmart on East Ben White in Austin. (KXAN Photo/Frank Martinez) The witnesses were able to instruct the 3-year old how to unlock the door and took the children to the store’s security office. Breaking into a car to save a child without facing legal consequences An Austin firefighter who responded to the 911 call took a temperature reading of the car’s interior and found it to be 100 degrees even after the doors were opened for several minutes. Police said, while they were attending to the situation outside the store, Perez left the nail salon at 2:05 p.m. and was seen walking around inside shoplifting. She did not leave until 2:23 p.m. As she did, she set off the store’s anti-theft devices. She only returned to the store to ask about her children after placing the stolen items in her car, continued in the court documents. “She was obviously not thinking right. Getting her nails done and obviously shoplifting,” said Ofc. Albino Cadenas, a spokesman with the Austin Police Department. Baby dies after being left in hot car for 9 hours at San Antonio Walmart When an officer contacted her nearly a week after the incident she told them she didn’t want to discuss it. Authorities issued a warrant for her arrest on April 4, 2017–nearly a year after the incident. “She told the detective that she didn’t want to talk about the incident and there was nothing to talk about and immediately hanged up,” Cadenas said. Perez is not currently in jail. Officers blame the delay in charges on an entanglement of red tape. “It’s an ongoing investigation,” said Cadenas. “So, the detective speaks to her to see what’s going on. The detective then staffs it with the district attorney, who aids in the criminal investigation.” Child Protective Services is also investigating. The agency removed the children from Perez’s care and placed them with relatives.

Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Apr 5, 2017 at 9:26AM Image source: Getty Images. Carrying credit card balances is not a smart financial move, as the interest rates card issuers charge increase exponentially the cost of whatever it is you bought. Yet according to the Federal Reserve, carry balances we do -- Americans had almost $1 trillion worth in 2016, up 6.5% from the prior year. The folks at WalletHub analyzed user search patterns and application statistics in order to identify the most popular credit cards. While most cards may be the ones you'd expect to find, a couple definitely will raise an eyebrow or two. Source: Best Buy. 1. Best Buy With consumer electronics suffering a 6% decline in sales over the past 12 months, having Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) pop up at the top of this list may raise some eyebrows, not least because the electronics retailer also saw domestic revenue decline 1.2% for the year and consumer electronics represent 34% of sales. Yet the Best Buy credit card also accounted for nearly a quarter of all the sales it made in 2016, or 23%. It did enjoy a 5% increase in comparable sales in the consumer electronics department, second only to appliances, which enjoyed a near-8% increase. So it seems consumers really weren't buying consumer electornics products all that much last year, but when they did, they went to Best Buy to do it, and apparently used its credit card to finance the purchases. However, while you can earn 5% back on purchases made with the Best Buy card, WalletHub notes all four Best Buy cards feature deferred interest, which means interest on purchases is retroactively applied to your entire original purchase amount if you're late paying your bill or don't repay the full balance by the end of the low-rate introductory period. Image source: Wal-Mart. 2. Wal-Mart Is anyone shocked that the world's biggest retailer also ranked very highly on the popularity charts for credit cards? Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) came in second, but WalletHub notes it's best for online purchases where you can earn up to 3% back while in-store purchases only garner you a 1% benefit. Wal-Mart notes its e-commerce offerings have also enjoyed strong growth, as it has invested substantial sums of money into building out the service. Including both its purchase of Jet.com and its online grocery options, Wal-Mart's e-commerce business grew 29% even as store growth expanded by less than 2%. Image source: Gap. 3. Old Navy Old Navy is Gap's (NYSE:GPS) largest retail concept and the only one that's experiencing any growth at all. Sales totaled $6.9 billion in 2016, ahead of the $5.4 billion generated by Gap stores themselves, and the only concept that saw positive comp growth for the year. Same-store sales rose 1% at Old Navy and fell everywhere else. What consumers might like about the Old Navy card is rewards can be earned at any of Gap's stores, including the namesake stores, Banana Republic, or Athleta, and it gives you some special sign-up bonuses and cash-back deals. What's not so sweet is the lack of an introductory rate and a higher-than-average APR that can really hurt if you don't pay your bill in full. Image source: Sears Holdings. 4. Sears Considering Sears Holdings (NASDAQ:SHLD) is reportedly on the brink of bankruptcy, it's surprising so many people are looking to sign up for this credit card. While it's possible they're hoping to rack up charges on going-out-of-business sales, it just may be cardholders are more interested in the retailer's Shop Your Way member loyalty program, the centerpiece of CEO Eddie Lampert's integrated plan to connect how consumers shop. The program awards points for purchases that can be used toward future purchases, and not all the purchases have to be made at Sears or Kmart. There are over 11,000 partners in the program, including ride-sharing app Uber, Burger King, movie ticket site Fandango, even grocers. The Sears MasterCard is the core credit card of the Shop Your Way Platform. Sears' credit card, however, has an even higher APR than Old Navy, according to WalletHub. It's 25.74%, and that's if you have good or excellent credit, which you need to have to get the card in the first place. Image source: Getty Images. 5. Home Depot DIY center Home Depot (NYSE:HD) has ridden the housing market boom higher, reporting a 7% increase in sales in 2016 to $95 billion, and it's expected housing will have another good year in 2017, though not as robust as it was last year. The National Association of Realtors predicts a 1.9% increase in home sales, as there will be a large number of first-time homebuyers entering the market in 2017, and that means they'll be turning to big-box stores like Home Depot to fix up, refresh, repair, and furnish their homes. Home Depot is forecasting sales and comps growth of 4.6% each this year, and likely a good portion of that will be put on its credit cards, since these are typically big-ticket purchases. Yet like we've seen with more than a few of the credit cards on this list, Home Depot charges really high rates, as much as 26.99%, so you're getting no bargain. Image source: Lowe's. 6. Lowe's Similar to Home Depot, big-box DIY rival Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) also ranked among the top 10 most popular credit cards, and for many of the same reasons. The company enjoyed a 10% increase in sales last year and a 4% rise in comps, yet 2017 might prove to be better for it as Lowe's generates more sales from appliances and fashion fixtures than does its orange competitor. Some 11% of sales come from the former category and 10% from the latter, while Home Depot generates just 7% of sales from appliances. In fact, Lowe's is the largest appliance retailer in the country, followed by Home Depot , which overtook Sears last year for second place. Best Buy comes in fourth. That could be why Lowe's credit card is a popular choice for consumers. Still, it has an APR just as high as its DIY rival, though it does give you generous 5% rewards on purchases. Image source: Banana Republic. 7. Banana Republic Another Gap concept, Banana Republic came in seventh on the list, but it's a business in a long, steady decline, with comparable sales plunging 7% in 2016 (although that's slightly better than the 10% drop it suffered the year before). Analysts say it has struggled because it lacks an identity with consumers, or has one that is otherwise forgettable. Coupled with high prices in a period where cheap, fast-fashion retailers like H&M and Century 21 rule, the retail concept has been spiraling down for some time. Like the Old Navy card, the Banana Republic credit card can earn rewards at any of Gap's four concepts, and though it has a high APR, it does offer a few benefits like the equivalent of 5% cash back that makes it understandable why it would be a popular choice even if consumers don't seem to be using it all that much at the store these days. Image source: Gap. 8. Gap Finally, Gap itself shows up on the list, and it carries with it all the advantages and drawbacks that both Old Navy and Banana Republic carry. Since it doesn't matter which store brand card you have, it may be why the most popular brand in the portfolio is also the most popular card. And with Gap also on a multiyear slide in comparable sales, its card may not move higher in the ranks any time soon. Image source: Getty Images. 9. Macy's If there's one trait that's common among the cards, it's that brick-and-mortar retailers are ailing these days, and Macy's (NYSE:M) is no different. It's closed down numerous stores and plans to close 100 over the next few years as sales shrink and move online. Yet unlike most of its rivals, Macy's actually owns a bank subsidiary, FDS Bank, that provides credit processing, collections, customer service, and marketing for all of its own credit card accounts as well as those from Department Stores National Bank, a subsidiary of Citibank.  Image source: Getty Images. 10. Chase Freedom The most notable feature about the JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) Chase Freedom card is that unlike any of the other cards in this top 10, it is not a retailer's credit card. Not surprisingly, Chase is the largest commercial credit card issuer by volume, owning over 19% of the marketplace compared to 16% at Bank of America and distant third place runner-up Wells Fargo at 10.7%. WalletHub finds that so long as you have excellent credit, which you need to qualify for the Freedom card, Chase gives consumers a bevy of benefits that makes it attractive, such as getting back $150 on your first $500 worth of purchases, 5% back on a ever-changing roster of categories, and 0% financing for 15 months.

The treatment of workers at the Ramatex factory was one of the considerations that influenced the Norwegian Government when it decided to disinvest in Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retail store. Ramatex supplies textile products to Wal-Mart. The Norwegian Government Petroleum Fund, one of the world’s biggest pension funds, invested a total of US$415 million as of December 31, 2005 in Wal-Mart. The retail store suffered the disinvestment from the fund for serious and systematic abuses of human rights. Ramatex, a Malaysian-owned company, makes products for western corporations including Nike, Puma, Wal-Mart, Sears and Otto Versand. In a press statement about the exclusion from the fund – which also affects mining group Freeport – Norwegian Finance Minister Kristin Halvorsen said the decision to stop investing in the retail store was based on allegations that “Wal-Mart is implicated in violations of human rights and labour rights in its businesses operations.” The assessment of the council encompasses Wal-Mart’s business operations in the USA and Canada and its suppliers in Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Lesotho, Kenya, Uganda, Namibia, Malawi, Madagascar, Swazi-land, Bangladesh, China and Indonesia. “The main suppliers to Wal-Mart in these countries (Namibia, Malawi and Madagascar) are Asian-owned textile factories. The Council is aware of a report dealing with working conditions at such factories in these countries. Here too, there are consistent accounts of long working days, low wages, injuries due to lack of protective equipment and various forms of abuse and discrimination,” the Council reported. A publication of the Labour Resource and Research Institute (LaRRI) on Ramatex in 2004 said workers at the factory were very unhappy about their wages, which forced them to work for very long hours to make a bit more money. Last year, the Namibia Food and Allied Workers Union said the basic pay of the workers ranged from N$500 to N$700 per month. “Sometimes, you work very hard and you are expecting a commission because we are told that if you reach a certain production level, you qualify for commission. End of the month, there is no commission. Sometimes the agreement was that you would get 85 cents per T-shirt, but when the commission appears, on the pay slip, the addition is one cent. Imagine what one will do with one cent,” one of the workers who were interviewed in the publication said. The publication “Ramatex, the other side of the fence” said the workers were having difficulty in making ends meet and were thus forced to live beyond their means. “The majority said they are hardly left with any money to buy enough food let alone clothing,” said the booklet. A campaign for workers rights, Jobs for Justice, this month called for Wal-Mart to be quarantined because “it is classified as a danger to public health.” Offences of the retail giant according to the campaign include: “Poverty wages, racial and gender discrimination, economic devastation for local communities and global exploitations. Other violations include environmental abuses, labour law violations and union busting, immigrant exploitation and health care infractions.” In 2004, Ramatex was again in the spotlight after 400 Bangladeshis who were recruited as skilled workers were deported back to their country. The migrant workers were said to have been lured to Namibia by ruthless agents who had promised them the chance to earn better salaries to support their families. After paying as much as N$21 000 to secure work in Namibia, they earned a salary of N$720 a month. One third of their salary was deducted for food and they were made to live in crammed and squalid conditions in one house with only one bathroom. In its recommendations to the Petroleum Fund last year, the Fund’s Council on Ethics said “An extensive body of material indicates that Wal-Mart consistently and systematically employs minors in contravention of international rules, that working conditions at many of its suppliers are dangerous or health hazardous, that workers are pressured into working overtime without compensation, that the company systematically discriminates against women in pay, that all attempts to unionise by the company’s employees are stopped, that employees are in a number of cases unreasonably punished and locked in, along with a number of other circumstances …” In its recommendations to the Norwegian Ministry of Finance, the council on Ethics noted that Wal-Mart is alleged to run its business operations in a manner that contradicts internationally recognised human rights and labour rights standards, both through its suppliers in a number of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America, and in its own operations. The council also noted that Wal-Mart exerted influence on the working conditions within the supplier network as it gives “it substantial market influence in the supplier industry. In fact, the company makes no secret of the fact that it imposes very stringent requirements on its suppliers to get them to cut their prices, enabling Wal-Mart to resell at low prices to the consumers.” SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleOpening Up Trade – Consequences for Namibia?

The Seattle-based giant has a market capitalization of over $430 billion, according to FactSet data. In comparison, Wal-Mart's market cap sits below $220 billion as of Wednesday morning. Like Wal-Mart, Amazon pitches itself to investors as a retailer, but is also a filmmaker, a cloud computing company, a grocery chain and a bookstore, among other things. So the comparison is, to a degree, apples to oranges — with one company aiming to take people to space and another that's staying focused on keeping its prices low, and not venturing outside the retail sector. "[Wal-Mart] continues to work to blend physical and digital assets in its operations, including a focus on buy online pick-up in-store, online grocery pickup, and 2-day shipping from its 5 e-commerce fulfillment centers," Guggenheim Securities wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. "Walmart.com's offering has grown increasingly competitive and the company continues to work on getting its e-commerce inventory levels in the right place to meet its 2-day free shipping promise," the note added. Some analysts, however, believe Wal-Mart has missed out on opportunities to be as expansive as Amazon, especially when it comes to groceries. Online grocery shopping could grow five-fold over the next decade, with U.S. consumers spending upwards of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according an forecast released earlier this year by Food Marketing Institute and Nielsen. AmazonFresh is Bezos' way of capitalizing on this trend. On Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets issued a new note on Wal-Mart to investors, maintaining its underperform rating on the stock and citing price cuts in grocery and households essentials as pressuring the retailer's top line. Recent pricing data suggest Wal-Mart could have trouble hitting its upcoming quarterly comparable sales growth targets, analyst Wayne Hood said. As of Tuesday's close, Wal-Mart has climbed nearly 5 percent over the past 12 months, while Amazon has risen close to 55 percent. Amazon hit an all-time intraday high of $908.54 on Tuesday. Wal-Mart had its last intraday high in January 2015, when the stock peaked at $90.97 per share.

If so, these stocks might be best to buy. Todd Campbell, Anders Bylund, and Jason Hall (TMFEBCapital) Apr 5, 2017 at 8:56AM Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are very different companies, but they share one thing in common: Our Motley Fool contributors think they're all great investments when markets tumble. If the stock market hits a rough patch, here's why it might be smart to buy these stocks.  Owning a business that's recession-resistant  Jason Hall (Brookfield Infrastructure Partners): While "thrive" may be a strong word for almost any company when the market is doing poorly, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is definitely built to ride out one of the most common causes of a market crash: economic recession.  IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. This is because the very nature of the assets Brookfield Infrastructure owns and operates are necessary to everyday life for tens of millions of people, no matter the economic environment. 48% of last year's funds from operations was from long-term contracts, while another 43% was from its regulated utility holdings. That's a significant amount of cash flows that can be counted on, rain or shine. Furthermore, its geographic diversity can help offset regional economic weakness that may have some effect on part of the business.  Brookfield Infrastructure is also built to pay its investors -- and to grow that payout. At recent prices, the dividend yield was over 4%, and management is committed to increasing the per-unit payout 5%-9% per year.  While it's possible its share price will fall during the next market crash, savvy investors who understand the business should feel confident that they can hold tightly to their investment and count on that nice dividend, because Brookfield Infrastructure's operations won't miss a beat just because the market's a mess.  Always low prices? Hey, that will work! Anders Bylund (Wal-Mart): Yep, you heard me right. Wal-Mart would be a great dividend stock to own in the next major market crash. The fact of the matter is, consumers have to tighten their belts when times are hard. So in periods of high unemployment, limited wage increases, and waning real estate prices, low-cost stores tend to do alright. And Wal-Mart is still the king of low-cost country. Here's how Wal-Mart made out in the 2008-2009 financial crisis, for example. The shaded area might as well show a golden age for Sam Walton's retail empire rather than an official recession: WMT Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Beyond that resilient quality, Wal-Mart also behaves like a true dividend champion. Payouts have increased in each of the last 42 years without fail, even if the boosts have slowed down a bit recently. The current yield stands at a solid 2.9%, with only 47% of the company's free cash flows needed in order to keep those checks coming. Unlike many other recession-resistant investments, traders and analysts have largely caught on to Wal-Mart's crash-market performance. Share prices actually rose 19% in 2008 while the rest of Wall Street burned. So, you can't simply resolve to pick up new shares on the cheap when disaster strikes -- you're better off getting your Wal-Mart ducks in a row ahead of time. And if share prices do fall precipitously for some reason, there's nothing stopping you from buying more. And those dips can do wonders for your dividend reinvestment returns, too. Sometimes, a good defense is the best offense Todd Campbell (Johnson & Johnson): When markets get tough, it can help to invest in companies where demand isn't tied to the economy, and perhaps no company is less exposed to economic whims and whispers than healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson is best known for its consumer goods brands, such as Band-Aid, but it generates most of its money from selling prescription drugs. Last year, it recorded $33.4 billion in sales from brand-name medicines used to battle cancer, HIV, heart disease, and autoimmune disease. The company sells medical equipment and instruments that are important for surgeries, too, and thanks to its diversity across healthcare, its performance during market downturns has been impressive. For example, between March 31, 2007, and March 31, 2008, Johnson & Johnson's shares declined by 15.5%, while the S&P 500 lost 37.9% of its value. Yes, that's still a loss, but given how many stocks performed worse than the S&P 500 during the Great Recession, I'll call it a win. Of course, there's no guarantee Johnson & Johnson will do as well the next time around, but there's reason for optimism. The company boasts a bulletproof balance sheet, and it runs one of the most prolific R&D departments in the business. It's also a Dividend Aristocrat, with an envy-inspiring 54 consecutive years of dividend increases. When the markets get dicey, it's one of the first stocks I'll buy.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 April 2017 by Military News Top WBENC Consumer Companies Join Together for the First Time in Collective Initiative to Source from Women-Owned Businesses BENTONVILLE, Ark., Mar. 30 /CSRwire/ – Walmart announced today that they are one of nine corporations joining in a collaborative effort to track and report sourcing from self-identified and certified women-owned businesses (WOBs) over the next five years. This marks the first time the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned, controlled and operated by women in the U.S., will launch a formal initiative to publicly report aggregated spending on WOBs. Walmart helped form this unified front of major corporations, including Campbell Soup Company, The Coca-Cola Company, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelēz International, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble, in order to create a more visible movement and raise awareness for the importance of sourcing from women-owned businesses. Walmart made the announcement on behalf of the other companies involved and WBENC at Walmart’s Women’s Economic Empowerment (WEE) Summit in Washington, D.C., a convening of leaders from business, government, NGOs and academia to discuss and celebrate the achievements of women’s empowerment. “Creating economic opportunity and growth is central to who we are as a company,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. “We are proud to be part of this important initiative, and together we can make an even bigger impact in elevating these successful women-owned businesses. Our customers care where products are sourced, and we believe supporting women-owned businesses helps us put innovative products on our shelves while helping these businesses thrive and grow.” “Campbell is proud to join this collaborative effort in order to raise awareness and foster more opportunities for female business owners,” said Denise Morrison, president and CEO, Campbell Soup Company. “One of the core values of our company is to ‘seek the power of different’ and we are committed to assemble a supplier base that reflects the diversity of the consumers and communities we serve.” “Empowering women entrepreneurs and women-owned firms is smart business and smart economics,” said Muhtar Kent, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. “Whenever you do the right thing and give businesswomen a real opportunity to compete, this creates a positive ripple effect that allows her to strengthen her company, her family and her community. And stronger families and communities help fuel more growth and opportunity.” “Women and minority-owned businesses are critical to both their communities and our company as they spur economic development and drive growth,” said Irene Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO of Mondelēz International. “We are proud to support this important initiative, as we continue to strive for inclusion and diversity in our company and women’s empowerment around the world.” „Supporting women-owned businesses and diversity across our suppliers is central to who we are at PepsiCo,” said Indra K. Nooyi, Chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. “Our commitment to diversity is not only a source of pride, it is a source of strength. And it’s part of our broader commitment to what we call Performance with Purpose, our approach to building a healthier, sustainable future for all our stakeholders — from our suppliers to our shareholders to our consumers, customers, employees, and the communities we serve.” „P&G is committed to Gender Equality,” said Carolyn Tastad, group president of P&G’s North America business. „Supplier Diversity has been an important business strategy at P&G in the United States for more than 40 years. We are proud to join this initiative to empower women-owned businesses, as we believe in the power of economic inclusion. When the ownership of our supply base reflects the diversity of our employees, consumers, and stakeholders, our business grows and our community thrives.” “By participating in this initiative, these companies will help fuel innovation and growth for women-owned businesses across the U.S.,” said Pamela Prince-Eason, president and CEO of WBENC. “With women-owned businesses currently supporting the creation or maintenance of 23 million American jobs, investing in their growth means investing in more opportunities for the workforce overall.” The initiative comes at a critical time when women entrepreneurs across a range of countries report having smaller and less diverse networks, leaving them at a disadvantage for growth, innovation and ability to be relevant to a global market (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor). Walmart helped to recruit this initial group of corporations to take part in this initiative and is encouraging others to join as well. This announcement comes on the heels of the culmination of Walmart’s five-year Global WEE Initiative, which included a set of goals to help empower women around the world through sourcing, training and supporting diversity and inclusion. As part of the WEE Initiative, Walmart sourced $20 billion from women-owned businesses in the U.S. and increased sourcing from women-owned businesses internationally. Additionally, in 2014, working with WBENC and WEConnect International, a global network that connects women-owned businesses to qualified buyers around the world, Walmart helped fund the creation of the “Women-Owned” logo which can be used by any woman-owned supplier certified by those organizations at any retailer to highlight their products to consumers. Today, Walmart has more than 1,500 suppliers who identify as women-owned businesses, producing everything from apparel to produce. In addition to participating in this collective initiative, Walmart announced plans to launch a Knowledge Center that will house the key tools, resources, learnings and achievements of the WEE Initiative and help serve as a guide for any company or institution in their work to empower women.

Reuters/Mike Blake An analysis of jobs posted to Walmart’s careers website between January and March found that more than half of the listings used gender-biased language. Fifty-one percent of job descriptions are more likely to attract men than women. Fortune and Textio collected and analysed 4,400 US-based Walmart job postings with an algorithm that ingests 10 million job openings per month, searching for language patterns and utilising them to produce scores that foresee how fast a job will fill and how widespread gender-biased language is in the post. The analysis found that 84 percent of director-level job descriptions and 53 percent of manager positions skew male. Out of 599 managerial positions, twenty-six percent had a gender bias rating that qualified them as very masculine. Of 49 director jobs analyzed, which included a global accounting director at the retailer's Bentonville home office and a user experience director in San Bruno, Cal., only seven utilised language that qualifies as neutral. One was classified as feminine while twenty of the director level positions used language classified as very masculine. Jacqui Canney, the company's executive vice president of global people, said they will continue to grow their point of view and get better. Known as the largest private employer in the US, Walmart, in the last eighteen months, overhauled its career website, which it said is a step in its "recruitment to retirement" overhaul. The company’s site now features more images of people of colour and women. The site also displays tourism-style profiles of regions, such as Northwest Arkansas, where its Bentonville, Ark. headquarters is situated. Textio's algorithm produces an overall score to determine how well a job post will perform against similar ads. For instance, a wanted ad for a store manager opening in Chicago with a score of 75 will appeal to more qualified candidates compared to 75 percent of retail store manager listings in the same location. Gender tone is scored on a scale from -1, very masculine, 1, very feminine to 0 representing a neutral score. Slightly and somewhat feminine or masculine are other categories that fill out the scale. Last year, Walmart was recognised for its  inclusive employee benefits policy by the Human Rights Campaign, which awarded the retailer a perfect score in its annual Corporate Equality Index. But it also deals with allegations of gender discrimination. Fortune reports that five women "reached a confidential settlement" last year and voluntarily withdrew their discrimination lawsuit against the company.

Destany Parrish, now 19, described one instance where Tad Cummins, who is accused of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with minor Elizabeth Thomas, 15, sang her a 'love song' in the Culleoka Unit School music room. Cummins, 50, and Thomas both disappeared on March 13 and were last seen together on surveillance video from a Walmart in Oklahoma City on March 15. 'I definitely think, on his end, it was a bit more than a friendship — its hard not to think that now,' Parrish told People magazine.  Scroll down for videos  Destany Parrish, 19, has come forward saying she now thinks a teacher accused of abducting one of his teenage female students exhibited 'grooming' behavior with her when she was 15 years old 'We’d sit [in his classroom] and talk about everything and anything,' Parrish said, describing her relationship with Cummins in 2011 and 2012, when he first began teaching the the Culleoka, Tennessee school. 'I never saw anything wrong with our friendship. He made me feel safe and he tried to do that with all of his students, so I never saw it as too weird.' Her opinion changed, though, when she found out about Cummins' accused abduction and alleged sexual contact with minor Elizabeth Thomas. Parrish said the coverage of the disappearance of Cummins and Thomas reminded her of a song he performed for her back she was only 15.  'I started recording because it surprised me how well he [played],' she said. 'I definitely didn’t focus on the lyrics at the time. I kind of thought about it [later] but I didn’t think about anything bad, I didn’t process them because it was Tad, the person I trusted.' Parrish recalled one line from the song to be, 'I could swim for a thousand miles in the oceans inside your eyes and never reach the side.' 'He was the one that everybody trusted,' Parrish said, adding that she shocked initially upon hearing the allegations lodges against Cummins. '[Up until recently] I was in a lot of denial.'   Elizabeth Thomas (left) and Tad Cummins (right) have been missing from Tennessee since March 13 Thomas's father, Anthony Thomas, said he believed Cummins used his time in school to 'groom' his daughter.  'He built up a system where she was dependent on him,' he said, of what he described as Cummins’ alleged efforts to woo the high school freshman. Parrish described Cummins as presenting himself as a confidant for students.   This revelation from Parrish comes after Tad Cummins' wife of 31 years, Jill Cummins, filed for divorce earlier this week.  She cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' on her husband's part as reasons for the termination of their marriage, according to court papers obtained by WKRN. Jill Cummins has previously spoken out,  pleading with her husband to 'do the right thing' and bring Thomas back to her family.  Meanwhile, Cummins' wife Jill Cummins filed for divorce on Friday citing 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' by her husband of 31 years; she is seen here at a press conference aired on Fox AMBER Alerts have been issued over the disappearance of Elizabeth Thomas on March 13 'This is not who you are. We can help you get through this,' she said. 'No matter how far you’ve gone or what’s happening right now, God’s grace is sufficient for you, and He wants you to come home.' It is not known at this time whether Thomas went willingly with Cummins, her former high school teacher. Two weeks before Thomas and Tad Cummins disappeared, a student claimed to have caught the two kissing on January 23 and administrators pulled Thomas from the teacher's classes. Tad Cummins was later, though not immediately, suspended. He was fired from his teaching job after the two disappeared on March 13. Since then the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) has received thousands of tips, but has confirmed only the March 15 Walmart sighting of the two together.  In the surveillance photo, Thomas appeared to have dyed her hair from blonde to red and wore a men's plaid flannel shirt while Cummins had dyed his beard from gray to black. Additional video of the visit later showed the two in discussion as they entered the store, with the teenager looking upset with the man wanted for her kidnapping.

Share this article Share 16 shares On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before they left the store.  Prior to the Oklahoma City sighting, Cummins was last seen on March 12 buying hair dye at a Walmart, while wearing the plaid shirt that Thomas was seen in on the March 15 video.  The last time the pair was seen was on surveillance video taken at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on March 15 On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased a few food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before hitting the road Thomas, who is one of ten children, made frequent posts on social media about romance and love in the weeks before she disappeared. She also started calling herself 'wife' on Instagram and made several references to a 'mission' that was 'almost complete.' On March 13, she told family she was going to spend the day with a friend. Thomas was seen on surveillance footage that same day carrying a bundle of clothes. One of her siblings has since revealed that the teenager told them to call police if she did not return home that night. Authorities say they believe Cummins has been grooming Thomas her for sex for some time. Thomas' estranged mother, Kimberly Ann Thomas, spoke to DailyMail.com earlier this month in an exclusive interview. She shared her fears about her daughter's alleged abduction. Cummins was seen at a Walmart on March 12, one day before the disappearance, purchasing hair dye She labeled her daughter's captor as 'disturbed' and said she worried Thomas would either end up pregnant or dead. Elizabeth Thomas' sister, Sarah Thomas, also spoke about the situation on Good Morning America last week.  The young girl fought back tears as she revealed that Cummins had begun showing up unannounced at her sister's work shortly before the pair disappeared together, and that his last visit had come just two days before the alleged abduction. 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' said Sarah Thomas. 'She thought it was the only way. She felt uncomfortable.' Elizabeth Thomas's family is still holding out hope that they will see the girl again, and are begging any person who might have information to reach out and contact authorities. Elizabeth Thomas's sister, Sarah Thomas (pictured) said that Cummins had been showing up at Thomas's work unannounced 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' said Sarah Thomas, pictured here second from the R with members of the Thomas family 'It feels like she just vanished, and I know that's impossible, someone had to see her,' said the victim's sister. Her father, Anthony Thomas, meanwhile was optimistic about the teenager's eventual return home to be with her family. 'We just live for that day where we are gonna get a phone call that says, "We're alright and waiting for someone to get me,"' he said. Investigators have learned that the two had been sending love letters to one another which were at times sexually charged by writing draft emails on a shared classroom computer at Culleoka School. They poured over email drafts that the two would send one another while in school for any clues into where the pair may be.

Share this article Share 16 shares Those letters were all sent after the student claimed to have witnessed Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas kissing in his classroom in January. 'They would write the message and let it save as a draft. The other person would log in, read the message and then delete it and then write another message that was saved as a draft,' said Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper. 'If you read them you would immediately recognize you are reading messages between two people who have a romantic interest in each other.' One of the emails uncovered by authorities was written by Tad Cummins and began: 'I saw you standing next to your backpack this morning.' The teacher then told the student how nice one of her body parts looked to him in the note.   The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is leading the hunt for the pair. Elizabeth Thomas;s last known whereabouts is believed to be Alabama. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. She has blonde hair and hazel eyes, and is 5 feet 5 inches inches tall and weighs 120 lbs. Cummins, who is described as being 'armed and dangerous,' was seen driving a Silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate 976ZPT, according to the TBI. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 lbs, with brown hair and eyes. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas is being asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND.     Read more: New details on relationship between former teacher and missing student | Watch the video - Yahoo Good Morning America Tad Cummins¿ wife files for divorce amid ongoing AMBER Alert | WKRN News 2 Tad Cummins: Student Describes Friendship with Teacher Share or comment on this article e-mail 16 shares Most watched News videos Driving tutor caught shouting and swearing at kids on horseback Shocking video shows 'Spice zombies' frozen by illegal drug Disturbing footage of attempted child abduction in Philadelphia Police officer stops press conference to arrest man Shocking video shows effects of stomach acid mixed with coke Bus driver KICKS passenger after throwing him off the bus Kendall Jenner stars in Pepsi's 'Live for Now Moments Anthem' ad Semi-decapitated teen tells police his shocking attack story Touching moment grieving mum sees robin on her son's grave Couple caught getting frisky in university building Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Heston Blumenthal confuses The Project desk with awkward interview Widower staying with his own daughter, 13, is accused of...

Most people, however, are neutral about it. Until, that is, they discover what Walmart does to towns even larger and more resistant to the degradation this retailing monster inevitably wreaks on American communities. Walmart sells cheap because it buys cheap, typically from 37-cents-an-hour Asian slave labor instead of decently paid Americans. This is the dirty secret of Walmart's boast, "Low prices. Always!" In the history of the world, there has never been so rich and powerful a corporation with so little regard for its 2.1 million employees or its impacts on the communities it burdens. Typically, what are Walmart's effects on a town it takes over? Take Kirksville, Miss., a town just a little bigger than Tehachapi. After Walmart's Supercenter barged in, supermarkets and other stores failed left and right, losing 15 solid jobs for every 10 minimum-wage jobs Walmart created. And this is the regular pattern, not an exception. The lowest possible wages, poor or no benefits, poor job security — all these convert a community of former independent business people with their valued employees into a herd of Walmart "associates," barely making it, paycheck to measly paycheck. By these means, Walmart always debases the average income of towns it invades. Always. A member of the Greater Tehachapi Economic Development Council has said in support of Walmart, "It is vital that we keep consumer spending local." A curious statement. Local merchants whose wares and services we buy spend their money here. The money we spend at Walmart is immediately shipped off as profits to Bentonville, Ark., to make the world's richest family, the Waltons, richer than ever. For a factual look at this omnivorous corporation's real impact on the small towns it assaults and on the U.S. economy generally, check out walmartwatch.com or any of the following books: "The Case Against Walmart," by Al Norman; "The Wal-Mart Effect," by Charles Fishman; "How Walmart Is Destroying America," by Bill Quinn; or the feature-length DVD, “Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price,” directed by Academy Award winner Robert Greenwald. Once you know, you care. Once you care, you no longer welcome Walmart's invasion. A community vote on this issue might well help keep Walmart from being foisted upon us. Many of us would really like to see a show of hands — informed hands — in a referendum. For those interested, the Tehachapi school district’s boundaries define the affected area well.

By Renwei Chung Mar 31, 2017 at 4:28 PM Shares462 Natasha Bowman “Turn your face towards the sun / Let the shadows fall behind you / Don’t look back, just carry on / And the shadows will never find you.” — Rihanna Earlier this month, Natasha Bowman delivered a presentation, at the Employment Law and Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., titled Equal Opportunity Bullying: How Even Lawful Behavior Can Put Your Organization at Legal Risk. Bowman has developed a reputation as an expert consultant and thought leader for organizations like The Heritage Foundation, Knowledge International, and Wiley Publishing, among others. Her expertise spans human resources management, talent management, employment law, organizational development, sourcing and recruiting, collective bargaining, and ethics and compliance. Because of her ability to diagnose workplace issues and provide proven solutions to organizations, she is often referred to as “The Workplace Doctor.” Bowman founded Performance ReNEW last year with the mission of developing the next generation of organizational leaders. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of my conversation with Natasha Bowman: Renwei Chung (RC): What motivated you to attend law school, and how did you choose University of Arkansas School of Law? Natasha Brown (NB): When presented with my options for enrollment and scholarship opportunities, I chose the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville due to its close proximity to the home office of Walmart Stores Inc. Because I was still determining whether or not I would use my JD to practice labor and employment law or as a tool to continue my career in HR, I thought if I could land an opportunity with Walmart while in law school, I could be exposed to both sides. RC: Performance ReNEW focuses on developing leaders. How can lawyers become better leaders? NB: Just like with leadership any organization, leaders in the legal field should not just focus on becoming a subject matter expert, but also on developing their soft skills such as emotional intelligence. Due to the nature of law, many lawyers already possess many of the skills necessary for leadership: effective communication, persuasion, the ability to negotiate. But they should also leverage those same skills that they use to practice law to engage the workforce within their law offices. RC: Earlier this month, you gave a presentation on bullying in the workplace. How does bullying affect workplace culture? NB: Bullying can have a major impact on workplace culture. Not only can it affect morale, reduce employee engagement, and increase turnover, it can also lead to extreme stress amongst employees. What many fail to realize is that it can also result in legal implications. Many organizations have the mistaken belief that workplace bullying is legal as long as it the person doing the bullying isn’t discriminatory in their actions. The reality is that employees do in fact have other legal avenues that they can pursue other than Title VII claims, such as through state workplace tort laws. RC: You mentioned that “you are responsible for your own career development,” and you wish you knew this fact earlier in your career. Can you expound on this? NB: I, like many others, often depended on my employer for my career growth and development. Additionally, I thought if I was doing everything right at work by exceeding expectations, going above and beyond, and reaching organizational goals, then I’d be on a guaranteed path to promotion opportunities. However, I found that that was just simply not the case. I am solely responsible for reaching my professional goals and dreams. While many organizations have given me opportunities for development and growth that I will always be grateful for, I am living by a saying that I read a while back: “If you’re not making your own dreams come true, you’re making someone else’s.” RC: Can you tell us more about your career path and the importance of building a personal brand? NB: My career path has been very unique. After graduating from law school, I had the opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 company, one of New York’s largest employers, and to teach at some of the most prestigious schools in the country, such as Georgetown University and Fordham University; however, most if not all of those opportunities came to me rather than me going after them. I have worked very hard over the past 10 years or so building my personal brand. I have over 20,000 connections on Linkedin that are about 99% in my professional field. Additionally, I constantly keep in touch with my past employers and colleagues. I spend a good amount networking at events as well. All of these actions have played a role in my career path. RC: Your book, You Can’t Do That at Work: 100 Common Legal Mistakes that Managers Make in the Workplace, comes out on May 6. Can you give us a brief overview? NB: Through my work as a legal academic, human resources practitioner, and consultant, I kept seeing many managers and organizational leaders making the same mistakes that were resulting in legal claims being filed against them. What I came to realize is that most organizations are well aware of basic federal labor and employment laws, but often struggle with the interpretation and application of them. They are often shocked to hear that these are not as black and white as they appear. Who would have thought having a policy of being respectful at work could potentially violate the National Labor Relations Act? This book explores those gray areas of labor and employment laws and gives real-life scenarios of what those laws really mean and how they really impact workplaces. RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience? NB: It was great chatting with you as well. I wish everyone reading this article the very best in their careers and challenge them to make the most of every opportunity that is presented to them. If no opportunities are presented then, they should go out and seek them. Much success to you all. On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Natasha Bowman for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

They found the University Heights man, 39, walking along the road, where he told them the women smiled at him so he felt the urge to hug them and photograph them. None of the women he had hugged chose to pursue the matter. He voluntarily went to Hillcrest Hospital for an evaluation because it appeared the medication he was taking for a psychiatric disorder was not working. Theft, Mayfield Road: A Cleveland man, 52, was arrested at Giant Eagle March 29 for the suspected theft of 25 bottles of 5-Hour Energy that he concealed in his shirt. The total value of the theft was $74.52. Theft, Mayfield Road: A Willoughby woman, 27, was arrested at Giant Eagle March 29 for possession of drug paraphernalia and theft. A Mentor woman, 26, was also charged with obstruction of justice and possession of drug paraphernalia. One of the women's father was also a suspect, but not charged. He said all of them have drug problems. Inside their vehicle was located a plastic bag with a white powdery substance, glass pipe, syringes and two vials of an unknown liquid. Noise complaint, Hinsdale Drive: Three residents were cited for unnecessary noises after officers responded to their home at 2:30 a.m. March 25 for a report of a loud party. The men, ages 20-21, were told they would be cited again if any further noise complaints were found to be valid. Assault, Warrensville Center Road: A man reported March 24 he was stabbed in the back by his ex-girlfriend while they were in her vehicle. He said she had wanted to rekindle their relationship and when he refused and tried to leave the vehicle, she stabbed him. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. Officers spoke to the Euclid woman the following day. She said the man wanted to rekindle the relationship and he became combative when she refused. She said she did not know exactly how he was stabbed because it happened so fast and the vehicle was in motion. The man chose not to press charges, but said he would seek a protection order. Violation of temporary protection order, Gable Lane: A woman reported March 21 she was being indirectly harassed on social media by a woman, whom she has a protection order against due to a lengthy history of harassment. She said she would pursue charges against the California woman, 32, if it was proven she was the one who anonymously posted the messages on the Internet. Weapons offense, Warrensville Center Road: A man reported March 24 a man he is familiar with pointed a gun at him while he was leaving Mr. B's Beverage after they exchanged words. Officers spoke to the suspect, a 23-year-old South Euclid man, who was still at the store with a six-month-old child in his car. He said he had the gun for protection because the other man robbed him in 2011. The gun was located and the man was charged with carrying a concealed weapon and child endangering. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A woman reported March 25 she accidentally left her wallet on a bench outside a restroom at Walmart and it was missing when she returned for it. Surveillance video showed a woman pick up the wallet and put it into her purse before entering the restroom. She later called police after hearing there was a video posted of her at Walmart on the South Euclid Police Department Facebook page. She said she picked up the wallet and subsequently turned it over to an employee. Officers found no evidence on surveillance video that she had. The wallet was said to contain credit cards and $180 cash. The incident is under investigation. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A woman was cited at Walmart for theft March 25 and released. Later, another woman called the station and reported her sister had been cited for theft at Walmart and used her identity. She said her sister told her the only reason she wasn't arrested was because she provided false information about her identity. Officers contacted the woman they cited at Walmart and strongly encouraged her to show up at court to resolve the matter so a warrant would not be issued under her sister's name. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: A Cleveland Heights man, 58, was arrested at Walmart March 29 for the suspected theft of eight packages of meat products, valued at $96.43. He later complained of chest pains and was taken to the hospital, based on the advice of paramedics. Theft, Grosvenor Road: A resident said March 30 her vehicle had been entered while it was parked in her driveway overnight and a small purse was taken from it. She believed she had left the vehicle unlocked, despite there being no signs of forced entry. She was unsure if there was any cash in the purse but said it did contain her Social Security card. Theft, Warrensville Center Road: Two girls were suspected of stealing merchandise from Walmart March 29 by concealing it in their purses.

"There are a lot of issues I’m not getting work done on today," Saltzman said this afternoon, near the end of a lengthy hearing on a controversial new city investment policy. "I don't really want to have to do this once or twice a year and have the same discussion over 21 companies." If not all of Saltzman's colleagues shared specifically that sentiment, two of them agreed with what he was driving at. In a 3-2 vote that is among the more divided of this group of elected officials, the council voted to make it the city's official policy not to invest in corporations going forward. In doing so, the council sideswiped a proposed strategy that would have moved the city's investment decisions behind closed doors—a prospect that made many commissioners and an overwhelming number of vocal audience members uncomfortable. Rather than wallow in acrimony, council decided to be done with corporate investments altogether. The vote means a number of things: •That the City of Portland's in no danger of putting money into companies like Nestlé, Wells Fargo, Walmart, Caterpillar, and sundry others that a group of citizen advisers have dubbed the "worst of the worst" in terms of corporate actors. Not long ago, the city created a "do-not-buy" list where it slapped companies it wanted nothing to do with (Walmart, Chevron, and Exxon all had homes there). But when a council-appointed Socially Responsible Investments Committee (SRIC) pressed council late last year to put nine more companies on the list, commissioners balked, worrying about the message that would have sent. Instead, the council made a temporary decision not to invest in corporations, which it formally enshrined today—partly because Saltzman was sick of talking about it. •It also means that Portland won't be taking a proactive stand against companies that do some objectionable things. Advocates for explicitly calling out certain corporations argue that those companies take a PR hit when a large city calls them out as toxic that's greater than any risk to their bottom line (see: Seattle pulling the plug on Wells Fargo). As SRIC member Hyung Nam told the Mercury recently: "It's not about the financial impact. It's about the public image that these corporations care about so much." Simply not investing in any corporate bonds—which was the city's standard operating procedure less than a decade ago—doesn't send that same message. •Portland is also going to lose out on some cash, though exactly how much isn't clear. City Treasurer Jennifer Cooperman said at the hearing that not investing in corporate securities could mean $3.5 million less in city coffers this fiscal year, and perhaps a larger hit next year. But that number is based on corporate bond returns versus lower performing US Treasury Bonds, Cooperman acknowledged to the Mercury after the hearing. That's a standard way of analyzing investment choices, Cooperman says, but the treasurer also acknowledged in a February memo that it is a "worst case." She wrote that other investments, like US Agency Bonds, are more lucrative, meaning the loss she spoke of at today's hearing isn't set in stone. Still, the city can probably expect to take some financial hit, which was a big reason why Mayor Ted Wheeler forcefully opposed eliminating corporate investments. "I really don't like the idea of completely getting out of corporate," said Wheeler, the former state treasurer, who rattled off a list of things that the lost money could pay for. "I just think they hit us too hard." Rather than divestment, which Wheeler called a "blunt instrument," he used a lengthy speech to advocate that people (and the city) make more ethical purchasing choices, and suggested that there are people who will advocate divesting from any company. "Do you use a Visa or Mastercard? Because if you do according to some you’re feeding the beast," Wheeler said. The mayor pretty clearly wanted to move ahead with the proposal he'd brought forward. It would have scrapped all public discussion about which companies the city should invest in, and instead used a secretive ratings system that evaluates companies on their environmental, social, and governmental practices. The city would have been legally prohibited from sharing those ratings or its rationales with citizens. Not a single person in the audience testified in favor. They called on the city to be a leader in social justice, suggesting companies' complicity in projects like the Dakota Access Pipe Line or funding private prisons needed to be highlighted. The most forceful testimony came from Katrina Scotto di Carlo, a founder of Supportland and member of the SRIC. She was angry that council had refused to accept a report her committee submitted last September. "I went through emotional battering on that committee," Scotto di Carlo said, speaking of the research she did into companies' bad practices. "I had to read about crap that I hope no one else in this room has to read about." She used the indentured servitude of fishermen in Southeast Asia as an example, and said her group had truly picked the worst nine companies it could find. "We only put nine on the list—that’s incredible," she said. "Unbelievable that you guys didn’t adopt the report." Council split assunder pretty quickly when it came time to decide. Commissioner Chloe Eudaly most clearly agreed with the activists on hand. She'd even tried to introduce amendments that would have explicitly put Nestle, Caterpillar, and the Bank of New York Mellon onto the do-not-buy list, and left leeway to add more. When Wheeler recently called for Portland to be a sanctuary city, Eudaly told him, "you said that Portland would be a beacon of hope and set the standard for the country. I would argue that we have another opportunity here to set another standard." Supporting the secretive investments system were Wheeler and Commissioner Amanda Fritz, who also was concerned about lost cash. Saltzman and Commissioner Nick Fish came down on the side of doing away with corporate investments entirely (though Fish made clear he was cool going the secret route)—a compromise Eudaly found she could live with. So there you have it! We're done with corporate investments—at least until next year, when the city is bound by state law to pass an investment policy again.

The 2016 estimate for total consumers within this retail trade area was 38,227 with an average household income of $64,907, according to Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. (TheRetailCoach / Courtesy map) Fort Morgan businesses draw from a "retail trade area" with a population of more than 38,000, according to the results of a retail analytics study commissioned by the city. The identified retail trade area is the geographical area where this community's businesses get about 85 percent of their business, explained Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. But of the $624 million in potential retail sales that trade area and its 38,000-plus customers could generate, the city is benefiting from an estimated $379 million in actual retail sales, according to Aaron Farmer from TheRetailCoach. He called the difference between the potential and actual retail sales the trade area's "leakage" or "gap." There was no surprise as to the source of that leakage, with people reporting that they were heading out of town to visit national chain restaurants and clothing stores that were not available in Fort Morgan, Farmer told the Fort Morgan City Council Tuesday night while delivering his company's retail study findings. "We know that quite a bit of retail dollars are leaving the community and heading west," he said. "You just don't have all of the retail, all of the restaurants that people leave town for." Advertisement The findings Farmer presented were based on gathering and sorting through many different kinds of data, all with a goal to "really get a feel for the market and really understand where are consumers coming from that are shopping and eating here, that are coming from outside of Fort Morgan," he told the council. "We know you've got that city limits population, that town limits population, that is eating, shopping here on a regular basis. But we also know you are getting people from outside the community. We call that the retail trade area." How that was determined may sound "a little scary" or " a little Big Brother-ish," Farmer said, "but I think you'll understand the use of this." TheRetailCoach did a "cell phone analysis," he said. "If you're shopping at Walmart or you're shopping downtown, you get a phone call, an email or a text. We're actually able to track your home address based off of that," Farmer said. "We're not selling the information or doing anything like that. We're just using it to understand where your consumers are coming from." He showed the council a "heat map" that indicated the number of people coming from various areas in and outside of Morgan County and who had shopped at Walmart in Fort Morgan at least one time over the last year. "We can look at specific times of the year or just lunch time," Farmer explained, and the contractor had created many other maps and reports about where and when people were shopping or visiting the city's retail stores or restaurants. "38,227 people are shopping in Fort Morgan on a regular basis," he said. "We realize you're getting people from outside of this area." Of those people, average household incomes were nearly $65,000 and average ages were 37 to 38, and that is only a couple of the types of data in Farmer's report. "What we've done is we've literally put together hundreds of pages of reports," he told the council. "Hundreds of pages of demographic information that a retail developer or site selector would be interested in." Farmer also had some advice for the city. "When it comes to recruiting retail, when it comes to even working with your existing businesses, forget about the city limits population," he said. "Retailers want to know where are those consumers coming from. Going forward, focus on that trade area population, which is almost 39,000." Further, there could be opportunities for the city with recruiting large, chain restaurants or clothing stores, he said. "There's about $23.5 million in clothing dollars that are leaving on a yearly basis," Farmer said. "Probably why we already have a clothing store interested in looking at the market is they see that." Similarly, the city was leaking almost $21 million spent at sit-down chain restaurants. "That number of almost $21 million in leakage is going to interest some of those casual sit-down restaurants," he said. But now begins the work of actually recruiting new businesses and meeting with the existing ones to look for opportunities for expansion or change, according to both Farmer and Fort Morgan Community Services/Economic Development Director Josh Miller. "We've been working with TheRetailCoach now since November," Miller said. "It's been helpful, as we look to the future and where we need to focus our attention in retail attraction specifically and what that might look like. Aaron's work thus far has generated a variety of reports for us that have proven helpful to better understand our market area, what our retail market looks like, what our opportunities are." "Having these specific dollar amounts to take to these retailers I think is going to help," Farmer told the council. TheRetailCoach will continue to work with the Fort Morgan Economic Development Department on recruitment, retention and more, according to both Farmer and Miller. "Really there's a couple ways this gap analysis, this leakage analysis can be used," Farmer explained. "Number one, it's to recruit businesses in, to recruit retailers that are not here into the market. We want to work with existing businesses. That's the other way it can be used. We're going to be having a meeting with existing businesses, downtown merchants and some others in the next few months. If there's an opportunity for an existing store here to expand their business or expand and carry different items or brands that people are buying, that's another way. The third is obviously entrepreneur-ism, somebody coming into the market and opening up a business." City Manager Jeff Wells pointed out that the goal was not to bring in businesses to compete with the existing ones already here, but to capture the leakage to businesses in other trade areas. The city's contract with TheRetailCoach is for at least two years from last October, with an option for a third year. The contractor's services are being funded both by Fort Morgan capital improvement dollars and a grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

IGD Retail recently noted Walmart India has confirmed plans to grow its cash and carry stores from 21 to 50 in the next three to five years, focusing on the cities in the north. Walmart India said half of its 50 stores will be located in Uttar, Pradesh and Uttarakhand. IGD said the northern area is an opportunity for Walmart India because its chief wholesale competitors Reliance and Metro AG have not yet penetrated the markets. Walmart India’s cash and carry business is wholesale in nature and the retailer in 2016 told Talk Business & Politics that business model would be the plan going forward. Early last year Walmart India announced 15 new cash and carry stores to be located in the country’s southern region. “Our commitment to the country is very deep and we are growing our footprints in India further by opening 50 more cash-and-carry stores in next few years across key focus states … Our development team is growing this store pipeline for last couple of years and we’re confident of continuing our contribution to the creation of thousands of skilled jobs, helpings kiranas, farmers & suppliers succeed through our cash & carry business,” a Walmart India spokesperson noted in an email. India has been somewhat of a troublesome market for Wal-Mart Stores despite being one of the fastest growing nations in the world and ripe with consumer demand. The retail giant invested into a partnership with Bharti in 2007 to begin establishing its wholesale cash and carry business and working to build supply chain capabilities. That partnership ended in 2015 and Walmart India has been cautious with expansion amid an ongoing investigation by the U.S. government for potential corruption allegations. Interest is growing agains as the Indian government begins to relax rules for food retailers by allowing 100% foreign direct investment in food products manufactured locally. “Walmart is interested in this business, but is hoping that a certain percentage of non-food items will also be included to make it economically viable. It is awaiting clarity on the food retail guidelines before committing,” noted IGD analysts. “There will be plenty of competitors in this segment if it chooses to enter this arena. Online players Flipkart, Amazon and Grofers have already sought government approval to operate in this category.” Walmart India released the following statement regarding the new rules for food retailers: “As we’ve said earlier, allowing 100% FDI in food retail is a very progressive step, but having a certain percentage of non-food items in this policy will make it economically viable.” Krish Iyer, Walmart India CEO, recently told the media recently the retailer is comfortable selling only “Made in India” products. He said even in Walmart’s Indian cash and carry business, imported items make up just 5% of the inventory.

Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations News Markeith Loyd News Markeith Loyd previously pulled gun on pregnant ex-girlfriend before fatal shooting, documents show New details emerge in Markeith Loyd's motive in killing ex-girlfriend New documents give insight into Markeith Loyd's motive behind killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. New documents give insight into Markeith Loyd's motive behind killing his pregnant ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon. Caitlin DoornbosContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Markeith Loyd had previously pulled a gun on his ex-girlfriend, Sade Dixon, before killing her and was upset because he thought she was cheating on him and smoking while pregnant, recently released court documents allege. The documents reveal further details about what led to the fatal shootings of Dixon and Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton, including information that Loyd and Clayton were in the same checkout line at Wal-Mart just before she was killed in January. Loyd is charged with first-degree murder in both cases. Dixon’s brother Ronald Stewart said the violence on Dec. 13 began when Loyd knocked on Dixon’s door, according to the documents released Tuesday. Dixon, 24, left the house to talk with Loyd for about 10 minutes before coming back inside. She later went back outside to speak to Loyd again. Stewart watched from inside as the two stood on opposite sides of the driveway and said Dixon “appeared frightened,” according to the documents. That’s when Stewart stepped outside and told Loyd and Dixon to separate. “Nah, nah, she ain’t going nowhere right now, she ain’t going nowhere. We got to talk about this,” Loyd told Stewart, according to the documents. “I can’t walk away from this situation, we got to talk about it.” Loyd, 41, told Stewart he was upset because he thought Dixon was cheating on him and smoking while pregnant, the documents show. The young woman also reported that Loyd had pulled a gun on her. “You want to tell them all that, but you don’t want to tell them that you had a gun to my head in the back yard of Mom’s house?” Dixon told Loyd, according to the documents. Dixon turned to walk back into the home, but Loyd pulled a firearm from his sweat-shirt pocket, loaded it and began firing. Loyd first shot Stewart, as Dixon hid between two pillars outside the house, according to the documents. Seven .40-caliber bullets hit Dixon, tearing through her chest, abdomen and foot. Dixon’s mother and younger brother ran outside to help Dixon and Stewart when they heard the shots fired. Loyd fired at them as he ran to his car and sped away, but neither was hurt. Stewart recovered from his wounds, but Dixon was later pronounced dead. A warrant was issued for Loyd’s arrest, and on Jan. 9, a witness approached Clayton outside a Wal-Mart on Princeton Street, where she had been shopping, to report seeing Loyd in the store. Incidentally, surveillance footage showed Loyd was in the same checkout line as Clayton moments before. Clayton called for backup, but before help could arrive, she saw Loyd push his shopping cart out of the store, according to the documents. “Lt. Clayton confronted [Loyd] and stated, ‘Get on the ground,’” the court documents said. “[Loyd] retreated behind one of the large pillars outside of the Wal-Mart entrance and drew his firearm.” The two circled the pillar, but when Clayton ended up on the street side of the pillar without cover, Loyd fired at her. She fired back at him after falling onto the pavement with a wounded arm, as Wal-Mart customers scrambled to get out of the way, according to the documents. Clayton, 42, was on her back when Loyd fired a fatal shot into her neck, according to the documents. He fled in his car and eluded police for more than a week as a massive manhunt ensued. Authorities caught him Jan. 17 at a home in the Carver Shores neighborhood, where they also found a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson firearm. Officials later determined it was the gun used to kill both Dixon and Clayton. State Attorney Brad King, who is prosecuting Loyd, filed the documents to argue that he should be allowed to use the firearm and shell casings from the crime scenes at trial to link both cases and prove in court that Loyd was the killer. “Because [Loyd] was not captured immediately following either murder, identity could become a valid defense,” King wrote in the documents. “If [Loyd] was identified as the shooter in the Dixon crimes and the gun used … was scientifically matched to the casings expelled at the Clayton crime scene, such evidence is highly relevant to prove that [Loyd] was the shooter in the Clayton homicide.” Loyd is expected in court for a hearing on Tuesday. He remains in the Orange County Jail without bond. cdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931 Caption Body cam footage reveals altercation ahead of Sanford shooting Sanford police on Friday released body cam footage of officers’ interactions with Allen Cashe and Latina Herring at a Wawa.

She was shopping at a Walmart in Billings while wearing a head scarf, her hijab, when someone told her that when Trump becomes president, she will need to leave the Big Sky State. Lane is a soldier in the U.S. Army studying sociology and criminal justice at MSU Billings. She told YPR’s Brie Ripley about one of the first times she felt unwanted in America for being Muslim.  Listen Listening... / Lane: The day after 9/11 I was on my way to the grocery store. It was turmoil. I used to wear a niqāb. Ripley: What’s that? Lane: Niqāb is face veil. I had on my hijab, which is the head cover. And I had the face veil on. And I’m on my way to the grocery store—Kroger at the time—it’s like in between the school and the library. And there’s a police car. And this is Cleveland. And he passes by really fast and you just hear the screech of the tires and he turns around and he comes back. And he pulls up, up onto the curb—and he stops me and he just has his gun up to me. And he just tells me—“stop, don’t move.” And he tells me to get down. So I’m on my knees. And then there’s another cop, another cop car comes. And he tells me, both of them, “Get down.” And they both have their guns up to me. And I’m like down on the ground, hands splayed. I’m like there, waiting. And they just want my ID and everything. Just because. And I’m there for a good hour to hour and a half for… what? Ripley: I’d be scared out of my mind. Lane: I wasn’t scared, I was angry. Ripley: Tell me more about that? Lane: Mainly because, I have had to deal with things like that most of my life. Not because of being Muslim, but because of being black. So it’s kind of just something you deal with. It’s sickening, but you deal with it.  Ripley: How do you feel around police officers in Billings, Montana? Lane: I know a lot of the police officers here. Some of them who are—who have been in the military, who I’ve actually worked with side by side. In Montana there’s like five—what is it? Like five degrees of separation here? Ripley: Totally. Lane: So you know, you know a lot of the people here. So you’re going to see someone you know through someone else. So, yeah. I like being here. You don’t have the issue of looking over your shoulder. Ripley: You feel respected. Lane: Exactly. And when I literally got here, they’re like, ‘Oh my gosh! You’re so beautiful!’ There’s love here. Ripley: So when you face ignorance or misunderstanding about your religion, how do you address it? Lane: Well I pretty much allow people to ask questions because the only stupid question is the one you don’t ask because your imagination is worse than anything that you don’t actually put out there. Because anything you’re thinking in your head is the biggest stupidest monster than what’s reality. Ripley: As a soldier sworn to protect the Constitution, is the Constitution threatened by people who practice Islam? Lane: No. No.  Ripley: Back in January, 31 people gave testimony in support of Senate Bill 97, also known as “the Sharia Law bill.” There are some folks in Montana who are really scared of Sharia law. As somebody who is Muslim, and in the army, do you believe that Montana state is at risk of threat of Sharia Law? Lane: See, this is—this is what people need to understand. For a Muslim, the first thing that we have to do, is we follow the law of the land that we live in. Period. They’re making up their own stuff in their head. Because they’re trying to fear monger, is what they’re doing. They’re trying to make a monster under the bed. They’re trying to start something that’s not there. They’re trying to make something look worse than what it is. Abena Lane is an American Muslim mother of five children. She’s the president of the Black Student Union and Vice President of the Veterans Club at Montana State University Billings where she studies sociology and criminal justice. She enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2005. The Republican-controlled legislature approved SB97 and sent it to the governor’s desk. Copyright 2017 KEMC-FM. To see more, visit KEMC-FM.

About 2 p.m. she left the salon and went back into the Wal-Mart where she shoplifted multiple items, according to the affidavit. Perez set off the store's anti-theft sensors about 2:30 p.m. before placing the stolen items in her car and walking back into the store to ask about her children. She has been charged with endangering a child, which is a state felony.  APD: Woman left children in hot car while she got her nails done, shoplifted: https://t.co/2Pt9C1cm3n pic.twitter.com/6fhp4IouJi— KVUE News (@KVUE) April 5, 2017 View Comments Tags Crime News Texas Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Check out this list of surprising things that add value to your property. KTRK Wednesday, April 05, 2017 05:13PM HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- Are you looking to sell your home? Here's a list of nine surprising things that add value to your property according to HAR.com. 1. Parks and Open Spaces Researchers in Oregon found homes within 1,500 ft. of a public park added about $1,200 in value. If your house is near a natural area, like a forest, it adds more than $10,000 to the value of your property. 2. Living Near a Walmart University of Chicago researchers found living within one mile of a Walmart could raise your home's value by 1 to 2 percent. Living within a half mile of a superstore can boost your property value by an additional 1 percent. RELATED: Historic Braeswood home for sale hides mysterious past of Houston socialite 3. Walkability Being able to walk out the door of your home and stroll to school, parks and restaurants can raise your property value between $4,000 and $34,000. That's according to a 2009 study by CEOs for Cities. 4. Accessory Dwelling Units Having a separate unit on your property, like a mother-in-law suite or garage apartment can increase your home's value by 25 to 34 percent. It also provides you with another source of rental income. 5. Community Gardens Research by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and NYU School of Law found having a community garden within 1,000 ft. of your home increased home values by 9.4 percent over five years. 6. Trees Trees are a sign of a well-established neighborhood. University of Washington researchers found mature trees in your yard increased value by 2 percent. Mature trees anywhere on your street increased value by 3 percent. Having mature trees in high-income neighborhoods increased home values from 10 to 15 percent. 7. Professional Sports Arenas According to researchers from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Alberta, a new pro-sports stadium within 2.5 miles of your home increases the value by more than $2,200. 8. Solar Panels A Department of Energy study found homes with solar panels sell for a $17,000 premium over those without them. Word of warning: a full solar panel system could cost up to $40,000 to install, so it may not be worth it in the long run. 9. Close to the Beach The Monterey Institute of International Studies found living within a mile of a beach with big waves can add about $106,000 to your home's value.

Debra Clayton An arrest video shows an officer kicking Loyd after he crawled out of a home where he'd been hiding Police said they used force against Loyd because he was resisting arrest, an allegation that Loyd denies  By Associated Press and Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.com Published: 07:54 EDT, 5 April 2017 | Updated: 16:35 EDT, 5 April 2017 e-mail 14 shares 1 View comments A suspect who is accused of murdering a Florida police officer was permanently blinded in one eye while ‘resisting’ arrest by her fellow officers, emails have confirmed.  Markeith Loyd, 41, was arrested January 17 after a week-long manhunt following the fatal shooting of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton.  An arrest video shows an officer kicking Loyd after he crawled out of a home where he'd been hiding.  Police say they used force because he was resisting arrest. The emails were obtained thanks to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Loyd, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Markeith Loyd (left at his most recent court appearance in February), 41, was arrested January 17 after a week-long manhunt following the fatal shooting of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton (right) The aerial surveillance shows a large contingent of police officers surrounding Loyd, who is on the ground (left). Police said they used force fearing that Loyd may be armed One email sent to Orlando Police Chief John Mina says surgery would leave Loyd blind in his left eye. '[Orlando Regional Medical Center] needed to perform surgery on his left eye and as a result the doctor said he will be permanently blind in his left eye,' Lt. Dan Brady wrote.  'This was as a result of the injuries Loyd received during his response to resistance.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'I disagree with my father and he knows it': Ivanka Trump... Kendall Jenner hides her face at the airport after Pepsi... Share this article Share Governor Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor after Orlando-area State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced she wouldn't seek the death penalty.  The special prosecutor, State Attorney Brad King, filed notice of intent to seek the death penalty. Video of Loyd being brought out of police headquarters emerged showing his bloodied face The force used against him by police left Loyd with a fractured eye socket and a broken jaw Loyd is accused of shooting dead Clayton on January 9 outside a Walmart as she tried to apprehend him over the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon on December 13. A second law enforcement officer, Orange County Sheriff's Deputy First Class Norman Lewis, was killed in a motorcycle crash after joining the massive manhunt. Police said Loyd resisted arrest and that force was used to bring him. Loyd, who was hospitalized due to injuries sustained in his arrest, was pictured in his mugshot with a battered face and a bandage over his eye. Police helicopter footage shows Loyd crawling from the home on his stomach before officers surround him and appear to kick him in the head several times. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said a use of force investigation is underway over the arrest.  He said Loyd was wearing body armor at the time and officers were concerned he could have been hiding something inside. Loyd is accused of shooting dead Clayton on January 9 outside a Walmart as she tried to apprehend him over the murder of his pregnant ex-girlfriend Sade Dixon (left) on December 13 Loyd appeared with his eye bandaged and flanked by two police officers in an Orlando courtroom in January to face the charges where he screamed 'f*** you' at the judge Mina said Loyd resisted arrest by not putting his hands behind his back. He added that they found a large bag of ammunition beneath him. Loyd appeared with his eye bandaged and flanked by two police officers in an Orlando courtroom in January to face the charges where he screamed 'f*** you' at the judge. 'They done took my eye, broke my nose, broke my jaw,' Loyd complained, swearing as he described crawling out to the road to be arrested. He claims he didn't resist arrest. 'I crawled out to the mother*****g road, so how did I resist?' he said. 'I didn't resist s***. They just did that s*** and tried to hide it from the news people, but I'm here right now.' Loyd has been charged with first-degree murder and the unlawful killing of an unborn child in the death of Dixon. He was also charged with resisting arrest, though he denies this. That brings Loyd's total charges to 11 in relation to the two deaths, including murder of a law enforcement officer and attempted first-degree murder with a firearm of a law enforcement officer.   Read more: Markeith Loyd emails to police chief confirm blindness in one eye - Orlando Sentinel Share or comment on this article e-mail 14 shares Most watched News videos Driving tutor caught shouting and swearing at kids on horseback Shocking video shows 'Spice zombies' frozen by illegal drug Disturbing footage of attempted child abduction in Philadelphia Police officer stops press conference to arrest man Shocking video shows effects of stomach acid mixed with coke Bus driver KICKS passenger after throwing him off the bus Kendall Jenner stars in Pepsi's 'Live for Now Moments Anthem' ad Semi-decapitated teen tells police his shocking attack story Touching moment grieving mum sees robin on her son's grave Couple caught getting frisky in university building Horrific moment bullfighter is gored by 1,000lb bull in Madrid Heston Blumenthal confuses The Project desk with awkward interview Widower staying with his own daughter, 13, is accused of...

Kendall's Pepsi ad with police, protesters may not be choice of online generation PepsiCo, Walmart, Starbucks suspend all YouTube ads over offensive content Pepsi on Wednesday pulled an ad after it was widely mocked and criticized for appearing to trivialize protests for social justice causes. "Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding," the company said. "Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize." It said it was "removing the content and halting any further rollout." Pepsi ad with Kendall Jenner, police and protesters sparks criticism The ad shows Kendall Jenner, a member of the Keeping Up With the Kardashians reality TV family, stepping away from a modeling shoot to join a crowd of smiling, young protesters. The protesters cheer after Jenner hands a can of Pepsi to a police officer, who takes a sip. 'The moments that make us feel alive' PepsiCo Inc. had previously said the ad was created by its in-house team and that it would "be seen globally across TV and digital" platforms. It initially described the spot as featuring "multiple lives, stories and emotional connections that show passion, joy, unbound and uninhibited moments. No matter the occasion, big or small, these are the moments that make us feel alive." That description was also derided on social media. The Purchase, New York, company had stood by the ad late Tuesday. But on Wednesday, it was apologizing to Jenner for putting her "in this position." Critics say the image of Jenner handing the officer a Pepsi evoked a photo of Black Lives Matter protester Ieshia Evans approaching an officer at a demonstration in Baton Rouge last year. Lone activist Ieshia Evans stands her ground while offering her hands for arrest as she is charged by riot police during a protest against police brutality outside the Baton Rouge Police Department in the U.S. state of Louisiana, on July 9, 2016. (Jonathan Bachman/Reuters) Others criticized the protesters' signs for being comically innocuous, with messages like "Join the Conversation" and heart and peace signs. The website Gothamist expressed a common sentiment online in calling the ad "gloriously tone-deaf." Among those mocking the ad was Bernice King, who tweeted a photo of her father, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., being confronted by a police officer at a protest march. "If only Daddy would have known about the power of Pepsi," the tweet said. If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi. pic.twitter.com/FA6JPrY72V— @BerniceKing Larry Chiagouris, a professor of marketing at Pace University in New York, said that the backlash was in part because Pepsi was a couple years "late to the party" with its message about unity, making its ad seem exploitive. Still, he also noted that the fallout wouldn't necessarily be that damaging, since a lot of the negative sentiment expressed on social media is "easily washed away overnight." It isn't the first time PepsiCo has backpedaled and apologized for an ad. In 2013, it pulled a Mountain Dew ad that was criticized for portraying racial stereotypes and appearing to make light of violence toward women. It pulled that ad from online channels, and said it was never intended to run on TV. © The Associated Press, 2017 Report Typo or Error Send Feedback To encourage thoughtful and respectful conversations, first and last names will appear with each submission to CBC/Radio-Canada's online communities (except in children and youth-oriented communities).

Reports have emerged that employees in over a dozen plants knowingly packed rancid meat, covering up the smell with acid, slabs of which were then sold on to schools and Walmart. - Advertisement - All this happened not in the U.S., though, but in Brazil, headquarters to meatpacking giant JBS. Named for its founder, Jose Batista Sobrinho, the company turns over almost as much as the next three largest U.S. beef producers--Tyson, Cargill, and National Beef--combined. In response, Egypt has already banned Brazilian beef, and U.S. Senator John Tester (D-Montana) recently introduced legislation to prevent Brazilian beef from entering into the country, even as JBS suspended meat production at 33 of its 36 Brazilian meatpacking plants. But choosing "America First" for your steak misses two far larger points. The Brazilian giant is simply striving to adopt ideas from, and buy out companies in, the U.S. meat industry. Pilgrim's, Cargill's pork business and Smithfield's beef operation have been acquired by what Bloomberg once called the world's second largest packaged food company (behind Nestle'). And even if you could stop the import of dodgy sausage, you still couldn't avoid the bigger planetary impact of the beef industry, because it's airborne. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), meat and dairy production alone now generates more greenhouse gas emissions than all the world's transport combined. - Advertisement - Much of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by industrial livestock occur indirectly, through the production of grains to feed to animals that then get fed to humans. In 2010, about one-third of all cereals on Earth went to animal feed, and the FAO predicts this figure will reach 50 percent by 2050. More feed means more land under cultivation. And feed crops like soybean, maize, and sorghum are usually grown with chemical fertilizers, themselves another potent source of greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, consumption is soaring, made possible by widespread marketing and producing meat that's cheap to buy--even if those low prices are made possible through dangerous and poorly paid jobs, lax environmental practices, corporate subsidies, and dreadful living conditions for animals. If current trends continue, the FAO predicts world meat consumption will grow a further 76 percent by 2050. If, on the other hand, people kept their level of meat consumption to the World Health Organization's recommended guidelines, the world could reduce 40 percent of all current greenhouse gas emissions. Unsurprisingly, this advice hasn't been well received by the meat, fertilizer, pesticide, and processing industries. Industrial meat concerns blasted the FAO after they put out a report in 2006 on the role of livestock in the climate crisis. "You wouldn't believe how much we were attacked," said Samuel Jutzi, director of the animal production and health division this UN agency. The FAO soon buckled under the pressure and agreed to establish a partnership with the meat industry's main lobby groups and shifted the focus of its work accordingly. Canadian academic Tony Weis has a term for what's happening here: the world's diet, food system, and food policy are being "meatified." The corporations doing it are increasingly based in the global South, where most of the world's future industrial meat eaters live, and those firms are doing roaring business. For example, a recent report by GRAIN shows that JBS is also the world's largest poultry producer. The world's largest pork producer is the Chinese WH Group, and France's Lactalis Group is the world's largest dairy producer. These firms, together with more-established U.S. and European ones, work hard to increase their control over the market: They blunt domestic government attempts to regulate them, they spur demand across the world, and they destroy the livestock practices of small-scale farmers in the process. Propping Up the Meat Market When Germany drafted guidelines to reduce meat consumption, demonstrating that a 50 percent cut by 2030 would be "crucial to climate protection," the industry lobbied. Hard. By the November 2016 launch date, the country's climate change plan had been gutted, and stripped of any reference at all to greenhouse gases in the agriculture sector. Similar stories can be told of U.S. efforts and those, predictably, in Brazil. - Advertisement - Despite industry opposition to certain kinds of regulation, they're very happy to suck at the teat of government subsidy. In 2013, OECD countries dished out $53 billion to livestock producers, with the EU paying $731 million to its cattle industry alone The same year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid more than $500 million to just 62 producers (starting with Tyson Foods) in order to get meat and dairy on school meal trays, compared to just a fraction of that to fruit and vegetable suppliers. But the big guns in the industry's arsenal are "free trade" agreements. These trade deals artificially prop up production and consumption by promoting the dumping of cheap meat and dairy into poor countries' economies. They include clauses that eliminate protections for local farmers from foreign competitors. They also make it illegal to grant preference to local suppliers or products and they make government regulations subject to investor-state dispute settlement under which a foreign company can sue governments that adopt social or environmental legislation that they think undermines their profits.

Soy, used as a primary food, can feed 7-9 times more people ith superior nutrition than soy used as feedstock, where it takes 7-9 equivalent servings to produce a serving of toxic beef. Even "pasture fed" (2.7%) is allowed up to 20% of "forage," which means GMO-grown alfalfa. Only organic meat is toxin free, but it is so expensive that few can afford it as a staple part of their diet. This means that switching to a plant-based diet, which all major diet studies prove leads to superior health and longer life (see China study, Oxford Study, and Loma Linda studies) saves 70-90% of land, water, and fossil fuels (used to grow feedstock), as well as decreasing the dangerous deforestation for feedstock and pasture (and burned out in 10 years), which is increasing global warming. Meat consumption is heavily subsidized (as with corn subsidies, etc) and would use 75% more land, water, and fossil fuels to produce than if the corn and soy were used as primary foods. Meat consumption is unsustainable, and not only because it wastes precious resources in a world where millions are starving, but because it is responsible for deforestation for pasture and feedstock production, which burns out in 10 years, leaving deserts where vibrant jungles once thrived. Reducing or eliminating meet will benefit your health, the eco-system, slow down global warming, free up food for the starving, and cost much less. Organic tempeh or tofu, more healthy than 99.7% of meat on the market, costs less than the cheapest and most toxic beef. It also saves 75% of our limited resources...and as a bonus, saves the lives of billions of innnocent creatures killed to supply our addiction to meat. This is a critical way to drop out of the violence universe, with the justification for killing animals being used to justify mass murder of human beings, as subhuman, animals, parasites, vermin, etc. Do yourself and the world a favor and switch to a plant-based diet, preferably organic. You will feel better both physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Mother earth will thank you as will the animal kingdom we share this earth with.

Now, if only others would as well. Yes, it is a battle and I am truly surprised how difficult people find giving up meat and dairy products. I am ashamed to admit how easy it was for me. Of course animal suffering was the selling point. I could not eat anything which I believe causes suffering. I hope someone doesn't respond to this by saying that plants suffer as well. To that I answer - then its a matter of who or what suffers more - animals or plants? For me that is a no brainer, but an even better argument for relying on plants is that if you believe in the Bible - God Himself gave our first parents a vegan diet.

They obviously don't care about their health either. I believe in what I consider this truism- "We kill the animals and they kill us." This fear never led me to become vegan but farm animal cruelty did. I am grateful to God that I care enough for animals that I don't eat them. I don't even want dairy which causes so many thousands and thousand of cows to stand in long dairy lines ad infinatum till they too are made into hamburgers and steaks. They also are kept impregnated but they never get to enjoy their progeny who are whisked from them shortly after birth. How cruel to these mothers. Their male calves are often placed in tight crates to be sold for veal. Their female calves will soon join their mothers on the dairy line. Do you really need milk and milk products that badly? We vegans don't need them at all. We use soy milk and soy products gratefully and happily.

Meat, as a diet for the planet, is unsustainable and destructive. Even those who reduce meat consumption once a weak can be part of the healing process.

Insiders said the retailer is laying off about 10% of its ISD workforce over the next few days. The layoffs at ISD in Bentonville began this week and are expected to continue through the month. Impacted employees said they received an email to report to a training room on Tuesday (April 4) where they were told their jobs were being eliminated in the company’s efforts to restructure. The layoffs appear to be across-the-board and include officers. Wal-Mart corporate spokesman Randy Hargrove told Talk Business & Politics-Northwest Arkansas Business Journal they were not targeted at older or longer-term employees – as was often suggested on social media – but based on the company’s ongoing efforts to streamline operations. “As we said in January, to fuel our growth and our investments we have to manage our costs and our capital decisions with discipline. This means we will continue to find ways to operate more efficiently and effectively, true to our cost-conscious heritage. In order to achieve this, from time to time you’ll see the company eliminate positions in an effort to stay lean and fast. In some areas, we’ll invest in new positions but in other cases, we’ll operate more efficiently and work to change our processes and become more digital to change the work itself,” Hargrove said on Wednesday. Impacted employees said they will remain on the payroll for 60 days and may apply for other jobs with the retailer. After the 60 days, a severance package will be provided to those who have not found other jobs. Insiders told Talk Business & Politics-Northwest Arkansas Business Journal that within the ISD division, the project management team took the biggest hit. Other jobs are being outsourced to a third-party vendor based in India which already does business with Walmart ISD. Still other jobs are being reduced from full-time to part-time and posted as temporary positions. “Outsourced/offshored that you’ve been told is not correct … Also, if anything, our focus is on having a higher ratio of full-time associates doing actual engineering and software development, which gets back to the point I mentioned about looking at the business and investing in areas as necessary,” Hargrove said. Walmart U.S. eCommerce CEO Marc Lore announced a restructuring of the division on Jan. 31, which impacted around 200 division jobs. The jobs cut this week are on top of that announcement, and is on top of the 1,000 corporate jobs slashed by the retailer prior to Jan. 31. At the time of the corporate cuts, Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon said, “To deliver the changes we ultimately want customers to see on the outside, we have to change on the inside. We need more speed and less bureaucracy. We need lower costs.” Sam’s Club is also streamlining its home office personnel with meetings being held Wednesday (April 5) and Thursday. Sam’s also eliminated all of its club auditors this week.

We like this definition. Women In Trucking Association recently held its eighth annual Salute to Women Behind the Wheel to honor female professional drivers. Nearly 400 people attended the event at the Kentucky Exposition Center in conjunction with the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky. Plover, WI (PRWEB) April 05, 2017 The Women In Trucking (WIT) Association’s annual “Salute to Women Behind the Wheel” recently honored 169 female professional drivers at its 8th annual celebration at the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky. These women, with nearly 2,700 collective years of driving, were honored for their service as pioneers in the trucking industry. Six women were recognized for driving careers spanning forty years or more! The room at the Kentucky Exposition Center was brimming with these female CDL holders in their red WIT shirts and the nearly 200 friends and family members cheering them on. Daphne Jefferson, Deputy Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration addressed the group and thanked them for their role as pioneers. She talked about her ride-along with two female drivers and what she learned from the view of a tractor-trailer window. Ann Dyer, Senior Director, Regional Transportation for Walmart Stores, Inc. gave the keynote address and told about traveling with her mother, a professional driver, when she was a young girl, and the challenges faced by female drivers in the past. Dyer also introduced Carol Nixon, a WIT member of the month, who recently donated a kidney to a fellow driver’s husband. WIT’s President and CEO Ellen Voie welcomed the group and reviewed the recent accomplishments of the nonprofit organization, including the Girl Scout Transportation Patch, ride-alongs with regulators and elected officials, the WIT app, WIT index, truck stop rating directory, and the group’s work on truck cab design and ergonomics. Other recognition programs include the Distinguished Woman in Logistics, the Influential Woman in Trucking and the recently expanded WIT Image Team. Voie promised to fulfill her dream of providing a female truck driver doll in the near future. A highlight of the event was the announcement by Jim Stevenson, Director of National Accounts for Arrow Truck Sales, who handed Voie the keys to a late model Volvo tractor Arrow is donating to a lucky WIT member who will win the tractor at next year’s Salute to Women Behind the Wheel. The celebration included music by Jayne Denham, an award winning singer and song writer from Australia. The crowd enjoyed dark and milk chocolate fountains and a huge truck-shaped cake. The female drivers won door prizes including a $500 gift card, and five $100 gift cards. The Women In Trucking Scholarship foundation gave away numerous prizes as well while raising nearly $2,000 in donations from the attendees. The event included the annual group photo of the women in their WIT red t-shirts and ended with the distribution of goodie bags filled with items from the event sponsors. Walmart Transportation won the driver participation award for having twenty-one of their female professional drivers present at the event. Next year’s Salute to Women Behind the Wheel will be held March 24th. All female professional drivers are welcome to participate and need not be members of the association.

Their parents were dead and an infant sibling was unresponsive in frigid water miles away as six children fled in terror from their burning home. Residents have united in the days that have followed to show their support for the family, and the outpouring has been immense in scope and compassion. From such grief and heartbreak has come towering heroism, both on the part of emergency personnel as well as from the Edwardsville-Glen Carbon community.   After escaping their burning home that morning, some of the children ran to a nearby Walmart while others went to a neighbor’s house. Surveillance video showed an SUV pulling away from the house and flames coming from the residence early that morning. Police would later find Justin Campbell, 37, dead of a gunshot wound inside the house.   At about 5:30 a.m., Highland emergency services received a call that a vehicle was submerged in Silver Lake.   Todd Zobrist of the Highland Emergency Response team was a first responder to the 911 call about the vehicle. As the situation unfolded, Zobrist ultimately placed his own life in extreme peril to save the life of an infant child he discovered inside the vehicle. When Zobrist arrived at the lake, he found the vehicle submerged in the lake about 100 feet from the shoreline. To determine whether or not there was anyone inside, he dove into the bone-chilling water and swam to it. The air temperature was below freezing and the chilly lake waters were about 45 degrees.  “I had to make a quick assessment,” Zobrist said. “My idea was to swim out, make sure the car was empty, then come back.”   Muscles and body functions react immediately to water that cold, and human survival becomes jeopardized after 10 minutes. The driver’s window was open and Zobrist quickly swept his arm through the car to determine if anyone was in it, working rapidly in the excruciating cold. “I tried opening the door and couldn’t,” he said. “Then I saw purple and blue hands and feet in the water. I thought it was a doll at first.” Upon realizing it was a baby in the water, Zobrist extracted the child and began CPR on him on top of the vehicle’s roof, performing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and using his fingers to do chest compressions. As the child began to revive, Zobrist realized he was approaching the limits of his own capacity and was dangerously close to succumbing to hypothermia. “I realized I was getting into trouble myself,” he said. “The police on the shore had called for a boat and were shouting to just stay there, but I couldn’t. It was too cold.”  Zobrist then swam to shore on his back, carrying the child above the freezing water.   The baby boy was taken to the hospital and is expected to recover. After handing the baby off to police officers on shore, Zobrist himself spent an hour and a half in the hospital emergency room being treated for exposure.   Later that morning, the body of Cristy Campbell, 32, was recovered from the lake. Brian Wilson, Highland EMS chief, said Zobrist’s actions epitomize the image of firefighters and paramedics and their dedication to the job. “There had to be a lot of independent decision-making in a very short period of time,” he said. “You can’t write policy to address a situation like that.” Wilson explained he has been involved in firefighting and emergency services for 40 years and that this was one of the most courageous acts he has seen.  “I’ve seen a lot of rescues over the years,” he said. “This one was in the top five.” Zobrist, a lifelong native of the community, lives in the area with his wife and two sons. He has been a paramedic with the Highland Emergency Services team for eight years. The selfless demonstration of courage on the part of this paramedic reflected his own training and values, as well as the organization as a whole. Leaders in the community immediately recognized Zobrist’s actions for the extreme heroism he demonstrated. Glen Carbon Mayor Rob Jackstadt praised Zobrist.  “(He) is a real hero,” he said. “Sometimes the word hero is thrown around to try to describe some person who may just be doing his or her job as trained. In this case with Mr. Zobrist, however, he went above and beyond the call of duty to jump in those frigid waters and to save that baby. He risked his own life to save that baby. He is the definition of a true hero.” U.S. Rep. John Shimkus recognized the actions in a statement.  “Todd was the first to arrive on the scene after receiving a call of a vehicle in Silver Lake with a person possibly inside,” he said. “I would like to commend Todd for his heroic and life-saving actions. It’s a great tribute to Southern Illinois.” Law enforcement officials also acknowledged the extraordinary nature of Zobrist’s actions.  “If there is something good that can come of this, it’s that Todd Zobrist, in my opinion, is a hero,” Madison County Sheriff John Lakin said.  The response of the community to these events has been nothing short of heroic itself. Numerous efforts have resulted in the collection of articles and funds for the family.  “As always, the Glen Carbon community was generous, caring and responsive,” Jackstadt observed. Melissa Maples, assistant manager at the Glen Carbon Walmart, said the event had a direct impact on store employees because some of the children fled there that morning and store employees called 911.  “Everybody in the store has been affected,” she said. “Our associates gave the kids clothing and food and sat with them to keep them calm.” The store collected items for the family in the days following the event. Toiletries, diapers, clothing and toys were dropped off during an enormous response by the community.  “We collected 32 grocery carts of goods between Friday and Sunday of that week,” Maples said. “Associates are volunteering to come in during their time off to help sort and organize the items.” The Bank of Edwardsville is serving as one of the collection points for monetary donations for the family. Brian Yarbrough, the bank’s communications and community relations coordinator, said residents can come in to any Bank of Edwardsville location to make donations to an account for the family. “We have employees who live in that area,” Yarbrough said. “It’s a personal connection.”  He went on to note the extent of the public’s response.  “The community is just really coming together for this,” he said. The Little Tigers junior football club conducted an extensive collection drive for the family. Eddie Lowry, president of the organization, said the response was overwhelming. “This was a natural extension of our organization’s purpose,” he said. “Our purpose is not just teaching kids football but also how to serve the community and be a good citizen.” Lowry noted five of the Campbell children had been involved in the Little Tigers, so the organization has a close connection to the situation. He said on the Friday evening they did the collections, cars were lined up all the way down Tiger Drive bringing goods.  “We filled three storage units at one location and another storage unit at another location in addition to a 22-foot box trailer,” he said.  He noted the efforts that evening were assisted by the junior and high school football team as well as the wrestling club. He said items included diapers, wipes, toiletry items, soap, shampoo, clothes and toys.  “We really appreciate the outpouring of generosity,” he said. “It’s not surprising, but it is still amazing to see the number of people who came out to help.” Little Tigers is still accepting financial donations for the family. People can go to littletigersfootball.com where they will find a “click here to donate funds online” button. Lowry said all financial donations are being directed to the account the Bank of Edwardsville has set up. Kids Club Child Development Center has raised more than $2,000 in cash and gift cards as well as toys, clothes and other supplies for the family. Director Renee Atwood said their connection with the family is personal. “Six of the children have attended the center here,” she said.  “We were all so heartsick when we heard the news.” Atwood said the center is still taking donations.  “The need is not just now,” she emphasized. “They will need support for years to come.” Anyone wanting to make donations through the Kids Club can call them at (618) 656-1600 or drop goods off at their location at Five 157 Center in Edwardsville. The Country Meadows Homeowners Association also conducted a collections drive. Their Facebook page reports they collected more than $800 cash and some $2,000 in gift cards for the family, along with large amounts of clothing and gifts.  Edison’s Entertainment Complex in Edwardsville hosted a special benefit event March 25. In addition to games and entertainment inside the complex, bounce houses and inflatable play areas were brought to the facility. Edison’s donated half of every $16 admission fee to the family. Owner Matt McSparin said the business did not have a specific connection with the Campbell family but felt it was something they should do for the community and for the family. Edison’s also collected cash and item donations during the week. Volunteers involved in efforts across the community emphasize that at this point, the family needs financial and gift card donations as enough materials have been received. A GoFundMe page for the family has raised approximately $17,000. Justin’s parents have filed for guardianship of their grandchildren, and a court hearing is scheduled for next month. gofundme.com/w9q78-campbell-children littletigersfootball.com Follow AdVantage News on Facebook and Twitter Tags Glen Carbon featured by Frank Prager April 5, 2017 3:00 AM Event Calendar April Volunteer Opportunity Volunteer at CFC Apr 6, 2017 Crisis Food Center Religion & Spirituality Tickets On Sale: 19th Annual Congressional Prayer Breakfast Apr 6, 2017 6:00 AM - 11:00 PM Gateway Center Meeting Office Hours Apr 6, 2017 8:00 AM Alton City Hall Class Fitness Health & Wellness Stretch & Move Classes Apr 6, 2017 8:00 AM Main Street Community Center Health & Wellness FREE CONFIDENTIAL WALK-IN HIV Apr 6, 2017 9:00 AM - 3:00 PM MadCAP Meeting Church Women United Meetings Apr 6, 2017 9:30 AM St. John United Church of Christ Leisure & Recreation Story Time Apr 6, 2017 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM Six Mile Regional Library Yoga Yoga @ Senior Services Plus Apr 6, 2017 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM Senior Services Plus Education & Learning For Women Only Religion & Spirituality Bible Study Group Apr 6, 2017 12:00 PM Women’s Ministry Center Charity & Fundraisers Free Clothes Closet: every Thursday!

God intended. What follows are musings that might have occurred between busting caps for Christ. Or maybe this is all from the Russians. I feel unmasked. When’s that medical marijuana become available? • During this 91st General Assembly of Arkansas legislators, we have again been reminded of the forces that continue to be powerful in this state. They are the SEC, NRA, and GOD. And not always in that order. Forces not so powerful continue to be the FOIA and YOU. Regnat Populus, my ass. • Tyson Foods CEO Tom Hayes recently said the future of food could be meatless. Yep, meatless. We’ll all be eating cricketburgers. How many crickets can one grow in a converted chicken house? 500,000? That number of crickets cricketing would be loud. Am assuming Hayes didn’t mean we’ll go meatless any time this century. A meatless Tyson is hard to fathom. That would be like a white trash free Wal-Mart, or a consistently nationally competitive Razorback football program, or a cleavage-free Hooters. Societies do evolve, however. Hayes may be ahead of his time. But probably not, because, well, bacon. • Of the many reasons why Sam Walton was a retail genius, putting clear “Enter” and “Exit” signs on his stores must be one of them. Nowadays such signage must be considered a suggestion, if not a dare. “In Through the Out Door” was a Zeppelin album title, not a recommendation for retail rebellion. Also, if you bring a child to Wal-Mart, please don’t let your germ wagon touch all the door handles in the frozen food section. And the middle of the aisle is not a place for a 15-minute high school or family reunion. Get your bacon, Ruffles and Great Value bean dip and keep moving. • About the effort by the Arkansas Legislature to pass a bill allowing guns on university campuses, there appears to be no truth to the rumor that the bill was amended to prevent the Razorback football team from using the shotgun or pistol formations. Not that either have proven consistent at hitting a target. • It seems every legislative session there is a push to make something the official state whatever-it-is. Milk is our official state beverage. We have official dirt. Dirt. It’s “Stuttgart” dirt, which is mostly good for growing crops and large areas of poverty. This year we have an official state dinosaur. And no, smartass, it’s not the Democratic Party of Arkansas. It’s something-something-saurus, I think. Our august gaggle of 100 men and women elected to the Arkansas House also this year approved a resolution – a resolution is not official, wink-wink – to make the Holy Bible the official state book. Again, the resolution is non-binding – like the state and U.S. Constitution in the minds of some Arkansas lawmakers when it comes to social legislation. If we can make dirt official, nothing is off limits. Here are some other “official” ideas. Official state pastime: Posting prayer requests on Facebook. “Cousin Donnie got a daughter getting married. He’s hoping to win enough money in the chamber’s bass tournament to get her a dress. The one she wore for that no-account second husband don’t fit no more, and she needs something different to cover up them tattoos she got with her third husband. Needing prayers that Donnie gets out of jail in time to make the fishing tournament.” Official state truck: The Ford owned by Sam Walton. Official state car: One of the vehicles driven by Mark Martin. The one that made only left  turns. At high speeds. Not anything driven by the constitutional officer of the same name who sometimes lives in Little Rock. Official state meat: Bacon. Real bacon. Official state bird: The Mockingbird is soooooo yesterday. Let’s go with the Cash bird. The Dirtius Dyess Digitidae. A rare sighting can be found at this link. Official state obsession. List of choices include: Guns; tax cuts; curbing civil liberties and making government less transparent in a hoped-for trade-off for more societal security; more guns in case that societal security thing doesn’t work out; bathrooms without urinals and who should or shouldn’t be traipsing through bathrooms without urinals. And designating stuff and people and animals with official stateification.

Home Tools Solano News Community News and Views US / World Opinion Features Entertainment Sports Business Real Estate Obituaries Gallery Classifieds 7,878 123 FAIRFIELD-SUISUN, CALIFORNIA Crime-courts Woman’s memory, testimony about father of her children go blank By Jess Sullivan From page A4 | April 06, 2017 FAIRFIELD — A 25-year-old Vacaville ex-con was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on four felony charges for what police said were two attacks on the mother of his two children. Ramon Garcia Jr. has pleaded not guilty to making threats and assault for what police said happened at his mother’s Brown Street apartment Sept. 1, 2016. Garcia has also pleaded not guilty to domestic violence and false imprisonment charges for what reportedly happened two months later on the morning of Dec. 12 in the parking lot of the Walmart in Dixon. The mother of Garcia’s children took the witness stand Wednesday for Garcia’s hearing. She testified she could not recall telling Vacaville police about Garcia pointing a gun at her and threatening to shoot her as she and Garcia sat in her car with her 2-year-old nephew just a few feet away. She testified she could not recall being slapped by Garcia in the apartment while their two young children and his mother were watching nearby. Nor could she recall turning over to Vacaville police the gun he reportedly hid in a diaper bag. Nor could she recall a phone call from Garcia a short time later, overheard by police, directing her to bring the gun back to the apartment. The woman testified that she could not recall being confronted by Garcia at the Walmart. She testified she could not recall Garcia punching her in the face before he grabbed her and tried dragging her to his car in the parking lot. However, she did acknowledge that she is the person pictured in a Dixon police photo showing her injured face shortly after officers responded to her panicked 911 call. Vacaville and Dixon police officers also testified at the hearing, filling in the gaps about what police said the woman had described for them about the pair of disputes with Garcia. Garcia, locked up since December with bail set at more than $100,000, is scheduled to be arraigned April 21. Reach Jess Sullivan at 427-6919 or [email protected] .

The banksters are back Posted on April 6, 2017April 4, 2017 by GS Early Views: 11 0 Shares It should come as no surprise that a guy from New York City, who has run a major global real estate development business, knows more than a few well-placed bankers. And when that guy becomes president of the United States, it’s his chance to give them their due. Now, before you get your hackles up, this isn’t a Trump-bashing piece. All presidents come to Washington and end up helping their state’s businesses. Reagan’s defense and anti-ballistic missile defense system build up helped many of the aerospace companies and computer firms in his home state of California. Clinton helped make Tyson Foods one of the biggest chicken producers in the world. And Wal-mart was also a big beneficiary of Clinton largesse. So it comes as no surprise that Wall Street has unpacked its bags on Pennsylvania Avenue. Like the former CIO of Goldman Sachs as Treasury secretary. Lose the middlemen Still in denial about the bankers having a heyday in D.C. as well as NYC? Here are the six-month returns of some of the top banksters that ushered in the financial crisis and were bailed out by you and me: Goldman Sachs: 44 percent JPMorgan Chase: 34 percent Wells Fargo: 27 percent Morgan Stanley: 36 percent Citigroup: 29 percent The S&P 500: 9 percent These big banks have outperformed the broad market three to five fold since the election. And it’s no coincidence. But this isn’t about morality. It’s about business. Actually, I’m kind of glad we’ve gotten rid of some of the ossified political hacks that were the middlemen for their corporate overlords and now we’re dealing directly with the overlords. At least it’s a change of pace. Investing is about performance. It’s about understanding what’s happening, regardless of your politics or desires and objectively observing what is going on. And then finding the opportunity there. That’s what I’m doing here. Do I like the debt-driven culture these banks have promoted? No. Are they a buying opportunity? Yes. But I think there is a better place to go with your investment dollars in this sector. Regional banks. Why regional banks? Because now that the banks are on their feet again and regulations will be in limbo for years to come, they have the chance to start blowing up the next big bubble. And I’m guessing that will be consolidating all the healthy, conservative regional and local banks. You see, the smaller banks weren’t the ones that caused the financial meltdown. They weren’t the ones lending to credit risks on one side of the trade while bundling those risks, selling them off and then shorting them on the other. Regional banks lend to local businesses, homeowners and individuals. They don’t have an arbitrage desk or a trading division. They make money the old way — pennies on the dollar, over and over again. For the “banksters,” as Bob Livingston calls them, they represent piggy banks full of responsible cash that will help their balance sheets (and stocks). It will also help the big boys leverage those assets into more trading money for their institutional side. Remember, the big banks cut their trading operations significantly once the bottom fell out of the global economy. But those days are gone and it’s back to business as usual, better business than usual. This is also a great opportunity to consolidate the banking landscape. If they gobble up enough smaller players around the country, they also rebuild their Too Big To Fail size while also becoming major players in small towns and big cities across America. Think about it like the auto industry. Here is a list of the defunct car companies in the U.S. that have been culled into the Big Three. Top targets Before I get to my investment picks, I want to say that the biggest statement you can make against the banksters is to move your business to smaller banks. I stopped using big banks decades ago and I have never felt cheated at keeping them as far away from my money as possible. Two other attractive qualities to regional bank stocks: Even if they’re not acquired, they’re still the best way to invest in the financial sector in the long term. If they are bought out, they will command big premiums, meaning big payoffs for investors. Without further ado, four solid stocks to look at are, BB&T, Fifth Third Bancorp, U.S. Bancorp and Burke & Herbert Bank and Trust. All these are rock-solid regional banks that will prosper on their own or profit handsomely from any takeover. — GS Early This entry was posted in Featured and tagged Bank. Bookmark the permalink.

Live Watch Tree planted in Tennessee in honor of allegedly kidnapped teen Elizabeth Thomas By David Caplan Close Follow on Twitter More from David Apr 5, 2017, 10:06 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star WKRN A tree planting ceremony on April 5, 2017, in Columbia, Tennessee, honored allegedly kidnapped teen Elizabeth Thomas. Her father, Anthony Thomas, is the fourth from the left (in a blue shirt). 0 Shares Email Elizabeth Thomas may still be out of sight, but she's not out of mind. A tree was planted Wednesday in a Columbia, Tennessee, park in honor of the 15-year-old, who was allegedly kidnapped three weeks ago by her former teacher, Tad Cummins, 50. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (L-R) Pictured are Tad Cummins, who is on the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's 'Top 10 Most Wanted' list and Elizabeth Thomas, the subject of a statewide AMBER Alert in Tennessee. So far, there's only been one confirmed sighting of the pair: At a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma City on March 15, two days after they vanished. MEDIA: Here's a quick video clip of Tad Cummins & Elizabeth Thomas entering the Walmart in Oklahoma City on 3/15.https://t.co/tIsI94rT6a— TBI (@TBInvestigation) March 31, 2017 The tree planting ceremony at Riverwalk Park was pegged to Victim's Rights Week, which is sponsored by Tennessee's Department of Corrections and Board of Parole. The ceremony was attended by Elizabeth's family and representatives from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, reported ABC affiliate WKRN. WKRN A tree planting ceremony on April 5, 2017, in Columbia, Tennessee, honored allegedly kidnapped teen Elizabeth Thomas. Elizabeth's father, Anthony Thomas, told WKRN he has a message for his daughter: "I want to tell her, Elizabeth, that man may be telling you that nobody's looking for you, or he may even be telling you that nobody wants you home. Don't listen to that. Everything he said to all the kids, not just you, has been a lie. He’s nothing but a liar. We all want you home. We all need you home." Thomas also had a message for Cummins: "I would like to just urge Tad Cummins, I know you’re keeping up with all this and you're filtering. You're not letting her see how much people out here love her. You're depriving her of that. It would make better sense for you to turn yourself in to law enforcement. If you turn yourself in, there are laws that will guarantee your general safety." 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Tree planted in honor of allegedly kidnapped teen Elizabeth Thomas " President Trump says Syria attack 'crossed many, many lines' " Father loses 9-month-old twins in Syrian chemical attack " Dem senator holds floor in 15-hour speech to slam Supreme Court nominee " Border wall 'unlikely' to stretch 'from sea to shining sea': DHS head " High court may re-examine Civil Rights Act after LGBT ruling " Federal agents raid California business in green card probe " Tornados and apparent twisters, rain, hail across Southeast " US will take action on Syrian chemical attacks if UN doesn't F-16 crashes in suburban Maryland " Man pleads not guilty to murder as terrorism for allegedly targeting black man in NYC " Hip, hip, hooray!

I’m just wondering. If you auditioned out here in Rabbit Valley, you had some stiff competition. I mean, after all, our army of seasoned bunnies with chain-saw teeth, able to destroy lawns faster than Cal American Water, don’t dress for work. Not like you do, carrying a basket with pink satin ribbons or wearing a vest embroidered with petunias. At least, I haven’t ever seen one like that gnawing on my marigolds. Seems you outdid yourself in the audition. What do you do in the off-season? Mascot perhaps? Walmart greeter? In anticipation of your arrival, Mr. Fixit (the husband) and I have already downed a few thousand jelly beans and dozens of those crunchy chocolate eggs. What does it feel like, Mr. Bunny, to know that your customers are getting a little round around the edges, soon to be anchored like the USS Bismarck into our easy chairs? We certainly won’t be hopping down any old bunny trail. Turns out, even the frequently pregnant daughter who lives on carrot juice and chardonnay, has also polished off a few dozen bags of peanut butter eggs. Your holiday confections show no mercy. Mr. Bunny, here’s my concern: This is a tough time for us humans, and your pre-Easter temptations are not helping. I mean nobody agrees on anything anymore, and Mr. Fixit thinks kale should be landfill. I thought you rabbits were about carrots? Adding insult to injury, it’s baseball season, which means a steady diet of soft pretzels at Fiore field, followed by hot dogs at Dover-Hendrix, and don’t forget the chili dog with jalapeños after a trek to Oxnard-El Rio. Due to my three rotten grandkids, now all in the game, I’ve become a Little League ball-field cuisine aficionado. And I’ve got the beef-jerky skin to prove it. If you wanna know which field never runs out of Cheetos, you’re in the right place. “We understand plump,” Mr. Fixit announces as he’s dicing his havarti to go with pretzel chips and olives as pregame warmup for the madness of March. “We?” I ask as I sneak the last piece of banana walnut bread out of the fridge and devour it before he busts me, trying to scoop the last bits of goo out of my receding gums before I say anything. I guess he’s noticed I’m beginning to resemble Miss Piggy. Seems the 20 pounds I lost found me again. And again. “I guess you’re getting ready for the Easter Bunny,” I tell my roommate as I spy a new bag of Easter egg peanut M&M’s, purchased by Mr. Fixit. “Yes,” he admits, “but I get that one confused with the Playboy Bunny.” “Oh really?” “Yes,” he continues. “It always happens this time of year. Must be those little white tails.” Mr. Bunny, here’s my concern: This is a tough time for us humans, and your pre-Easter temptations are not helping He thinks he’s hilarious. So, Mr. Bunny, or is it Ms.? Anyway, Madame Easter Bunny, thanks to you, my goofy husband and your Easter treats, I can only muse about when I used to remotely resemble the Playboy version of your species. Next year, only carrots and kale. Please. But can you make them taste like those crunchy little chocolate eggs? Thanks.

There was some speculation that it was going to be Amazon moving into the Hazelwood Logistics Center but at Wednesday night's council meeting the city heard from Massachusetts based company called Quiet Logistics and London based Bunzl Distribution Midcentral Inc, which is a grocery supplier. Quiet Logistics is a third-party distribution company that will work with companies like Macy's, Amazon and Walmart bringing with it more than 200 jobs to the area. The center which is on Lindbergh Boulevard has one building fully leased, two more that will be finished this summer, plus two more buildings that should be done and leased by end of year, with a total of 1,200 jobs. Brian Lemerise with Quiet Logistics said that adding their company to Hazelwood made sense because the city understands the importance of economic development. "City of Hazelwood understands what it means to recruit great businesses and partner with businesses," said Lemerise, "...and they have picked a great business in Quiet Logistics that's going to invest in their communities, there are a lot of great smart people that understand the importance of economic development and understand the services their community needs and jobs are a big part of that as well as finding businesses that are going to invest in the communities they are moving into." Quiet Logistics plans to move in as early as May and Bunzl is slated to move in at the end of the year. 38.771440 -90.370949 Related stories Hazelwood ready to announce new businesses coming to city Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email STL Moms!

Deputies had been investigating the controversial shooting for two months and had not released Leonard’s name until now. The shooting happened Feb. 4 after Adams and two others walked out of the Clarcona Ocoee Road store in Pine Hills with the unpaid merchandise, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.   Lonnie Leonard Lonnie Leonard Leonard stepped in to help an employee who was trying to stop the trio, deputies said. He told deputies he felt threatened and thought one of the suspects was arming himself, so he grabbed his gun and opened fire. Adams and the two others drove away in a stolen vehicle, which was carjacked in January, but crashed a short time later, deputies said. Adams was found at a nearby gas station. He was taken to the hospital, where he later died. Authorities said the two others got away on foot. Adams was a fugitive on felony probation, records show. He was also a gang member who was planning to sell the diapers, Sheriff’s Office Capt. Angelo Nieves said. chayes@orlandosentinel.com, 407-420-5493 or Twitter: @journo_christal Caption Body cam footage reveals altercation ahead of Sanford shooting Sanford police on Friday released body cam footage of officers’ interactions with Allen Cashe and Latina Herring at a Wawa.

Kettleman Lane at about 9:49 p.m. Monday. Police said a woman attempted to leave the store with nearly $250 worth of clothing. When store security officers tried to escort her back inside, she struggled with them, and an unknown man confronted them, claimed he had a knife and threatened to stab them if they did not let the woman go. The pair fled in a gray or gold early 2000s Honda Civic with the spare tire on the right side of the car, police said. They were last seen driving eastbound on Kettleman Lane. The woman is described as white, standing 5 feet, 7 inches tall, weighing 130 pounds with brown hair, wearing a black tank top and denim shorts. The man was described as white, standing 5 feet, 6 inches tall, weighing about 140 pounds, wearing a black baseball cap, a black hooded sweater with the hood over his head, a black vest and tan pants, police said. The pair have committed several thefts at Target and Walmart, police said. A security agent told police he believed the pair live at a Cherokee Lane motel and have two young children.

By: Banikinkar Pattanayak | New Delhi | Published: April 6, 2017 6:20 AM The shortfall in production led to calls by refiners and traders for scrapping or trimming the 40% import duty on sugar (both raw and white).(PTI) The government is weighing further relaxing foreign direct investment (FDI) rules in the retailing of food products to make it even easier for top foreign retailers to invest in India, official sources told FE. The move comes after several global retailers such as Walmart, Tesco, Metro Cash and Carry and Auchan Group conveyed to the government their willingness to set up shop here provided the rules are relaxed to add more items to the shelves, said a senior government official. Even a Brazilian retailer is learnt to be exploring opportunities to invest in India with a local partner. Although these retailers haven’t submitted details of investments that they may make in India, the food processing ministry believes potential investments could be as much as $5-10 billion if rules are suitably relaxed. So, after initial reluctance, the government is discussing the possibility of adding some related items such as kitchenware and even beauty products to the list of food products for retailing to boost footfall at supermarkets, said another official. “Discussions on allowing more items have started. But no decision has been taken on this matter so far,” he added. In June last year, the government notified that 100% FDI will be permitted (with government approval) in trading — including through e-commerce — of food products produced or manufactured in India to boost the realisations for farmers. Critics, however, pointed out that no supermarket would attract massive footfalls and be profitable with just food items on its shelves. Also Watch: The ex-factory price of domestic white sugar currently stands at around Rs 35-36 per kg. Sugar production has been hit hard by dry spells in Maharashtra and Karnataka, although Uttar Pradesh witnessed bumper production in 2016-17. “The decision to allow limited duty-free imports is aimed at keeping domestic supplies steady in case consumption picks up and also to have adequate stocks by the end of this season so that there is no scarcity before the new sugar comes in. However, as of now, we don’t have any real shortage of sugar due to massive carry-forward stocks from 2015-16,” said a senior government official. While the food ministry has projected production to drop to 22.5 million tonnes for the current marketing year through September, down from the official estimate of 25.1 million tonnes in 2015-16, the Indian Sugar Mills Association has pegged output at just 20.3 million tonnes for 2016-17. The shortfall in production led to calls by refiners and traders for scrapping or trimming the 40% import duty on sugar (both raw and white). Millers, however, have been maintaining that although production will take a hit, plentiful carry-forward stocks from 2015-16 will more than offset the shortfall and there is no need to scrap the import duty. “Considering the opening balance of 77.5 lakh tonnes (which has been reported by all sugar mills to the government) and considering an estimated sugar production of 203 lakh tonnes in the current season and consumption of 238-240 lakh tonnes, the closing balance in the current season would be 40-42 lakh tonnes. This balance will be enough to meet the domestic requirement till almost end of November 2017,” ISMA had said last month. To tide over a massive local shortage in 2008-09, the government had allowed import of raw sugar at zero duty under OGL from April 17, 2009, through June 2012. Thereafter, a moderate duty of 10% was imposed in July 2012, which was increased to 15% in July 2013 and subsequently to 25% in August 2014. The import duty was raised further to 40% in April 2015. Thereafter, there had been hardly any import of sugar under OGL. However, imports of raw sugar under the advance authorisation scheme (for subsequent exports) have been continuing at zero duty. The government seems to be adopting a cautious approach on making adequate sugar available to consumers, after its recent experience in wheat. In December last year, the government was forced to scrap a 10% import duty on wheat after retail prices of the grain rose sharply due to lower-than-expected production, with analysts casting doubts over the agriculture ministry’s bumper output estimates. The import duty on wheat was as high as 25% in September 2016. However, in anticipation of a bumper harvest this year, the government again imposed a 10% duty on wheat imports last month.

File photo Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Calgary Co-op is once again facing calls from its members to change how it sources its eggs and pork, a symptom of a North America-wide tidal wave of consumer pressure that has been forcing both retailers and farmers to adopt new animal welfare standards. At Thursday's AGM, Calgary Co-op member Clint Robertson will put forward a resolution calling for the grocery chain to "respect and honour" a 2013 vote by members which called for an end to the sale of eggs and pork produced using intensive confinement cages, such as battery cages and gestation stalls, by 2018. Robertson said he is bringing the issue back because he is frustrated that Co-op management has not done more to achieve the five-year time frame stipulated in the original non-binding vote. Though Calgary Co-op offers a larger selection of free-range eggs than it did in 2013 — as well as a new line of pork raised without the use of antibiotics or added hormones — the retailer has decided that a full phase-out of inexpensive products raised using conventional cages is unfeasible. "When this resolution was brought forward, the economic times we are currently experiencing were not contemplated," said Calgary Co-op spokesperson Karen Allan in an email. "While it is noble in the long run to phase out eggs and pork that do not meet the terms of the resolution, this is now less economically viable for the average Co-op member." Robertson acknowledged that moving to a cage-free supply chain would mean increased prices for customers, but said he believes Co-op members are willing to pay more to save "hundreds of thousands" of animals from being tightly confined in cages and crates. He said he is calling on Calgary Co-op to hold itself to a higher standard. "Co-op is never going to be the price leader, it's never going to be Costco or compete with WalMart," Robertson said. "So maybe they should think of a different business model, where they are the socially responsible retailer." In recent years, the agriculture industry has been under growing pressure from retailers and fast-food outlets who say their customers are increasingly demanding "ethically sourced" food. Grocery chains such as Loblaw, Sobeys, and Walmart have all stated their goal is to transition to cage-free eggs or pork by the end of 2025, while McDonald's, Starbucks, Tim Hortons, A&W, and Subway have made similar commitments. For its part, the agriculture industry is moving to meet changing consumer demand. Last month, egg farmers together with the National Farm Animal Care Council released an updated code of practice for the care of laying hens and pullets. The new code mandates the phasing out of at least 85 per cent of conventional cages within 15 years, although it gives farmers the option to replace them with "enriched" systems — cages with extra features such as perches and scratch pads — instead of moving to a fully free-run or free-range system. A new national code of practice for the care and handling of pigs was released by the pork industry in 2014. It calls for the phase out by 2024 of narrow gestation stalls that do not allow sows to lie down or turn around — replacing them instead with group housing, individual open pens, or stalls that allow for greater movement. Susan Schefer, chair of Egg Farmers of Alberta, said there are pros and cons to every animal housing method and said Calgary Co-op deserves credit for consulting with the agriculture industry before making any drastic moves. "I think quite frankly in some cases there are major corporations that are bowing to pressure from activist groups," Schefer said. "That's why I think Calgary Co-op has done such a good job — they've not just made a unilateral decision, they've really done the work to investigate what's out there." She added that 21 per cent of eggs produced in Alberta now come from hens housed in an alternative to conventional battery cages — either free-range, free-run, or the more modern "enriched" cage systems. But she said consumers need to understand that while farmers do care about animal welfare, they also have the responsibility to feed a hungry world as affordably as possible. "The fact is, we're not going to be able to feed people with 20 birds in our backyards," Schefer said. "Large-scale animal agriculture is still going to exist, because we have a growing population."   astephenson@postmedia.com Twitter.com/AmandaMsteph   As Advertised in the Calgary SUN Animal welfare debate returns to Calgary Co-op as management urged to honour 2013 'cage-free' resolution By Amanda Stephenson First posted: Wednesday, April 05, 2017 04:24 PM MDT Calgary Co-op is once again facing calls from its members to change how it sources its eggs and pork, a symptom of a North America-wide tidal wave of consumer pressure that has been forcing both retailers and farmers to adopt new animal welfare standards.

It was early July, and we were on our way home after a botched date night. My spouse's mood was off, once again. This chronic melancholy, this little Eeyore cloud hanging over our lives and saturating everything in miserable little droplets. It happened all the time. Advertisement Advertisement SO THIS HAPPENED Keep this field blank Enter your email address You may unsubscribe at any time. Privacy Policy | About Us The unhappiness had put a wedge between us for years. And on those rare nights we could sneak out for a meal or a drink, I would grow resentful when the Eeyore cloud starting pissing all over our parade. "I wish you would tell me what's going on with you," I said as we drove home from the coffee shop. "I can't," he replied. "Enough of that. We've been together 22 years and you've been unhappy the whole time. Everyone can see it. The kids and I can feel it." "I know," he admitted. I sighed. "Is it me? Are you unhappy with me? With our family?" "No, it's not you. It's not the kids. This predates all of you, trust me." "Look," I said. "I'm tired of brushing this under the rug. I think it's time for some honesty. Nothing will get better if you don't tell me what's wrong." "I can't," he insisted, staring straight ahead, hands firmly on the wheel. I thought of potential big secrets and just started guessing. "Are you gay?" I inquired. Hey, it happens, right? Maybe he wasn't as into me as my ego wanted me to believe. "No," he said. "OK." And then I just threw it out there. "So do you want to be a woman or something?" Silence. And suddenly, I knew. But I had to ask again because I needed to hear the answer. "You..." My voice was caught in my throat. "You're a... a woman?" More silence. My stomach was in knots. I wanted to throw up. "I can't talk about this," he said in the smallest, most vulnerable voice I had ever heard from him. I felt my heart break on the spot. RELATED: If You Use The Term 'Opposite Sex,' It's Time For A WAKE-UP CALL And I, the supportive mom of a trans child, the advocate, the ally and friend of the LGBT community, replied with an eloquent, "Oh, you have got to be f—king kidding me!" Yep. Not my proudest moment. The life I knew—the life I had with my husband—died that night. There's no other way to describe it. I thought I knew everything about my spouse. And yet, at that moment, I felt completely blindsided by the news. I didn't know this could happen twice in one family. (Our daughter, Alexis, is also transgender.) I didn't understand how someone could hide something like that from the person they'd been married to for over two decades. I didn't know how this would affect our family, the kids, his job. I felt betrayed, hurt, devastated, angry and scared. And he, by the light of the Walmart parking lot we had stopped in, looked a perfect picture of terror and relief.  "I never thought I'd tell anyone," he said, staring down. "But I just told you." I wanted to scream at him and I wanted to hug him, all at once. We were lost in a situation neither of us saw coming. RELATED: 'One Day, Leny Kissed Me': Amanda Knox Explains Lesbian Love In Prison But that was eight months ago. I would love to tell you that, given all the experience my family has with trans issues, it's been an easy journey. It hasn't. The first few months were incredibly bumpy. I didn't think we could come back from it all. But we did. Life with Zoe is beautiful. That's her lovely chosen name, by the way, and I helped pick it by vetoing all the ones I hated. I hated a lot of them. I'm really supportive. Check out these 14 amazing things you didn't know about orgasms. Her name is now legally changed on her birth certificate, along with her gender marker. The papers came in about a week ago. Her birth certificate says "female," which means — you guys — I'm gay married! (Insert rainbows and plaid shirts here.) You have no idea how many lesbian jokes I've been holding in for the last few months. S—t's about to get real. This same-sex marriage revelation was a perfectly comfortable shift for me. It feels right, because we feel right. After nearly 23 years together, I finally have my whole partner, not just the part she wanted to show me. And that Eeyore cloud? It hasn't come out to play in a while.  My wife is gorgeous, witty, and social now that she's finally comfortable in her own skin. We're the happiest we've ever been. I need to give some serious props to our two sons. These guys could teach a class in resiliency, compassion and acceptance. They've embraced their mama with open arms, just as they did their sister. And Alexis? She taught her mama to be brave like her by example, and saved her from drowning in secrets and misery for the rest of her life. What a gift that girl is. While I know there are many horror stories out there about what happens when people come out, we haven't dealt with a single one yet. Our families, friends and neighbors have all been incredible. We're so fortunate to be surrounded by many caring, open-minded people. And that brings us to this very day. Today is the day Zoe is coming out at work. There's much at stake here, and she's understandably nervous. Like her daughter, Zoe has also written a coming out email to all her coworkers who don't yet know she's transgender (the ones she works closely with already know, as does HR, but there are may more people to tell). It's a big day. After we do these two things, there's no more hiding. Zoe gets to be herself full-time. I get to say "my wife" without outing her before it's time. My kids finally get to say, "I have two moms." RELATED: 25 Completely Ridiculous Lesbian Stereotypes That Just. Won't. Die. We don't have to remember who knows and who doesn't know and who can't know yet because they might tell someone else. And, well, let's just say it's been exhausting for all of us. We've been living in the closet, and it feels damn good to be busting out of it. This is the internet, so I expect not all of you will be supportive. But believe me, there isn't a thing you could say in response to this news I haven't already thought of in the last several months. I used to worry about the shade people would throw our way, but not anymore. Our world is so full of love and support that it leaves absolutely no room for hatred or ignorance to reside within it. Besides, on top of having both a transgender daughter and wife, I've been fully immersed in gender issues for two years now: studying research, interviewing experts, giving talks, writing articles, and connecting with thousands of families. So unless you're coming at this with at least as much knowledge as I have, I'm probably not going to pay your negativity much mind. Just sayin'. So why share this at all? The same reason we share Alexis' journey: I want you to learn with me. If you learn along with me, then you won't be afraid. You won't be judgmental. You won't think families like ours are defective or weird. You'll get to know the queer parents at your kids' school instead of avoiding them. You'll invite the trans kid in your child's class over to play, like you would any other child. And then you'll teach these things to the people in your life, whether directly or indirectly. Knowledge creates change. And then the world gets safer for Alexis and Zoe, the two bravest ladies I've ever had the pleasure of loving. You and I are going to help make that happen, okay? Here's to the messy stuff of life, the woman I love more and more each day, and to wonderful new beginnings.

Raquel Perez, 26, has been charged with two counts of endangering a child for allegedly leaving her children in a hot car in Austin, Texas in May 2016, according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed by police on Wednesday Witnesses found the children in the backseat of the car in the parking lot of the superstore just before 2.00pm Central, as reported by ABC's KVUE.   'Both children were very hot, sweaty and dirty,' the affidavit read. 'The doors of the vehicle were locked. The windows of the vehicle were rolled down approximately an inch and the witnesses could not reach into the car to unlock the door.'

She entered the store, came back out about 10 minutes later, and reentered the store at about 1.00pm Central, this time going to the nail salon. The mother was seen leaving the salon at 2.05pm Central, but did not go outside right away. Cameras caught her doing what appeared to be shoplifting before exiting the store at 2.23pm Central as alarms went off. Perez placed items in the trunk of the car and then reentered the store to ask security about her children. 'Perez told officers that she left her children in the car because they were asleep,' the affidavit said.

Don't listen to that The father of Amber Alert subject Elizabeth Thomas had messages for his daughter and her accused kidnapper, Tad Cummins, when he spoke at a National Crime Victims' Rights Week event today in Tennessee. Elizabeth's father, Anthony Thomas, pleaded for his daughter to come home and for Cummins to surrender to law enforcement. Thomas was speaking at a tree planning event at Riverwalk Park in Columbia, Tennessee. The video of Anthony Thomas' comments was published by The Tennessean newspaper. "Elizabeth, that man may be telling you that nobody is looking for you or he may even be telling you that nobody wants you home. Don't listen to that," Anthony Thomas said to his daughter in the video. "Everything he said to all the kids, not just to you, has been a lie. "We all want you home," the father continued. Cummins, a 50-year-old ex-teacher is accused of kidnapping 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas more than three weeks ago. Amber Alerts remain active in Alabama and Tennessee following their March 13 disappearances. Their last known location is March 15 in Oklahoma City, where surveillance cameras at a Wal-Mart store captured video and photos of the two shopping for food. "Tad Cummins I know you're keeping up with all this and you're filtering," Anthony Thomas said today. "You're not letting her see how much people out here love her. It would make better sense for you to turn yourself in to law enforcement. If you turn yourself in, there are laws that will guarantee your general safety." Elizabeth Thomas was Cummins' student at Culleoka Unit School in Maury County, Tennessee. Authorities have said Cummins may have groomed and lured the girl before the kidnapping. As of Tuesday, the Tennessee Bureau had received more than 1,300 tips, but didn't have any new information about the whereabouts of Cummins and Thomas. Before surveillance footage was discovered at the OKC Wal-Mart, the last location investigators identified for Thomas was Columbia, Tennessee the day of her disappearance. Later that day, investigators place Cummins in Decatur, Alabama. The video and images from Oklahoma showed their appearances had been altered, including darkening Cummins' hair and changing Thomas' hair color to red. Cummins' wife, Jill, who has publicly encouraged her husband to surrender, filed for divorce this past week, citing irreconcilable differences that have arisen in the marriage. Cummins was fired by the school system the day after the abduction, although as far back as January he reportedly was caught kissing Thomas in his classroom. Read more about how the school system handled the situation here. Authorities are encouraging the public to share information about the Amber Alert with anyone they know south of the U.S. border. While investigators don't have any information placing Thomas and Cummins in Mexico, they say it's possible the two have made it that far. Mexican police have been notified about the case. The public is asked to be on the lookout, particularly in rural or secluded areas. Hunters are asked to watch for Cummins and Thomas. Investigators are asking people to be vigilant in parking garages and lots, parks, campgrounds and other off-the-grid places. Thomas is a white female possibly with red, strawberry or blonde hair and hazel eyes. She is 5 feet and weighs about 120 pounds. Cummins, believed to be armed with multiple guns, is a white male possibly with dark hair and brown eyes. He is six feet and about 200 pounds. They may be traveling in a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. Anyone with information is asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND. Anyone who sees Cummins, Thomas or the vehicle should call 911.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Apr 5, 2017 at 4:30PM In this segment from Motley Fool Money, Chris Hill asks Motley Fool analysts Jason Moser, Simon Erickson, and Jeff Fischer to shed some light on the companies they have their eyes on this week. Find out why iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC), and Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO) made the list. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 31, 2017. Chris Hill: Simon Erickson, you're up first. What are you looking at this week? Simon Erickson: Chris, I'm looking at iRobot. The ticker is IRBT. This is a company that makes a lot of the home cleaning products you've gotten used to. The Roomba vacuum cleaner, the Braava mop. These have been devices that are buzzed around and cleaned the floors and done household chores before, but now they're getting integrated into the cloud and becoming smarter. They're now going to be connected through Amazon Alexa. You have artificial intelligence that's actually making them able to clean, rather than just run around on the floor. I think that's a lot more valuable in the smart home of the future. I'm keeping my eye on these guys. Hill: Steve, question about iRobot? Steve Broido: How much time does a company like iRobot have to get this right? It seems like they've been at this for a very long time. Erickson: I think the internet connectivity and the real push for the smart home right now, Steve, gives them the window of opportunity. They have the spatial recognition figured out for years. It's just a matter of, how do you actually get it to do what you want it to do, which is actually clean your house. I give them a year to really see how this goes in the smart home. I think now is the time to do it. Hill: Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Jason Moser: My wife gave me a Roomba for my birthday last year, we have the things sweeping around the hardwoods, it cleans up after the dogs pretty well, actually. I've got Teladoc on my radar, ticker is TDOC. They provide telehealth services via mobile devices, internet, video, phone, basically connecting patients to doctors, and preventing you from having to actually go to that doctor's office, which we know is typically a very inefficient process. I've been following this company since it went public, a little bit more than a year ago. Stock is having a great year thus far, up better than 50%, and that's because they continue to grow their top line at 65%-plus rates, they're adding more visits, adding more members. This is an interesting business that is disrupting the traditional doctor visit model that we've grown up with. I think it's one that has some legs, and I'm going to keep following it. Hill: Steve? Broido: Are insurers bullish on this thing? Moser: Yeah. It's interesting, they get more partnerships with not only companies but health plans and whatnot, and I think insurers are finding ways to add this sort of feature as supplemental to plans they're selling out. So, yeah, I do think they find this type of offering very attractive. Hill: Jeff Fischer, what are you looking at? Jeff Fischer: Momo. The ticker is MOMO. It's fun to say. The business they offer is also called Momo, it's a social networking platform in China. They have 81 million monthly active users. Earnings per share have been soaring. They're expected to grow about 60% this year. This company's revenue, Steve, has gone from $3 million in 2013 to $550 million in the past few years, it's astronomical. Trades at 25 times forward earnings. Again, it's a Chinese company, so you need to watch that. But, Momo. Hill: Steve?  Broido: Do you trust numbers coming out of China? Fischer: I do. I'm starting to more and more. You have Baidu, transparency is growing. Chris Hill owns shares of Amazon. Jason Moser has no position in any stocks mentioned. Jeff Fischer owns shares of Amazon and MOMO. Simon Erickson owns shares of Amazon and Baidu. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon, Baidu, and iRobot.

The fossil fuel industry's business model is directly at odds with emissions reduction. (Photo by Olivier Polet/Corbis via Getty Images) Web Only / Features » April 5, 2017 Trump May Start Pushing a Carbon Tax. It’s a Trap. A carbon tax at the expense of regulation is just what the fossil-fuel industry wants. BY Kate Aronoff Share TweetReddit0 StumbleUpon0EmailPrint Email this article to a friend your email your name recipient(s) email (comma separated) message captcha Any optimism about using only a carbon tax to reduce emissions is hard to square with the scale of change needed to prevent a climactic worst-case scenario. On Tuesday afternoon, the Washington Post reported that the White House is considering two new options for reforming the country’s tax code. The first is a Value-Added Tax, or VAT, which increases fees on certain kinds of consumption. The second is a policy with strange pockets of support on both sides of the aisle: a carbon tax, which would charge polluters based on the amount of carbon dioxide they emit into the atmosphere. A White House statement released later on in the day shot down the report. But if the White House’s track record of contradicting itself is any indication, the proposals may still be in the mix. The White House’s rumored embrace of a carbon tax might be the best argument yet against progressives and environmentalists fixating on it as a policy demand. Mind, carbon taxes per se are not a bad idea—polluters should pay their fair share. And the revenue generated from a tax could fund much-needed investments in everything from modernizing the grid to waterfront resiliency to economic development.Unfortunately, Trump’s plan is almost certainly going to be a bad idea—this is not the carbon tax progressives are looking for. Any White House carbon tax proposal is likely to borrow from the “Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax” presented to the administration in early February by a handful of Republican luminaries who populate the Climate Leadership Council, including everyone from Reagan Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III to former Walmart chairman Rob Walton. ExxonMobil’s former head of climate policy recently joined the CLC as its research director, topping off a 35-year career in the oil and gas industry. The proposal calls for a carbon tax in exchange for a “significant regulatory rollback” phasing out the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. In other words, exactly what Trump motioned toward in his Executive Order last week scaling back Obama-era climate rules. “Because many regulations would become unnecessary,” the proposal’s authors state, “the plan would give companies the flexibility to reduce emissions in the most efficient way.” Carbon taxes, however, don’t have a great track record of bringing down emissions at all. When a carbon price was passed in British Columbia, a negligible portion of emissions reductions could be traced back to the tax itself. A Food & Water Watch report from last year points out that the measure’s implementation coincided with the Great Recession, and fossil fueled consumption across the Canadian province fell mainly due to the economic downturn—not because there was a price on pollution. What’s more, several major oil companies already factor a price on carbon into their long-term projections, muting the kinds of corporate behavioral changes carbon pricing advocates herald. ExxonMobil, after all, has one of the loudest voices in calling for a carbon tax—specifically as a means to scale back other regulations. A “properly designed carbon tax,” Exxon spokesperson Alan Jeffers told me in January, would replace “the existing regime of emissions regulations.”  To be sure, carbon pricing has a strong role to play in any low-carbon agenda bent on bringing down emissions. Taking the climate crisis seriously means rapidly decarbonizing the economy. That’s in direct contradiction with Exxon and other fossil fuel companies’ business model—to dig up as much coal, oil and natural gas as possible. A carbon tax can tip the scales by (rightly) fining companies for the emissions they produce and thus disincentivizing fossil fuel production. But that can’t come at the expense of regulations to curb greenhouse emissions now. Industry and the Right champion a carbon tax over regulation precisely because it won’t work as well; there is no win-win for the planet and the fossil fuel industry. Interestingly, the White House tax is likely to depart from the CLC plan in one critical way: It won’t be revenue neutral. A measure is revenue neutral if it doesn’t contribute to state or federal tax revenue—the preferred route for small-government conservatives. According to the Post, though, the White House’s alleged carbon tax measure was being pitched as a way to “find new revenue sources”, meaning it would subsidize the GOP’s proposed tax cuts for the wealthy and the additional $54 million in defense spending—both of which would be a disaster for the planet. Whatever carbon tax ultimately emerges from the Oval Office would likely fit comfortably alongside the administration’s full-frontal assault on climate protections. Trump has spent the first three months of his administration writing a series of love letters to the fossil fuel industry, approving the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, scaling back seemingly common sense regulations on extraction and proposing deep cuts to virtually every agency with a say over the quantity of greenhouse gasses the industry spits up into the atmosphere. Former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson is running the State Department, and the Department of Energy has allegedly even banned its climate office from even uttering the phrase climate change. Still, the proposal isn’t likely to gain much traction among the GOP. In a realpolitik sense, the main flaw of conservative carbon tax advocates is in conflating the support of neoclassical economists and Beltway policy wonks with enthusiastic public support. Aside from being virtually incomprehensible to the general public, pricing carbon is also an idea that’s wildly unpopular among Republicans in Congress. White House higher-ups have repeatedly denied they were considering a measure, and it remains unlikely that the draft proposal reported on today will find its way into whatever tax reform package the GOP ends up implementing. John Kartch, spokesman for Grover Norquist’s influential right-wing think tank Americans for Tax Reform, tweeted today: “Carbon tax, VAT—not happening.” Even if a Trump-approved carbon tax does turn out to be a total nonstarter (which—again—is very likely), there’s still reason for concern over the Trump White House considering carbon pricing at all. Given that a carbon tax enjoys some sort of support from the likes of Bernie Sanders and other left-of-center leaders, it has the potential to trick progressives into thinking it’s a good idea. Billionaire greens like Al Gore and Elon Musk—supporters of both a carbon tax and collaborating with the administration—will probably praise the measure, potentially alongside some bigger green non-profits. Such a fracturing could give political cover for Trump’s cabinet to move full-steam ahead with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy and more. And at the risk of overestimating Team Trump’s strategic thinking, their support of a watered-down carbon tax might also be intended to appease critics of pulling out of the Paris Agreement. via GIPHY Any optimism about the tax as an emission reductions measure is hard to square with the scale of change needed to prevent a climactic worst-case scenario. A recent paper in the journal Science outlines what sorts of changes would realistically be needed to meet the 2 degrees Celsius warming target agreed to at the Paris climate talks: Cut global emission in half every decade from the 2020s to the 2040s, with the most rapid decarbonization occurring in wealthy nations like the United States. As hardly-progressive firm PricewaterhouseCoopers put it in a 2012 report, “The only way to avoid the pessimistic [climate] scenarios will be radical transformations in the ways the global economy currently functions.” A Trump-approved carbon tax, then, is either political snake oil or—more likely—dead on arrival. If it does manages to grow any legs politically, progressives should know better than to fall for it.  Like what you’ve read?

Yes, there will be a bottom eventually, as we won't see a future with no brick-and-mortar stores whatsoever. But that business is in the early stages of an evolution into whatever it will eventually become in an Internet world. If you must be in retail, stick with the best there is in Home Depot (HD) , or (as silly as it seems), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) . Wal-Mart is aggressively pushing the envelope on its own evolution. As for the rest of the sector, an improving economy means more money spent on entertainment, vacations and merchandise -- and who else will benefit from all of that more than Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ? Disney's troubled ESPN unit might have to evolve as cable TV goes the way of bricks-and-mortar retailers, but content is king -- and so is family fun when there's enough money in the budget to include it. And need I even mention Star Wars?

Oldenshaw, a sidewalk musician, can usually be found in downtown Rutland on Wednesdays at the corner of the Walmart parking lot or under the awning of the Yellow Deli on Center Street. On the last Saturday of the month, he can also be found indoors at the Rutland Farmers’ Market on West Street. Oldershaw uses the money he earns entertaining passersby with sidewalk music to the support his partner Kim and their 8-month-old daughter Summer. Gabby helps him do it safely. Oldershaw will turn 34 this month and is a veteran of the Coast Guard and trained field medic who volunteered for Iraq duty in 2009-2010. He was wounded almost immediately and more recently suffered a severe head injury. He sets up with a guitar case open to receive donations, a cardboard sign that reads “Singing USCG Daddy,” and small dishes of dry cat food and water. While Oldenshaw sings and strums a wide range of popular tunes, Gabby perches coolly on his shoulder or wraps around his neck like a furry scarf. She only leaves his shoulder to grab a bite or ask to be taken outside to relieve herself. Gabby recently turned 2 years old on March 26, the same day that his daughter Summer turned 7 months old. The use of cats as service animals is unusual but growing. In November 2016, Oldershaw told the Mountain Times, a tiny kitty was rescued from a barn fire in Brandon — the only survivor. The fire chief, who knew about Oldershaw’s situation, asked him to take the kitten temporarily so the kitten could learn from Gabby until it could get trained as a medical cat for a local 12-year-old child who had suffered a head injury in a car accident. The little cat, Gru, went on to receive certification in Boulder, Colo., and has since returned to Vermont. Any animal can be trained to match up to a medical need, said Oldershaw. A prescription comes with the animal, who accompanies the patient at all times. Gabby is registered with the state licensing division. The cats are trained to be calm under all circumstances and not spook at loud noises or disturbances. The baby can tug and pull at Gabby and she doesn’t react, Oldershaw said. Oldershaw explained that minutes before she detects an impending seizure, Gabby gives an alert howl and starts nudging his head and face to get his attention. If he ignores her, she will begin to scream. She will stay with him until someone comes to his aid. “Pills are not going to solve everything,” Oldershaw said. “Animals are like a medicine that you can’t die from or o.d. on.” Photo by Julia Purdy Matty Oldenshaw plays the guitar with his service cat who monitors signs for epileptic seizure from his shoulder. catgabbyhelpsjulia purdyserviceshow Share This Article Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Travis Hoium (TMFFlushDraw) Apr 5, 2017 at 1:59PM What happened  Shares of hydrogen supplier Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) jumped as much as 85% on Wednesday morning after the company announced a supply agreement with retail giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Related fuel cell suppliers Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) and FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL) popped as much as 11.1% and 10.1%, respectively.  So what Amazon has agreed to purchase Plug Power fuel cells and hydrogen technology at select fulfillment centers. Revenue from the deal is expected to be $70 million in 2017 and could be as high as $600 million overall.  Along with the agreement, Amazon was granted 55,286,696 warrants with an exercise price of $1.1893 per share. These vest based on aggregate purchases made by Amazon directly or indirectly, and the exercise price will adjust after the first 34,917,912 warrants vest.  Forklifts in distribution centers are the biggest use of Plug Power's technology. Image source: Getty Images. There's also a technology-collaboration deal, which will look into expanding the application of ProGen fuel cells that are primarily used in forklifts.  While this deal doesn't directly impact Ballard Power Systems or FuelCell Energy, the three stocks often trade in tandem, and any big signing for any fuel cell player is seen as good news for the industry.  Now what The last time we saw a big signing like this was when Plug Power came to a supply agreement with Walmart in late 2013. The stock shot up as investor hopes for a hydrogen future surged, but the financial results never quite matched those expectations. You can see below that when Plug Power began shipments to Walmart in 2014, it lost even more money and still hasn't been able to make a profit.  PLUG data by YCharts. It's possible that the bigger base of customers will allow Plug Power to lower costs and spread fixed costs among a bigger base. But that theory hasn't proven true in the past, so until we see Plug Power become profitable, I'll remain skeptical about this signing. Small companies rarely get the upper hand on negotiations with giants like Amazon. In Plug Power's case, the Walmart deal has proven not to be a moneymaker.

More On: endangering the welfare of a child Couple arrested for trying to sell baby on Craigslist Adopted girl dies after life in most horrific circumstances imaginable Parents charged after 8-year-old son ODs on heroin Homeowner finds landscaper having sex with family dog A Texas mother allegedly left her two young children inside a hot car that reached 100 degrees so she could get her nails done at a local Walmart — and shoplift, police said. Raquel Perez, 26, spent more than an hour inside the superstore’s nail salon in south Austin as her two children – ages 3 and 1 – sat in her car on May 5, according to an arrest warrant affidavit filed Wednesday. “Both children were very hot, sweaty and dirty,” read the affidavit, which was obtained by the Austin American-Statesman. “The doors of the vehicle were locked. The windows of the vehicle were rolled down approximately an inch and the witnesses could not reach into the car to unlock the door.” One of several witnesses in the store’s parking lot managed to show the older child how to unlock the door and then took them inside to the store’s security office, KXAN reports. The temperature inside the vehicle was recorded at 100 degrees when emergency responders finally got to the car, despite its door being open for several minutes. Temperatures in Austin that day reached 89 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. Perez was identified as the mother of the children when she went into the store searching for them. She claimed to have left them inside because they were sleeping, KVUE reports. Perez, according to surveillance cameras, parked at the store at about 12:45 p.m. before entering the store. She exited about 10 minutes later, only to return to the store and visit its nail salon. Perez then left the salon at about 2:05 p.m. and began walking around to shoplift, cops said. The stolen goods set off the store’s alarm as she stepped outside and she bolted to her car. Once she realized her kids weren’t in the vehicle, she went back into the store, the affidavit states. Perez, who faces two counts of endangering a child, was not listed as in custody at the Travis County Jail early Wednesday, the American-Statesman reports.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Why Is The Nintendo Switch So Hard To Find? Posted: Apr 5 2017, 9:55am CDT | by Noel Diem, in News | Gaming   Photo Credit: Getty Images   For many people, they keep reading all about the new Nintendo Switch console that was released last month, but they can't actually get their hands on it. The reviews haven't helped - many people were afraid it would be a bust, but word of mouth is fairly good, despite problems.  Don't Miss: The best Deal on a new Samsung Galaxy S8 Leading retailers, like GameStop, Walmart, and Target have seen some boosts in their online and retail stores, but they still aren't able to keep up with demands.  "It isn't like we are seeing the same people coming in," a GameStop employee said. "We are seeing different people coming in who played it at a friend's house and now wants one of their own. People are getting them, but more and more people want them, so there is a backlog." Finding the Nintendo Switch is easier for some people and places than it is for others. But why is it so hard to keep these consoles in stock? Nikkei Technology said that the culprit is the high production cost of the Nintendo Switch. It costs about $257 to produce a single Nintendo Switch, which is high considering that the console doesn't cost that much. It also means that the profit isn't as high, meaning producing more in a single session doesn't seem possible right now. They've already had to double their production, and it seems like they may have to even double that to keep up with the demand. Over at Wedbush Securities, Michael Pachter has some tough words for Nintendo: meet expectations or get out of the pool, because you aren't really a console to begin with. “The Switch works really well- you’re essentially playing with a controller and screen right in front of your face," Pachter said to SIFTD Games. “It is a handheld, the cool thing about it is that your games work on the television as well, but the truth is, it’s a handheld, it’s a great handheld. So, I actually think the Switch is going to end up selling about as well as the 3DS. It’s at a higher price point- but ultimately if it comes down to $149, then ultimately, 3DS style 13 million units a year is possible.”   This story may contain affiliate links.

This is "Think Tank," an occasional series of conversations with Bay Area power players, conducted by San Francisco editors. Interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity. Name: Leila Janah Occupation: Founder and CEO of Samasource and LXMI Age: 34 Residence: San Francisco San Francisco: You started your nonprofit Samasource when you were only 25. What’s the idea behind it? Leila Janah: In Sanskrit, sama means “equal.” My goal is to get 100,000 people moved out of poverty as soon as possible. I want to shift the role of philanthropy from giving away stuff to people to giving them jobs. And how do you do that? We teach people how to benefit from the gig economy. Low-income people often don’t know how to access information on these types of jobs. We train them so they can do jobs such as moderating reviews on TripAdvisor or categorizing catalog merchandise for Walmart or content work for Glassdoor or building custom databases for companies. We’ve helped elevate 35,000 workers and their dependents out of poverty since 2008. The majority of them are in Kenya, Uganda, India, and Haiti. Does this politically charged climate make you rethink the fact that you are outsourcing jobs that could go to U.S. workers? It’s not “either you help someone in the United States or just someone in Africa.” It’s not a zero-sum game. It’s like if you have a great product like an iPhone, why would you sell it only in the United States? Why not make it accessible to everyone? Have you come under fire for it? I started our U.S. program in 2012 after someone emailed me to say that we were ruining America. We place people in different types of work here—telemarketing, localized customer service, and having people drive to places to do address verification. We’re reaching people who are unemployed or underemployed in places like rural Arkansas, where people lost jobs after factories closed. You graduated from Harvard with a major you crafted—international development with a focus on Africa. What set you on this path? I got a scholarship from a tobacco company when I was 16. I wanted to use the money to do something more beneficial than just going to a fancy Ivy League school. I had never seen poverty up close in a developing country. So my senior year in high school, I used some of that money to volunteer at a school for the blind in Ghana. I went over there feeling like I was going to save them. I felt very righteous. But you learn in the aid world that’s the worst attitude to have. When I got there, I learned the students could recite parts of Bill Clinton’s speeches. They listened to NPR. They were poor materially, but rich in knowledge. It changed my perspective on why poor people are poor. You had a somewhat volatile upbringing, with your family moving a dozen times and your parents divorcing when you were a teenager. What effect did that have on you? We had no money even though both my parents worked. We lived paycheck to paycheck. My parents even dealt with homelessness periodically after I left for college. They were not financially savvy. I was always so worried and anxious about money. But you become resilient because you know the worst that can happen. Where did the social justice gene come from? My mom grew up in Calcutta, which is very poor, and my father went to Jesuit schools. They always cared about social justice. With them, there was always the feeling that there are things to change in the world, things to fight for. And how does LXMI, your new luxury skincare brand, fit into all of this? Its main ingredient is nilotica, a powerful and rare shea butter found in northern Uganda. It is all hand-harvested by women. I thought, Why not build a beauty brand that can give work to women? I donated one-third of my shares of LXMI to Samasource, which is equivalent to a cofounder equity position. I believe a beauty brand should not only make you more beautiful, but make the world more beautiful, too.  This interview was originally conducted for our sister publication, Silicon Valley.

The Fox News host, who built a following with a combative style and sometimes coarse put-downs, has also made news by settling sexual harassment lawsuits as far back as 2004. Yet revelations of more O’Reilly settlements this past weekend sparked a stampede of advertisers pulling spots from his show. Why now? Call it heightened awareness among advertisers of “brand safety.” A recent uproar over ads being placed next to hateful videos on YouTube highlights the shift. While apparently not noticing for years, many advertisers are reviewing where their ads appear to ensure they’re not associated with objectionable content. “Every one of our top 50 customers has sat down with us in the last two months,” said Wayne Gattinella, CEO of DoubleVerify, which vets online ads for companies and whose clients include Centrica Plc’s British Gas. “We’re seeing a record number of ads that we’re now blocking as a result of a category of ‘inflammatory politics.’” Other factors are feeding the newfound sensitivity. Politics in the U.S. and Europe has become more polarized, adding pressure to brands associated with cable-news controversy. And media has become focused on personalities -- whether it’s YouTube star PewDiePie or O’Reilly -- whose unfiltered statements made advertisers uncomfortable. When disputes arise, social media makes it easy for activists to pressure brands into taking action. Fanning Flames “It’s about the speed at which social media has allowed the backlash to generate and to really rage out of control,” said Ross Barnes, chief technology officer at The&Partnership, a collection of media agencies that is minority-owned by WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising company. “It’s just a whirlwind. You can’t predict where that’s going to go or the scale it’s going to reach.” This week at least five automakers -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Hyundai Motor Co., BMW of North America, Jaguar Land Rover North America and Mercedes-Benz -- said they’re withdrawing advertising from “The O’Reilly Factor” following allegations against its host that were reported in the New York Times. A plethora of global brands, including PepsiCo Inc., Starbucks Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. pulled spots from YouTube in recent weeks, amid concerns that their marketing was appearing next to hateful and extremist content. JPMorgan Chase recently shrunk its ad placements to 5,000 websites from 400,000 because it wanted to reduce the chances its ads will be next to offensive content or fake news. While advertisers may have been unaware that their ads appeared next to terrorism videos on YouTube, it’s hard for them to plead ignorance with O’Reilly, said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research. “The O’Reilly Factor” is a tempting buy for advertisers: He’s built a loyal following of consumers as the most popular host on the most-watched cable-news network in the world’s biggest marketplace, the U.S. “Bill O’Reilly is one of the most popular personalities in all of television,” Wieser said. “Any advertiser who was surprised hasn’t put much thought into their media planning.” Kangaroo Skin The creator of the Twitter account Sleeping Giants took screen shots last fall of ads appearing on Breitbart News in a successful campaign to get brands like Kellogg Co. to leave the website, which has been accused of espousing racist and anti-Semitic views. Breitbart, in turn, started a campaign to get readers to stop buying Kellog’s cereals. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Sensitivities can lie on both sides of the political spectrum, so companies must be careful either way. After Budweiser beer aired a Super Bowl ad that celebrated the immigrant roots of its German-born creator, Adolphus Busch, some supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump called for a boycott of the AB InBev Worldwide Inc. brand. Ethical Consumer lists 48 active boycotts for progressive causes, from Adidas (using kangaroo skin) to West Country Dairy Products in the U.K. (badger cull). The pressure can bear some unexpected fruit. The U.K. activist group Stop Funding Hate scored a victory of sorts last month in its campaign against British tabloids over articles it considers anti-immigrant. But Co-Operative Group, which operates grocery stores and bank branches, stopped short of pulling its ads as requested. Instead, the company met with executives at two newspaper publishers, News Corp.’s Sun and Daily Mail & General Trust Plc, to ask them to change their editorial stance -- a move that raises questions about press freedoms. Stop Funding Hate said it welcomed the spirit of the Co-Op statement but made clear it hadn’t asked the advertiser to demand editorial changes. “We’re having interesting discussions with our clients,” said Barnes, of The&Partnership. The topics range from whether companies want their brands to appear in certain publications to whether they want business from customers who hold contrary views, he said. Easy Switch Those unhappy with their current media associations have many options to reach audiences on TV and online. That makes it easy to bail out for any reason. “If I was an advertiser in 2017, I’d steer my money away from hosts and cable networks who are serially being sued (and are serially settling) sexual harassment cases,” said Ian Schafer, chief executive of the creative agency Deep Focus. “Audience is a commodity. There are many other ways to reach them.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

SOUTH UNION TOWNSHIP, Pa. A 72-year-old Pennsylvania woman was dragged by a car during a purse snatching Tuesday morning outside a Walmart in South Union Township. The woman was in the parking lot putting bags into her car when a man approached her and asked for directions to The Home Depot, according to police. He then grabbed her purse. >> Read more trending news The woman’s son, George Null, told WPXI TV that he is appalled by the incident and is counting his blessings that his mother survived. “She had the purse on her shoulder, and from what she has said, he was trying to get it off. She had a tight grip on it and got knocked down and pulled away,” Null said. Police said the suspect, 28-year-old Douglas Gettemy, of Uniontown, pulled the woman over to his car as she held onto the purse. He then started driving off, dragging the woman across the pavement until the purse strap broke. Null’s mother was treated and released from Uniontown Hospital. “It's hard to keep a good woman down,” Null said. Gettemy was arrested about an hour after the incident.  >> Got a question about the news?

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. „There’s lots of misinformation about this — although it’s still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn’t have online privacy to begin with, so you’re not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can’t buy your specific internet history. That’s a myth. A VPN won’t entirely shield your privacy, either – that’s another myth. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid’s teacher emails you that he’s struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven’t delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the ’90s. Twenty years later, we’ve gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block.” Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig „Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it’s because Summer Zervos, a former ‚Apprentice’ contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump’s lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos’ claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump’s argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton’s claims that he was immune, noting: ‚The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.’ So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com How the Gorsuch Vote on Friday May Change the Supreme Court Forever James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig, Phoenix „This Friday, April 7, is shaping up to be a huge day in our country’s history, and to borrow a line from Senator Mitch McConnell, whether or not Judge Gorsuch gets his new robes ‚really depends on our Democratic friends.’ How will this week unfold? Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster — nearly half the number needed to avoid the ‚nuclear option,’ the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it’s not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK’s Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK’s process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: „The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a ‚United’ Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing.” Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including „TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History’s Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement,” „Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a),” „Modern GATT Law” and „International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook.” Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis „The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, ‚That’s no longer good enough.’ And it’s not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved.” Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving „collaborative filtering,” as a collective response to the problem: „Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, ‚Our system may not be perfect, but it’s the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.’ This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk.” Contact: Randy Labuzinski, rlabuzinski@jaffepr.com EXPERT ROUNDUP: Trump’s Environmental Policy (16 experts) With President Trump signing a sweeping executive order that rescinds at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, following are experts who are available for interviews on President Trump’s environmental policy: Climate Change and Ideology Lawrence Hamilton Professor of Sociology University of New Hampshire Hamilton’s recent research (see link below) explores what the general public knows and believes about the environment, climate change, and science, and how their perceptions relate to education and are shaped by political orientation (see video link below). His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. „Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs,” said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of „alternative facts,” people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. „Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people’s ears,” said Hamilton. „For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge.” Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump’s policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: „Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard.” Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration’s commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department’s 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions.” Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer „The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow.” Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump’s Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can’t make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court’s mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump’s policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. „Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules,” Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world. Bio: http://www.sprlaw.com/attorney/jeffrey-b-gracer/ Contact: Olivier Gibbons, ogibbons@courtstory.com Toxic Chemicals and the Ethics of Risk Carl Cranor Distinguished Professor of Philosophy University of California, Riverside Generations of toxic chemicals in everyday use – from ingredients in cosmetics and paint to nonstick cookware and upholstery – have sickened or killed thousands of Americans. Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: „Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us.” Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of „Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals” (Oxford University Press, 2017), „Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants,” „Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law,” and „Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice.” He has served on science advisory panels (California’s Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees. Contact: Bettye Miller, bettye.miller@ucr.edu Climate Change Cameron P. Wake, Ph.D. Research Professor in Climatology and Glaciology University of New Hampshire Wake is available to discuss climate change, health impacts, sustainability as it relates to climate change, the importance for preparedness and building community resilience, and distrust of scientists (see video link below). He leads a research program investigating regional climate and environmental change through the analysis of ice cores, instrumental data, and phenological records, with a focus on the northeast United States, the Arctic, and central Asia. His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that „New Hampshire’s climate is already changing and having an impact on people’s lives. It’s hotter and wetter, there are more extreme precipitation events, our sea levels are rising and our health is being affected.” Wake on climate change: http://bit.ly/2l5qd04 Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Climate Change Science Neil Leary, Ph.D. Founding Director, Center for Sustainability Education Dickinson College Leary, a leader on international climate change studies and projects, is available to discuss climate change science, climate change risks, the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing, and carbon pollution reduction. He has conducted research on climate change risks and policies for 20 years and has brought Dickinson students to the UNFCCC climate conferences in Paris, Lima, Durban and Copenhagen to conduct research on transnational governance of climate change. Leary teaches courses on climate change, sustainable communities and sustainable campuses. He has been a participant in the 1995, 2001, 2007 and 2014 science assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and has led international studies of climate change risks and adaptation that have involved more than 300 scientists from 50 countries. Before joining Dickinson, Leary served as senior scientist at the Global Change System for Analysis, Research and Training and as senior economist at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. He has a Ph.D. in natural resource economics. Read his thoughts on climate change at his Huffington Post blog.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric. The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases will be disbanded and policy documents associated with the metric withdrawn. 3) Federal Lands: The EO directs the Department of Interior to lift the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, which may not be subject to legitimate challenge in court. In contrast, the direction set forth by the EO to suspend and revise rules limiting hydraulic fracturing and regulating oil and gas operations on federal lands will require a full rulemaking process, which could take the better part of a year followed by several years of litigation. Belcher has a national, multidisciplinary practice counseling clients in the utility, power and pipeline sectors. He represented Enbridge Inc. in the acquisition of a 103-MW wind project in West Virginia and he represented Freepoint Commodities in its joint venture with ArcLight Capital Partners to acquire certain storage terminals, refining units and marine infrastructure at the former Hovensa refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. „There’s lots of misinformation about this — although it’s still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn’t have online privacy to begin with, so you’re not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can’t buy your specific internet history. That’s a myth. A VPN won’t entirely shield your privacy, either – that’s another myth. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid’s teacher emails you that he’s struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven’t delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the ’90s. Twenty years later, we’ve gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block.” Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig „Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it’s because Summer Zervos, a former ‚Apprentice’ contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump’s lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos’ claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump’s argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton’s claims that he was immune, noting: ‚The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.’ So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J.

Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster — nearly half the number needed to avoid the ‚nuclear option,’ the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it’s not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK’s Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK’s process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: „The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a ‚United’ Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing.” Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including „TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History’s Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement,” „Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a),” „Modern GATT Law” and „International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook.” Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis „The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, ‚That’s no longer good enough.’ And it’s not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved.” Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving „collaborative filtering,” as a collective response to the problem: „Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, ‚Our system may not be perfect, but it’s the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.’ This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk.” Contact: Randy Labuzinski, rlabuzinski@jaffepr.com EXPERT ROUNDUP: Trump’s Environmental Policy (16 experts) With President Trump signing a sweeping executive order that rescinds at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, following are experts who are available for interviews on President Trump’s environmental policy: Climate Change and Ideology Lawrence Hamilton Professor of Sociology University of New Hampshire Hamilton’s recent research (see link below) explores what the general public knows and believes about the environment, climate change, and science, and how their perceptions relate to education and are shaped by political orientation (see video link below). His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. „Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs,” said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of „alternative facts,” people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. „Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people’s ears,” said Hamilton. „For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge.” Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump’s policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: „Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard.” Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration’s commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department’s 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions.” Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer „The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow.” Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump’s Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can’t make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court’s mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump’s policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. „Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules,” Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world.

Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: „Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us.” Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of „Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals” (Oxford University Press, 2017), „Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants,” „Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law,” and „Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice.” He has served on science advisory panels (California’s Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees.

His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that „New Hampshire’s climate is already changing and having an impact on people’s lives.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric.

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. „There’s lots of misinformation about this — although it’s still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn’t have online privacy to begin with, so you’re not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can’t buy your specific internet history. That’s a myth. A VPN won’t entirely shield your privacy, either – that’s another myth. What’s going to happen is you’re going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid’s teacher emails you that he’s struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven’t delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the ’90s. Twenty years later, we’ve gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block.” Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig „Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it’s because Summer Zervos, a former ‚Apprentice’ contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump’s lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos’ claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump’s argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton’s claims that he was immune, noting: ‚The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.’ So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com How the Gorsuch Vote on Friday May Change the Supreme Court Forever James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig, Phoenix „This Friday, April 7, is shaping up to be a huge day in our country’s history, and to borrow a line from Senator Mitch McConnell, whether or not Judge Gorsuch gets his new robes ‚really depends on our Democratic friends.’ How will this week unfold? Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster — nearly half the number needed to avoid the ‚nuclear option,’ the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it’s not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court.” ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK’s Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK’s process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: „The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a ‚United’ Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing.” Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including „TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History’s Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement,” „Understanding Islamic Law (Shari’a),” „Modern GATT Law” and „International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook.” Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis „The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, ‚That’s no longer good enough.’ And it’s not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved.” Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving „collaborative filtering,” as a collective response to the problem: „Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, ‚Our system may not be perfect, but it’s the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.’ This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk.” Contact: Randy Labuzinski, rlabuzinski@jaffepr.com EXPERT ROUNDUP: Trump’s Environmental Policy (16 experts) With President Trump signing a sweeping executive order that rescinds at least six Obama-era executive orders aimed at curbing climate change and regulating carbon emissions, following are experts who are available for interviews on President Trump’s environmental policy: Climate Change and Ideology Lawrence Hamilton Professor of Sociology University of New Hampshire Hamilton’s recent research (see link below) explores what the general public knows and believes about the environment, climate change, and science, and how their perceptions relate to education and are shaped by political orientation (see video link below). His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. „Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs,” said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of „alternative facts,” people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. „Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people’s ears,” said Hamilton. „For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge.” Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump’s policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: „Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard.” Dr. Azevedo’s research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration’s commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department’s 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions.” Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer „The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow.” Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice’s Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump’s Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can’t make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court’s mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump’s policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. „Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules,” Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world.

Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: „Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us.” Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of „Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals” (Oxford University Press, 2017), „Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants,” „Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law,” and „Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice.” He has served on science advisory panels (California’s Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees.

He leads a research program investigating regional climate and environmental change through the analysis of ice cores, instrumental data, and phenological records, with a focus on the northeast United States, the Arctic, and central Asia. His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that „New Hampshire’s climate is already changing and having an impact on people’s lives. It’s hotter and wetter, there are more extreme precipitation events, our sea levels are rising and our health is being affected.” Wake on climate change: http://bit.ly/2l5qd04 Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Climate Change Science Neil Leary, Ph.D. Founding Director, Center for Sustainability Education Dickinson College Leary, a leader on international climate change studies and projects, is available to discuss climate change science, climate change risks, the Paris Agreement, carbon pricing, and carbon pollution reduction.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric. The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases will be disbanded and policy documents associated with the metric withdrawn. 3) Federal Lands: The EO directs the Department of Interior to lift the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, which may not be subject to legitimate challenge in court. In contrast, the direction set forth by the EO to suspend and revise rules limiting hydraulic fracturing and regulating oil and gas operations on federal lands will require a full rulemaking process, which could take the better part of a year followed by several years of litigation. Belcher has a national, multidisciplinary practice counseling clients in the utility, power and pipeline sectors. He represented Enbridge Inc. in the acquisition of a 103-MW wind project in West Virginia and he represented Freepoint Commodities in its joint venture with ArcLight Capital Partners to acquire certain storage terminals, refining units and marine infrastructure at the former Hovensa refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Mobile Marketing Association Study with Allstate Insurance Company Reveals Importance of Attribution and Cross Channel Metrics Mobile Marketing Association Study with Allstate Insurance Company Reveals Importance of Attribution and Cross Channel Metrics Posted on April 5, 2017 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. Cross Marketing Effectiveness (SMoX) research proves fine-tuned targeting strategy a success. New York (PRWEB) April 05, 2017 The optimal combination of formats and targeting can create significant shifts in sales and consideration, according to the most recent SMoX attribution study done for Allstate Insurance by The Mobile Marketing Association (MMA). The study also proved the clickthrough rate (CTR), a widely-use measurement of impact, has no direct correlation to conversions. “The insights we learned will have immense value over time as our marketing efforts evolve,” says Allstate’s Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Gupta. “This confirms our belief that in this fast-changing world, what’s seen as tried and true in the past may not always be the best method for the future.” The new research suggests brands should leverage some form of unified, real-time data measurement practices, and apply them across all their channels and down to individual users, in order to accurately attribute performance and optimize campaigns on the fly. Leveraging such an approach, the study revealed a number of specific opportunities that drastically improve the performance of mobile: The right format for the right goal: Mobile video and mobile audio were more efficient than the campaign average of all media in driving brand consideration, performing at 85 percent and 32 percent, respectively. On the other hand, mobile banners that successfully targeted consumers who were in the market for insurance were 12 percent more efficient as compared to the campaign average (across all media) in terms of driving sales. Targeting changed the game: The best targeting performer was behavioral targeting which far outperformed untargeted banners, scoring 272 out of an index of 100 when it came to incremental sales per dollar spent. Re-targeting was also very efficient– performing more than two times better as compared to when it was not applied. Location drives sales at scale: Banners that employed location targeting improved the efficiency of sales per dollar spent compared to untargeted banners by a factor of nearly two. The study also validated the importance of physical location patterns of consumers as predictive in terms of defining an audience that is in the market for insurance. Shorter is better for audio and video: Video’s efficiency was hugely dependent not just on its placement in the sales funnel but also on length. A 15-second video was twice as effective in delivering on consideration as a 30-second version and audio was 18 percent better when it was a shorter length, as well. “It is critical for marketers to understand the potentially huge swings in ROI that both format and targeting opportunities unique to mobile can have,” says MMA’s Chief Executive Officer Greg Stuart. “Metrics need to be integrated cross-channel to accurately attribute business outcomes. The impact this level of marketing maturity can have to drive topline business growth as well as greater personalization of the consumer experience is unprecedented.” To date, MMA has conducted 10 SMoX attribution studies providing marketers with an idea of what an optimized marketing mix should look like for brands. About SMoX SMoX is a global research initiative conducted by the MMA, which has included studies with Allstate, AT&T, Coca-Cola, MasterCard, Walmart and Unilever. SMoX applies research techniques from person-centric marketing analytics firm Marketing Evolution to provide a granular read of mobile and other media. For more on SMoX, click here.

With new logos, Perimeter cities join the branding boom Many of metro Atlanta’s corporate giants, from Coca-Cola to UPS, attract customers with instantly recognizable brand logos. In turn, cities marketing themselves as hometowns for such businesses are trying to stand out with their own brands, with new city logos popping up everywhere from Perimeter Center to Peachtree City. Dunwoody and Sandy Springs are among the local cities that have recently created new city logos at considerable cost in time and money that they figure will pay off with economic development. The new Sandy Springs city logo. “A city is a business,” said Sharon Kraun, communications director at the city of Sandy Springs, which recently spent more than $175,000 on a package of six logos and related illustrations for its government and its City Springs downtown redevelopment. “We are a business. We are attracting other businesses to come.” The city of Atlanta is the old-school holdout, its post-Civil War emblem of a phoenix reborn from ashes remaining essentially unchanged from its adoption in 1887. That logo appears everywhere, including on the city’s economic development handbook that tries to sweet-talk businesses into moving to Atlanta and staying. But the city also built a distinct economic development authority, Invest Atlanta, that has a modern logo of a stylized “A” in the blue-and-green color scheme that is popular in recent city logos. The Atlanta phoenix logo. Atlanta also had a “New Coke” moment of a branding change gone wrong, according to former Mayor Sam Massell, who now heads the Buckhead Coalition. During his administration in the early 1970s, he said, the city introduced a redesigned phoenix intended to look modern and cosmopolitan, as Hartsfield-Jackson airport began running its first non-stop international flights. The logo didn’t fly, he said. “We weren’t really international,” Massell said. “We were talking bigger than we deserved.” Getting a city’s brand spot-on is “just a hard, hard job,” Kraun said. Indeed, the new Dunwoody and Sandy Springs brands are in part replacements for previous logos that didn’t work so well. The new Dunwoody city logo. In Dunwoody in 2010, the city and the Convention and Visitors Bureau paid a branding company $105,000 for a logo that was immediately derided as a confusing copycat. It featured a star that looked like an asterisk and became known as the “Walmart logo” for its similarity to the discount retailer’s symbol. As much as the City Council wanted to change the logo, it was even more eager to avoid spending more money on another one. This year, three Dunwoody residents who head marketing and branding firms — Jay Kapp of Kapp Koncepts, Mike Martin of Jackson Spalding, and Heyward Wescott of Custom Signs Today — did pro bono work to produce a new logo. Their final design is the city’s name in blue with a curving green brushstroke beneath it. “We went with a very safe design,” Wescott said, while Kapp added, “We didn’t want to see the city go through another round of a logo that people didn’t like.” A big difference city logos have from corporate counterparts is that they must try to represent an entire diverse community and their costs must be justified politically to city residents. Dunwoody was able to say its new logo was free, but the design team said their volunteer effort had a market value of around $30,000. The City Springs district logo. Sandy Springs took some heat for spending nearly $100,000 on its new city logo, the primary version of which is three blue-and-green brushstrokes. That was on top of $77,000 spent on branding its new “City Springs” downtown area anchored by a $220-million public-private development — a name that private developers are already imitating. Kraun said it’s true that various websites will design a custom logo for $500. But, she said, cities get what they pay for, including market research, vetting of designs and creation of alternatives and spin-off logos to use in other formats. Sandy Springs got six separate designs and a branding guide to using them. “If it was just to draw that one icon, yes, a hundred thousand dollars would be a lot,” Kraun said. “The cost for us was not just that icon. … It’s not just something you put on a T-shirt.” Sandy Springs presented its branding companies with complex challenges. Its previous city logo, depicting a river and trees in shaded colors, was popular, but it was a nightmare to use in different sizes, colors and applications. The replacement had to be not only more flexible, but also had to match well with the new City Springs brand — an abstract, fountain-like image — that, in turn, has a more specialized goal of drawing residents and customers to downtown. The $100,000 included several designs integrating the new city logo with other images for such special uses as the parks department and the city’s new performing arts center, which is set to open next year. One of the new illustrations is specifically for economic development marketing materials. It shows the city logo wrapped around the Concourse Center’s King and Queen skyscrapers, the icons of the city’s Perimeter Center big-business hub. That is not an official logo, but an image that may be used in marketing materials as well as serving as an inspiration for other versions later. An illustration created for Sandy Springs economic development marketing, showing the city’s new logo combined with the King and Queen skyscrapers. The cost included “how we were able to take something so iconic and wrap it with the brand,” Kraun said. “From an economic development perspective, we’re tying all the pieces together.” Businesses ultimately base their location decisions on measurable factors such as demographics, community amenities and tax incentives. Does a city logo really matter? Are cities creating them mostly because everyone else is? Kraun likened the value of a city brand to a basic rule in the public relations business: “‘No comment’ is a comment. No logo is also a logo. … It’s a calling card.” Kapp said the logo serves as a foundation for a city to build its brand value upon. “A logo is what you make of it, how you use it,” he said. “Of course you don’t want a logo with [the cartoon typeface] Comic Sans. But what’s in a brand? The reason Coca-Cola is as well-known as it is, is not because of a logo.” –John Ruch, Dyana Babgy and Evelyn Andrews About John Ruch Mail | More Posts (1038) 5 Responses to With new logos, Perimeter cities join the branding boom Pete Reply April 3, 2017 at 8:17 am Students at SCADncouod have done all of this and saved the city $100,000. Concern Sandy Springs Citizen Reply April 3, 2017 at 3:01 pm Ok. They spent $175k for design and consultation for guidelines on how to use it. Now, how much is it going to cost to replace the old logo on the street signs, the park signs, city uniforms, city vehicles, etcs??? TO MUCH MONEY!!! An investigation should be held to see who influenced this decision. A logo is a logo. So, why replace one if you already have one that works…The new Sandy Springs logo is a MAJOR step back from the previous design. The new logo tells the direction of the city. Sandy Springs officials care less about “depicting rivers and trees..” and more about making things cookie-cutter. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Sandy Springs needs a CITY SEAL like the one the City of Atlanta has had for over a Century! It has served them well enough to land major business so the idea that Sandy Springs needed new branding within 10yrs of being a City is asinine. Paul Reply April 4, 2017 at 7:29 am For the reasons you stated and many, many others the entire city council and the mayor need to be voted out of office in November. Hopefully, there will be good alternative candidates. Ralph Reply April 4, 2017 at 4:51 pm City leaders have lost sight of how to lead our city. They throw dollars around as if it is limitless and always available. They continually approve developments to increase the tax base with no regard to infrastructure. The City of Sandy Springs needs a moratorium on developments for 5 years. But, our leaders won’t do that because of their developer friends that have hijacked the system and the constant pressure of being sued. Maybe our leaders should spend some of our taxes to defend a moratorium. Better spent on that than logos. Kevin Reply April 5, 2017 at 9:18 am Ms. Kraun, I don’t think anyone could have given a more thorough reason for your firing than you just gave. As the Director of Communications and Media your own lack of ability it appears required spending to be told how to communicate the logo and city vision to the public. What you describe as paying others for is exactly your job description. While the small, tightly held company you work for is being paid by tax payer dollars it’s their job to hire those who can perform within a strict budget. Spending additional tax payer dollars to find someone capable of doing the job you’re task to do is wasteful spending. Perhaps you and the elected officials using the Reporter as a place to hang talking points could actually respond to those who elected to you when they comment. As you just said, No Comment is a Comment. Ignoring the citizens outrage at the rants posted here by Sandy Springs officials, indeed, speaks volumes.

Internet Law and Ethics Professor, Communications Department Adelphi University, Garden City, N.Y. "There's lots of misinformation about this -- although it's still not good news. In short, nothing is changing. You didn't have online privacy to begin with, so you're not losing anything. The FCC had recently adopted new privacy rules that were set to go into place, but the new legislation stops that from happening. No, someone can't buy your specific internet history. That's a myth. A VPN won't entirely shield your privacy, either – that's another myth. What's going to happen is you're going to see more and more targeted ads when you surf online. So, for example, if your kid's teacher emails you that he's struggling in algebra, you might see ads about tutoring services. If you do a Google search for flights to Paris, expect to see ads from airlines and hotel websites. Deregulation of internet service providers has been a disaster for Americans. ISPs haven't delivered the promises they made when they begged Congress to end common carriage regulations in the '90s. Twenty years later, we've gone from being a pioneer in internet service to now lagging behind developing countries in terms of access, cost, speed, privacy protections and more. And this situation will probably continue to get worse. It looks like net neutrality is next on the chopping block." Website: http://www.adelphi.edu Contact: Kali Chan, chan@adelphi.edu How Lawsuits May Be the Ultimate Unraveling of the Trump Presidency James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig "Allegations about Trump and sexual misconduct are in the news again. This time it's because Summer Zervos, a former 'Apprentice' contestant who alleged Trump made improper advances, is suing Trump for defamation. This week, Trump's lawyers indicated they will seek to have Zervos' claim dismissed because they claim Trump is immunized from state court suits because he is president. Will Trump's argument carry the day? Probably not. In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held unanimously in Clinton v. Jones that Bill Clinton could be sued while in office for acts allegedly committed before he assumed office. The case related to allegations of sexual harassment from former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones. In the case, the Supreme Court rejected Clinton's claims that he was immune, noting: 'The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves office.' So why is Trump challenging this seemingly clear case?" ProfNet Profile: http://www.profnetconnect.com/james.goodnow Bio: https://lambergoodnow.com/legalcommentator/ Contact: Terence J. Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com How the Gorsuch Vote on Friday May Change the Supreme Court Forever James Goodnow Legal & Political Commentator Fennemore Craig, Phoenix "This Friday, April 7, is shaping up to be a huge day in our country's history, and to borrow a line from Senator Mitch McConnell, whether or not Judge Gorsuch gets his new robes 'really depends on our Democratic friends.' How will this week unfold? Going nuclear? Three Democratic Senators have indicated they will break party ranks and support President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch and oppose filibuster -- nearly half the number needed to avoid the 'nuclear option,' the changing of the Senate rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority. With Republicans having a 52-48 edge in the Senate, the question is whether Senate Majority Leader McConnell can woo the five additional votes needed to get to 60. Based on the current landscape, it's not looking good. Democrats now have enough votes to filibuster the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court."

Murnin, tmurnin@fclaw.com UK's Process of Withdrawal From European Union Raj Bhala Associate Dean for International & Comparative Law; Rice Distinguished Professor, School of Law University of Kansas Bhala can discuss the triggering of Article 50, which officially begins the UK's process of withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), and international trade and political negotiations now set to take place: "The United Kingdom is about to embark on the most complex set of negotiations it has encountered since the era of decolonization, when it withdrew from countries across the British Empire. Unlike that era, which spanned several decades, now the UK has limited time: two years. Also unlike that era, the UK is dealing with the entire world – that is, the other 163 members of the World Trade Organization. Finally, its previous colonial withdrawal did not threaten the integrity of the UK itself. Now, its future as a 'United' Kingdom is in peril. For America, the ramifications with its closest ally, its special relationship, cover economic, political, military and national security matters. For Americans, a pillar of their post-Second World War, post-Cold War world is changing." Bhala has authored dozens of journal articles and books, including "TPP Objectively: Law, Economics, and National Security of History's Largest, Longest Free Trade Agreement," "Understanding Islamic Law (Shari'a)," "Modern GATT Law" and "International Trade Law: An Interdisciplinary, Non-Western Textbook." Contact: Mike Krings, mkrings@ku.edu YouTube Advertisers Boycott Robert J. Zafft Privacy and Technology Attorney, Greensfelder, Hemker & Gale, P.C. (St. Louis) Business Ethics Teacher, Washington University in St. Louis "The suspension of their advertising on YouTube by blue-chip brands like PepsiCo, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart and Starbucks due to concern over automated ad placements reflects a maturing of social media and society. Current YouTube technology cannot adequately screen the content, and the brands worry that automated ad placements will pair their brands with content that promotes terrorism, racism, violence, or other messages highly offensive to customers. For a long time, publishers have acted like hotel owners who happily collect rent while turning a blind eye to unsavory or illegal goings on in the rooms they let. Now, the advertisers who foot the bill have begun to say, 'That's no longer good enough.' And it's not just the problem of YouTube owner Google, which has vowed to address the issue. Brand risk will likely move down the food chain, affecting other publishers, ad networks and ad buyers. Social media will likely get faster and more effective at naming and shaming businesses involved." Zafft is able to discuss the ethics surrounding this matter, as well as a possible solution involving "collaborative filtering," as a collective response to the problem: "Collaborative filtering would assess content by looking at who posts it and who watches it. Collaborative filtering improves with the number of companies and publishers that participate. If top publishers and ad networks wire into the same filtering system, they can say to ad buyers and consumers, 'Our system may not be perfect, but it's the best there is, and we are working hard with others to improve it.' This answer may go a long way to diminishing or defusing brand risk."

His body of work involves research that integrates data from social and natural-science domains. "Many people now are inclined toward distrust of scientists, and outright rejection of scientific findings that contradict their political beliefs," said Hamilton. He notes that long before the recent discussion of "alternative facts," people developed set views based on their ideology, even for straightforward physical facts such as whether the Arctic sea ice is melting. "Our research has shown that ideology whispers in people's ears," said Hamilton. "For some people, ideology has a dominant effect on how they answer survey questions, not just what they believe but who they will listen to, and how certain they feel about their knowledge." Hamilton is available to discuss climate change and political views, knowledge and attitudes toward science, migration; resources and society in the Arctic (aka climigration). Hamilton speaking about climate change and ideology: http://bit.ly/2lh4GDR Research: http://tinyurl.com/koztxjy Contact: Robbin Ray, robbin.ray@unh.edu Environmental and Economic Issues Ines Azevedo, Ph.D. Associate Professor, Engineering and Public Policy; Co-Director, Climate and Energy Decision Making Center Carnegie Mellon University Dr. Azevedo can speak to the implications of President Trump's policies, why the power sector is a perfect candidate for emissions reductions, emissions, and the carbon intensity of the power sector: "Since 2005, the U.S. was able to reduce our emissions from the power sector by about 25 percent. However, given the current policies, we may soon see an increase, rather than a decrease, in the emission intensity of the U.S. power sector. Instead of taking a position as a leader, the United States is running the risk of being a forever laggard." Dr. Azevedo's research interests lie at the intersection of environmental, technical, and economic issues, such as how to address the challenge of climate change and to move towards a more sustainable energy system. She tackles complex problems in which traditional engineering plays an important role but cannot provide a complete answer. In particular, she has been looking at how energy systems are likely to be shaped in the future, which requires comprehensive knowledge not only of the technologies that can address future energy needs but also of the decision-making process followed by different agents in the economy. Dr. Azevedo has also been working on assessing how specific policies will shape future energy systems, especially in a carbon-constrained world.

It is, unsurprisingly, a sharp break with the Obama administration's commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, but President Trump is also ignoring the Defense Department's 2015 assessment that climate change represents a national security risk. According to the now-shelved report, environmental effects like shifting climate zones and rising sea levels will lead to disruptions and shocks for fragile governments around the world, as well as exacerbate tension and risk in conflict-prone regions." Brozek writes on the intersection of environmental politics and international security, with a focus on freshwater and climate change. Contact:  Rick Peterson, richard.peterson@lawrence.edu Legal Challenges Ethan Shenkman Partner Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer "The EO is sweeping in scope, setting up a new policy review process focused on energy independence that will bring additional regulations within its sights. It raises as many questions as it answers, and presents both challenges and opportunities across all sectors. It is not the end point, but rather one step in a lengthy series of legal and administrative processes. The only certainty is that litigation will follow." Shenkman is available to discuss all aspects of the executive order, including: Clean Power Plan, Clean Air Act/regulations, CEQ guidance, social cost of carbon, endangerment finding, administrative law/APA issues, future rulemaking processes, litigation/courts, Supreme Court, DOJ and EPA. He served for seven years as a political appointee in the Obama Administration. Most recently, he served as deputy general counsel at the US Environmental Protection Agency (2014-2017) and, prior to that, as deputy assistant attorney general at the US Department of Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division (2010-2014). During his post at the EPA, Shenkman was responsible for Clean Air Act regulations and litigation. Bio: http://www.apks.com/en/people/s/shenkman-ethan-g Contact: Issara Baumann, issara.baumann@apks.com Legal Challenges Jeffrey Gracer Principal (Partner) Sive, Paget & Riesel Gracer believes that President Trump's Executive Order undermining the climate change policies enacted by his predecessor will lead to years of litigation as states and cities continue passing their own environmental regulations, challenging federal policies. He points out that the EPA can't make decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, irrational, or unconstitutional; and lower courts are likely to be skeptical of wholesale efforts to walk away from the Supreme Court's mandate to protect public health and the environment. Gracer also believes that President Trump's policies will hurt American standing in the world on the issue of climate change, and cede a leadership role to other countries like China. "Despite the political theater last week at the EPA, it will take more than the stroke of a pen to undo the Obama-era rules," Gracer said. Gracer is principal (partner) at New York City-based law firm Sive, Paget & Riesel, the oldest environmental law firm in the country. He has a vibrant domestic and international practice and is an expert in all state and federal environmental matters, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water, Clean Power, hazardous waste disposal, and brownfield cleanups. He is the founder of the Environmental Program at the Vance Center for International Justice at the New York City Bar, which focuses on providing pro bon advice on environmental issues around the world.

Why? Because most of these substances are not regulated by the federal government. And the legal system – which offers the only recourse for deaths or injuries resulting from toxic exposures – often fails to properly use science to identify and assess whether or not products are toxic. Says Cranor: "Laws that are supposed to protect citi­zens from toxicity-caused diseases accomplish this so poorly that we rarely read of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and Health administration, or the Consumer Product Safety Commission taking action to better protect us." Cranor is known globally for his research on the regulation of toxic substances, the ethics of risk, and the philosophy of law and science. His work has changed how scientific testimony is addressed in court cases, as well as aspects of regulation in California. He is the author of "Tragic Failures: How and Why We Are Harmed by Toxic Chemicals" (Oxford University Press, 2017), "Legally Poisoned: How the Law Puts Us at Risk from Toxicants," "Regulating Toxic Substances: A Philosophy of Science and the Law," and "Toxic Torts: Science, Law and the Possibility of Justice." He has served on science advisory panels (California's Proposition 65, Electric and Magnetic Fields, Nanotechnology, and Biomonitoring Panels), as well as on Institute of Medicine and National Academy of Sciences Committees.

Wake, Ph.D. Research Professor in Climatology and Glaciology University of New Hampshire Wake is available to discuss climate change, health impacts, sustainability as it relates to climate change, the importance for preparedness and building community resilience, and distrust of scientists (see video link below). He leads a research program investigating regional climate and environmental change through the analysis of ice cores, instrumental data, and phenological records, with a focus on the northeast United States, the Arctic, and central Asia. His research on several regional climate assessments, like flooding, in the northeast United States has been shared with state and federal agencies and has been covered widely in the media. His recent climate change research looking at the New Hampshire seacoast had him commenting that "New Hampshire's climate is already changing and having an impact on people's lives.

In the meantime, regulated businesses can operate without the additional costs of complying with the plan. 2) Social Cost of Carbon: The EPA is expected to discontinue the use of the social cost of carbon metric. The Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases will be disbanded and policy documents associated with the metric withdrawn. 3) Federal Lands: The EO directs the Department of Interior to lift the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands, which may not be subject to legitimate challenge in court. In contrast, the direction set forth by the EO to suspend and revise rules limiting hydraulic fracturing and regulating oil and gas operations on federal lands will require a full rulemaking process, which could take the better part of a year followed by several years of litigation.

Sarah Nassauer and Laura Stevens 17 hrs ago SHARE SHARE TWEET SHARE EMAIL Rockwell said to win EU approval for B/E Aero takeover Stores take flight from Fifth Avenue in Manhattan Costco Wholesale Corp., which built an empire selling products in bulk, hasn’t felt the need to transfer that winning strategy online. Quotes in the article Costco Wholesale Corp COST ▼ 167.00 -0.25 -0.15% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 909.28 +2.45 +0.27% Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 71.65 -0.36 -0.50% FedEx Corp FDX ▼ 195.85 -0.42 -0.21% “We want to get you into the store because you’re going to buy more,” Costco’s finance chief Richard Galanti said last month when asked during the company’s earnings call about its e-commerce growth. Costco attributes much of its success to the treasure-hunt atmosphere it creates in its 725 stores by cycling through new products to spur impulse purchases. But in an era where people are shopping online for giant packages of everything from dog food to disposable diapers, more investors and analysts are pressing Costco to focus on e-commerce. Meanwhile, online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and newer players like Boxed.com are making inroads with consumers looking to buy in bulk. “They are in an OK spot for now, but I don’t think that will last forever,” said Tim Campbell, a Kantar Retail analyst covering warehouse chains. “They need to get ready to compete with Amazon.” Wholesale chains have been slow to embrace home delivery for online orders. Shipping half-gallon tubs of mayonnaise is expensive—especially as carriers move to charge by size in addition to weight—and profit margins are already low on most household staples. “We are a little late to the game on purpose,” said Mr. Galanti in an interview. “We recognize there are things we can do or should be doing.” Costco’s contrarian stance on e-commerce is supported by its strong store sales at a time when many brick-and-mortar chains have floundered. But as e-commerce grows in importance, Costco’s online sales growth has slowed. It hovered around 10% in recent quarters, lower than comparable figures by Amazon and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Online sales account for about 4% of Costco’s $119 billion in annual revenue. Costco is making some moves, adding more products to its website, such as cosmetics and clothes, and investing in distribution centers to speed delivery. It now sells about 10,000 products online and 3,700 in a typical store. The company lets nonmembers buy most items it sells online, generally at a 5% upcharge, Mr. Galanti said. “We want them to see the site and hopefully become a member.” BJ’s Wholesale Club Inc., with 214 stores in the eastern U.S., said it is also emphasizing online efforts that ultimately get shoppers into stores. It sells about 10,000 products online, though much of the food and household products listed are only available for store pickup. One complication for selling Costco-size packages via a website is the move by carriers like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. to charge based on package size as well as weight. A $13 tub of mayo could cost a big retailer $5 to $8 to ship from Los Angeles to the Las Vegas area, depending on how remote the buyer’s address is, according to a cost analysis by consultants Spend Management Experts. A smaller retailer would likely pay about double. To make up for shipping costs, warehouse chains sometimes charge more for products online or sell larger quantities. Costco sells only two-packs of its popular store brand Extra Fancy Mixed Nuts online for $38.99, including shipping, but it sells the same product for $33.98 in stores, as well as a $16.99 single pack. Some online upstarts say the economics can work. Boxed, based in New York, presents shoppers with a selection of items that encourages them to buy more at once. The goal is for a customer to spend about $100 on 10 items, said Chieh Huang, the firm’s chief executive and co-founder. “Three years ago we were extolling the virtues of buying toilet paper online, and people were looking at us like ‘that’s the stupidest idea ever,’” said Mr. Huang. “It’s a full-on race now.” The company had more than $100 million in revenue last year and is unprofitable. Amazon is encouraging shoppers to buy smaller, higher-margin products along with bulk items shipped in a large box, its answer to the wholesale chains. Dubbed Prime Pantry, the service allows Amazon to sell groceries and household products that its website says are “cost-prohibitive to ship for free individually.” Last year, Amazon reported sales excluding its cloud division rose about 25% to $123.8 billion. Sam’s Club, a warehouse chain owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. with $57.4 billion in sales, has installed drive-through stations where customers can pick up online orders in about 65 of its 660 U.S. stores. While a typical Sam’s Club sells around 6,000 products, Samsclub.com now sells more than 51,000, many of them bulk items such as 24-packs of Gatorade and 252-count boxes of Pampers diapers. The investment is worth it, said Jamie Iannone, chief executive of SamsClub.com, because shoppers who buy both online and in stores spend more and renew their membership more often.

Larry Downing/Reuters/File | Caption Loading... Amanda Hoover Staff | @amahoover April 5, 2017 —As large retailers continue to struggle in a highly competitive e-commerce age, several, including Target, have embarked on a rethinking of their offerings and price points in an uncertain market where customers have left department stores behind for the allure of discounted online shopping. While the future of the company may seem uncertain, some say Target's plan moving forward and the power of brand recognition could push the company into a successful future.  Target's shares plunged 13 percent at the end of February, marking the largest single-day drop in 18 years and the lowest rate in two years. The hit follows a downward trend in which Target shares lost a quarter of their value since the 2016 holiday shopping season kicked off in November. Those results countered profit forecasts, as analysts had expected to see same-store sales get a boost of about 0.4 percent this year. Once a central part of the shopping experience, large stores have suffered in recent years, steadily losing market share to Amazon and other heavily discounted online retailers. President Trump’s pledge to levy high taxes on imported goods are also threatening the chains, which depend on low-cost imports. Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi? Take our 'parent company' quiz! “Our fourth-quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,” Brian Cornell, chairman and chief executive of Target, said at the time. "Our industry is in the midst of a seismic shift," he added. On Tuesday, Payless Shoe Source filed for bankruptcy and unveiled a plan to restructure its business model, and Ralph Lauren announced plans to shutter its flagship store and pivot toward a focus on e-commerce.  Confusion over Target's branding could be contributing to its losses, say experts. While the stores seem to offer a bit of everything, they have yet to make their mark by diving head-on into certain ventures. "Target is neither a full-line grocer nor a player with lots of niche specialty products; it is neither a high-end player nor a price-focused discounter," Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, told Reuters. But as department stores such as Macy’s or J.C. Penny keep shuttering physical locations, Target executives say they hope to remodel their older stores to attract new customers. Nationwide, the chain plans to tackle 600 of its 1,800 locations in the next two years. To counteract the losses, Target announced it would invest $2 billion in 2017 on analytics, supply chains, and opening 100 small-format stores such as TargetExpress in urban communities and colleges. It will also unveil 12 new brands that will offer merchandise exclusively through Target. Some of that mirrors action taken by Wal-Mart in recent years, as the company focused on remodeling its aging stores and bolstered its online presence with exclusive new products. Wal-Mart has since seen nine quarters of consistent growth. February's quarterly report did have a silver lining: Target saw a 34 percent jump in online sales, and vowed to continue to grow its offerings there. Success online has come after Mr. Cornell increased the total stores that ship products directly to shoppers, hoping to match the two-day Amazon Prime deliveries that make the online retailer so appealing. While Target seeks to copy the successful path laid down by Wal-Mart and Amazon, experts warn the retailer could encounter new challenges. "Target’s got bigger issues" than Wal-Mart had, analyst Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones told the Associated Press. "They’ve struggled since Brian Cornell’s come on to figure out what to do with their grocery department.... I think Target’s turnaround could take a little bit longer than Wal-Mart because it’s a different situation and probably a little more difficult.” But forecasts for the company still call for earnings of $4 per share in 2017, which could cover its dividend. The company also has a recognizable and well-received brand, popular among both Millennials and older generations.  Its plans to reduce store size and open smaller, convenient locations in cities and densely populated areas could prove a successful tactic as well, allowing the company to reach more customers seeking to buy groceries and every day essentials.  Those shifts, coupled with the drop in shares value, could make now the optimal time to invest in the company.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Some Say That Defeats the Point by Dirk VanderHart François Vigneault Tweet WELLS FARGO wanted to talk. It was August 2016, and as Portland inched closer to acting on recommendations that the city cease investing millions in the bank, Wells Fargo executives hoped to stop the process. The bank's Oregon region president, Tracy Curtis, penned a letter [PDF] to the city's Socially Responsible Investments Committee (SRIC), which was close to formally suggesting Portland add Wells Fargo to its "do-not-buy" list. Another bank employee—a senior vice president based in San Francisco—followed up by email and phone, offering to meet in person. For advocates of the SRIC, the response was telling. Though corporate divestment campaigns are frequently written off as merely symbolic, SRIC members say Wells Fargo's concern showed it was keen on avoiding the stigma of being listed as a bad actor by a major American city. Nearly nine months later, the bank might get its wish. Portland's on the verge of ensuring Wells Fargo and others won't have to worry about such public shaming. In an interesting about-face, the Portland City Council will consider scotching the SRIC, created in late 2014 to help ensure Portland was investing ethically. Instead, Mayor Ted Wheeler is proposing moving the city's do-not-buy list behind closed doors. Wheeler and Treasurer Jennifer Cooperman want to move away from the SRIC's public hearings, and instead employ a secretive ratings system that ensures Portlanders have little idea which companies have been blacklisted. For people who support the SRIC process, the proposal defeats the purpose. "It's not about the financial impact," says Hyung Nam, a Portland high school teacher and SRIC member. "It's about the public image that these corporations care about so much." Portland is required by state law to adopt an investment policy each year, but the pronounced changes being pushed this time reflect a central conflict in how that policy should be carried out. On one hand, officials like Wheeler—the former Oregon state treasurer—and Cooperman think of investments largely in terms of reaping maximum returns, feeling that's a responsible use of public money. Asked about divestment policies late last year, a spokesperson for Wheeler said they are "not typically center-of-target." On the other hand, some groups believe the city should be making a statement with the roughly $1.5 billion it invests, and refuse to do business with companies that behave shabbily. Doing so publicly can at times make officials uncomfortable. Last year, in its first major report, the SRIC recommended the city put nine additional companies on its do-not-buy list, which already included Walmart and fossil fuel companies. Wells Fargo was singled out partly for its role helping finance private prison companies. Caterpillar, the most contentious recommendation, was listed partly because its bulldozers are used to raze homes in the West Bank. Amazon was also included the report, as were Nestlé and a number of banks. But City Council waffled, with even then-Commissioner Steve Novick, who'd pushed the creation of the SRIC, voicing concern about the scope of the committee's recommendations. Instead of voting on adding specific companies to the do-not-buy list, commissioners instead placated the audience by electing not to purchase bonds from any corporation until this year, after the city had adopted its latest investment policy. Activist groups claimed victory, but the proposal that's surfaced under Wheeler has inspired disdain. "The mayor's investment policy backslides from a system that city council did not give a chance to work, and replaces it with an undemocratic, secretive process," says Jamie Trinkle of the group Enlace, which has pushed heavily for divestment from private prison companies. "This is not in line with the city's values and its unanimous support of becoming a sanctuary city, of supporting fossil fuel divestment, of asserting support for Standing Rock." Wheeler's proposal is to use a system from New York-based firm MSCI that rates corporations on their "environmental, social, and governance-related business practices" (ESG for short). Portland spends $37,500 a year to subscribe to the ratings service, and agrees to keep the data secret. "The contract obligates the City to not disclose MSCI's detailed ESG methodology or individual company ESG-ratings," reads a memo Cooperman wrote in February. Under the proposal, the City of Portland would only be allowed to invest in companies that meet MCSI's middle-of-the-road "BBB" rating or higher. According to Cooperman, using that baseline would allow Portland a pool of roughly 24 companies it could invest in. (Walmart and fossil fuel companies would still be explicitly off limits.) What are those companies? The city won't say. Even when the Mercury asked for a list divorced completely from companies' ratings, the city refused, saying that MCSI "confirmed they would consider the requested information proprietary as the ratings are their intellectual property."  Activists aren't just worried about this secrecy. They've suggested the policy could flout state law by giving undue influence over investments to a private firm. And they're worried that the ratings system doesn't consider issues properly, being more concerned with how corporate actions might affect a company's bottom line than society at large. Nam points to a 2015 rating from MSCI on Wells Fargo [PDF]—which is supposed to be secret, but which he says he found posted publicly on the company's site. It lists 14 factors MSCI could theoretically take into account for the rating. But as Nam points out, the document gives no weight to three you'd think would be biggies: "carbon emissions," "labor management," and "business and ethics fraud." The result? Wells Fargo earned a "B" rating in 2015, too low to be considered under the plan the city is considering. Then again, the rating might have changed since then. There's no way to know.

Rachel Evans Bloomberg News Published Wednesday, Apr. 05, 2017 11:08AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Apr. 05, 2017 11:08AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Leighton Shantz had barely begun managing part of the $26-billion (U.S.) pension fund for Texas state employees when he got a crazy idea. The fund’s floundering investment-grade bond portfolio was occupying his undivided attention, its strategy clearly broken. No matter what he tried, the securities couldn’t deliver sufficient yield or liquidity. He knew he had to get rid of them; he just wasn’t sure how. The time-tested rules for fixed income, which Mr. Shantz had honed for years as a managing director at Lockheed Martin Investment Management Co. and as a money manager for Tennessee’s retirement system for teachers and state employees, no longer seemed to apply. As he analyzed the broader portfolio over the summer of 2012, it dawned on him that exchange-traded funds, which were becoming increasingly popular investing tools, might prove useful. These funds needed thousands of securities just to exist. Perhaps they could take the bonds off his hands? Yet whenever ETFs came up in conversation with asset managers, they responded how a Texan might react to finding beans in his chili. “Every one of them commented on how stupid bond ETFs are,” says Mr. Shantz, 51. That response didn’t sit especially well with the contrarian. “I decided that either fixed-­income ETFs were truly sensationally stupid - which didn’t explain why their assets were growing so fast - or there was much more to it.” Mr. Shantz and his team of six began studying the funds. What they found intrigued them - so much so that in May 2013 Mr. Shantz forked over $1.35-billion of debt, or almost 20 per cent of the fixed-income book, in exchange for shares in two of BlackRock’s investment-grade bond ETFs. It was a bold move for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, an institution that had only one small trade in bond ETFs under its belt when Mr. Shantz joined. When he later explained the maneuver at an industry event, peers and competitors told him that he was risking his reputation and that he’d gone mad. “They were absolutely convinced that I was a fool,” he says. “In a market dislocation, [they said,] these things would blow up, leaving me in a smoking heap in the ditch.” That wasn’t just fear of the unknown. When the U.S. housing bubble burst in the mid-2000s, the price of some ETFs diverged sharply from the value of their underlying bonds. Given that these funds had since become more sophisticated and complex, some wondered whether they could walk through the fire of a global financial crisis. But Mr. Shantz and his portfolio have yet to find said ditch. Indeed, they’re both alive and well, with the credit book returning an annualized 5.3 per cent over the last three years, beating its benchmark by 60 basis points. “It wasn’t until it was all done that you could breathe in and go, ‘Well, that was awesome,’ ” he says. And the once-esoteric debt ETFs he used? They’re colonizing swaths of investor money that bonds used to rule alone. In pension plans, endowments, and mutual funds, they’ve grown as liquid alternatives to cash and temporary holding pens for capital, and as trading tools. Bond ETFs around the world are swimming in more than $700-billion of cash, with about $480-billion of that in the U.S. Although those sums are a drop in the bucket compared with equity ETFs, which account for about 80 per cent of the $2.8 trillion U.S. market, debt funds are growing at a faster clip than all asset classes other than commodities. Every bond powerhouse from Pacific Investment Management Co. to DoubleLine Capital has started funds to get in on the action. More shares in a BlackRock high-yield debt ETF were traded on its busiest day last year than shares in Wal-Mart Stores, Exxon Mobil, or American International Group during the same session. By ­contrast, similar bonds typically trade fewer than 100 times a day. This rapid explosion of “Debt 2.0” has spurred dislocations and mutations in the market. Regulators worry that ETF brokers can’t keep pace with investor appetite for the funds. Some ETFs flirt with allowing cheaper assets into their portfolios so they grow faster than their competitors. And the products are getting more and more complex. But none of this has slowed their acceptance by the financial community. “It’s gone viral,” Mr. Shantz says. Turning bond ETFs into the next Grumpy Cat was far from Stephen Laipply’s mind when he got the call from Texas in early 2013. Mr. Laipply had welcomed Mr. Shantz to BlackRock’s San Francisco office a few weeks before and was impressed by the fund manager’s thoughtful questions about ETFs. Now Mr. Shantz was back with a proposal. A flood of easy money spilling out from the Federal Reserve had lifted company debt almost 10 per cent in 2012, according to the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index. Investors had two ways to join the party via ETFs: They could either buy shares from existing owners on the stock market, the way they would with Apple Inc. or General Electric Co., or they could ask the ETF manager to create new shares for them. To create shares, an investor could pay in cash or “in kind,” acquiring and delivering an agreed-upon smorgasbord of securities to the fund, which the fund would then absorb and use to support the issuance. A middleman, usually a bank or broker, facilitated the switch. Mr. Shantz wanted to explore an innovative version of the second route: using his book of investment-grade debt to buy the shares. Mr. Laipply had seen this type of portfolio trade only once before, nine months earlier, when he’d swapped 4,000 bonds from a large pension fund for shares in BlackRock’s flagship ETFs. He started picking through Shantz’s selection of securities to determine which bonds might fit into their ETFs. “There were hundreds of bonds,” Laipply says. “We went through a process of just looking at the potential candidates and seeing how they could map onto our ETFs.” Those names were then sent to BlackRock fund managers, who made the final call on whether to accept or reject the offerings. A little more than half the bonds were a match. Elated, Mr. Shantz handed over the debt in exchange for shares in two ­investment-grade ETFs. Just like that, step one was complete. But for Mr. Shantz, that wasn’t the end. The pension plan needed bonds, not these ETFs, and he’d settled on a mix of junk debt and Treasuries. So after lying low for three months, Mr. Shantz quietly arranged step two: selling the ETFs in the secondary market to exit his position and free up capital. By October he’d halved his exposure. By December the shares were gone. Mr. Shantz had his cash - and all without roiling the price of the ETFs. “We didn’t want to show up every day looking for bids,” he says. “You can go into ETFs and buy or sell exposure in size and never tip your hand to anybody.” That versatility is part of what makes ETFs an attractive proposition for money managers frustrated with the clubby world of traditional debt trading. Rules implemented after the financial crisis have crushed the banks and brokers that previously oversaw bond trades, curbing their inventories and manpower and making large trades a laborious process that nimbler competitors can exploit. ETFs offer a speedier, cheaper alternative. The difference between the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell a mainstream junk-bond ETF is about 1 basis point, considerably less than a spread of about 45 basis points to trade the underlying basket of bonds. The fee to create ETF shares is typically less than $1,000. In tumultuous markets, the funds are a safe house for investors, allowing them to remove baskets of bonds from their balance sheets in return for highly tradable equity instruments that they can switch back into debt when markets calm down. Others buy ETFs to earn income on capital they’re waiting to allocate elsewhere. And still more follow Mr. Shantz’s example and use ETFs as a tool to adjust their portfolios. “It’s happening every day at some level and in some form,” says Damon Walvoord, co-head of the ETF group at Susquehanna International Group LLP. “It still has a long way to go before it’s an everyday tool for bond managers, but it’s moving in that direction.” Such a dramatic transformation of the debt market brings challenges as well as opportunities. Regulators fear that share creations could falter if even one or two middlemen who lead these trades quit. The Securities and Exchange Commission needs to review the role of these gatekeepers, Commissioner Kara Stein has said. Difficulties sourcing debt to create ETF shares and managing that risk - particularly overnight - have already pushed some middlemen to stick to cash creations or hand over tricky requests to their competitors. The likes of Susquehanna have dedicated bond ETF traders, but debt and equity teams at some other shops remain divided. The creation process they administer - which is unique to ETFs as an asset class - is also fragmented. Although some bond ETFs demand a basket of securities already found in the fund, others require a portfolio of debt that’s merely similar. The latter makes for a more liquid ETF that’s easier to create, particularly for portfolio trades, but it also incentivizes submitting the cheapest qualifying securities to the fund. ETF managers wanting to increase their assets must walk a fine line between accepting them and diverging too far from their mandate. “We’re evaluating them very closely, but the execution potentially is not as good as doing it yourself,” says Gregory Peters, who runs ­Prudential Financial Inc.’s flagship Total Return Bond Fund. “I’m not an ETF hater by any stretch of the imagination, but those are some of the challenges we face as an active bond manager implementing ETFs into the strategy.” Many other money managers have made their peace with debt ETFs and are weaving them deeper into their books. BlackRock gained 64 institutional users of its bond ETFs last year, while almost 70 per cent of the 100 pension funds, insurers, and ­investment advisers surveyed for a Greenwich Associates LLC report last September said they’d increased their use of the funds over the previous three years. Investors that have already embraced portfolio trades are now utilizing ETFs in lieu of options, swaps, and futures. Instead of entering total-return swaps, they’re finding similar exposure in an ETF. And rather than using credit default swaps, investors are hedging their debt holdings with help from options on ETFs. Exchange-traded funds have also allowed ­investors to bet against entire markets rather than short individual securities. The funds are typically cheaper and require less ­balance sheet space or collateral than buying a derivative. All of that seems a world away from the stakes Mr. Shantz faced using ETFs in 2013. Then, his reputation was on the line; now he uses them almost casually to respond to the needs of his ­portfolio - instantly boosting exposure to a hot sector or ditching a clutch of unattractive bonds. “There are some people who aren’t that bright and would rather fail unconventionally than muddle along conventionally,” he says. “I guess I’m one of those.” Report Typo/Error   More Related to this Story PORTFOLIO STRATEGY Rob Carrick's 2017 ETF Buyer's Guide: Best bond funds PORTFOLIO STRATEGY Rob Carrick's 2017 ETF Buyer's Guide: Best Canadian equity funds This bond ETF is the master of disaster Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

Amazon’s cloud-computing service Amazon Web Services experienced problems in its eastern U.S. region, Tuesday, Feb. 28, 2017, causing widespread problems for thousands of websites and apps. (AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File) (CNN)– Hey, Alexa, can anything stop Amazon? Shares of the e-commerce king, which is also now a cloud computing giant, connected-home leader, drone company, freight airline, Hollywood studio and even a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer, rose above $900 for the first time Tuesday. It’s another all-time high. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) stock is on a seven-day winning streak. The shares have gained 7% during that stretch and more than 20% this year. As a result, Amazon is worth more than $430 billion. That’s nearly twice the market value of its rival Walmart(WMT), which has a market cap of a mere $220 billion. Only Apple (AAPL, Tech30), Google owner Alphabet(GOOGL, Tech30) and Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) are worth more than Amazon. The Jeff Bezos-led company is now more valuable than Facebook (FB, Tech30) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). And with that $900 stock price, Amazon is approaching some rarefied air. The only company in the S&P 500 with a stock price in the quadruple digits is Priceline (PCLN, Tech30), which is trading at about $1,770 a share. The latest surge in Amazon stock comes after news last week that it is buying Middle Eastern e-commerce site Souq.com. Amazon’s success is causing significant pain for other retailers, especially mass merchandisers like Macy’s (M), Kohl’s (KSS), Sears (SHLD), JCPenney (JCP) and Target. (TGT) Several analysts have also lavished praise on Amazon for its Sponsored Products business, which lets sellers place ads on Amazon search listings for specific products and keywords. Some tech and advertising experts are starting to think that Amazon could even challenge Google and Facebook for digital ad supremacy. Investors are also excited about the success of Amazon’s Echo home speaker, which features its Alexa voice assistant. Amazon has the lead over Google Home so far. So will Amazon continue to climb? The stock is extremely expensive, trading at more than 125 times its estimated earnings this year and nearly 75 times its forecast profit next year. But amazingly enough, most Wall Street analysts still think it’s a buy. According to FactSet, two dozen analysts have a stock price target above the current price. Seven put it above $1,000. Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets raised his price target on Monday to $1,200. And that’s still not the highest on Wall Street. Shyam Patil of Susquehanna Financial Group has a price target of $1,250. That’s nearly 40% higher than the current price. And that level, Amazon would have a market value of about $600 billion. Not bad for a company that started out selling books and CDs (remember them?) online.

Police appeal directly to mother suspected of abducting her... Share this article Share A day later, police were alerted that someone had found the phone close to where Yeoman's truck was found. They turned on the phone - which quickly lost power - and took it to a cell phone store in Yuba City.   'These facts and the interviews with family, friends and investigative leads are very concerning and all resources are being utilized,' Gridley Police said. Investigators are currently saying there is no evidence of foul play in Yeoman's disappearance.  The Yuba College student failed to show up for either of her shifts at Starbucks and McDonald's last week Concerned friends said that her disappearance was 'really worrying' and 'not like her' at all The Yuba College student failed to show up for either of her shifts at Starbucks and McDonald's last week. 'No one has heard from her,' Christa Mills, a friend and co-worker told KHSL-TV in Chico, California. 'It's just really worrying and it's not like Aly at all.'   Yeoman's ex-boyfriend of two years, Leo Almonte, said the couple were about to make their reconciliation public just before she went missing, Fox 40 reported. He speculated that she may have taken a back road to get home, in order to avoid authorities as she may have been drinking.  'Everybody just loves her, and I don't see anybody harming her,' he said. Yeoman is described as being 5 ft, 4ins and weighs 115 pounds. She has brownish-blond hair, a nose ring, braces, and a small mole near her left eye. Anyone with information about her case should call the Gridley Police Department at 530-846-5670. A Facebook page has also been set up to help find Yeoman.

Close Large corporations, manufacturers stick with climate pledges despite Trump John Voelcker Apr 5, 2017 Follow John Add to circle Walmart store sign (via Wikimedia)Enlarge Photo The new U.S. president, Donald Trump, is working to eradicate every Obama policy to limit the carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. Having variously called the science behind climate change a "Chinese plot" to hurt the U.S. and referred to it using an expletive for bovine excrement, this shouldn't come as a surprise. He pledged to do that, and he is doing exactly what he said he would. DON'T MISS: Trump Administration goal: undo every climate-change effort A substantial number of U.S. corporations, however, are not following suit. Instead, they are retaining policies that commit them to reducing their overall carbon emissions and otherwise working to limit climate change. Their reasons reflect bottom-line priorities: lower carbon emissions reflect less energy use, which saves them money. Donald TrumpEnlarge Photo And, as a Bloomberg story last week noted, the moves also both counter activist pressure and position the companies against a risk to their future profits from the effects of climate shifts on factories and markets. Corporations "don’t have the luxury of denying" climate change or its potential impact on their businesses, Gina McCarthy, former EPA administrator, told Bloomberg. "They have to invest wisely." Companies that signed the pledge and continue to support Obama's climate-change policies include Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, General Electric, Google, Ikea, Levi Strauss, Mars, Microsoft, Nestle, Pepsi, and Procter & Gamble, among others. CHECK OUT: Trump's climate-change order: now what happens? Wal-Mart is the nation's largest retailer, and it was one of 81 large companies that signed a pledge to cut its carbon emissions in the lead-up to last year's landmark Paris Climate Agreement. Cutting carbon emissions is “good for the business, our shareholders, and customers," Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner told Bloomberg. General Electric GE WattStation charging "If ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process," he continued, "that’s a win too.” A separate piece last week in The New York Times asked whether corporate executives have the president's ear and can affect his decisions on climate policy. It noted that Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GE, says climate change is real—and sits on the president's manufacturing advisory council. Environmental groups suggest that corporate CEOs can play a key role in influencing the administration's climate policies. How that might play out, and any evidence that it is in fact the case, remains to be seen. Last week, President Trump directed the EPA to reassess the Clean Power Plan issued by the agency, which requires each state to come up with a greenhouse-gas emission-reduction plan tailored to local conditions—and empowers the agency to develop one if the state refuses. Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, 2014Enlarge Photo Under fossil-fuel champion and climate-science denier Scott Pruitt, who now heads the EPA, the agency is widely expected to dispense with the plan, though it will need to provide scientific justification for doing so. (Which should be an interesting fight.) Trump also rescinded several orders signed by his predecessor that directed government agencies to consider how climate change will affect their actions and how their actions affect carbon emissions.

A Salisbury Police report said the suspect wore a pink hooded sweatshirt and had “what appeared to be breasts” – and a mustache, reported the Post. He stashed four packs of steaks worth $85.36 in a really big purse and left the store. The suspect was seen getting inside a blue-green Honda that is missing its rear bumper, the Post reported. Anyone with information is asked to call the Salisbury Police Department at 704-638-5333 or Salisbury-Rowan Crime Stoppers at 866-639-5245.

The fund’s floundering investment-grade bond portfolio was occupying his undivided attention, its strategy clearly broken. No matter what he tried, the securities couldn’t deliver sufficient yield or liquidity. He knew he had to get rid of them; he just wasn’t sure how. The time-tested rules for fixed income, which Shantz had honed for years as a managing director at Lockheed Martin Investment Management Co. and as a money manager for Tennessee’s retirement system for teachers and state employees, no longer seemed to apply. As he analyzed the broader portfolio over the summer of 2012, it dawned on him that exchange-traded funds, which were becoming increasingly popular investing tools, might prove useful. These funds needed thousands of securities just to exist. Perhaps they could take the bonds off his hands? Yet whenever ETFs came up in conversation with asset managers, they responded how a Texan might react to finding beans in his chili. “Every one of them commented on how stupid bond ETFs are,” says Shantz, 51. That response didn’t sit especially well with the contrarian. “I decided that either fixed-­income ETFs were truly sensationally stupid—which didn’t explain why their assets were growing so fast—or there was much more to it.” Shantz and his team of six began studying the funds. What they found intrigued them—so much so that in May 2013 Shantz forked over $1.35 billion of debt, or almost 20 percent of the fixed-income book, in exchange for shares in two of BlackRock’s investment-grade bond ETFs. It was a bold move for the Employees Retirement System of Texas, an institution that had only one small trade in bond ETFs under its belt when Shantz joined. When he later explained the maneuver at an industry event, peers and competitors told him that he was risking his reputation and that he’d gone mad. “They were absolutely convinced that I was a fool,” he says. “In a market dislocation, [they said,] these things would blow up, leaving me in a smoking heap in the ditch.” That wasn’t just fear of the unknown. When the U.S. housing bubble burst in the mid-2000s, the price of some ETFs diverged sharply from the value of their underlying bonds. Given that these funds had since become more sophisticated and complex, some wondered whether they could walk through the fire of a global financial crisis. But Shantz and his portfolio have yet to find said ditch. Indeed, they’re both alive and well, with the credit book returning an annualized 5.3 percent over the last three years, beating its benchmark by 60 basis points. “It wasn’t until it was all done that you could breathe in and go, ‘Well, that was awesome,’ ” he says. And the once-esoteric debt ETFs he used? They’re colonizing swaths of investor money that bonds used to rule alone. In pension plans, endowments, and mutual funds, they’ve grown as liquid alternatives to cash and temporary holding pens for capital, and as trading tools. Bond ETFs around the world are swimming in more than $700 billion of cash, with about $480 billion of that in the U.S. Although those sums are a drop in the bucket compared with equity ETFs, which account for about 80 percent of the $2.8 trillion U.S. market, debt funds are growing at a faster clip than all asset classes other than commodities. Every bond powerhouse from Pacific Investment Management Co. to DoubleLine Capital has started funds to get in on the action. More shares in a BlackRock high-yield debt ETF were traded on its busiest day last year than shares in Wal-Mart Stores, Exxon Mobil, or American International Group during the same session. By ­contrast, similar bonds typically trade fewer than 100 times a day. This rapid explosion of “Debt 2.0” has spurred dislocations and mutations in the market. Regulators worry that ETF brokers can’t keep pace with investor appetite for the funds. Some ETFs flirt with allowing cheaper assets into their portfolios so they grow faster than their competitors. And the products are getting more and more complex. But none of this has slowed their acceptance by the financial community. “It’s gone viral,” Shantz says.     Turning bond ETFs into the next Grumpy Cat was far from Stephen Laipply’s mind when he got the call from Texas in early 2013. Laipply had welcomed Shantz to BlackRock’s San Francisco office a few weeks before and was impressed by the fund manager’s thoughtful questions about ETFs. Now Shantz was back with a proposal. A flood of easy money spilling out from the Federal Reserve had lifted company debt almost 10 percent in 2012, according to the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index. Investors had two ways to join the party via ETFs: They could either buy shares from existing owners on the stock market, the way they would with Apple Inc. or General Electric Co., or they could ask the ETF manager to create new shares for them. To create shares, an investor could pay in cash or “in kind,” acquiring and delivering an agreed-upon smorgasbord of securities to the fund, which the fund would then absorb and use to support the issuance. A middleman, usually a bank or broker, facilitated the switch. Leighton Shantz Photographer: Kristin Wrzesniewski for Bloomberg Markets Shantz wanted to explore an innovative version of the second route: using his book of investment-grade debt to buy the shares. Laipply had seen this type of portfolio trade only once before, nine months earlier, when he’d swapped 4,000 bonds from a large pension fund for shares in BlackRock’s flagship ETFs. He started picking through Shantz’s selection of securities to determine which bonds might fit into their ETFs. “There were hundreds of bonds,” Laipply says. “We went through a process of just looking at the potential candidates and seeing how they could map onto our ETFs.” Those names were then sent to BlackRock fund managers, who made the final call on whether to accept or reject the offerings. A little more than half the bonds were a match. Elated, Shantz handed over the debt in exchange for shares in two ­investment-grade ETFs. Just like that, step one was complete. But for Shantz, that wasn’t the end. The pension plan needed bonds, not these ETFs, and he’d settled on a mix of junk debt and Treasuries. So after lying low for three months, Shantz quietly arranged step two: selling the ETFs in the secondary market to exit his position and free up capital. By October he’d halved his exposure. By December the shares were gone. Shantz had his cash—and all without roiling the price of the ETFs. “We didn’t want to show up every day looking for bids,” he says. “You can go into ETFs and buy or sell exposure in size and never tip your hand to anybody.” That versatility is part of what makes ETFs an attractive proposition for money managers frustrated with the clubby world of traditional debt trading. Rules implemented after the financial crisis have crushed the banks and brokers that previously oversaw bond trades, curbing their inventories and manpower and making large trades a laborious process that nimbler competitors can exploit. ETFs offer a speedier, cheaper alternative. The difference between the price at which traders are willing to buy or sell a mainstream junk-bond ETF is about 1 basis point, considerably less than a spread of about 45 basis points to trade the underlying basket of bonds. The fee to create ETF shares is typically less than $1,000. In tumultuous markets, the funds are a safe house for investors, allowing them to remove baskets of bonds from their balance sheets in return for highly tradable equity instruments that they can switch back into debt when markets calm down. Others buy ETFs to earn income on capital they’re waiting to allocate elsewhere. And still more follow Shantz’s example and use ETFs as a tool to adjust their portfolios. “It’s happening every day at some level and in some form,” says Damon Walvoord, co-head of the ETF group at Susquehanna International Group LLP. “It still has a long way to go before it’s an everyday tool for bond managers, but it’s moving in that direction.”     Fixed-income portfolio managers can use {BSKT <GO>} to find liquidity by exchanging bonds for ETF shares. Such a dramatic transformation of the debt market brings challenges as well as opportunities. Regulators fear that share creations could falter if even one or two middlemen who lead these trades quit. The Securities and Exchange Commission needs to review the role of these gatekeepers, Commissioner Kara Stein has said. Difficulties sourcing debt to create ETF shares and managing that risk—particularly overnight—have already pushed some middlemen to stick to cash creations or hand over tricky requests to their competitors. The likes of Susquehanna have dedicated bond ETF traders, but debt and equity teams at some other shops remain divided. The creation process they administer—which is unique to ETFs as an asset class—is also fragmented. Although some bond ETFs demand a basket of securities already found in the fund, others require a portfolio of debt that’s merely similar. The latter makes for a more liquid ETF that’s easier to create, particularly for portfolio trades, but it also incentivizes submitting the cheapest qualifying securities to the fund. ETF managers wanting to increase their assets must walk a fine line between accepting them and diverging too far from their mandate. “We’re evaluating them very closely, but the execution potentially is not as good as doing it yourself,” says Gregory Peters, who runs the ­Prudential Total Return Bond Fund. “I’m not an ETF hater by any stretch of the imagination, but those are some of the challenges we face as an active bond manager implementing ETFs into the strategy.” Many other money managers have made their peace with debt ETFs and are weaving them deeper into their books. BlackRock gained 64 institutional users of its bond ETFs last year, while almost 70 percent of the 100 pension funds, insurers, and ­investment advisers surveyed for a Greenwich Associates LLC report last September said they’d increased their use of the funds over the previous three years. Investors that have already embraced portfolio trades are now utilizing ETFs in lieu of options, swaps, and futures. Instead of entering total-return swaps, they’re finding similar exposure in an ETF. And rather than using credit default swaps, investors are hedging their debt holdings with help from options on ETFs. Exchange-traded funds have also allowed ­investors to bet against entire markets rather than short individual securities. The funds are typically cheaper and require less ­balance sheet space or collateral than buying a derivative. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up All of that seems a world away from the stakes Shantz faced using ETFs in 2013. Then, his reputation was on the line; now he uses them almost casually to respond to the needs of his ­portfolio—instantly boosting exposure to a hot sector or ditching a clutch of unattractive bonds. “There are some people who aren’t that bright and would rather fail unconventionally than muddle along conventionally,” he says. “I guess I’m one of those.”    —Evans covers ETFs for Bloomberg News in New York.

Chicago, IL, April 05, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Automate 2017, and Odense, Denmark – Mobile Industrial Robots, (MiR), a next-generation developer and manufacturer of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), is launching its newest robot, the MiR200, at Automate 2017 in Chicago today. The MiR200 is a more powerful mobile robot in almost every aspect than the company’s flagship MiR100, which has already been installed in more than 30 countries by companies such as Airbus, Boeing, Flex, Honeywell, Michelin, Procter & Gamble, Toyota and Walmart. MiR’s industry-leading AMRs are a dramatic improvement over legacy automated guided vehicles (AGVs), which require the expensive and inflexible installation of sensors or magnets into factory floors for guidance. MiR products are designed to give owners the flexibility to easily redeploy the robots to different processes or facility layouts to support changing business needs and agile manufacturing processes. With the launch of the MiR200, customers now have even more choices in how to effectively, quickly and cost-effectively automate their material transportation needs. “Our robots are changing the game for any size business, from small, regional companies to large multinationals,” said MiR CEO Thomas Visti. “With the new interface of the MiR200, it’s even easier for companies to program the robot themselves and adapt its deployment as their business evolves. That’s critical for their competitiveness, and supports extremely fast ROI. The robot typically pays for itself in less than a year, even in very dynamic environments.” MiR200 offers game-changing user interface, performance and ROI The MiR200 updates MiR’s already-intuitive web-based user interface, making programming even easier for users who have no previous experience and allowing for even more optimized implementation. Updates include customizable dashboards, improved mapping, easier creation of robot missions and tasks, multi-level permissions, responsive web design and comprehensive browser support. Integrated help and product documentation provides additional guidance. The powerful MiR200 doubles the payload capacity of the MiR100 to 200kg/440lbs, and offers a MiRHook option for autonomous towing of carts up to 500kg/1102lbs. The robot offers exceptional flexibility for top modules—including racks, shelves, conveyors, lifts or even collaborative robot arms—which can be easily customized and mounted to meet specific application requirements. With its ESD-compliant exterior, the MiR200 is ideal for electronic assembly applications where parts being transported must be protected from electrostatic discharge. MiR robots offer more high-performance sensor technologies than any other mobile robot on the market. Six separate sensor systems feed data to the robot’s real-time navigation and safety algorithms. This enables quick decisions for highly efficient and safe operation of the robot, even in changing situations where people, extension cords, pallets or boxes can create unpredictable obstacles. Full 360-degree scanning allows the robot to safely back up, rather than being limited to forward motion. Additional sensors prevent blindspots by identifying obstacles above the robot, such as a table, and can look ahead and down to identify holes or stairwells, as well as clear obstacles such as glass walls.

A sale to an investment firm could help Staples escape the glare of the public market, where its shares have more than halved in three years. The move comes less than a year after its proposed merger with rival retailer Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) was torpedoed on antitrust grounds. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is confidential. Staples spokesman Mark Cautela declined to comment on Tuesday. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples had a market value of $5.65 billion as of Monday. Staples shares rose as much as 15.5 percent on Tuesday, and were still up 10.1 percent at $9.54 in afternoon trading. Staples, which made its name selling papers and pens, has for years been hurt by the digitization of the workplace and increased competition from online retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and big-box stores such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT). In 2015, it tried to address these challenges by merging with rival Office Depot, but the deal was called off a year later due to antitrust concerns. Since then, Staples has announced cost-cutting plans and operational restructuring. Last year, it sold its UK business to restructuring specialist Hilco Capital for a “nominal” amount and a majority stake of its European business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. In the United States, it has focused on selling to small businesses in light of changing consumer habits and has embarked on an office sharing program, opening up some of its stores as communal working space. Staples, which has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada, last month announced plans to sell roughly 60 stores in North America. Staples has made executive changes as well, appointing Shira Goodman as CEO in September. Goodman, who had held a number of positions as Staples, also worked for years as a consultant at consulting firm Bain and Co. Private equity firm Bain Capital LLC helped support the founding of Staples in the 1980s and took it public in 1989. Staples has the largest market share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent and that share has been increasing since 2011, according to Euromonitor. TROUBLED SECTOR Private-equity acquisitions of retailers have become increasingly rare, as the investment firms worry about increasing headwinds facing the industry and their portfolio companies struggle with the debt burden left behind from leveraged buyouts. Retail deals comprised the smallest share of mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, backed by buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners, filed for bankruptcy last year. The owners of high-end U.S. department store chain Neiman Marcus, Ares Management LP (ARES.N) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CPPIB have begun to consult restructuring advisers. The level of debt issued by U.S. retailers trading at distressed levels remains elevated, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said last month. In early March, Standard & Poor’s had taken 20 negative actions against retailers, including downgrades of iconic department stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N). Moody’s said in an outlook note last year that the office supply sector will continue to struggle, with operating profit expected to be nearly flat in 2017. Still, Staples’ bonds maturing in 2018 are trading at face value, indicating investor confidence in the company. In its most recent quarter, Staples recorded a net loss of $615 million and a sales decline of 3 percent compared with the prior year. It expects to have at least $500 million in free cash flow this year, according to its quarterly earnings. The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier on Tuesday that Staples was exploring a sale.

Move aside, indoor sports. It is time to celebrate America’s pastime for the next seven months. It doesn’t feel like it was that long ago that I was staying up late watching the Cubs win Game seven of the World Series and completely ignoring an exam I had the next morning. I don’t remember what class the exam was for, but I remember the game. That’s usually how those kinds of things work out. As great as baseball continues to be, I used to think – and still do, to a degree – that we lost sight of what baseball really is: a game. It’s a kid’s game, really. But maybe that’s also why it feels like so much more than just a game to its fans later in life. It becomes a souvenir of sorts from their childhood. Baseball is not changing your underwear because you’re on a seven-game hitting streak. It’s yelling indecipherable chants of encouragement from the dugout when your teammate is at bat. Sometimes it’s being able to call yourself an athlete and still be fat enough to not get questioned when zooming around Wal-Mart in one of those motorized carts. It’s going broke and building a full-size diamond in your cornfield just to play catch with the ghost of your father. And it’s definitely NOT about crying, no matter how much “Field of Dreams” may tempt you. Above all other interpretations of the game, the Fourth of July scene from “The Sandlot” perfectly depicts what baseball, at its core, is meant to be. It’s that part in the movie when the kids play their only night game of the season under the light of the fireworks. It sounds super cheesy, but they played because they loved baseball. They didn’t play for college scholarships. They didn’t have an adult screaming in their faces because the rookie-division-house-league title was on the line. All the “Sandlot” kids cared about was having enough players to field a team and a ball to play with that day. That movie took place in the ‘50s. Things are a little different today. From a young age, thousands of kids around the country are brought up specializing in one sport – in this case, baseball – going to private lessons and clinics year-round. But when you’re 12 years old, there are only so many mid-January practices in a gymnasium and ultra-competitive, whack-job coaches you can stand before falling out of love with baseball. In a way, the competitiveness in youth baseball is robbing kids of what is supposed to be their pastime. A pastime when many years down the road, the smell of a leather glove brings them back to the time their grandfather took them to their first ballgame, or the time their dad first taught them how to play catch. Not a pastime when what mattered was the numbers on the scoreboard or the radar gun. To me, baseball will always be about the times I shared with my dad. The times he’d practically throw his arm out tossing batting practice to me after work because I wanted to finally hit a home run, or the conversations we had in the car traveling to and from games. Kids should still be able to take away memories like these. Memories of something much bigger than just a game. Memories they can look back fondly upon long after their playing days are over that root themselves in a lifelong relationship with baseball.

Done Editing Tags 125 Comments Share this article 138 138 138 The New Brandeis movement wants to demolish a source of that concentration—monopolies. David Dayen at The Nation writes—This Budding Movement Wants to Smash Monopolies: In a conference room overlooking the Chicago River last week, 35 years of thinking about the economy came under direct challenge. It won’t get as much attention as a Sean Spicer press conference or a Bernie Sanders town hall, but decades from now it may prove much more important to how our economy is organized. The University of Chicago Stigler Center’s three-day conference asked, “Does America Have a Concentration Problem?” A sufficient response to this could be “go outside.” Virtually every major sector in our economy has been whittled down to a few major players. Two companies produce nearly all of America’s toothpaste. One, Luxottica, produces nearly all the sunglasses. There are four cable and Internet providers, who have divvied up the country and rarely compete. There are four major airlines. There are four major commercial banks. There are four major Internet platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Google — controlling your information flow, your data, and your virtual life. These markets are shrinking further, thanks to a continuing wave of mergers. Bayer is buying Monsanto to control a significant section of the agricultural seed market. AT&T and Time Warner’s combination would tie a content distributor to a content provider. The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would narrow major chain pharmacies down to two (three if you’re generous and include Walmart). Platform monopolies like Google are buying a firm a week; it’s become a large part of their research and development strategy to acquire ideas and market share simultaneously. This market consolidation has wide-reaching effects beyond the higher prices monopolies can charge due to lack of competition. Quality suffers when consumers have nowhere else to turn. Supply chains become fragile – an outage from Amazon Web Services, the leader in cloud computing, took out half the Internet in February. Economic power begets political power and democratic institutions suffer. Personal liberty to use talents and skills gets stymied when there’s only one game in town. Barriers to entry have led to a decline in business startups and a retrenching of economic dynamism. Inequality grows when a few at the top gather all the rewards in a market. Our growing monopolization didn’t happen by accident. Starting in the 1970s, a group of academics led by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork changed the view of antitrust law, which was originally intended to break up concentrated power. Without altering a word in the Sherman Antitrust Act, Bork and his colleagues – known as the “Chicago school” because of their devotion to University of Chicago neoclassical economic theories – rewrote history, determining that antitrust merely concerned “consumer welfare,” an economic study of prices, rather than effects on competition. Starting in the Reagan administration, the Chicago school’s capture of antitrust theory has brought us to a period of market concentration unrivaled since the Gilded Age. A new group of scholars and activists has rebelled against Chicago school dictates. You can call them the “New Brandeis movement.” Louis Brandeis, before reaching the Supreme Court, advised President Woodrow Wilson in the election of 1912, condemning “the curse of bigness” and favoring breakups of those trusts that the Sherman Act had yet to dismantle. Under Wilson, Congress closed Sherman Act loopholes with the Clayton Antitrust Act, and created the Federal Trade Commission to combat monopoly power. As Brandeis wrote, “We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.” [...] An Activists’ Calendar of Resistance Events TOP COMMENTS • HIGH IMPACT STORIES QUOTATION "To sit home, read one's favorite paper, and scoff at the misdeeds of the men who do things is easy, but it is markedly ineffective.

Kruse (@KevinMKruse) April 4, 2017 BLAST FROM THE PAST At Daily Kos on this date in 2005—Cornyn: Violence against judges understandable: Remarks by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) on the Senate floor today: I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. Certainly nothing new, but we seem to have run through a spate of courthouse violence recently that's been on the news and I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in—engage in violence. Violence against judges is nothing short of domestic terrorism. And Cornyn (along with DeLay and their ilk) are nothing more than apologists for such violence. ​​​ 125 Comments Share this article 138 138 138 125 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Changes could help Honeysuckle traffic problem Lance Griffin Lance Griffin Apr 4, 2017 (…) Lance Griffin Dothan District 4 Commissioner John Ferguson addresses residents during a public meeting Tuesday at the Family Life Center of Selma Baptist Church. Changes could be coming to alleviate congestion and traffic hazards at one of Dothan’s most confusing intersections. The awkward conflagration of Honeysuckle and Hatton Road on one side of South Park Avenue, with Moore Road coming in from the other side at Selma Baptist Church, has caused accidents, near-accidents and congestion for several years. The opening of James Oates Park this weekend, along with expected further development in the general area, will only add to the congestion. One of the most affected areas is Moore Road. Motorists looking to avoid Ross Clark Circle are piling on to Honeysuckle Road and traveling south to South Park Avenue, then jetting across South Park to squeeze on to Moore Road and use it as a cut-through to Taylor Road to access the southside Wal-Mart and, most likely, James Oates Park. According to recent traffic counts, about 2,500 cars travel on Moore Road in any given 24-hour period, about four times more than normal for the dwellings along the road. Assistant Public Works Director Charles Metzger said Tuesday evening during a community meeting held by District 4 Commissioner John Ferguson that the city is looking to construct two cul de sacs on Moore Road that would keep the residences accessible, but preclude cut-through traffic. Metzger also said the cul de sacs would assist in alleviating drainage issues that often lead to flooding. The cul de sacs are relatively inexpensive. The solution appeared to be well received by homeowners along Moore Road. The project could be the first of a handful of projects in the future to alleviate congestion in the area and solve the awkward configuration at the intersection. A comprehensive Honeysuckle Road corridor study is currently being performed. The study begins at Honeysuckle Road and Highway 84 West and is expected to offer suggestions for improvements all the way to Highway 231 South. Potential suggestions include the widening of Honeysuckle Road from Highway 84 West to Fortner Street, a slight movement of Honeysuckle Road north near South Park Avenue to avoid the awkward intersection, and a potential extension of Honeysuckle Road. “We are trying to look at what we can do, and of course that has to do with what we can afford,” Ferguson said Tuesday during the community meeting held at Selma Baptist Church. I travel this area often and I know things right now are sort of edgy at best.” Metzger said solving the traffic issues in the area can be tricky because one solution in one area can cause a greater problem in another. Metzger said he believes the potential widening of Honeysuckle Road to Fortner Street is essential. “At the end of the day, you have to do something about that bottleneck at the front,” Metzger said. Ferguson said the matter is a priority for him because residential development is expected to increase traffic in the future. “This is not just about the ball park traffic,” Ferguson said. Metzger expects public meetings to be held on the Honeysuckle corridor study in June and/or July. About 100 residents attended the public meeting, which also included updates about city finances, sewer projects and long-term debt.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for the S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links at the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1) The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2) the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now. These days only, I generated close to $36k so far with nothing but my computer and some free time, however i have a full-time nine to 5 job. Even everyone new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income may go much very high over time... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Francisco Peña Should have been clearer.. yes, the actual thing won't happen until 2 yrs from now, I meant the referendum, was 9 months ago, but that basically set the wheels moving. My point wasn't to blame Brexit (referendum or otherwise) entirely as it was more the US markets increasing due to Obama leaving... Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? Francisco Peña That's what I meant.. the vote... which led to 9 months later May invoking Article 50. Brexit officially won't happen for 2 yrs, but for all intents and purposes, the referendum started it. StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they? Adil Tajgeer Looks like a 256gb card and some on ear akg bt headphones Scott Looks like AT&T's BOGO deal requires a TV package :( TechGuy22 sounds good really expensive but if i can sell my s7 edge for around 300 then i'd be good Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ WITH an additional line mind you. looks like a great device....but has battery improvements been made?? seems this will have the same lackluster battery the S7's had. Not that they were horrible, in my eyes, they couldve/shouldve been better. TechGuy22 also bootloader better not locked PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It is, if you want that don't bother with Samsung TechGuy22 the exynos will be unlocked. the s7 edge is unlocked running remix rom Corey W. Man that $50 Gear S3 is a killer deal even with the $5/m for 24months, that's only a $170bucks headpiece747 Too bad Verizon is not offering that I would get the S8 and S3 in a heartbeat if they did. Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market. Marty The back looks like my Note 5. Nothing different. kapilmachi S8 is all about the front side. Marty ...except for the fingerprint scanner. Analyst_NYC So if i am already an AT&T customer, I can get buy 1 get 1 free (bill credits)? ArrTooDeeToo Meh Margaritas Ante Porcos Still no word on TouchWiz? Did they make it lighter or does it still suck as always? TouchWiz is the only big thank in Samsung phone that makes me look the other way. Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability? Good_Ole_Pinocchio #Unlocked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f4745c019aae7e3c05746af0e61186e5fb91f093c06fdbaea6e834c1cf1ea30a.png Barron Roth Any downside to getting this version? Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean it's fully unlocked and has the bands for all carriers...... But the unlocked S7 still doesn't have nougat....So theres that. Leonardo Baez You will get updates faster on an unlocked device than a carrier one Good_Ole_Pinocchio No. The US Unlocked models still don't have nougat. All the carrier variants do. Leonardo Baez I bet you that will be an upgrade OTA on the first week after unboxing it Good_Ole_Pinocchio Bro I'm taking about the unlocked S7 from last year lol. Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release. Eddy Nelson Lopez Look at the model number, if it ends with the letter U do not buy it if you care about software updates, if the variant ends with the F then do buy it, that's the best variant to receive Software updates and rhe Fastest thanks to the exynos processor. Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat. (He works closely with samsung and got a preview sample unit) https://youtu.be/n0makpckS8c Maybe is the unfinished firmware or something else.... but the image quality of video and pictures looks better in the iPhone. Maybe something that can be corrected with an update? Jay Quir Not going to lie I have recently thought about going from cricket to att because of their direct tv cell phone plan bundle. Yet still trying to see if it will save me money in the long run. Anyone have that plan and dont mind saying how much they pay a month for it? Ailín Ó’S Irish pricing (probably same in the rest of the EU.) S8: €799.99 S8+ €899.99 Interestingly there's a network here (3) which will sell the phone 8 days before general release if someone preorders. Must be preordered by 12/4 however which means the phone will be available on 20/4 instead of 28/April. Richard Markert 95xU news? Mr. Robot "Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173" I strongly doubt there's much interest in the S8 by 20173 ;-) brgulker Is it just me, or is that fingerprint sensor in just about the worst possible spot imaginable? Who likes fingerprints all over their camera lenses!?!?! Bonedatt It's just you 😉 Wildcard Funny, if this were a HTC phone, you guys would have been killing them over the pricing Bonedatt Yea but htc screwed themselves. Always one step forward two steps backwards. They just started listening again to their customers. A little too late if you ask me, but I wish them well. I'm a fan of their designs. dblock Really on the fence about getting one of these. They appear to be quite nice, but I don't know if I want to lock myself into Verizon or not. Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus. AQ Samsung previously used + on the S6 for the larger screen version (S6, S6 Edge & S6 Edge+) because you could get a 5.1 inch S6 with the Edge screen back then. Dllemm It would help their credibility if (A) they were upfront about pricing and (B) acknowledge that most people use phone cases in their marketing and build the back of their phones more rigid. Daniel Tiberius Anyone know if I can still use Jump On Demand on T-Mobile for this? Flo R. S8 € 799.- S8+ € 899.- In Austria http://www.saturn.at/de/shop/samsung-s8.html?utm_medium=affilate&utm_campaign=SE%5F%5Fsparhamster%2Dpost&utm_source=sparhamster&etcc_var=textlink&etcc_grp=sparhamster&dclid=CNaO16DU_NICFYyPGwodyNEOnA Fiorta I gotta get rid of this Nexus 6. It's terrible... G6 or S8?! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Ju kidding me mon? S8 or S8 Plus. G6 is nice, but not worth $750. iluvthesoftsoft One Plus 3T, and save $300-$400. Bonedatt OP3T... That's the equivalent (processor wise) to the G6. Fiorta Can't finance through TMobile tho right? Eddy Nelson Lopez I can't believe people still buy phones from US carriers, that's the stupidest idea you can have, just buy the european variant at full price and forget about US carriers controlling your software updates and Just use a pre-paid company like Simple Mobile. lomsha You do that and let others make purchases as they wish. It's a free world. krazy $1199 and $1349 in Australia...

By Allison Saunders @alliesaysrelax click to enlarge “I love textiles,” says Cherry. “I can’t get enough of beautiful fabrics.” LENNY MULLINS Katherine Cherry knows a thing or two about starting over. She's moved a lot, and the arduous process of packing things, shipping things and leaving things behind has taught her a lot about furnishing a home, and investing in pieces that are worth holding onto. After studying at NSCAD, Cherry moved on to working in non-arts industries, but could never quite shake her creative, hands-on side. "I always tried to find a design in whatever work I was doing," she says. But it wasn't until years later—when she returned to Halifax after a stint of living in the US—that she refocused her path, and discovered a passion for the world of furniture-making and upholstery. "It's something I love, but I fell into it," she says of her career, which she kickstarted by working as an apprentice at a Dartmouth refinishing and repair shop. "There are not many places that teach upholstery. It used to be taught in some vocational schools, but I learned that it actually is mostly taught in prison." After taking in tips and tricks from seasoned veterans for a couple of years, Cherry decided to branch out and launched Boss Designs—she's "obsessed with Bruce Springsteen"—a business that allows her to focus in on her refinishing skills, and her own mid-century inspired designs from a workshop attached to her home. "You see at Winners, or Walmart, you can go buy a sofa for $200—why would anyone want to get their stuff redone? But you learn that there's no comparison," says Cherry. "The gentleman that I worked with before has been doing it over 40 years and his rule was if it's more than 10 or 15 years old, you're better to reupholster than to buy something new." She's into textiles, colours and dynamic design, but the stories behind the old, tired pieces she works on are her most inspiring muses. Recently, she was commissioned by the Halifax Naval Museum to help bring old pieces from ships back to life for the 100th anniversary of the Halifax Explosion. "One of my favourite parts of this job is coming across something I haven't seen before, and doing the research," she says. "The historical aspect of it I love."

Tresa Baldas , Detroit Free Press 10:58 p.m. ET April 5, 2017 Khalil Abu-Rayyan and Sebastian Gregerson (Photo: Wayne County, Jerry Lemenu) 1 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE On paper, Sebastian Gregerson and Khalil Rayyan sound a lot alike,  if their alleged crimes are any indication. Both are accused of supporting terrorist groups. Both allegedly had an affinity for guns and talked a lot about jihad. Both were stung by the FBI. But one is a white Muslim convert, the other an Arab Muslim with immigrant parents — a difference that one attorney fears could lead to an injustice as the white suspect appears poised to get a much better sentencing deal. The government wants to lock up Rayyan for eight years; Gregerson could get less than half that. Read more: Detroit terror-linked suspect cuts plea deal with feds on explosives Sentencing postponed for Dearborn Heights man accused of ISIS support Rayyan will learn his fate today at a 2:30 p.m. sentencing hearing before U.S. District Judge George Caram Steeh.  Gregerson will be sentenced June 30. Under a plea deal, Gregerson,  a married father of twins, avid hunter and gun enthusiast who converted to Islam after high school, faces three to five years in prison for possessing explosives.  Rayyan, a single, 22-year-old pizzeria worker whose parents are Palestinian immigrants from Jordan,  faces eight years for gun charges tied to marijuana use: He was trying to buy and use a gun while using pot at the same time. Rayyan's sentencing guidelines call for a prison sentence of 15-21 months, but the government says that's not enough and it's pushing for eight years instead,  saying he's too dangerous to roam free so soon. For defense attorney Todd Shanker,  the disparity in possible punishments  raises a  troubling question. "Is Khalil being punished for being an Arab Muslim from Dearborn, as opposed to a Caucasian?" Shanker asked in court, saying "it makes no sense" that Gregerson is facing less time when "his case is far more scary." "He had grenades. He had a machete. He had multiple AKs, 16 guns, thousands of rounds of ammunition, a book on sniper fire and ... he threatened to kill people," Shanker wrote of Gregerson. Shanker has asked for a 15-month sentence for Rayyan, claiming he was manipulated by two FBI undercover employees posing as love interests who pushed him to make radical statements. The federal government paints a different picture. Prosecutors argue that Rayyan deserves a lengthy sentence because — they say — he's a danger to the community, and,  it's necessary to deter others who may be contemplating terrorism or mass shootings.  Prosecutors have alleged that Rayyan contemplated mass murder and talked about being a jihadist, killing women and children at a church, and killing a police officer in a hospital. Khalil Abu-Rayyan  (Photo: Wayne County) "He pinpointed the location for each attack," prosecutors argued in court documents. "And he specified his weapon of choice: an AK47 with a 40-round magazine." "It's clear the defendant is dangerous," Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Waterstreet said in court last month, responding to questions about why Rayyan is facing a stiffer sentence than Gregerson. "He dreamed about jihad," Waterstreet said. "He told others about it." Rayyan, who pleaded guilty to two gun charges,  was never charged with terrorism-related crimes. The government says  that the FBI blocked Rayyan from implementing his ideas because it arrested him first. Rayyan came onto the FBI's radar in 2015 after he allegedly bragged about plans to “shoot up” a Detroit church. The FBI had tracked him through social media, phone conversations and surveillance, following his two Twitter accounts, on which he expressed support for the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. Shanker argues his client is not the man the government is painting him to be. "Rayyan is not a terrorist," Shanker has argued  in court. "He never intended to hurt anyone." Shanker said Rayyan was emotionally manipulated by two FBI undercover employees who flirted and pretended they were romantically interested in him. He fell for it and made "tough guy/radical guy" statements to impress the women, noting one of them claimed to be ready and willing to commit jihad, and that her family members had been killed by anti-ISIS forces. "When push came to shove in their conversations, not only did Rayyan refuse to agree to any act of violence, he pleaded with (one woman) not to hurt herself or others," Shanker argued in court records. Shanker argues that his client "fully and completely understands why the FBI targeted him," but that he now denounces ISIS and understands the "bastardization" of the Muslim religion by radicals. Moreover, he argues, his statements were protected under the First Amendment. Gregerson's lawyer has made similar arguments, maintaining the government overstated its case and that his client's statements on Facebook about the conflict in the Muslim world and terrorist attacks were protected speech. Gregerson, 30, of Detroit was arrested in July after allegedly buying grenades from an undercover FBI agent at a Monroe gas station.  He pleaded guilty to unregistered possession of destructive devices. He was never charged with a terrorism crime, but prosecutors accused him of plotting jihad on behalf of the Islamic State in court documents — information it disclosed in an effort to keep him jailed. The government seized an arsenal of weapons from his home, including  a loaded AK47, a machete, a grenade launcher and hundreds of rounds of AK47 ammunition. Sebastian Gregerson  (Photo: Jerry Lemenu, Special to the Free Press) According to courtroom testimony, Gregerson converted to Islam more than a decade ago after graduating from high school in Ann Arbor. He has worked at Target and Walmart and taken courses at Henry Ford Community College. He remains jailed pending his June 30 sentencing. He faces a maximum of five years in prison. Gregerson has been spared the fate of other Americans who were charged with and convicted of trying to support terrorist groups or join their mission. For example, in February, a Wisconsin man was sentenced to 10 years in prison for trying to join the Islamic State.  Joshua Van Haften, 36, was arrested two years ago on his way to Syria to join ISIS. According to the Department of Justice, he swore allegiance to ISIS in an online post, stating:  “The only thing that matters to me is joining my brothers for the war against America liars.” In 2015, a federal judge sentenced a 19-year-old Colorado woman to four years in prison after she admitted to wanting to join ISIS and participate in jihad in the Middle East. Shannon Conley, a Muslim convert who wanted to marry a Tunisian ISIS fighter and become a nurse in an ISIS camp, had asked for leniency. But prosecutors argued for a tough sentence to deter others from joining terrorist groups and turning to extremism. That same year, a federal judge sentenced Leon Davis, of Augusta, Ga., to 15 years in prison  for attempting to provide material support to a a terrorist organization, specifically ISIS. According to the Justice Department,  for more than a year, an FBI-led team investigated Davis’ attempts to join an overseas terrorist group. He was arrested at an airport in Atlanta on a parole violation.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Economy In a first since 2012, Centre allows duty-free sugar imports In a first since 2012, Centre allows duty-free sugar imports The government on Wednesday allowed duty-free imports of raw sugar up to 5 lakh tonnes to keep domestic supplies steady amid a drop in production. By: FE Bureau | New Delhi | Published: April 6, 2017 6:24 AM This is the first time since 2012 that imports of sugar under the open general licence (OGL) will take place at zero duty, albeit in limited quantity.(Source: Reuters) The government on Wednesday allowed duty-free imports of raw sugar up to 5 lakh tonnes to keep domestic supplies steady amid a drop in production. However, such imports will be allowed only until June 12 under a tariff rate quota, according to a notification in Parliament. This is the first time since 2012 that imports of sugar under the open general licence (OGL) will take place at zero duty, albeit in limited quantity. Imports of raw sugar beyond the stipulated quantity and the deadline will, however, attract the 40% duty that has been imposed since April 2015. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade is expected to soon notify the modalities of such imports. The decision comes barely three weeks after Uttar Pradesh assembly poll results, which has been the traditional epicentre of massive cane arrears due to the state government’s arbitrary fixation of cane prices. Imports of raw sugar at zero duty will allow a mill or a refiner to sell the sweetener in the domestic market at roughly `3-4 per kg lower (after refining it) than the current ex-mill price of white sugar. At Tuesday’s international raw sugar price, the cost of refined sugar in India out of imported raw will work out to around `31-32 per kg, if the sweetener is allowed at zero duty. The food processing ministry has been pitching for allowing more items to be sold, along with food products, to make it more attractive for investors. It also wanted a portion of the proposed investments to be committed for creating farm infrastructure to benefit farmers. However, it wasn’t accepted when the department of industrial policy and promotion had notified the decision last year, as the government wanted to keep the regulations “simple”. It also wanted to take one step at a time, ostensibly keeping in mind the interests of both domestic and foreign retailers, and the BJP’s traditional opposition to further opening up of the retail sector. Also Watch: Recently, e-commerce players Amazon, Big Basket and Grofers applied for approval for retailing locally-produced food products, promising a combined investment of $695 million. Although a final approval from the government is expected soon, the food processing ministry — the administrative ministry in this case — has endorsed the proposals, setting the stage for the first lot of investments to flow in since the government tweaked FDI rules for the sector last year. A section of the government feels while the proposed investments by the e-commerce players in augur well for the sector (although Amazon has proposed to set up its own brick-and-mortar stores as well, apart from investing in e-commerce), for massive investments to flow in at a steady pace and change the retail landscape of the country the entry of big players like Walmart and Auchan are essential. Amazon has proposed to invest $515 million, while Big Basket and Grofers want to invest $155 million and $25 million, respectively. The decision to allow 100% FDI in marketing of locally produced food items was important as food and farm items worth Rs 92,651 crore go waste annually in India due to a low levels of processing and inadequate infrastructure for scientific storage. India is the world’s largest producer of milk and the second largest grower of rice, wheat, fruit and vegetables, but the processing level of such items currently stands at just 10%. The Narendra Modi government has already announced two big rounds of relaxations in the FDI regime, first in November 2015 and then in June last year, easing rules in over a dozen sectors ranging from real estate, pharmaceuticals, food marketing, aviation and defence to e-commerce and banking. Total inflows of FDI (in equity) into India rose 29% in 2015-16 from a year before to $40 billion. Between April and December 2016-17, FDI inflows rose to $46.40 billion, up 1% from a year earlier.

Read: Footage Thought to Show Missing Teen and Teacher at Nebraska McDonald's Is Not Them: Authorities Ed Smart, whose daughter was snatched from her Utah bedroom in 2002 at age 14 in one of America's most notorious kidnapping cases, told Inside Edition that Cummins is manipulating his former pupil, and is "trying to get her into thinking he's doing her this great favor." Elizabeth Smart was held captive by Brian David Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, for nine months. Their brainwashing was so effective that she never attempted to escape. She wore a veil on the streets of Salt Lake City with her captors and even attended parties with them. "She was threatened that her family might be killed if she didn’t comply with what their requests were,” Ed Smart said. He has been closely following Thomas' case. He feels certain that Cummins, 50, is using similar tactics as Mitchell to keep the teen under his control. “They will try to manipulate in any way possible, to get their compliance or 'be their friend,' be in love with them somehow," he said. Beth's father, Anthony Thomas, told the Today show Monday that Cummins began to brainwash his daughter after they were caught kissing in his office.

"He was owning her mind, convincing her."  He said Beth came to believe that her only option was to run away with her teacher. Ed Smart told Inside Edition that once Beth is found and returned to her family, the spell will be broken just like it was with his daughter. “She understood that we unconditionally loved her," he said. "We knew that she had been through hell. Her ordeal was over with."

An ADP Research Institute report showed US companies added 263,000 workers in March, far exceeding economists' expectations for 185,000. “Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a statement, Bloomberg reported. Moody’s produces the figures with ADP. “The gains are broad based but most notable in the goods-producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining,” according to Zandi. The government's nonfarm payrolls report, slated for release on Friday, is expected to show US employers added 175,000 jobs in March. Meanwhile Federal Reserve policy makers might begin easing the central bank’s balance sheet this year, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s March 14-15 meeting released on Wednesday. “Most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee’s reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year,” the minutes showed. “Many participants emphasised that reducing the size of the balance sheet should be conducted in a passive and predictable manner,” according to the minutes. Wall Street rallied. In 1.55pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent. In 1.40pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent. The better-than-expected jobs data underpinned other recent signs of optimism for the US economy. "The GDP number was recently revised upward, jobs continue to look good, inflation is moving in the right direction," Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory Services in New York, told Reuters. The ADP report “was just another piece of the puzzle that gives the market some confidence that we are still on track.” Gains in shares of DuPont and those of Caterpillar, up 2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, led the Dow higher. The only declining stocks in the Dow, as of early afternoon, were Cisco and Wal-Mart, down 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. Panera Bread shares jumped, trading 13.8 percent higher at US$311.88 as of 12.57pm in New York. JAB Holdings, which owns a slew of coffee brands including Peet’s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, agreed to buy the bakery chain in a deal valued at about US$7.5 billion, including the assumption of about US$340 million of net debt. JAB, which also owns Krispy Kreme Donuts, will pay US$315 per share in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. "We view the acquisition as strategically compelling for JAB," Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said in a note, Reuters reported. “We view the acquisition price as high enough to preclude a competing financial suitor.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index eked out a gain of less than 0.1 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, France’s CAC40 Index slid 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index fell 0.5 percent. European bonds slid after Bundesbank President and European Central Bank Governing Council member Jens Weidmann told Die Zeit the time was approaching for the ECB to ease monetary stimulus and that he would welcome a lower pace of ECB bond purchases in a year from now.

Feedback from repeat customers, top online retailers and brand influencers are incorporated into portfolio planning before starting discussions on the future roadmap.

Huffstutter | CHICAGO CHICAGO ABC Broadcasting has lost a last-ditch bid before South Dakota’s highest court to avoid a trial in a beef producer’s $5.7 billion defamation case over reports about a product that critics call "pink slime." The order signed on Monday by state Supreme Court Chief Justice David Gilbertson denied ABC’s petition to appeal a recent ruling letting plaintiff Beef Products Inc (BPI) take its case to a jury. In February, Judge Cheryle Gering of the Union County Circuit Court in Elk Point, South Dakota, said ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co, and its reporter Jim Avila must defend against claims that they damaged BPI by referring in a series of reports to BPI’s “lean finely textured beef” product as "pink slime." Gering did not rule on the case's merits, nor did the Supreme Court. ABC declined on Wednesday to comment while BPI said in a statement it looked forward to holding the defendants accountable. The case is scheduled to go to trial on June 5 and could last eight weeks. Lean, finely textured beef is made from beef chunks, including trimmings and exposed to tiny bursts of ammonium hydroxide to kill bacteria. At the time of the ABC News broadcasts, few Americans realized the product was a mainstay of fast-food burgers, school lunch tacos and homemade meatloaf. BPI said ABC's reports in March and April 2012 implied that the South Dakota-based company's product was not safe, not nutritious and not even meat. The network has called BPI's lawsuit an attempt to chill media coverage of the industry and inhibit free speech. BPI has claimed up to $1.9 billion of damages, which could be tripled to $5.7 billion under South Dakota's Agricultural Food Products Disparagement Act. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has called BPI's product safe. But some retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, stopped selling ground beef containing it after the ABC reports. Several other defendants were previously dismissed from the case, including a former Agriculture Department microbiologist said to have coined the term "pink slime" in a 2002 email. The case is Beef Products Inc et al v. American Broadcasting Cos et al, First Judicial Circuit Court of South Dakota, Union County, No. 12-292.

An ADP Research Institute report showed US companies added 263,000 workers in March, far exceeding economists’ expectations for 185,000. “Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a statement, Bloomberg reported. Moody’s produces the figures with ADP. “The gains are broad based but most notable in the goods-producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining,” according to Zandi. The government’s nonfarm payrolls report, slated for release on Friday, is expected to show US employers added 175,000 jobs in March. Meanwhile Federal Reserve policy makers might begin easing the central bank’s balance sheet this year, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s March 14-15 meeting released on Wednesday. “Most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee’s reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year,” the minutes showed. “Many participants emphasised that reducing the size of the balance sheet should be conducted in a passive and predictable manner,” according to the minutes. Wall Street rallied. In 1.55pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 percent. In 1.40pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.7 percent. The better-than-expected jobs data underpinned other recent signs of optimism for the US economy. “The GDP number was recently revised upward, jobs continue to look good, inflation is moving in the right direction,” Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory Services in New York, told Reuters. The ADP report “was just another piece of the puzzle that gives the market some confidence that we are still on track.” Gains in shares of DuPont and those of Caterpillar, up 2 percent and 1.9 percent respectively, led the Dow higher. The only declining stocks in the Dow, as of early afternoon, were Cisco and Wal-Mart, down 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent respectively. Panera Bread shares jumped, trading 13.8 percent higher at US$311.88 as of 12.57pm in New York. JAB Holdings, which owns a slew of coffee brands including Peet’s Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, agreed to buy the bakery chain in a deal valued at about US$7.5 billion, including the assumption of about US$340 million of net debt. JAB, which also owns Krispy Kreme Donuts, will pay US$315 per share in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. “We view the acquisition as strategically compelling for JAB,” Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said in a note, Reuters reported. “We view the acquisition price as high enough to preclude a competing financial suitor.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index eked out a gain of less than 0.1 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, France’s CAC40 Index slid 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index fell 0.5 percent. European bonds slid after Bundesbank President and European Central Bank Governing Council member Jens Weidmann told Die Zeit the time was approaching for the ECB to ease monetary stimulus and that he would welcome a lower pace of ECB bond purchases in a year from now.

Jeff Bezos, who upended the retail industry as a dominant seller, will power his warehouse forklifts with a novel deal. In exchange for buying hydrogen fuel cells, Amazon gets a potential discounted stake in the supplier, Power Plug. And the customer's imprimatur could make a good investment even better. The e-commerce titan's obsession with efficiency is reflected in the arrangement to spend up to $600 million on the battery-substitution technology. The validation sent Power Plug's shares rocketing up some 75 percent. Warrants that Amazon received as part of the transaction are already in the money. Bezos is always looking for ways to squeeze more out of his all-important distribution centers. For example, Amazon has deployed some 50,000 Kiva Systems robots to retrieve and replace goods after paying $775 million to buy the company five years ago. Likewise, fuel cells should help make industrial machines more reliable and run longer. Unprofitable Plug Power benefits in several ways, too. Starting with some $70 million of new revenue from Amazon over the next nine months could help it inch toward the black. Having both Amazon and Wal-Mart as customers now may help persuade others to give its technology a try. A stock sale arranged earlier in the week also will be far less dilutive. There is of course some circular logic to the deal. Even so, almost two-thirds of the warrants Amazon is getting are priced at $1.19 for each Plug Power share, and the rest at a 10 percent discount to where they trade once Amazon's orders reach $200 million. The warrants vest based on fuel-cell purchases, with all of it accruing at the $600 million threshold. In one way, it's just an overly complex rebate. In another way, however, by endorsing both fuel cells and Plug Power, Amazon also turned the relatively simple business of being a customer into a canny act of venture capitalism.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous Gold falls after US jobs data, Fed minutes limit losses     Next CBOT wheat ends higher on light technical buying Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The UK’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.1 percent. Meanwhile, France’s CAC40 Index slid 0.2 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index fell 0.5 percent. European bonds slid after Bundesbank President and European Central Bank Governing Council member Jens Weidmann told Die Zeit the time was approaching for the ECB to ease monetary stimulus and that he would welcome a lower pace of ECB bond purchases in a year from now.

Megan Geuss - Apr 5, 2017 9:26 pm UTC Enlarge / Forklifts outfitted with Plug Power hydrogen fuel cells. Plug Power reader comments 67 Share this story On Wednesday, hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power announced that Amazon would be changing its battery-operated forklifts to hydrogen fuel cell-powered ones at 11 of its fulfillment centers. According to Reuters, Amazon secured the right to buy up to 23 percent of the company as well, which would make the online retailer one of the largest shareholders in the fuel cell company. Plug Power said in a press release that Amazon would be spending about $70 million in 2017 to purchase Plug Power’s GenKey systems, which include fuel cells for forklifts, stationary fuel cells for backup power, hydrogen fueling infrastructure and fuel, as well as customer support. Hydrogen fuel cells are seen as interesting alternatives to batteries because batteries can take a long time to recharge, whereas fuel cells are simply refilled, like filling up the gas tank in a car. There’s also no real waste or emissions associated with using hydrogen to power a vehicle, besides harmless H2O. But there are downsides, too. Making hydrogen often relies on burning greenhouse gases, so critics say it’s not truly a carbon-neutral fuel. And transporting hydrogen is more difficult than transporting, say, gasoline, as it often needs to be compressed or kept at very cold temperatures. Still, fuel cell technology is being developed by GM in partnership with the Army and the Navy, as well as Toyota and Shell. Companies like Walmart and Kroeger have deployed Plug Power fuel cell forklifts in their warehouses. Back in 2015 we reviewed the Toyota Mirai, one of the first production cars to use a hydrogen fuel cell. In its press release, Plug Power noted that its partnership with Amazon will be unique, as the fuel cell company will collaborate with the retail giant on “exploring the expansion of applications for Plug Power's line of ProGen fuel cell engines,” which could include applications in cars and trucks. According to the Albany Times Union, Plug Power had $85.9 million in revenue last year, so the Amazon deal could nearly double that figure this year. Plug Power has not yet seen a profitable quarter. Correction: Headline was changed to clarify that the old forklifts used batteries to provide electricity, and the new forklifts use hydrogen fuel cells to provide electricity.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall St dip claws back 200-point gain Margreet Dietz Thursday April 6, 2017 Share Moody's chief economist Mark Zandi Play NBR radio on Wall Street climbed then crashed after the mid-afternoon release of US Federal Reserve minutes that suggested officials may begin reducing the central bank’s balance sheet later this year. Earlier, the benchmark Dow Industrial had climbed 200 points and the Nasdaq reached a new high as better-than-expected US jobs data bolstered optimism about the outlook for the US economy and corporate profits. The ADP Research Institute report showed US companies added 263,000 workers in March, far exceeding economists' expectations for 185,000. "Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a statement. Moody's produces the figures with ADP. "The gains are broad based but most notable in the goods-producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining," hee said. More jobs data coming The government's non-farm payrolls report, slated for release on Friday, is expected to show US employers added 175,000 jobs in March. Meanwhile, minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's March 14-15 meeting revealed policy makers might begin easing the central bank's balance sheet this year. "Most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year," the minutes showed. "Many participants emphasised that reducing the size of the balance sheet should be conducted in a passive and predictable manner." Wall Street rallied then fell in the final hour of the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 41.09 points, or 0.2%, to 20,648.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.6% to 5864.48 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index eased 0.3% to 2352.95. US government bond prices edged lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note rising to 2.352% from 2.350% on Tuesday. Bid for bakery chain In corporate news, Panera Bread shares jumped 13.8% to $US311.88 after JAB Holdings, which owns a slew of coffee brands including Peet's Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, agreed to buy the bakery chain in a deal valued at about $US7.5 billion, including the assumption of about $US340 million of net debt. JAB, which also owns Krispy Kreme Donuts, will pay $US315 per share in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. "We view the acquisition as strategically compelling for JAB," Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said in a note, Reuters reported. "We view the acquisition price as high enough to preclude a competing financial suitor." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index eked out a gain of less than 0.1%. The UK's FTSE 100 Index gained 0.1%, France's CAC40 Index slid 0.2% and Germany's DAX Index fell 0.5%. European bonds slid after Bundesbank President and European Central Bank Governing Council member Jens Weidmann told Die Zeit the time was approaching for the ECB to ease monetary stimulus and that he would welcome a lower pace of ECB bond purchases in a year from now.

Photo / Getty Images Wall Street climbed, pushing the Nasdaq to a record high, as better-than-expected US jobs data bolstered optimism about the outlook for the US economy and corporate profits. An ADP Research Institute report showed US companies added 263,000 workers in March, far exceeding economists' expectations for 185,000. "Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017," Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania, said in a statement, Bloomberg reported. Moody's produces the figures with ADP. "The gains are broad based but most notable in the goods-producing side of the economy including construction, manufacturing and mining," according to Zandi. The government's nonfarm payrolls report, slated for release on Friday, is expected to show US employers added 175,000 jobs in March. Meanwhile Federal Reserve policy makers might begin easing the central bank's balance sheet this year, according to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's March 14-15 meeting released on Wednesday. "Most participants anticipated that gradual increases in the federal funds rate would continue and judged that a change to the committee's reinvestment policy would likely be appropriate later this year," the minutes showed. "Many participants emphasised that reducing the size of the balance sheet should be conducted in a passive and predictable manner," according to the minutes. Wall Street rallied. In 1.55pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8 per cent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.6 per cent. In 1.40pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 0.7 per cent. Continued below.

Airport security clampdown 'the biggest in 10 years' The better-than-expected jobs data underpinned other recent signs of optimism for the US economy. "The GDP number was recently revised upward, jobs continue to look good, inflation is moving in the right direction," Myles Clouston, senior director at Nasdaq Advisory Services in New York, told Reuters. The ADP report "was just another piece of the puzzle that gives the market some confidence that we are still on track." Job growth is off to a strong start in 2017. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics Gains in shares of DuPont and those of Caterpillar, up 2 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively, led the Dow higher. The only declining stocks in the Dow, as of early afternoon, were Cisco and Wal-Mart, down 0.3 per cent and 0.1 per cent respectively. Panera Bread shares jumped, trading 13.8 per cent higher at US$311.88 as of 12.57pm in New York. JAB Holdings, which owns a slew of coffee brands including Peet's Coffee and Keurig Green Mountain, agreed to buy the bakery chain in a deal valued at about US$7.5 billion, including the assumption of about US$340 million of net debt. JAB, which also owns Krispy Kreme Donuts, will pay US$315 per share in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. "We view the acquisition as strategically compelling for JAB," Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said in a note, Reuters reported. "We view the acquisition price as high enough to preclude a competing financial suitor." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index eked out a gain of less than 0.1 per cent advance from the previous close. The UK's FTSE 100 Index gained 0.1 per cent. Meanwhile, France's CAC40 Index slid 0.2 per cent, while Germany's DAX Index fell 0.5 per cent. European bonds slid after Bundesbank President and European Central Bank Governing Council member Jens Weidmann told Die Zeit the time was approaching for the ECB to ease monetary stimulus and that he would welcome a lower pace of ECB bond purchases in a year from now. - BusinessDesk By Margreet Dietz Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

US President Donald Trump faces his biggest test as a world leader when he meets Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the first time in Florida. Mr Trump has already signalled it will be difficult and warned he will go it alone on North Korea if China doesn't help. But trade is likely to dominate. Mr Trump has staked his presidency on bringing jobs back to the US and reducing America's huge trade deficit with China. Many experts say his plans are unlikely to succeed. What happens when the two leaders meet at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Thursday (local time) will be felt around the world. Together China and America make up 40 per cent of global economy. Presidents' traditional trade stance reversal James McGregor has been living in China for more than 25 years and is a former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. "The Chinese will want to take measure of Donald Trump and figure out how they can deal with him," he said. "There is two strong personalities running each country so it's going to be person to person. "The 19th party congress is coming up for Xi Jinping later this year so he will want to look all knowing and powerful … The Chinese don't want anything embarrassing to happen so they want a quick talk and get out of town." US-China trade war threat The biggest economic risk Australia faces this year is a trade war between two of our biggest trading partners, writes David Taylor. On the face of it Mr Trump and Mr Xi are totally different people: Mr Trump the dealmaker, real estate developer, reality-TV-star-come-president, and Mr Xi the hard-line communist party supremo. The great irony is their public stances have been reversed. Mr Xi is now spruiking himself as a champion of free trade, sounding like US presidents of the past. Mr Trump on the other hand is going back to the era of protectionism and idea that it will lead to greater prosperity and strength. Trade imbalance a focus for Trump A basis of co-operation needs to be found for there is a lot at stake. Annual trade between the US and China is now about $US600 billion. America's biggest exports are aircraft, machinery and soybeans, totalling $US116 billion. But Chinese imports at $US463 billion are four times bigger — the major ones being consumer electronics, clothing and machinery. Mr Trump wants this huge trade imbalance addressed when he meets Mr Xi. Mr McGregor says Mr Trump's team will be pushing "countervailing duties, anti-dumping measures, all steel aluminium dumping, and excess capacity being dumped overseas". "The US is going to focus on that and that's people he had brought into his administration," he said. China can quickly retaliate to hurt vulnerable US, Trump But most economists say Mr Trump's pledge to bring back jobs to the rust belt of America is unrealistic. To remain competitive, US workers would have to accept much lower wages and worse conditions. Professor Michael Pettis from Peking University says it's just not that simple anymore. "In the manufacturing of most electronics there is often one leg of that's gone through China because it has cheap disciplined labour and cheap domestic costs," he said. "When the US buys a finished product it could have gone through five to 10 different countries. So it's very complex these days." Mr Trump's threat to impose tariffs of up to 45 per cent on Chinese imports will also hit US firms, such as Apple, which assemble goods in China. American consumers will lose out with much higher prices. Mr McGregor says if any kind of trade war erupts, China can easily and quickly retaliate to hurt Mr Trump. "They are going to be screaming at the White House and it's going to be farmers and workers, his base — people that voted for him — that would get hit by this," Mr McGregor said. "He's going to wake up pretty quickly. China will go after big multinationals like Walmart, GE, Caterpillar, Intel — they have big stakes in China. "If it comes to that everyone will lose." 'The President has been schooled' China has been one of the biggest benefactors of globalisation so it will continue to push its win-win message. It says America has benefited, and in 2015 bilateral trade and investment created 2.6 million American jobs and saved every American family $US850 a year. Henry Wang, from the Chinese Think Tank Centre for China and Globalisation, says Mr Xi may offer Mr Trump job-creating Chinese investment in America and greater access to Chinese markets. Mr Xi at least will want to hear Mr Trump is committed to the one China policy. Mr Trump is a businessman, so if he is looking for the best deal, the biggest benefits, who else can be the best provider but China? At end of the day Mr McGregor too, says Mr Trump is likely to be pragmatic. Mr McGregor and many others have been to Washington to advise the new administration. "The President has been schooled," he said. "All these CEOs going into the White House who have big stakes in China are telling him if you try to do China like Mexico, you're going to have a bad day. "So he's backed off until recently. Now he's ramping up, but I don't think he will be wacko. I think he'll be forceful, but not really wacko."

You Might Like Transcript - Not for consumer use. Robot overlords only. Will not be accurate. Relocated seats on April the fifth to get I get a right again. Righter then right again. Chris Curtis what is up Ken layered Mike Toni came through let's ease off a match on the mossy I told you from the start mailed it. Indeed 2017 Kirk and Callahan. A hole of the year eight holes right again layered on to Marcy who edged out the right time the subject to Boston Kevin thanks to calmer entire. I think Evans and actually cartman ahead. Occurred in Cali Schobel money Jones Natalie and recite that he does a yet to see you know aren't our -- -- I'm just thankful that the white guy was a bigger hole Boston has more over reputation for being racist in any and I think Boston can remove. Sigh of relief here and knowing that we're not that racist today the more you say you're not races the more you sound like are you racist you know the official Twitter bulls kitty kitty so we had to break debt. So we would do very scientific method of me just lying at the end of we have. The final tally is still 5050 the zone believe it during the break the callers have spoken and on the Texas have too by the way. It is pretty unanimous among the book among the techs and the calls during the break that John Hamas yeah. Well I will. Always for coming. Analysts say every texted this morning for two months into. Some calls and some I mean the texts and calls both said that it was the lawsuit but either way you know we wanted to get to moss 2000 picked followers some addict Keefe can mock kids. Twitter audit next time not to ship on Kurt have a friend of the program curtain and ran 191679. Fake. Yet while Blassie's very well deserving as honoree this year he was in the spotlight for a couple of reasons of late there are probably people who own slaves who felt though that was my favorite act guy worked about hired its at all but really I think it's still goes back to the to the locker rate that's the that's the essence of the to bossy than a minute old Beverly. That will be his scarlet letter for the rest of his life I'll have to Wear and further arrests that will never ever ever dissipate I tell you when we have animal and there are the same three to five people a call Wednesday morning Curtis daily listener turning up the radio (%expletive) Tamar. It's like it just wears those people actually somewhat believe usually for people call in and they say that the other argument to listen to every word Kirk injures. We get those glossy colors I have a feeling the biggest in mobiles and that we Loren and you know my friends good morning. Police to get those with tangling when he was it in last year was Kirk entangling who finished. City city right which we play the audio today it was a controversial ending this is two years arrow the idol finalists come down to an exact time. But Curtis but it with the flow right now we have. Quite as look at me look at each citizen and 2011 votes which makes them says there was a mark next to one name or another yeah probably the most beat. Somebody figure who has more votes and I know it's hard to place but then again I just lived on in space for a year I think we could figure who has more votes in that in the 4000 vote balance that's that's yes. Despite a call demanding yes it's not so much that yes nice stride did you fail. They'll be asking for a reason tree I lost able caught just laugh your failure temple I don't know what we're sorry the Twitter doesn't display the boats how many votes does not percentages of what you know Robert. You're just asking you did you fail I didn't feel it that you tell us how many vote Kirk go what are you feel that the Mexico later Dale's right. This is perfect that's the only way effort and enable move with no end April co eight holes. We're Twitter cannot solve it cannot be solved in last year Gerri was very rude I'd forgotten that he told me I was a failure I pleasant. Defending its unelected. That voice I will never used to hearing that ever. The deal my voice all your old girl DO Curtis off I didn't feel. Discussed discussed. While you. Changed. Its them. Like yours better today you throttled or blank that there is a narrative away a brutal showboat Roemer and Gilani last all did in. Bloggers try to talk to Roemer about these wire you the media on bugs that policy and Alex. Mr. saying basically you know right things to be read Crist pleasure to join you tonight Chris compared to a the last month late Friday with the drill layered what he would house. Of the breakdown. Fireworks last Friday with with a cue me we right ought to know he had a wonderful people. Gaelic how do you feel. Things on what can you explain what happened yesterday. Yes look it's. So we had Lamar ball on yesterday because when of that and I mentioned seat in the bar ball made sense or are so he is bought his kids. 100000 dollar cars right yes and then he made a comment about now. Ali you know white people are brought up one way or block people brought up another way and I says no social. Went wait a how many white people get a 100000 dollar cars are sixteen. Indeed a comic all like music I mean obviously Brett joke you the album. And then Dale's like my three kids and now I did not like how odd to look at 92 Ford Taurus right so than Curtis thinks it's wetter. And I went to saint Paul's view as a prep school and there. And he's like keep was the only kid at saint Paul's in the ninety Taurus I guess insinuating. I've been hiding all the Stanley wealth right so loaded icon from money that's got that it's my triggers Evan is. When people assume that everybody went to a prep schools it's filthy rich like they only allow the Vanderbilt in the Kennedys to go to prep school he's angry I guess I'll multiple sources and kitchen with in this building that says that he was. This shouldn't bother me as much as it does bloodied it does remains missed it destitute and yours truly yet so anyway sides respondent the Curtis made a comment about how you know he'd quit. And walked away from the job and apparently had no consequences. You feel about that. I've known Rick since we computed on the hard knock fields of the ISL when he was at saint Paul's and I was the river's edge and back before when you were did this eight has well. I've played. Baseball football rivers noted he had at a saint Paul's point against each other and always like a nice guy had a really old Judy cargo which was weird but a place. To place that say at Saint Paul Reuben is gonna (%expletive) third Roman numeral after their name fifty grand a year but whatever you know whatever. And the whole Bart real real real two or profit there's a bit and ask would go a tough times don't last tough people do credit him that was responsible and anger came with that we. Once said that it was. Fired about consequences I would tell them that I got two full time jobs and review before its first. And opening OK okay okay. You are actually fired correct you actually like you quit as it was spun came back Europe sabbatical. Let's sabbaticals over. By the therapy yes Rick yes. I backed. It was good I have very high levels of anxiety and then I'll really I guess renewed chorus yeah the tour. The care of some things health wise up like in order it's reasonable return. A giant in the industry titans somewhere in Syria deport. Him. The show was a lot more welcoming some regard. Us exactly welcoming. He suffered seriously I teacher freaking guts I certainly hope your targets when I purchased for guys like your wife's arms and really I really hope that happens you suck I hate your guts I get yourself to choke. Sock you saw. So just do recap tomorrow sees the whole the year Kirk. Lost its fastball and he goes out in the semis to blow money Jones that's embarrassing it's entered Paris Mets he's mobile he's become irrelevant. I was stunned honest to god I did not I thought that was going to be a even on. Tomorrow she said on Monday. At families like Hulk he was this that Kirk it's such an easy field right. That was going to be a joke. I 99 on and on and off. And no there early returns just stock went like 62 to. 38 oddly racist Boston personal. We were so does the mayor elect have a conversation about the Saddam talk to him about his experience what he's experienced some Boston I think you spoke with him impress people. Or I highly doubt it's gonna come by at the finish line Alan I don't think he's gonna make an appearance. On the Tuesday April 4 edition of key NC which were battery get three ships that it does pretty well it's that's a lot to get through but we get muddy and with Kirk and year but took a beating I would say. She'll be 8 o'clock segment probably we can't complaining to sound out seems to be some Kerr fought for behind the scenes but the the scoreboard update was getting tarnished it was it was a tough Tuesday for much. Applause today with the with cork out. Though it was a little goes where it's started to sort of organic thing of explaining you know. There was a joke and hang of explaining you know there was a joke in there about the final four. You college basketball North Carolina and Inzaghi here and on a flight to station WEEI beginning at 732. We got. Goldman Sachs mock UNC. The national championship game. And in the process of getting good joke. Zag wins my wife is gonna beat me in our bracket challenge means I have a lot of want to do for next week I think that there. So that a segment of a certain broadcast is good banter back and forth between my apartment in my different Pittsburgh did witty repartee. And be. The intent as the play that in sort of focus on the printer and Jerry and Kirk sort of fixated on com. The scoreboard element of said segment. And the scores that were being discussed which is not. Well it's a little bit of an insult to segment. I guess but really they were criticizing much creative liberties in choosing to update the brewers game in particular which. A little bit honestly I would put in Mike Trent. You did discuss an exodus and yawkey way wow that's the whole team it's my guys that's my squad Friday noted Abram Friday rim not a out. Does so is and I thought it was all good fun I. Listen I S senate Tuesday at thing Peter Clarke are with the best our yesterday. Every actor Kirk category aunts but Adrian Peterson craps not knowing whether he was down. He will be a big way you don't know for years and you know he's got a bag probably it's pretty okay are they have to do catcher it's explain in simple plays an early to tell congress they explained to me that's. Quite. The that. Really. Efforts have not reached to throw in the just ask you pack it up pretty idiot on this he's really shocked shocked that it. I have a conversation as the light to a huge idiot but lump the you guys had nothing I've gotten about him or not the week I recognized the way we ought not reached yes we have and because you sound like table August. I thought it was a good sick but I thought the and much deftly took the brunt of the anger about this by the way I should copped it is starting the clock sync Tuesday. Much as I've criticized my good friend might. For going low hanging Curtis Langley air Israel hanging fruit fighting the exit routes and things get hot oh boy that I go lagging my. And can mattered Chris Curtis again answer here I guess and I couldn't have been lots of fourth. I would say characters that are sure I've analogue in his journey here for the first two hours thirteen minutes producer Richard yen is worried. Trying to think something. I think I would rather he was on need to start you and I really early producers were assigned to feel. Little carcass out there was the player rattle for a little while at work dull boy did it work that much so forth. Through Yahoo! it was anybody's in the water. And I'll write the cafeteria. Lou is open it's yet to deal for you recount so. The bullet. A potted plant that potted plant anyway that brings the Wednesday show Kirk was off we had air shows money to write decent decent. Today we never it's going to be without Kirk it typically it's a big drop off in that show will suck it's always going to be drop off and Kirk. Or Jerry. I thought it was a great show and it was a definite Jordan know what to expect in terms of what exact direction the guys and girl we're gonna get into him O'Reilly off the top yup. Was great the advertisers you know leaving him. Having training today is the female about the sexual harassment workplace was good. Obviously good Nance I thought was that the biggest takeaways today with a great story that month found. It is the most magnificent. Hydrant reboot spoke to me like every way you can actually say this it's spoke to me the red balls until I am I to of the kind that sort of hi my feelings. Passage so they got married on his second double what it was perfect. Arnold Palmer was there the sex of any Jeep perfectly when he got the early morning. Rain a lot Bonnie Nettles is an excellent A Flock of Seagulls soared along the horizon as the two exchange house this isn't Brian user who wasn't there a writer from the Washington Post who says. A Flock of Seagulls. Soared over on the rise. Does this guy have an editor. Anyone read this report comes in a conflict of sales soared on the horizon to horizon which kind of 00. Jim Nantz in the Washington Post and that was led to the golf digest which led to the toes which led to defeat the grounds Wednesday at Augusta yeah ironic that Phil Simms is in the news because he's getting bounced in gymnastics the front how about that. Right now and you know I thought we did a little too much on marsh and today I. I mean it was a little too this or for foreign trending. The wind coming despite playing two periods without Brad marsh and it was given game misconduct for a spear to the groin. I thought I would have the right stuff today we had one thing that I wish we got to buck we just were. Blame me I shoehorn the O'Reilly and consider wanted to get that emits and tired and we hadn't played it would play in little drops of my favorite things this show has ever play and. That's tomorrow and that is it for us today and we will leave you with me. I can't do it. We'll do a lot. Oh well good why. Door hi I don't look a lot. That's tomorrow and that is it for us today on Bill O'Reilly thing. Mean price guy our name any day now any day now. So we got better and that we didn't get to Jerry's girls sewage Steele I have found like number two sage Steele yes there was speck tack I. It's staged daily at the Michael Irvin regards Michael has an office prop fine. I don't know how do you think that it went it was I'd like I say I was impressed I thought this is a good in case of emergency Kirk is suspended for a week. This is our writing goes to Oprah and Jerry with tritium. Pretty canister Chinese not afraid to go anywhere. She gets in the Celtics talk in Celtics history. She's a bit out of water disposal times time he'll levels and are asked to what do you think attitude you if you're current flu a fewer. But she still willing it is the talk about it she was Britain that Andy chin a little bit for work on it locally in the older and each in Jordan comparison. She's not afraid to talk about a contest brother okay natter find out. And I'll tell you one thing turning those ten times more about so which district richer. He's having this season he's had and his colleagues who murdered at his bags of Dole's 42 days no doubt you know sales debut tonight and we spent most of the 8 o'clock hour Celtics but we still got enough I think of typical day and see stuff that Kirk would be at least happy with the topic to approach it. That I think the Susan Rice much of a good job headlines today of just sort of introducing a sound read in the story getting Susan Rice and Andrea Mitchell finally it's nothing to know my. Lying two weeks ago about the wiretapping claims and I think about this and just letting Jerry Trainor illegal out of a thought was good. I was a very you know a little long but good fifteen minutes sort of back and forth in headlines and you know overall I thought. Today moved and I was insured not just because Kirk result but because of the topics what was really gonna stick mineral disorder known to. For that money in training and it worked together. It's true that could have been awkward at the dual two pros they have the well what do you by the way. Training new show tentatively start she really seems to Alicia fakes it well enjoy the radio. Part but I just get the sense an elitist tag Alicia will prove photos give a chance. But two hours every night a trainee entangling us. Joe's going to be great Canadian may. Yeah my way of attack where. She pushed the radio more full time and can't guess about once a month. Or so depending on the time of year paternal holidays and we have different hosts in the might beat three times an hour I say tractor. I can shows that you know it's just distracting yet not a lot going on somebody's fault it's just (%expletive) out there doesn't happen often. I watched that show and it's a tractor and it's two hours it's tedious it's force disagreement for example. You know reporters as Comcast government you are I'm sure they're very talented Wal-Mart on grates at awesome. They have Jeff how long you up to combat Gary tell you how treats out yesterday afternoon I'm going to be on put anyways head in the toilet. They can under fifty people on the south. It's just how intense way Don and that's that takes later this hot Jeff and is that takes or even on. Play the sound yell at each other releases Tuesday. Too many voices pilot training and Bertrand you know Oprah and good guy yeah what are they doing there one just occupying a lot of space tackle Colin here no disrespect again but I never thought that you would be coal. And the others are sort of like awkwardly in between and so I watched that show what it's like you have gold and it's your their former gold you know assault disagreement yeah. Yep people or a release house and regionally this often rattled. What angle and that's like never done and keep it for a reason ours in radio with stalking. Every every segment care while Boston sports tonight put that threats that they'd change about it Casey Smith has and everything everything is what's the vibe she asked about the vote live via yes everybody with the vibe like it is and every one of those positive vibes we try to present Jerry's thoughts on Casey Smith. For an awkward. Repartee between Jerry trainee today can be back for the 832 level with the modern classic girls girls girls from Motley crew is that the team. Terkel like dat going deep catalog. Jenny didn't really gauge though she well she said she is to settle the pacing Smith is smoke him. And if that's a good time there and a nice person to write yes and support to me no I've I think training knows she's Smart enough not to while not a Nazi everything I mean treated swearing here today yeah she dropped. (%expletive) today foxy Eagles. Flew behind him. Should in my conference. Up up up up up its act upon. You cut what do you cut from. Jerry started groaning. And I don't know there was a call but I heard him like Jerry made a noise like he was getting down point night. Cut out some of what he was so I urgency going down a path of like shooting in the toilet describing the fecal matter going and in what looked like in the shape of who was on the line it was Kevin Brasilia cameras and so. At that moment my owls achieve the release in my chock full coal port out. Like a butterscotch Charest. What I stood up and looked in the. I got nervous and hit the dump button and then within like three minutes is usually jury make that noise and I think like oh boy did I miss something. And then. Which are probably could've gone Revere was statement he put a collective or bar after. Yeah. We evils scandal logical whatever what's the term and yes you're and so. Anyway but then of course I expect this to you nobody knows whatever like four seconds later trees that ship. So the delay had fully rebuilt. And win the offer but we have a buffer and it's was aggressive so. It's all worked out by the way we get it in here. Sure number one show in Boston again. Congratulations yulia. Big news big league as a week it's a weekly weekly. And we for the multiply two votes in sort of like two weeks we have two more weeks until the bookends in the long variables that. And we have been kicking ass as usual the show is him. Really general so it's usually you know. Now for too much during the actual broadcast real came Selig optical listeners number one in Boston and point 550 for the last two weeks lost. That's even with but it much takes credit for what we were belts at the regular number one or number three. Tomorrow we will get it over to Roemer until. Friday Friday correct speaker flight phrased it. The Thursday edition features the return of old friend address the weekly Chris we've got a a return of a a friend of the show the president on it coming on Friday we take Johnny to thrills I got a text confirming this morning so.

VANISHED: Texas family searching for retired firefighter who disappeared from Walmart Nguyen was supposed to fly to Florida on Sunday night for a job interview on Monday morning, Black said. He didn’t go. Black said Nguyen has been described as “dependable” and that his phone is off, which is unusual. The car didn’t have a tracking device. “We’ve got a big concern,” he said. The car’s rear back door is dented, and the Texas license plate number is HJB-5077. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Harris County Sheriff’s Office at (713) 755-7427 or Texas EquuSearch at (281) 309-9500. LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS — Family and friends are mourning the loss of a Massachusetts teen who was horrifically beheaded by a classmate. The Boston Globe reports that Lee Manuel Viloria-Paulino disappeared on Nov. 18, leaving behind his phone and wallet. The teen’s family had filed a missing person’s report, but authorities considered him a runaway and largely ignored the case. Two weeks later, a woman walking her dog along the Merrimack River spotted his body near the riverbank. He had been decapitated and gruesomely mutilated. Both arms were hacked below the elbow, and his head was lying about 50 feet away. Police investigating the brutal slaying believe it was carried out by Viloria-Paulino’s classmate, 16-year-old Matthew Borges, but have not disclosed a motive for the murder. Borges was arrested on Saturday after authorities found evidence linking him to the killing. He is expected to be charged as an adult with first-degree murder.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     Nintendo NES Classic Edition In Stock At Target Stores Posted: Apr 5 2017, 9:47am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News     Target stores are best place to find a NES Classic in stock besides Amazon Prime Now. Wednesday morning the Nintendo NES Classic Edition is showing up in stock again at many Target store locations. Also Amazon continues to offer the NES Classic through Amazon Prime Now. Nintendo has started to ship new NES Classic inventory last week and more stores are offering the NES again. Don't Miss: Today's Best Deals on Amazon.com Target somehow manages to get the bulk of Nintendo's new NES supply. IStockNow triggered lots of alerts for Target stores in the past hours like earlier this week. To find an NES Classic at Target we recommend using iStockNow and BrickSeek in combination. If both services show that the NES is in stock at a select Target store, the likelihood is higher that this is indeed the case. It is also recommended to look for change in the stock information over time. If a store had zero NES the day before and now shows 12 in stock, then again the likelihood is higher that you find the NES at that store now. It got now a bit easier to find a NES Classic, but the demand is still red hot and competition is fierce. We published a new NES Classic Shopping Guide featuring all methods to find and buy a NES Classic. The reseller prices stay at around $125, plus $3.99 shipping on amazon.com from legit appearing resellers. The first offers in the list on amazon.com might be fake offers. The first listing is for $99 and the second for $109. Both are from just launched resellers. Proceed with caution on these offers. In the past week we have seen offers below the $59.99 NES Classic list price. These offers are obviously fake. Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam that lock up your cash. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch and NES Classic Amazon scam for details. Amazon has been sitting on NES inventory and makes it available in small batches on its local delivery service since a couple weeks now. This is an obvious marketing campaign for Amazon Prime Now. The frequency is though getting higher. Today the NES Classic was available already San Jose, California.  Check the NES Classic listing for your Zip code on Amazon Prime Now. Las Vegas was the latest city to that was offered the NES Classic. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint. Shoppers can get notified about the NES Classic availability on Amazon Prime Now with iStockNow. Several resellers offer still the original Nintendo NES Controller for $39.99 on Amazon.com. This is though four times the regular price. There are plenty of 3rd party NES controller that sell for around $10. The NES Classic supply has not improved significantly after months on the market. Target and Walmart stores have been the source of NES hunters a couple weeks ago, but both stores have not gotten significant new inventory in a long time. The last time the NES was on sale on amazon.com for the regular retail price of $59.99 was on Feb. 23. Find all details on how and where to find a NES Classic in stock in our NES Classic Shopping Guide. NES Classic on Amazon Prime Now The only option that has worked in past days is Amazon Prime Now. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint and very sporadic. It is suspicious that only Amazon has the NES in stock and only sells them through Amazon Prime Now. It looks like Amazon set aside some NES inventory to use it to promote its local delivery service. Amazon only allows one NES Classic order per person. There is strict limit on how many NES an account can order for a set period of time, at least 24 hours. Ordering a NES via Amazon Prime Now is though great, but its a hassle to spot one in stock and ready for order. It arrives in 2 hours for free in the cities where Amazon Prime Now is available. NES hunters have to refresh the search for the NES Classic for their ZIP code on a regular basis to spot the NES in stock. About the NES Classic The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985. The Holiday shopping season 2016 has been dominated by the hunt for Hatchimals and the Nintendo NES classic edition. The NES Classic demand is still strong amidst ongoing shortage. The Best Buy NES Classic and Switch sale on March 29 was worse than a Black Friday sale. We don't expect the sitatution to improve in 2017. The NES Classic will be a hard to find item into the Holiday shopping season 2017. Read the latest NES Classic Updates and see also our Nintendo Switch Shopping Guide.

 Facebook is staking a new claim in the work chat battle with Microsoft, Slack, and Google Matt Weinberger Apr. 5, 2017, 1:40 PM 1,992 facebook linkedin twitter email print Workplace by Facebook includes specialized versions of profile pages, the News Feed, Facebook Messenger, and even Facebook Live. Facebook Facebook is testing a free version of Workplace, its still-in-beta social networking service for office workers, reports CNBC. That new version of Workplace, dubbed the "Standard" edition, will function much the same as the paid version when it eventually launches, but will lack certain security controls and other IT department-friendly features.  Otherwise, this version will do the same thing as the paid "Premium" edition, which launched in October, free of charge: Provide a private, walled-off social network for you and your coworkers to chat and collaborate, including specialized versions of Facebook Live and the News Feed. This is a very competitive move against Facebook's rivals for the fast-growing chat marketplace. Microsoft just launched its own Microsoft Teams, a part of the Office 365 subscription suite. Google responded with the introduction of Hangouts Chat, which comes as part of the premium G Suite services for businesses. Neither company currently offers a free version of its work chat tools. "The vision of Workplace is to connect everyone. This means people who work only on mobile, on the go. This means large companies with distributed workforces. This means small businesses. This means companies in developed and developing markets. Workplace Standard will make Workplace more accessible and make it simpler for businesses of all sizes across the world to get started," says Facebook spokesperson Vanessa Chan. But the company to beat in work chat right now is Slack, the $3.8 billion startup that claims 1.5 million paid users at customers like IBM and Walmart's Jet.com. Slack has attributed much of its growth to its own free tier, basically giving even large customers a free taste before it reels them in to the paid version as their usage increases. Now, Facebook can ride the same wave.  Plus, this move stands to give Workplace by Facebook some credibility with companies in a more subtle way. Lots and lots of programmers hang out in topic-specific Slack chatrooms, taking advantage of the company's free service, giving the app lots of fans all over Silicon Valley and beyond. It stands to reason that lots of topic-specific groups will similarly find reasons to use the free, private version of Facebook promised by Workplace — giving it some credibility and users, despite the fact that people still think of Facebook as a consumer product.

The increasing number of millennial shoppers has added to the growth of online retail channels, most of which are price-sensitive. Moreover, consumers prefer shopping online at discounted rates and therefore increasingly adopt online shopping. Hair conditioners, hair styling gels,bath gels,and shower products are the commonly purchased beauty and personal care products online. Additionally, the wide range of products available on online platforms and the time-saving aspect of the medium are factors that have contributed to the rise of the online retail phenomenon. E-retailers offer better security features for online payments, customer-friendly services, easy-to-navigate shopping websites, and easy delivery, due to which the number of consumers using online shopping portals is anticipated to increase significantly in the next few years. Fill the form to gain deeper insights on this market @ http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=18323 The global online beauty and personal care market is divided in terms of product types into the following categories: skin care, oral hygiene, hair care, color cosmetics, fragrances, sun care, bath and shower, deodorants, baby and child care, male grooming, and depilatory products. Among all of these, skin care products are prominently purchased across different regions. This segment includes facial care products and body lotions which enhance skin quality, prevent wrinkles, rejuvenate the cells, and brighten the complexion. The availability of several brands and new features in the market is expected to boost the online sales of skin care products in the next few years. In addition, leading vendors focus on launching products comprising ingredients derived from organic and natural sources to amplify their revenue generation. The online beauty and personal care market is geographically distributed over North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa (MEA), and Latin America. Asia Pacific accounted for the maximum share in the market in 2015, which is primarily driven by the availability of new brands, consumer experimentation with new products, and an increased demand for fragrances and colored cosmetics. The growing adoption of specific products such as skin lightening products across different age groups as well as anti-aging cosmetics are projected to fuel the expansion of the market in this region. In addition to this, regional brands are also gaining popularity due to their unique properties.

Maybe he's tired of being "missing" after all. Richard Simmons, the once uber-flamboyant, now-reclusive fitness maven, has signed a new deal with a company that will handle his licensing, merchandising and endorsements, and launch a line of "motivation" and "inspiration" products. The deal with Prominent Brand + Talent, whose executives include Simmons' longtime manager Michael Catalano, was reported Wednesday by the trade site License Global. The news comes less than three weeks after the release of the final episode of the highly popular podcast "Missing Richard Simmons." That podcast detailed how Simmons abruptly disappeared from the public eye and cut off of contact with his many friends without any explanation in 2014. Catalano told CNBC on Wednesday that the new deal came about partly because of "the podcast" and a recent People magazine article on Simmons, which "created an outpouring of interest" in the celebrity. "And a lot of that has been in the the licensing group area," Catalano said. Asked if Simmons, who no longer does public appearances, will promote his existing products and new products in connection with the deal, Catalano said, "I don't know about promoting, but he certainly will be involved in the creation and the direction of the product, that's for sure." "Richard really hasn't decided what, if anything, he's going to do to promote it in a public way. So it's really undetermined, at this point," Catalano said. Simmons' withdrawal was particularly puzzling because for decades before he was known for his over-the-top, emotional television appearances, public events and private encouragement of people who were trying to lose weight. Simmons even had made a habit of dashing out to greet gawkers on tour buses passing by his Los Angeles home. The six-episode podcast debuted a year after a Daily News story detailed how Simmons' closest friends had become "increasingly concerned" about him after he ceased communications with them, and stopped leading a weekly exercise class at his Beverly Hills studio, Slimmons. There was even speculation that Simmons was being held against his will or being controlled by his longtime housekeeper. Both the story and the podcast had sparked welfare checks on Simmons by Los Angeles Police, who reported that he was "fine." After the News article ran in 2016, Simmons did a phone interview with NBC's "TODAY" show, and said, "no one is holding me hostage," and dismissed as "very silly" the theories about his housekeeper. "I just sort of wanted to be a little bit of a loner for a while," Simmons told "TODAY" at the time. License Global, in its story Wednesday, reported that Prominent Brand + Talent "will now aim to create a collection of Richard Simmons–inspired products and build on the fitness icon's current lineup merchandise." The story also noted that Simmons-related merchandise has sold more than $1.5 billion over the years through retailers that include Wal-Mart, Payless, QVC and Amazon. Catalano told CNBC that Simmons had done 20 different infomercials over the years, and said that was an indication of Simmons' marketing power given the fact that if a product doesn't sell after an infomercial airs, the show is yanked. Dan Levin, a managing member of Prominent Brand + Talent, was quoted in the License Global story as saying the company "has plans to launch a global line of thoughtful motivation and inspiration-based products that that will achieve the tenet Richard has always espoused — love yourself no matter what you weigh, make time to do good for others and laugh a little." Catalano told CNBC that no decision has been made yet as to what those new products will be. "It will all be in keeping with Richard's messaging. ... Richard's always been about helping people feel better about themselves," Catalano said. "We're certainly not going to do tires and party hats. We really want it to be meaningful." In the last episode of "Missing Richard Simmons," Catalano told the podcast host Dan Taberski that Simmons did not want a "last bow." "Most people want that last bow, not everybody," Catalano said on that episode, where he also asked Taberski and others "to please respect" Simmons' desire for privacy. "He's earned it, this is his story," Catalano told Taberski. "He has, certainly, the right to write the ending." On Wednesday, CNBC asked Catalano if Simmons would call a reporter to discuss his new licensing deal. "He's not talking to anybody right now," Catalano said. "But I appreciate you asking."

Top among them could be Louisiana, the state with the largest trade surplus with China, followed by Washington, Oregon, Alabama and Alaska. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up While Trump sharply criticized China's unfair trading practices during the election campaign — and threatened to impose tariffs that sparked fears of a damaging trade war — his administration has so far taken a subdued approach. Still, Trump keeps repeating he wants to "level the playing field." What's certain is that altering trade patterns between the world's two biggest economies could have all sorts of unpredictable consequences. This is especially true for trade-surplus states, including the six that voted for Trump such as South Carolina, West Virginia and Montana. Overall, the U.S. rang up a $347 billion trade deficit with China last year, with California responsible for roughly a third of that amount. About 30 states imported at least $1 billion more in Chinese goods than they exported, according to data from the International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Gulf Coast state of Louisiana, dotted with refineries and chemical plants, became the biggest beneficiary of trade with China last year, expanding its trade surplus to $6.8 billion, while to the northwest, Washington's surplus was $4.6 billion. Statistics from the U.S.-China Business Council show that most of that state's 2015 total exports worth $15.4 billion fell into the transportation equipment category, suggesting a lot could be at stake for the state's largest private employer: Boeing. On the deficit end of the spectrum are four of the five most populous U.S. states. None is more significant than tech-centric California, which last year exported $14.4 billion — with computers and electronics among its largest sellers — while importing a staggering $144.1 billion in Chinese goods.  Demand for imports in Illinois and New York similarly outstripped those states' major export goods to China: crops and recycled materials, respectively.  Even with a majority of states likely to benefit from a re-balancing of trade with China, Trump should think twice about focusing on trade sanctions as a solution when he meets with Xi on Thursday and Friday, writes Bloomberg Intelligence Chief Economist Michael McDonough. Tough actions could end up harming many American consumers and businesses. Shoppers at Wal-Mart and Target would see an immediate surge in imported goods costs. U.S. corporations selling into or producing in China would see lower profits. The promised benefits -- a return of U.S. manufacturing jobs -- appear uncertain. High labor costs, automation and sticky supply chains all make it difficult for firms to relocate back to the U.S. This suggests the Trump administration might be content with symbolic wins, rather than major sanctions.  So unless New York City has a whole lot more cardboard and scrap metal it can ship to China, Trump's road to smaller deficits will likely have to go through Xi and the "difficult" first meeting the president says he expects they'll have this week. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The Givers: Wealth, Power, and Philanthropy in a New Gilded Age David Callahan Alfred A. Knopf: 2017. ISBN: 978-1101947050 Buy this book: US UK Japan In January, Oxfam released its annual zinger on inequality: the collective net worth of the world's poorest half (3.6 billion people) is equivalent to that of just 8 of the wealthiest men. This figure was released to coincide with the yearly gathering in Davos, Switzerland, of economic and political elites and celebrities, who publicly commit to advancing global well-being even as they safeguard conditions for private profiteering. Each of the eight wealthiest men is a megaphilanthropist, underwriting billions of dollars for medical research, public health, humanitarian causes and education. The bulk are familiar US names, including technology gurus Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Lawrence Ellison, investment oracle Warren Buffett, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and media magnate (and politician) Michael Bloomberg. Health is much in their sights: Zuckerberg has earmarked US$3 billion to “cure, prevent or manage” disease; Bloomberg has designated almost $1 billion to curb smoking and traffic fatalities; and Gates has ploughed some $20 billion into vaccine development and global health. This group — with many others in the top tier of the $700-billion US philanthropic sector — is the subject of David Callahan's exposé, The Givers. As Callahan reveals, many philanthropists participate in the Giving Pledge, a brainchild of Gates and Buffett that invites the world's wealthiest to contribute the majority of their assets to addressing “society's most pressing problems”, echoing steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie's 1889 homily 'The Gospel of Wealth'. Drawing on insider interviews, Callahan discovers that many pledgers are initially humble about giving. This contrasts with the arrogance enabling their profitmaking journeys, which spills over into a sense of “hyperagency” — sociologist Paul Schervish's term for elites' sense of entitlement. Callahan goes beyond such sentiments to explore the scientific, social and political implications of largesse in the new gilded age. His breathless overview of the provenance, giving style and domestic impact of current US philanthropy finds it undemocratic. Most egregiously, this set-up heightens private influence in an era of plunging public spending. Not all philanthropists are anti-government. Buffett calls for increased taxes; Bloomberg wants philanthropy to “embolden”, not replace, government. Still, both continue to marshal soaring wealth while their donations mount, making them absurd reformers of the system that empowers them. Older-style “legacy” philanthropy (exemplified by New York City's Rockefeller Foundation) was based on slow accumulation from mainline industries, with late-in-life or posthumous creation of perpetual, bureaucratized foundations. Callahan is more interested in those with fast and vast fortunes derived from finance and technology. Overnight tycoons prefer to 'give while they live', spending down huge fortunes with huge donations. Their venture philanthropy is characterized by risk-taking, mirroring the donors' own business trajectories to big bucks — leaving room for both colossal failure and large-scale impact. It often bypasses traditional support for educational and cultural institutions to invest in catalysing issues, including gene editing and artificial intelligence. Philanthropy remains gendered: men earn fortunes and their wives or daughters give them away, with little focus on gender equity beyond reproductive rights. Still, women's philanthropic networks (such as Women Moving Millions, based in New York City) have emerged, perhaps portending change around women's political representation. Callahan marvels at the ideological range of philanthropic giving. Firmly for or against issues ranging from the 2010 US Affordable Care Act to climate change, it also spans support of both liberal and conservative think tanks such as, respectively, the Center for American Progress and the libertarian Cato Institute, both in Washington DC. (Think-tank funding is a savvy way of bypassing laxly enforced prohibitions on political lobbying by non-profit institutions.) Yet Callahan is troubled that the donors' agenda-setting priorities do not reflect the public's. He believes that philanthropists are more fiscally conservative and socially liberal than the general population, and are stronger advocates of market solutions and technocratic fixes. Thus they typically favour the latest medical innovation over ensuring decent housing conditions. Callahan's discussion of science and medicine is circumscribed. One concern is that therapies for the wealthy, such as precision oncology, garner undue attention. Prospects for accelerating research where government grant-making is bureaucratic and cautious, he fears, are accompanied by spending cuts leading to the privatization of science. Callahan says little about the impact of such changes, but foreseeable problems include ratcheting down peer-review processes and ignoring already underfunded arenas such as occupational health. One of the most contentious targets of activist philanthropy is education. Among others, the Walton family — heirs to the Walmart fortune — Zuckerberg and hedge-fund maestro Bill Ackman have given enormous sums to charter schools, facilities that are publicly funded, privately administered and sometimes for-profit. Illustrating how fraught this philanthropic involvement is, in Newark, New Jersey, a top-down school-reform strategy disregarded community priorities, generated wide resentment, exacerbated inequity and defunded public schools. Despite his lament that increasingly powerful philanthropy engenders civic inequality, Callahan pays inadequate attention to philanthrocapitalism. This model, which infuses business principles into philanthropy (proffering handsome investment returns), essentially justifies wealth accumulation on the backs of ordinary people. He mentions various structural enablers of gargantuan fortunes, from tax shelters to weak securities laws and corporate pressure to cut taxes and shrink regulation. Yet he retreats to mild critique, calling for a “balancing act” of middling reforms around philanthropic accountability, transparency, partnerships and political lobbying. “Many would argue that It is time to rein in the billionaires.” If philanthropy indeed poses a grave threat to egalitarian values, Callahan's prescription may amount to tinkering at the margins. Why should self-anointed philanthropic elites, who already exercise inordinate power, have carte blanche to steer public policy? As former US labour secretary Robert Reich has noted, governments once collected billions from tycoons, then democratically redistributed these revenues. Many would argue that it is high time to rein in the megabillionaires, whether they are wielding influence from the boardroom, the White House or philanthropic perches.

By Elizabeth Foster April 5, 2017 When one door closes, hundreds of internet windows open. In a trend that’s only accelerating, bricks-and-mortar retail locations across North America are closing as e-commerce continues to thrive. In fact, New York-based real estate developer Clarion Partners reports that approximately 5,000 store locations have shuttered in the past 18 months, and retailers like Sears and Macy’s have announced further closures are on the way in 2017. Non-physical retail, however, shows no signs of closing up shop. According to the US Census Bureau’s Retail Trade Report, online sales grew by 11.4% last year. The leader of the pack, Seattle-based online behemoth Amazon, reported a 50% increase in holiday season shipping between 2015 and 2016. Additionally, it reported that the number of third parties using its fulfillment service to store, pack and ship goods rose by more than 70% in 2016. E-commerce is becoming the new normal, which means the focus for bricks-and-mortar stores needs to shift in tandem. To take advantage of the opportunities afforded by online shopping and the emergence of in-store “experiences,” licensors and licensees need to shift not only their strategies, but also their perspectives. “When you look at an entertainment or a retail platform, there are obviously surging technologies and competitors coming into the landscape and causing disruption,” says Bill Graham, chief business development officer for PhatMojo, an L.A.-based global product development company. PhatMojo specializes in plush, hangers, collectibles and apparel and has a history of working with digital properties like Crossy Road and Borderlands, along with entertainment brands like Steven Universe. So connecting with consumers where they engage with digital IPs online is second nature to the company—e-commerce has always been part of the mix for PhatMojo. “The really positive takeaway from all of this disruption is that all of these products are being supported,” says Graham. “It’s really the methodology that we need to explore. What people want to deliver is the product to the consumer in the way the consumer wants. So, when we’re looking at digital natives and their level of comfort in using technology to acquire tangible goods, it’s certainly a factor.” To take advantage of this growth and meet consumers where they are, he says, the industry has to stop seeing e-commerce as competition, or simply as a tool to prop up traditional retail. “Online retail is very easy and it’s kind of aligned with how lots of kids engage on a number of other platforms, socially and educationally,” Graham says. “We want these new channels to succeed, because ultimately it’s in everyone’s best interest that both the online retailers and bricks-and-mortar retailers are successful. It’s important to the industry at large.” PhatMojo’s gravity feeders are designed to take advantage of limited space while adding to the overall in-store experience For Hasbro, bridging the gap between traditional and online retail means enabling consumers to interact with the products in ways that fit with their personal preferences through as many points of engagement as possible. “Today’s consumer is looking for a more robust brand experience than ever before, which means extending our strategy to hit every touch-point in people’s lives,” says Maureen Smith, SVP of brand marketing in the US for Hasbro. In an effort to evolve brands like Transformers and My Little Pony in a way that makes them as appealing as possible both in stores and online, Hasbro has developed a brand blueprint strategy with a focus on storytelling and consumer insights. Structured like a wheel, the brand sits at the center of a number of spokes in the blueprint, with each spoke representing an expression of the brand. As unique as the expressions might be across different consumer product categories, they are connected by the brand’s central theme, like the power of friendship in My Little Pony. “Storytelling creates a connection that inspires the consumer to travel with a brand across the many points of engagement,” Smith says. By investing in storytelling and building out the world of My Little Pony brand, Hasbro is working to create a connection that will inspire in-store and e-commerce opportunities. Kids who first approach the wheel through digital content can follow those central storytelling themes to collectibles, apparel and plush, or vice versa. “There is no doubt that the retail landscape is in a period of transition,” says Smith. “We’re telling stories and interacting with fans in-store, on their phones, in their living room and everywhere in between.” To execute this kind of plan, it’s important to know who your consumers are and what they want, and then meet them where they are most comfortable interacting with brands, Smith explains. Fortunately, feedback is more readily available than ever as kids continue to share their opinions online. For Hasbro, licensed products have been a valuable tool in developing customized offerings with a focus on individual shoppers’ needs and interests. Each licensee provides a new spoke for the wheel, and each spoke appeals in a different way to kids looking to engage with the brand. This ability to zero in on consumers and their retail habits only grows in importance as the retail landscape continues to evolve, Smith says. Eric Marcy, chief revenue officer of Detroit, Michigan-based search marketing intelligence platform AdGooroo, agrees that IP owners, toycos and retailers need to truly embrace e-commerce in order to ensure continued growth in the industry at large. “Previously there was a kind of disconnect between the digital side of these organizations as compared to the store side,” Marcy says. “Oftentimes they are working in silos in terms of how they drive consumer behavior, and that leads to not being able to optimize their assets in a way that tells a story and connects with consumers where they’re at today.” Integration between traditional and online retail is no longer optional, he says. Coordination between the two channels is necessary to provide consumers with the experiences and conveniences they’ve come to expect, like being able to order a product online but return it in-store. This integration isn’t just one-way, however. Marcy says the experiential nature of traditional retail is also informing e-commerce as it continues to expand. AdGooroo focuses on the pay-per-click search market. And brands and retailers are adjusting their online strategies, Marcy says, by moving away from traditional text ads and shifting to more widespread use of product listing ads (PLAs). “The PLA is a more visual experience,” Marcy explains. “It provides you with an image and a price, and it’s more visually appealing. It replicates more of that experience you’re used to when you’re in an actual bricks-and-mortar store.” Google is listing more PLAs at the top of the search result page than ever before, Marcy says, and the search engine is also experimenting with PLAs on the right rail of the search results page. “It’s not prevalent everywhere yet,” says Marcy. “But it’s what we’re anticipating to see from Google. And I think that kind of coincides with the idea of a more experiential digital experience for the consumer.” PLAs also boast a higher click-through rate than traditional text ads, according to AdGooroo, so it’s no surprise that the most successful retailers are taking advantage. AdGooroo’s recent study of PLAs based on roughly 900 popular toy-related keywords found that Walmart is currently the biggest player in this area. Walmart’s three websites are pulling in approximately 30% of total clicks related to those keyword searches. And as massive as Amazon is in e-commerce, the study found that the retailer has largely abstained from PLAs in favor of text ads, although AdGooroo reports that Amazon has recently started testing PLAs in the toys and home goods categories. Product listing ads, which are more visually appealing than text-based ones, are driving more click-throughs than ever before E-commerce needs to continue to evolve to provide consumers with all the comforts of a traditional retail experience. Marcy contends the importance of consumers’ experiences cannot be overstated. He also believes bricks-and-mortar stores need to continue to focus on creating the type of retail experiences online shopping is incapable of providing, to prevent traditional retail from feeling like an inconvenient mode of buying. “We’re seeing an experiential shift in stores from a retail perspective,” he says. “How do you take advantage of the physical assets you have with these retail stores in terms of setting up really unique experiences for the consumer that they’re not going to be able to find anywhere else? It needs to become this stellar experience that you can’t replicate online.” As retail locations continue to close this year, Marcy says the remaining stores will focus less on the quantity of locations and more on the quality of experience. PhatMojo’s Graham agrees, comparing the experience of traditional retail and e-commerce to seeing a live performance versus watching one at home on a screen. “I think what’s important for retailers as they offer compelling reasons for consumers to come into their stores is to provide the full sensory experience,” contends Graham. “Embracing that ‘live show’ component is very important. Ultimately, what you want to do is deliver an experience that supersedes all of the conveniences of online retail so that you’re executing your brand experience on a store level that can’t be duplicated—it has to be seen in the store. Of course, that’s the challenge a lot of retailers are figuring out.” PhatMojo is working closely with retailers in an effort to reach that ideal in-store experience, Graham says. “Within bricks-and-mortar stores, we’re very aggressively pursuing a number of different packaging and display executions, where we’re making sure we’re offering retailers the best opportunity to leverage their available real estate.” For example, the company is using gravity feeders for properties like Animal Jam and Star Wars. The feeders hold dozens of products in one space, and kids can easily grab a blind bag or collectible from the open mouth at the bottom. The feeders are designed to be merchandised in multiple locations, including the collector’s aisle and point-of-purchase areas. Graham says the company is currently working on end-cap and side-cap real estate solutions that take advantage of unused space. “Where there is unused space, we’re trying to make sure we’re coming up with creative solutions to take advantage of that space and get incremental sales for everyone involved,” he says. This shift in strategy regarding traditional retail, e-commerce and the relationship between the two is key, Graham says, as the retail landscape continues to evolve. The National Retail Federation’s economic forecast for 2017 projects that US retail industry sales (excluding automobiles, gasoline stations and restaurants) will grow between 3.7% and 4.2% over 2016. And while retail sales were up by 4% overall in 2016, sales in department stores were down 7%, and online sales saw a significant growth of 12.6%. The NRF found that the toy industry, in particular, made the majority of its gains online. Data like this is of course important in crafting future retail strategies, Graham says. But he cautions against forgetting the human element. “I think it’s important to take a step back,” he says. “We have to have a good blend of heart and mind when you’re looking at these things. There are different strengths within traditional and online retail, and I think it’s up to all of us in the industry to make sure we’re helping to deliver to their respective strengths as best as possible. We want all of these channels to survive and thrive, and it’s a very healthy discussion to have at this point so the industry can react to it in a way that’s as constructive as possible.” TAGS:AdGooroo, Amazon, Animal Jam, Crossy Road, Google+, Hasbro, My Little Pony, PhatMojo, PLA, Star Wars About The Author Elizabeth Foster is Kidscreen's Senior Writer.

clock menu more-arrow The “multicultural” L'Oréal booth where Raquel Savage modeled. Photo: Raquel Savage The Whitewashing of Natural Hair Care Lines Carol’s Daughter and Shea Moisture are ready to appeal to a wider audience — but who loses out? by Morgan Jerkins Apr 5, 2017, 10:02am EDT tweet share pin Raquel Savage, a Miami-based, board-certified sex therapist, was recently invited to be a hair model for Carol’s Daughter, a natural haircare, body, and skincare line. This event, an expo showcasing Carol’s Daughter and other products for CVS sales reps, took place on March 30th. From 6 a.m. to 5 p.m., Raquel was to model for the brand, which would test products on her hair but not cut or color her locks. All Raquel had to do was come to the Westin Fort Lauderdale on that day wearing all black with freshly washed hair. She was looking forward to the opportunity. It was another way to collect a check and promote herself. At first, Savage knew that something was amiss from how messily her natural hair was handled. When she was reached out to for this opportunity, she assumed the stylist, who was also black, knew how to do her curly hair, which was to style while wet. But instead, her hair was styled while dry. After Dark & Lovely and Carol’s Daughter were used on Savage’s hair, she was prompted to go to one of the Westin’s ballrooms, where besides the aforementioned lines, Shea Moisture, NYX, Wet n Wild, Maybelline, and Coppertone, among many others, were present. Downstairs, that feeling of something being a bit off escalated, as the majority of people present, including CVS ambassadors, were white. Savage, along with another light-skinned, curly-haired woman, were a part of L'Oréal’s multicultural booth, which included Dark and Lovely, Dessange, and Carol’s Daughter. According to Savage, the booth’s multiculturalism proved to be more of a dilution of blackness than anything else. However, according to Savage, the booth’s multiculturalism proved to be more of a dilution of blackness than anything else. Carol’s Daughter, a popular haircare line for natural-haired black women, showcased an ad with a racially ambiguous, fair-skinned woman. Aside from the colorism aspect of its advertisement, Savage was struck by the obfuscating language that stylists used to describe Carol’s Daughter products: “The two stylists marketed the products, specifically Carol’s Daughter and Dark and Lovely, saying all textures of hair can use these products. They said the textures that work the best for these hairs are curly to wavy to very curly, as opposed to saying it’s for ethnic and women of color. Sometimes he would say ‘coily’ or ‘textured’ hair to try to imply that it’s for women of color. A couple of times, he would say that it’s not about race. He said he doesn’t like to look at the racial and ethnic backgrounds of someone but rather what the hair needs.” When Savage went over to the Shea Moisture booth to talk to its representatives — one white woman and one light-skinned, racially ambiguous woman — the latter woman told her Shea Moisture is not a “black” company, but rather a multicultural company that is very diverse. The transformation of marketing natural haircare lines is a strong testament to what black consumers gain and lose when their beloved products became a part of larger corporations — “mainstream” can be a loose euphemism to erase blackness altogether. Prior to the transition, Carol’s Daughter hosted a wide range of ads featuring African-American women, such as Jada Pinkett Smith and Mary J. Blige. They were the main customers. In fact, in 2011, when Today ran a profile of Lisa Price, the headline was “Carol’s Daughter delivers beauty to black women.” A brief search on Carol’s Daughter’s website shows that these black women exist, but the more racially ambiguous ads that took center stage at this expo seem to be less of a coincidence and more of a marketing strategy. L'Oréal bought Carol’s Daughter in 2014, and since then, natural-haired black people have worried that the products would change in order to appeal to the white masses. L'Oréal bought Carol’s Daughter in 2014, and since then, natural-haired black people have worried that the products would change in order to appeal to the white masses. Lisa Price founded Carol’s Daughter in 1993. The line began as a hobby, making all-natural hair and skin products in the kitchen of her Brooklyn apartment. Her husband would deliver them to family and friends. This two-person operation grew into 10 to 12 people working inside of Price’s home. Eventually, Carol’s Daughter expanded to be sold at places like Sephora, CVS, Target, HSN, and Ulta. In a 2012 interview with Ebony, Price said, “I feel like being in my business, being an African-American woman is a plus. It doesn’t hurt or hinder me... The only time it’s a negative is when you have to get people to recognize that, ‘yes I’m an African-American woman, yes my core customer is African-American women, but that doesn’t mean that you can’t use it too and benefit from it.’” What Price says is, in fact, true. It can be difficult to get other women to use a product that caters primarily to black women. However, if black women feel de-centered, is the promotion worth it? It was right around the time of this interview when Price’s double-sided message did not sit well with fans of the line — particularly with one of its biggest spokespeople, Solange Knowles, who parted ways with the organization after a 17-month-long stint. In an interview with Lurve magazine, Solange said of the dissolution: “I was constantly fighting for the right message to be heard," she said. “The message that, the way we wear our hair is a personal choice, there’s no right or wrong way; one way doesn’t make us more intelligent, or more superficial, and everyone makes that choice for very different reasons.” This was one of many fissures in the beauty brand from 2010 to 2011. As NPR reports, five out of the seven Carol’s Daughter boutiques had to close, and Carol’s Daughter LLC had to file for bankruptcy. In 2011, in response to a multiethnic ad that included Solange, Selita Ebanks, and Cassie, Carol’s Daughter investor Steven Stoute said of Carol’s Daughter’s direction — or redirection — “What we’re doing now is moving into a polyethnic space. We want to be the first beauty brand that truly captures the beauty of the tapestry of skin types in America… We believe we’ve put together a shoot that celebrates many different ethnicities, to become a mirror of what America’s really becoming… They will serve as cultural ambassadors in bringing forth this acceptance that the definition of beauty is now colorless.” “What we’re doing now is moving into a polyethnic space. We want to be the first beauty brand that truly captures the beauty of the tapestry of skin types in America.” This colorless utopia is what Price echoed in her Ebony interview, when responding to Carol’s Daughter wanting to be more mainstream: “I don’t really think of it as appealing to a ‘mainstream’ audience to be honest, because with the way our world is changing, people are going to identify less and less with the color of their skin. It’s just something that’s going to end up happening in the next 20 to 30 years.” Although L'Oréal had a history of buying other black haircare lines, such as Softsheen, black women weren’t sure if Carol’s Daughter was selling out. As it stands, because the line still thrives, the partnership was a success. In 2016, Carol’s Daughter tapped Orange is the New Black’s Dascha Polanco and model Nazanin Mandi to be a part of the brand. Its growth and distribution expanded, according to Ad Age, to 25,000 stores in that same year. But at what cost? Shea Moisture is another brand that has had to grapple with this dilemma. Beginning in 1991, Richelieu Dennis, founder and CEO of the company, along with Nyema Tubman and Mary Dennis, created Shea Moisture. The line was created to honor Dennis’s grandmother, who sold shea butter products in Sierra Leone starting in 1912. Shea Moisture has grown from selling not only haircare products, but also soaps — its initial product — and lotions. Like Carol’s Daughter, Shea Moisture is also sold in CVS and Target, as well as at Bed Bath & Beyond, Walmart, and others. In an essay for NBC News, Dennis said that the company ethically sources shea butter from 14 women’s cooperatives in Northern Ghana, which invests in more than 6,500 women entrepreneurs. In turn, Bain Capital, one of the world’s largest private equity funds, has a minority stake in Shea Moisture. Stylists divulged that both Carol’s Daughter and Shea Moisture are changing the formula of their products so that they are less heavy and of more use to white customers. When Savage modeled at the hair expo, she recounted how the stylists divulged that both Carol’s Daughter and Shea Moisture are changing the formula of their products so that they are less heavy and of more use to white customers. This change is not entirely a surprise; there have been rumors on forums such as Lipstick Alley and sites like Hello Beautiful that the products have changed. In 2015, Nikki Walton, founder and head of content for CurlyNikki.com, wrote a blog post questioning if Shea Moisture changed the formula of its curl-enhancing smoothie because glycerin, not water, was its first ingredient. This change began to feel even more like a breach of trust between Shea Moisture and its original clientele when the brand launched its Break The Walls campaign, which featured a black woman observing the difference between the beauty aisle where a white woman and blonde, curly-haired child stand and the ethnic aisle. The walls collapse in order to demonstrate the merging of the two concepts. Although the goal was to demolish racial barriers within the beauty industry, bloggers such as Tyisha Scott were skeptical of how a “just for us” beauty can now be a free-for-all. Further criticism came Shea Moisture’s way when it included images featuring white children. The team tweeted a response to the backlash: “We came across an image of a little girl with a puzzled expression that we imagine our #SheaFamily has when they run out of product, so we shared it with you. No ad. No agenda.” After Raquel Savage shared her experience at the hair expo on social media, her tweets set off a firestorm full of disenchanted African-Americans whose distrust of both Carol’s Daughter and Shea Moisture had worsened. When Savage thinks of her brief modeling experience, she says, “In hindsight, I should’ve asked more questions. I felt like I was [taking] up space for a kinky, curly person who was black and dark, not a light-skinned, biracial, curly-haired woman. Black companies are selling out to appease the masses and appeal to whiteness. It’s not like there aren’t a ton of options for white hair. There’s a huge market for that already.” “Black companies are selling out to appease the masses and appeal to whiteness. It’s not like there aren’t a ton of options for white hair.” There are a series of questions at play here and all of them are inextricably linked to capitalism, which is never going to reward a company for catering to a strictly African-American market. Ideally, a market for black-oriented hair products can be seen as both mainstream and black-centered, not two labels that run directly opposite from one another. As a company expands, what or who gets erased in the process? Is it possible to maintain a loyal clientele of black consumers the more mainstream a company becomes? Can you have black models in advertisements and reference black people in sales pitches and still be considered mainstream? Judging from Savage’s experience — one that has left her so traumatized that she refuses to model again — this, along with the appeal to be colorless, mainstream, and broad, is one that will leave many black people, the formerly loyal customers, as casualties in its wake.

(NASDAQ: AMZN) confirmed a supply agreement with and the rights to acquire a 23 percent stake in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ: PLUG), Benchmark analyst Dan Kurnos told Benzinga the deal is “just another tech upgrade.” But it wasn’t necessarily an expected one. “[It] makes you wonder why Amazon couldn’t find a better tech to implement,” Kurnos said. “Regardless, spending hundreds of millions of dollars over several years is a drop in the bucket to enhance efficiency.” Plug Power is expected to generate about $70 million in revenue from the agreement, while Amazon will procure technology to enhance the speed of warehouse activity and power industrial equipment. Additionally, the contract requires Amazon to spend at least $600 million with the hydrogen fuel cell maker over the contract's lifetime in order to validate any stock purchases. Collateral Damage Although unlikely, the deal could impact present Plug Power customer Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT). “[It] would be more interesting if Amazon is interested in taking out PLUG so Walmart can’t use them, but I don’t see that as a viable strategy,” Kurnos said.

Privacy groups are understandably perturbed. But I wonder whether all the brouhaha is just shouting at the horse to come back long after he’s left the barn. Yes, it’s a little disturbing that Verizon and AT&T will be able to start behaving like Google and Facebook. But Google and Facebook are already behaving like Google and Facebook. They recognize what we ourselves refuse to see: that we are no longer entirely human. We may not (yet) be sporting wired implants, but with so much of life spent online, we are increasingly integrated into the digital world. Our smartphones and tablets and computers long ago ceased to be our servants. They are also not our masters. Whether we are at work or at home, in the street or in the car, at school or on vacation, the devices that were once our tools are now our partners and our symbionts. The day has become unimaginable without our ability to connect at leisure. We march through the world shedding digital information with every step we take. Whether we are browsing online or browsing in a store, our symbionts surround us and embrace us … and steal from us. We like to call the bits we leave behind “our” data, but the truth is that what we shed in our online travels we also abandon — if not as a matter of law, then as a matter of practical fact. Most of the time we do little to protect our leavings. We dribble data in our path and never look back, on the cheery assumption that nobody will ever want to examine what we have tossed aside. For the Internet behemoths — Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — the data constitute a treasure-trove. Their business models are built around finding ever more complex methods of mining what we leave behind for information that advertisers will buy to target us, anonymously but effectively. Yes, the algorithms work imperfectly — all of us have stories of being served ads for products we hate — but they work. The giant internet service providers — Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&T Inc. in particular — look enviously upon the ability of other tech companies to monetize our digital trails. The ISPs peer greedily into their vaults, packed with data potentially even more detailed than what Google and Facebook collect, and wonder why the companies whose signals ride their fiber optic networks can exploit this vast collection and the owners of the network cannot. In their version of the story, the ISPs try to dip their toes in the water, and a Washington establishment that sits in awe of Google and Facebook reacts with horror and bans them from the beach. With the FCC rules out of the way, it’s everybody into the sea. This isn’t the end of privacy. Privacy ended already. The FCC rules about to be cast aside, like many other regulatory and legislative barriers, represented mere fingers in the dike. Nowadays a Wal-Mart or Nordstrom’s might use your mobile phone, connected to the store’s Wi-Fi, to follow you around the store, combining browsing habits with buying history to personalize offers that are then sent straight to the phone. In his fascinating if disturbing book “The Aisles Have Eyes,” Joseph Turow sharply criticizes this practice, but also tells us where it came from: the need to compete with Amazon, which with its reams of data about customers can both target ads and price discriminate minute-by-minute. If the brick-and-mortar stores couldn’t find a way to exploit similar technologies, they would be left in the dust even faster. A National Security Agency data center opened three years ago in Utah is estimated to be able to store several exabytes (a quintillion bytes) of data, and although the organization is no longer allowed to store most data on our telephone calls, privacy advocates believe that considerable information about our internet usage might be preserved there. (I am not saying they’re right.) And don’t forget the hackers, who do a lot more than occasionally raid the database of a retail shop. Now that it is possible to scan every port on the Internet (the IPv4 space) in mere minutes, any connected device is likely to be attacked. If the device is poorly protected, it will be hacked. Not might be. Will be. Most likely we will see another online civil war, such as the one being fought now between users of ad-blocking software on the one hand, and, on the other, websites that support themselves with advertising income.

The service acts as a sort of reverse ATM: Display your unique barcode at participating retailers to deposit cash into your Amazon account. To get started, generate a code online; opt to print a physical copy, or have it texted to a Web-enabled phone. Users can then save the barcode to an Android home screen or iOS digital wallet, or simply bookmark the mobile website. Amazon Cash is currently available at a handful of major retailers, including CVS Pharmacy, Speedway, Kum & Go, D&W Fresh Market, Sheetz, Family Fare Supermarket, and VG’s Grocery. Additional vendors are expected to sign on “soon,” according to the e-commerce giant. Customers can deposit any amount between $15 and $500 per transaction. Funds are immediately available in your Amazon Balance, where that credit may be used just as you would a gift card. “It’s simple, quick, and there are no fees,” the product FAQ page said. “Your Amazon Balance can be used to shop for millions of eligible physical products and digital content.” This move puts Amazon in direct competition with Walmart and PayPal, both of which already offer similar services for the 27 percent of so-called “unbanked” Americans. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 2015 national survey, some 9 million US households are unbanked, with no checking, savings, money market, or credit account. An additional 24.5 million may have a checking or savings account, but also obtain financial services outside the banking system. Walmart’s five-year-old “Pay with Cash” option lets customers shop a broader selection of items online and pay for them with banknotes at brick-and-mortar stores. The PayPal My Cash Card, meanwhile, works like Amazon’s barcode at 70 merchants across the country, including Rite Aid Pharmacy, Dollar General, and 7-Eleven.

Share on Twitter Click me! Copy Link Image via Pexels In 2014, President Obama passed the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order after discovering certain companies received an astounding amount of federal money, despite making clear labor and civil rights law violations. To rectify this problem, Obama’s order required companies adhere to 14 workplace protection laws if they wanted to receive federal funding. The Fair Pay order sought to make work environments safer for women as well, by enforcing paycheck transparency requirements and ending “cover-up clauses,” making it easier for women to speak up about sexual harassment. It should come as no surprise then that on March 27, Trump signed an executive order to do away with those essential protections. With no explanation and a stroke of his pen, Trump’s executive order will send us back “to a time best left to Mad Men,” says Senator Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. As he explained to NBC News, “These cover-up clauses render people voiceless—forcing them to suffer in silence, suppressing justice, and allowing others to fall victim in the future. At a time when the fight for equal pay continues, Trump also moved to eliminate paycheck transparency and leave workers to negotiate in the dark.” Revoking the Fair Pay order not only makes it inordinately difficult for female employees to negotiate on their own terms, it also takes high-profile discrimination cases out of the spotlight and into backroom dealings. Even if you don’t work at Wal-Mart, for instance, you have a right to know whether female hourly workers are being paid an average of $1,100 less per year than male employees for doing the same work. Without the Fair Pay order, it’s likely that story would not have seen the light of day. Thanks to Trump’s latest order, swearing off shopping at big-box companies with deplorable workplace policies won’t prevent your tax dollars from funding the places you loathe most. To that point, Equal Rights Advocates director Noreen Farrell told NBC News, “We have an executive order that essentially forces women to pay to keep companies in business that (discriminate) against them, with their own tax dollars. It's an outrage.” At this point, it’s almost expected Trump would move to make the workplace harder for women right around Equal Pay Day. Maybe we can use this knowledge to our advantage and anticipate a paid maternity leave ban right before Mother’s Day. The key to fighting Trump’s regressive agenda, it seems, is constantly staying one step ahead.  Recently on GOOD New Site Is Everything You Need To Fight Trump In One Convenient Place  “People shouldn’t have to go to eight different organizations to find out about issues that impact their lives.” Innovation Stacey Leasca San Diego Will Get To Vote On Whether It Wants A New Stadium The team owners may have learned something from the city’s voters rejecting an NFL stadium Sports Jeremy Repanich Steve Bannon Was Just Removed From The National Security Council Trump just made his first good decision by reversing his worst Communities Eric Pfeiffer A New Park In Turkey Lets You Walk Among The Treetops Taking parks to the next level  Design Tod Perry Federal Court Rules That LGBTQ Employees Are Protected Under The Civil Rights Act  They may become protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Communities Tod Perry The Hashtag #WhatAnxietyFeelsLike Reveals The Many Forms The Condition Can Take Reading the accounts, you quickly learn the disorder takes many different forms Health Penn Collins Communities Trump’s Approval Rating Can’t Stop Sinking Those polled believe Trump is “not honest” by Kate Ryan Communities PETA Publicly Called Out Nintendo For Letting Players Milk A Cow In A New Game The animal rights group is clamoring for a more realistic depiction of cow-milking by Penn Collins Sports NFL Star J.J.

Scott Morris in Crime & Law Enforcement, Military, News By M. Scott Morris Daily Journal FULTON – A deceased World War II veteran will receive a patriot’s escort through north Mississippi on Sunday. The strange last days of Pvt. Robert D. Brooks have garnered national media attention. On March 5, the 89-year-old’s body was discovered in a suitcase in a field in Prairie County, Arkansas. An autopsy revealed he died of natural causes, but two people were taken into custody for crimes committed while taking his body from Johnstown, New York, to Arkansas. It took about three weeks to work out the details so Patriot Guard Riders on motorcycles could take Brooks’ cremated remains from Little Rock to his final resting place, a cemetery near Columbia, South Carolina. “We are working to give him recognition and show appreciation for his service,” said Don McKibben, state captain of the Patriot Guard Riders of Mississippi. Brooks enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1945 and was honorably discharged in late 1946. His medals include the WWII Victory Medal and the Army Occupation Medal. The Patriot Guard, a 501c(3) organization, has arranged the ride with Brooks’ son. Though the timing could shift, the Mississippi contingent is scheduled to meet guard members from Tennessee at Olive Branch between 2:30 and 3 p.m. Sunday. “There will be a dignified transfer,” McKibben said. The Mississippi group will meet riders from Alabama for another transfer at the Walmart in Fulton. That’s tentatively scheduled to happen between 4 and 4:30 p.m. McKibben said details are being arranged for law enforcement to escort the riders on I-22. Fire departments, law enforcement agencies and civilians are invited to line up on overpasses along the route to show their support. “I know the North Mississippi Cruisers and the Gumtree Mustang Club and other car clubs will be on Magnolia Way, the entry to the Toyota plant that runs parallel to Highway 78/I-22,” McKibben said. “They’ll be there with flags waving.” People also are invited to meet the riders at Walmart. Fulton and Itawamba County officials will be on hand to direct traffic, and arrangements have been made for parking. The Mississippi chapter of the Patriot Guard participated in 332 funerals last year, which is nearly seven a week. “When you see those flags flying on the overpasses, that really gets to you. That means a lot to us when people do that,” McKibben said. “But it’s not about us. It’s about the remains on that first motorcycle and showing our respect and appreciation for him, especially in light of what’s happened.” According to multiple media reports, Brooks’ caregivers, Virginia “Ginger” Colvin and Michael Stivers of Johnstown, New York, were both arrested and charged with abusing a corpse, a felony. scott.morris@journalinc.com Twitter: @mscottmorris Click here to leave a comment!

Parrish was a student of Cummins’ at Culleoka Unit School in 2011 and 2012, when she was 15 — the same age as Elizabeth Thomas, the teen Cummins is accused of abducting. Thomas and Cummins, 50, have not been seen since March 13. In 2011— Cummins’ first year teaching at the Tennessee school— Parrish was having difficulties at home, she says. Her parents divorced and both moved out of town, leaving her to live with her grandparents. “[With Cummins], I had somebody I could trust, and I couldn’t talk to my parents,” Parrish says. “I don’t show emotions with family— I shut them out emotionally. [My mother] was just happy that I had somebody I could trust and I could talk to about the divorce.” “We’d sit [in his classroom] and talk about everything and anything,” she continues. Parrish says she didn’t think anything was amiss about their friendship until she heard about Thomas’ alleged abduction last month. “I never saw anything wrong with our friendship. He made me feel safe and he tried to do that with all of his students, so I never saw it as too weird.” A warrant has been issued for Cummins’ arrest on charges of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with a minor, according to the TBI. The latter claim stems from an incident in which Cummins allegedly kissed Thomas on Jan. 23, after which he was suspended from his job. He was fired after he and Thomas went missing. TBI A Love Song? Parrish says she and Cummins became friends when he taught her health sciences class. She says that like Thomas, she and Cummins would talk extensively before and after class. “[He didn’t] talk too much about himself at all,” Parrish says. “Whenever we were alone he would talk to me about how I was doing or try to give me advice on what I was going through.” When she heard about Thomas’ disappearance, Parrish says she remembered something from her friendship with Cummins that, up until three weeks ago, seemed normal: A love song Cummins allegedly performed for her in the school’s music room, which she recorded on her phone. • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

I kind of thought about it [later] but I didn’t think about anything bad, I didn’t process them because it was Tad, the person I trusted.” The song, which Parrish believes was written by Cummins for her, describes a deep love, with the line: “I could swim for a thousand miles in the oceans inside your eyes and never reach the side.” Like Thomas, Parrish spent time with Cummins in and out of school. She sometimes attended church on Sundays with Cummins and his wife, Jill, and would get lunch with them. She says she never got to know Jill, who last week filed for divorce after more than three decades of marriage. “He was the one that everybody trusted,” Parrish says of her shock when hearing last month’s news. “[Up until recently] I was in a lot of denial.” Jill Cummins at a press conference in March Source: FOX 17 • Pick up PEOPLE’s special edition True Crime Stories: Cases That Shocked America, on sale now, for the latest on Casey Anthony, JonBenét Ramsey and more. Cummins is believed to have used his time in school to “groom” Thomas, her family previously told PEOPLE. The father-of-two allegedly presented himself as a confidant for students, Parrish says. In a previous interview with PEOPLE, Thomas’ father Anthony said he believes being approachable was part of Cummins’ plan. “He built up a system where she was dependent on him,” Thomas’ dad, Anthony, says of Cummins’ alleged efforts to woo the high school freshman. In addition to homework help, Anthony says Cummins “[gave] her money, bought a microwave so she would heat food up in his room [and] try and get her out of trouble.”   The Search Continues Last week, Tennessee officials released photos of Cummins and Thomas at a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, captured two days after they were reported missing. They appeared to have dyed their hair. It is unclear at this time whether Thomas went with Cummins willingly. The pair allegedly exchanged emails described by Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper as “romantic” prior to their disappearance. Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas Tennessee Bureau of Investigations Authorities believe Cummins is likely keeping Elizabeth “off the grid” and they’ve urged the public to search their properties, local campgrounds, rural areas and parking garages. Last week, officials announced the pair could potentially be in Mexico or further south. Elizabeth was last placed in Alabama and was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. She is 5 feet 5 inches inches tall and weighs 120 lbs., with blonde hair and hazel eyes. Cummins, who is described as being “armed and dangerous,” was seen driving a Silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate 976ZPT, according to the TBI. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 lbs., with brown hair and eyes. Anyone with information on Cummins or Elizabeth should call the TBI at 1-800-TBI-FIND.
