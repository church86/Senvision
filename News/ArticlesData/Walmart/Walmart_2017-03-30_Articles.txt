For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its "Everyday Low Price" guarantee. Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales, according to a presentation the company made at the summit, which Recode reviewed. To accomplish that, the brands that sell their goods through Walmart would have to cut their wholesale prices or make other cost adjustments to shave at least 15 percent off. In some cases, vendors say they would lose money on each sale if they met Walmartâ(TM)s demands. Brands that agree to play ball with Walmart could expect better distribution and more strategic help from the giant retailer. And to those that didnâ(TM)t? Walmart said it would limit their distribution and create its own branded products to directly challenge its own suppliers. But this time around, Walmart's renewed focus on its "Everyday Low Price" promise coincides with Amazon's increased aggressiveness in its own pricing of the packaged goods that are found on supermarket shelves and are core to Walmart's success, industry executives and consultants say. The result in recent months has been a high-stakes race to the bottom between Walmart and Amazon that seems great for shoppers, but has consumer packaged goods brands feeling the pressure. amazon business internet ← You may like to read: → House Approves Bill To Force Public Release of EPA Science Donald Trump Wins US Presidency Garmin Engineer Shot And Killed By Man Yelling 'Get Out Of My Country!'

Of course this includes many decent people of modest means and quite a few thoroughly unpleasant people.

Saritha RaiP. R. Sanjai Radhakishan Damani. D-Mart outlets follow a simple design—wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Bangalore/Mumbai: Radhakishan Damani may be India’s Sam Walton. Like the Walmart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. So successful that when Damani’s 15-year-old company, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, went public last week, the stock price more than doubled on the first day of trading in Mumbai, valuing his direct family’s interest at about $3.6 billion. The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. By appealing to homemakers with cheap, reliable staples and giving them ample parking in convenient locations, Damani has not only successfully countered the threat from online retailers, but beat them on earnings. Amazon.com Inc., the global giant that’s investing $5 billion in the Indian market, and Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the biggest domestic e-commerce company, are yet to make money in India, whereas Avenue Supermarts said it had net profit after tax of Rs3.2 billion ($49.3 million) in the year ended March 2016. “The low-cost ethos that was embedded into the Walmart chain by Sam Walton has become the hallmark of Damani, who’s ingrained it into his Avenue Supermarts,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt., which tracks retail trends in India. “Like Walmart, Damani has stuck to a single format and peddled a significant proportion of private-label goods from the very beginning.” Stag profit Avenue Supermarts’ shares jumped as high as Rs650 before closing at Rs641.6 on their 21 March debut, compared with an initial public offering price of Rs299. The share sale raised Rs18.7 billion, attracted bids for 106 times the quantity available, and was the best IPO performance in India in four years. The shares closed at Rs631.85 in Mumbai Thursday, valuing the company at Rs394 billion.

Damani and his direct family have financial interests in Avenue Supermarts amounting to about 60% of the company. Soft-spoken with a preference for white clothing, Damani eschews media attention. He earned hundreds of millions of dollars from successful stock market investments that he used to kick-start a bricks-and-mortar retailing business just when many merchandisers were focusing on e-commerce. Damani wasn’t available for an interview, an external spokesperson for the company said. Urban sprawl The retail chain, with its 129 D Mart stores in more than 40 cities, is now more valuable than local rivals Future Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent Ltd combined. Stores typically cater to bargain shoppers in the heartlands of India’s urban sprawl. Importantly, the land is acquired before real estate prices in the area have surged, said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm. “We observe our customers and plan for them,” said Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive officer at Avenue Supermarts, adding that D Mart’s business model has evolved since its first store opened in 2002. It centers largely on everyday low prices—a concept reminiscent of Walmart Stores Inc., the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company started by Sam Walton in 1962. Avenue’s approach is also to procure merchandise at low prices and to avoid relying on sporadic promotions on specific products, the Mumbai-based company said in a regulatory filing in September. ‘Unfancy stores’ “D-Mart has unfancy stores,” said Technopak’s Singhal. “If other retailers became counter-intuitive and chased retail glamour by opening stores in malls, launching multiple formats and going national, D-Mart has been intuitive by sticking to the very basics.” It doesn’t hire high-profile executives, pay “stratospheric” salaries or overspend on marketing and advertising—all of which are hallmarks of Indian retailers, Singhal said. “It’s not like Damani has stumbled on some magic formula—he hasn’t,” Singhal said. “These should have been the basic rules for every retail business in India.” D-Mart outlets follow a simple design: wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Elevators move shoppers and their trolleys between levels, with groceries and food staples located below household goods and sports equipment, and textiles and soft furnishings on the floor above. No time to clean “D-Mart offers me the best prices, and the grains are very clean—which is a big advantage over other retail stores in the vicinity,” said Varsha Nilesh Benke, a 35-year-old office worker, while on a twice-monthly weekend shop at the Seawoods store, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from downtown Mumbai. “Since I’m a working woman, I don’t have time to clean grains.” Benke said she’s happy to purchase apparel online, but prefers to see for herself the rice and pulses she needs before buying. “D-Mart also offers free gift-wrapping services, which makes it convenient to buy a gift here,” Benke added. Retiree V.P. Sharma, who lives in Navi Mumbai, a satellite town east of the city, also says D-Mart has a distinct advantage over online retailers. “They show something on the net and deliver something else,” he said, while shopping at the same store. “Also, the delivery at odd hours, making e-commerce very inconvenient.” India hasn’t yet reached its retail renaissance, Boston Consulting Group said in a 21 March report, in which it predicted the South Asian nation will become the world’s third-largest consumer market by 2025. Domestic consumption will triple to $4 trillion by the middle of the next decade as rising affluence drives consumer behavior and spending, including in nascent agglomerations like the ones D-Mart is focusing on. “Damani may not have the size and scale of Walmart, but certainly Damani is Sam Walton in the making,” said Kejriwal at KRIS.

Dmitriy S. Sveshnikov, 22, faces two allegations of indecent liberties in connection with the March 15 incident. Battle Ground police were dispatched about 5:15 p.m. to the Wal-Mart at 1201 S.W. 13th Ave., for a report of a sex crime. A 16-year-old girl was groped by an unknown man inside the store, according to an affidavit of probable cause. The girl told police she was shopping alone in the toy aisle when a man approached her and grabbed her “butt” from behind. When she turned around, she saw the man, whom she didn’t recognize, standing close to her. She said the incident happened quickly but that she asked him, “What are you doing?” She said the man “smirked” at her and then walked away down the aisle, the affidavit states. The girl said she kept shopping but saw the same man from a distance over the next several minutes. While standing in the check-out line, she noticed a female Wal-Mart employee who appeared to be upset and crying, and then “it hit me,” she told police. She said she thought the same thing may have happened to the employee, according to court documents. She told an assistant manager what had happened and described the man and what he was wearing to police. The assistant manager reported that an employee was also grabbed, court records said. That employee was working near the fitting rooms when the man walked passed her, grabbed her “butt” and kept walking. She said she turned and yelled at him, but he didn’t respond, the affidavit states. Police obtained surveillance footage of the suspect entering and leaving the store and an image of the pickup he was driving. The information and photos were released to the public March 21. Several tipsters reported seeing the pickup in the Battle Ground and Vancouver areas. One caller identified the driver as “Dmitriy,” according to court documents. Sveshnikov called the police department March 22 and said he recognized himself from the press release. He stated that he didn’t know why police were looking for him and that he didn’t do anything wrong. He wanted to clear his name, he said, and reported to the department. Sveshnikov denied contacting or grabbing anyone at the store and said he believed it was a case of mistaken identity, court records state. He will retain his own attorney, court records show, and his bail was set at $20,000. He will be arraigned April 13.   Jessica Prokop Columbian Courts Reporter  360-735-4551  @jprokop16  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Saritha Rai and P R Sanjai Radhakishan Damani may be India’s Sam Walton. Like the Wal-Mart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. So successful that when Damani’s 15-year-old company, Avenue Supermarts Ltd., went public last week, the stock price more than doubled on the first day of trading in Mumbai, valuing his direct family’s interest at about $3.6 billion. The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. By appealing to homemakers with cheap, reliable staples and giving them ample parking in convenient locations, Damani has not only successfully countered the threat from online retailers, but beat them on earnings. Amazon.com Inc., the global giant that’s investing $5 billion in the Indian market, and Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the biggest domestic e-commerce company, are yet to make money in India, whereas Avenue Supermarts said it had net profit after tax of 3.2 billion rupees ($49.3 million) in the year ended March 2016. “The low-cost ethos that was embedded into the Wal-Mart chain by Sam Walton has become the hallmark of Damani, who’s ingrained it into his Avenue Supermarts,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt., which tracks retail trends in India. “Like Wal-Mart, Damani has stuck to a single format and peddled a significant proportion of private-label goods from the very beginning.” Stag Profit Avenue Supermarts’ shares jumped as high as 650 rupees before closing at 641.6 rupees on their March 21 debut, compared with an initial public offering price of 299 rupees. The share sale raised 18.7 billion rupees, attracted bids for 106 times the quantity available, and was the best IPO performance in India in four years. The shares closed at 631.85 rupees in Mumbai Thursday, valuing the company at 394 billion rupees ($6 billion). For 61-year-old Damani, a former stockbroker who was raised in a one-room apartment in a Mumbai tenement block, the listing catapulted Damani’s wealth beyond that of Ajay Piramal, Anil Ambani and Kapil Bhatia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Damani and his direct family have financial interests in Avenue Supermarts amounting to about 60 percent of the company. Soft-spoken with a preference for white clothing, Damani eschews media attention. He earned hundreds of millions of dollars from successful stock market investments that he used to kick-start a bricks-and-mortar retailing business just when many merchandisers were focusing on e-commerce. Damani wasn’t available for an interview, an external spokesperson for the company said. Urban Sprawl The retail chain, with its 129 D-Mart stores in more than 40 cities, is now more valuable than local rivals Future Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent Ltd. combined. Stores typically cater to bargain shoppers in the heartlands of India’s urban sprawl. Importantly, the land is acquired before real estate prices in the area have surged, said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm. “We observe our customers and plan for them,” said Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive officer at Avenue Supermarts, adding that D-Mart’s business model has evolved since its first store opened in 2002.

Scott Hilton, chief revenue officer for Walmart eCommerce U.S., and Steve Breen, senior vice president of merchandising for Walmart.com, shared strategy insights with suppliers at the Wal-Street Speaker Series event held in Bentonville on Thursday (Mar. 31). Breen opened the meeting saying the Jet.com acquisition has been transformational for Wal-Mart’s online business. Hilton, who joined Wal-Mart with the Jet.com acquisition, said nearly all retail categories are moving online. He said when Amazon started with books years ago it made sense when lots of other categories did not. Hilton who also worked for Quidsi, parent of Diapers.com, said gradually many more categories have shifted online. Clothing, footwear, jewelry and watches will in the next three years see more than $30 billion in e-commerce growth in the U.S,  according to Forrester Research. Even laggard categories like pets are poised to see roughly $5 billion in additional e-commerce growth by 2020. Home and garden is expected to pick up $10 billion in online revenue growth and consumer electronics could see $30 billion in incremental online revenue over the next three years. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates U.S. e-commerce revenue will grow from just more than $400 billion this year to $600 billion by 2020. Hilton said the online revenue is a mere fraction of the $2.9 trillion offline retail market in the U.S. The executives said it’s a mistake for suppliers to underestimate the importance mobile phones are playing in e-commerce sales. Of the $343 billion in U.S. e-commerce sales last year, one third were completed by mobile devices – a whopping $115 billion in retail sales made from a mobile device. More importantly Hilton said customers today are just shopping and they may move between several devices looking at items online and then eventually make the purchase in a store. Breen said Walmart.com wants customers to use their mobile phones while in-store to make their shopping experience more pleasant and the retailer also wants the online experience with the mobile phone to be equally satisfying. CATEGORY EXPERTISE One major change at Walmart.com is that Lore wants category managers to know their products A to Z. He said last week at the ShopTalk Conference in Las Vegas that the recent acquisitions of Moosejaw, ShoeBuy, ModCloth and Hayneedle through the Jet.com deal gives the Walmart a major advantage in certain categories which is why he is putting those subsidiary CEOs in charge of specific categories for the entire operation. Breen said MIke Sorabella is going to be responsible for shoes not only sold on ShoeBuy but also the entire retail shoe business on Walmart.com and Jet.com. “Mike has a team of 220 people in Boston who really know footwear and how to sell it online because that is all they do. We would have previously had a buyer that focused half the day on shoes and the other half on say flannel shirts, which maybe a bigger category,” Breen said. The same will be true of Hayneedle for home furnishings, Moosejaw for outdoor adventure gear and apparel, and ModCloth for trendy ladies fashion and accessories. While the subsidiary CEOs will oversee the category, Scott said there is also 28 category managers at walmart.com responsible for the entire category, regardless if the goods are sold at only Walmart.com or also Jet.com and the other online stores. Hilton said there is no way Wal-Mart is going to collapse the recent acquisition sites and roll them under the Walmart brand. He said they will exist and flourish separately which will benefit Wal-Mart Stores in the long run. He said the new category teams are deeply focused on the items but also the user experiences regardless of which site customers are shopping. ‘IT’S’ PROTOCOL Breen said this past year Walmart.com began growing its online inventory from around 5 million to start the year to 30 million items at year-end. He said the retailer now has about 35 million items on its website. He said having a broad assortment is just part of the retailer’s new strategy that it calls “It’s.” Lore previously mentioned the new “It’s” protocol, but Breen and HIlton gave suppliers more details around the new strategy they say will make a difference for shoppers online and in store. The “It” strategy has five components. 1. Have it 2. Find it 3. Display it 4. Price it 5. Deliver it Breen said that the top 1 million items sold online account for roughly two-thirds of total online sales, which means Wal-Mart is focused on making sure it has those top selling items. By having the item, the products must be in the fulfillment centers. “After we know we have physically have those items in our possession, we also also work with our market-place suppliers to ensure they have them too,” Breen said. Hilton said it’s easy to look back and see the top selling items, but knowing what they will be in the future is “a forward-looking problem.” He said knowing the products and categories well will ensure the retailer gets the right with the help of its suppliers. Hilton said for customers to “find it” suppliers will need to step up their participation in furnishing the specific product content to increase the searchability. He said the retailer will do its part by furnishing customers with easy re-order buttons, but for the sale to take place they must first be able to easily find what they are looking for online, regardless of what device they use. Breen said the next step of “display it” also requires help from suppliers. He said having accurate, searchable content, high resolution photos and videos when applicable can be a difference maker in converting searches into sales. He said the retailer recently worked on content for plastic storage bags and the team spent time on specific details of the bags, such as ziplock closures, count in box, ounces each bag would hold and after supplying the deep level details, sales nearly doubled. Hilton also implored suppliers to give the retailer all the products it makes. “We want to see your entire product catalog, that means everything you make. Give us all the products you have because the general manager can know which products best fit the various sites available. This streamlined approach for category management means you have just one contact regardless if you sell on Walmart.com, Jet.com and perhaps Hayneedle or ShoeBuy.” The fourth prong in the plan regarding pricing the items is self explanatory. Breen said the retailer is working to ensure the online and in-store prices match to instill consumer trust. He said the general managers will set the price, while also making sure it’s competitive with Amazon and other retailers. He said getting the lowest price from suppliers is a big help in that endeavor. Hilton re-emphasized the importance of a low cost of goods to the retailer’s overall plan. He told suppliers that if there is some way to change the packaging that could reduce shipping costs, those plans can be worked out with the retailer. “We want to help suppliers take costs out of the supply chain where we can do so,” Hilton said. The fifth prong in the plan is to “deliver it” in a way that pleases the customer. Sometimes that will be picking it up on their way home. Other times it could be two-day delivery at home with a minimum $35 ticket. He said the $35 minimum order was set to encourage customers to engage in building a basket, and wasn’t totally arbitrary. He said two-day home delivery is more like “table stakes” today but said the company does it without an annual subscription fee. When asked if there is any plans to combine SamsClub.com with the Walmart.com sites, Hilton said absolutely not. He said SamsClub.com has its own dedicated e-commerce team focused on that separate business. When asked to quantify what the Jet.com purchase meant for the two companies Hilton said it gave Jet.com and now the other subsidiaries instant scale and financial stability. “Retail is a scale game and Walmart gave that to Jet overnight,” Hilton said. “Each party also benefits from the experience of the other.” Breen said Wal-Mart gained access to a team of people with much e-commerce experience. He said they are digital natives who understand the importance of mobile and curated content, while also delivering unique shopping experiences that allow them to draw a diverse fan base. –––––––––––––––––- Editor’s note: The Supply Side section of Talk Business & Politics focuses on the companies, organizations, issues and individuals engaged in providing products and services to retailers.

Adam Levy (TMFnCaffeine) Mar 30, 2017 at 6:24PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is the king of retail. Well, it's the king of brick-and-mortar retail. When it comes to online sales, it's still well behind Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). Wal-Mart, though, is spending heavily to catch up, acquiring Jet.com and several other e-commerce websites over the past year. But for all Wal-Mart's efforts, Amazon is still widening the gap. Amazon accounted for over half of U.S. e-commerce growth last year, according to some estimates. And e-commerce is by far the biggest driving factor of overall retail growth in the United States. E-commerce accounted for 9.5% of all retail in the fourth quarter, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Online sales increased around 15% for the year, while the overall industry was up just about 3%. Wal-Mart is the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in the world. As Amazon and other e-commerce sites start eating into more traditional brick-and-mortar retail segments, Wal-Mart investors may have something to worry about. Image source: Wal-Mart Wal-Mart's e-commerce spending is going off the charts Wal-Mart made big headlines when it announced the acquisition of Jet.com for $3.3 billion last year. Few people paid attention to the streak of acquisitions Wal-Mart and Jet have made since then. Jet.com acquired Hayneedle just before the deal with Wal-Mart closed. Under Wal-Mart it acquired ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, and ModCloth. What's more, Wal-Mart's head of e-commerce in the U.S., Marc Lore, said it's "a fair assumption" that Jet and Wal-Mart will pursue more of these types of acquisitions. Wal-Mart is also investing in building out its own technology. It's creating a start-up incubator called Store No. 8 to build new technologies to enhance the customer experience both in stores and online. The company didn't disclose how much it plans to pour into the project. Wal-Mart doesn't have an R&D expense on its income statement, but if it did, it'd surely be rocketing higher. Still, it has to compete with the $16 billion Amazon spent on technology and content last year. (Some of that spending goes to support Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud-computing division, as well as Prime Instant Video). Wal-Mart may have the resources to spend that much, but there's one big concern Wal-Mart investors should have. Nobody can compete with Amazon Amazon has a huge moat called Amazon Prime. Amazon likely has over 70 million Prime subscribers, and the first place they go when they want to buy something online is Amazon.com. Wal-Mart tried to compete with Amazon Prime by offering its own shipping service -- ShippingPass. Earlier this year it ended the $49 per year program and started offering free two-day shipping to everyone for over 2 million items on its website (on orders $35 or more). That won't show up in R&D either, but it'll likely hit Wal-Mart's operating margin. The bigger problem, though, is that Amazon is at the top of mind for consumers shopping online. More than half of online shoppers start their product search on Amazon.com. Wal-Mart can piece together a bunch of web properties with a few million in sales each, but it won't cut into Amazon's huge dedicated customer base. So Wal-Mart may be spending heavily to grow its e-commerce through acquisitions and a new start-up incubator, but there's no indication that any of its efforts will produce results for the company -- especially considering the premiums it's paying for all these relatively small web stores. Again, e-commerce is the main driving force behind retail growth in the U.S. If Wal-Mart's only means of growing its online sales is through expensive acquisitions, that should concern investors. That's especially true considering nobody has been capable of cutting into Amazon's lead.  Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Amazon.

By Spencer Soper and Craig Giammona Bloomberg News  March 30, 2017 SEATTLE — Amazon has invited some of the world’s biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to convince them it’s time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass such chains as Walmart, Target, and Costco. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez, and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from worldwide consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports to founder Jeff Bezos. Advertisement Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged, and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Walmart aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate.

Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘Times are changing,’’ Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. ‘‘Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.’’ Manufacturers would have to reimagine everything from the way products are made to how they’re packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers, and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Factories could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It’s unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market — an $800 billion category still dominated by Walmart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Advertisement Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales now, e-commerce is the future. ‘‘Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,’’ says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. ‘‘But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.’’ Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores persuaded brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. ‘‘There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth,’’ says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages’ tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of ‘‘frustration-free’’ products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike chief executive Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon’s Seattle gathering. The event’s cohost is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark, and Land O’ Lakes butter. Amazon’s pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Walmart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with such concepts as buy online, pick up in store. Startups Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Walmart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Loading comments...

Will the company be able to recreate the success of its original Wii? Tune in to learn more. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*  David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned.   This video was recorded on March 23, 2017. Vincent Shen: On the console side, there's been a lot of news -- now we're diving a little into things that might be driving the industry. I saw some rumors around new console generations. Since the last big release of the Xbox and PlayStation, around 2013, approaching that time when we usually get a refresh. But I want to talk first about something that is out now, which is the Switch from Nintendo. This latest device so far, from what I've heard from some friends and also for the inability for people to find these in stores because they're selling out so quickly, it's doing quite well. Keep in mind that Nintendo, right now, is in a position where they really want the Switch to succeed, especially after the struggle they had with the Wii U. To give you some perspective, the Wii U only sold about 13.5 million units in its entire four years on the market. A strong year for a more popular console like the PlayStation, that might be one year or 1.5 years of sales for them. So, in terms of lifetime volume, that's quite low. And compared to the original Wii -- even my wife, who is not a video gamer at all, she has one -- it was the kind of console that really brought in a lot of new gamers, or people who hadn't played video games since they were much younger. The original Wii sold 17 million units in its first calendar year. Eventually, it topped 100 million units in its lifetime. PlayStation 4 right now has an installed base of around 50 million. The numbers that Nintendo is hoping to put up for the Switch, management expects it to move about 2 million units by the end of March, some estimates say that 1.5 million units were sold in just the first week of its release. Have you followed this at all? Seen any demonstrations of it? What do you think, in terms of how this can drive competition with the other major consoles? Seth McNew: Yeah, at the beginning, you couldn't find a Switch in any stores, they were sold out right away. I wasn't quite sure, maybe that created some scarcity there, they were trying to drive up some of the interest. But so far, it seems like it has been selling really well, so maybe it's just beating their own expectations there. Shen: A report recently -- I forgot to add this -- from The Wall Street Journal said that management planned to double its production. For the fiscal year ending March 2018, their production would jump from 8 million to 16 million, indicating potential first year sales of over 10 million units. This is outperforming a lot of analyst estimates. I think initially, for that first year of the release of this device, some analysts were putting total sales at just in the 4 to 5 million range. So, really blowing that out of the water. From what I've seen, the only thing that is holding this back from hitting that threshold and taking off and being a huge success for the company is titles. This is where, I think, the more well-known PlayStation and Xbox have that advantage. Right now, with the Switch, the only game that I know of that's really drawing in people, it's called Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The reviews for this are fantastic. I think the Switch console actually sells with this game to 90% of customers. McNew: Yeah. This was the game that they really marketed as they were talking about the device, this is the one they were saying was going to be the big game. Shen: So, right now, otherwise, from Nintendo, a lot of their other major releases, in terms of those most famous franchise characters they have, which, people have pushed them in the past to move away from producing consoles and just try to monetize their very rich library of IP. But, they're not expected to release more games for Mario, for example, until later in the year, hitting the holiday season a little bit better, and also just trying to give a little bit of runway so they can slowly build up steam. But, I'm interested to see if that holds them back at all, because even the best game, if you have only one title to really hold on to people at first, we'll have to see how their momentum builds over time. McNew: Of course. And they do have a really rich library, like you were saying. But I think there's also the risk -- I mean, look at Super Mario Run that they released for mobile earlier this year or last year, it didn't perform nearly as well as they thought it would. So, I think there is that risk, you can't just say just because those are iconic names that the games themselves will perform well. But I hope they do, because I think this could be a really interesting change to the gaming industry. Keep up with money news, sent to your inbox Sign Up!

(KSNW) – A neighborhood in northeast Wichita is getting frustrated at how difficult it is to get a neighborhood grocery store. The Walmart Neighborhood Market at 13th and Oliver shut down last year making the area a food desert. It means people with no cars have to walk more than a mile to get to the nearest store. However, a furniture store is going into the old Walmart location. James Walker has lived at 13th and Oliver his whole life. He was frustrated to learn the newest business in the neighborhood won’t be a grocery store. “You don’t need another furniture store in the area.” Walker was hoping that when the Walmart shutdown it would eventually be replaced by another grocery store. Right no, there are a few options for food like the Sav-A-Lot, QuikTrip and dollar store. The nearest full service grocery store is miles away. “21st and Rock or Douglass and Hillside.” Walker’s concerned that those without transportation can’t walk that far for the basics. “Say you need some hamburger meat or just anything, a banana, an apple say you need an apple you know, you gotta walk six miles round trip for an apple.” He says without a full-service grocery store it’s tough for the community to sustain itself. “It’s still a community. Ya know even as detached as it is in 2017, it’s still a community so when you do stuff like that, you’re pushing the community off, your’re making it hard for the community to eat.” Renovations for the former Walmart will begin this year.

Like the Wal-Mart founder, he’s a self-made billionaire from humble beginnings with a successful formula for retailing. So successful that when Damani’s 15-year-old company, Avenue Supermarts Ltd., went public last week, the stock price more than doubled on the first day of trading in Mumbai, valuing his direct family’s interest at about $3.6 billion. The reason has much to do with Damani’s strategy of offering knockdown prices on everything from lentils to laundry powder in multistory hypermarkets on India’s urban fringes. Radhakishan Damani Photographer: Rajesh/StageKraft via D-Mart By appealing to homemakers with cheap, reliable staples and giving them ample parking in convenient locations, Damani has not only successfully countered the threat from online retailers, but beat them on earnings. Amazon.com Inc., the global giant that’s investing $5 billion in the Indian market, and Flipkart Online Services Pvt., the biggest domestic e-commerce company, are yet to make money in India, whereas Avenue Supermarts said it had net profit after tax of 3.2 billion rupees ($49.3 million) in the year ended March 2016. “The low-cost ethos that was embedded into the Wal-Mart chain by Sam Walton has become the hallmark of Damani, who’s ingrained it into his Avenue Supermarts,” said Arvind Singhal, chairman of retail consultancy Technopak Advisors Pvt., which tracks retail trends in India. “Like Wal-Mart, Damani has stuck to a single format and peddled a significant proportion of private-label goods from the very beginning.” Stag Profit Avenue Supermarts’ shares jumped as high as 650 rupees before closing at 641.6 rupees on their March 21 debut, compared with an initial public offering price of 299 rupees. The share sale raised 18.7 billion rupees, attracted bids for 106 times the quantity available, and was the best IPO performance in India in four years. The shares closed at 631.85 rupees in Mumbai Thursday, valuing the company at 394 billion rupees ($6 billion). For 61-year-old Damani, a former stockbroker who was raised in a one-room apartment in a Mumbai tenement block, the listing catapulted Damani’s wealth beyond that of Ajay Piramal, Anil Ambani and Kapil Bhatia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Damani and his direct family have financial interests in Avenue Supermarts amounting to about 60 percent of the company. Soft-spoken with a preference for white clothing, Damani eschews media attention. He earned hundreds of millions of dollars from successful stock market investments that he used to kick-start a bricks-and-mortar retailing business just when many merchandisers were focusing on e-commerce. Damani wasn’t available for an interview, an external spokesperson for the company said. Urban Sprawl The retail chain, with its 129 D-Mart stores in more than 40 cities, is now more valuable than local rivals Future Retail, Aditya Birla Fashion and Trent Ltd. combined. A D-Mart supermarket in Thane, Maharashtra. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg Stores typically cater to bargain shoppers in the heartlands of India’s urban sprawl. Importantly, the land is acquired before real estate prices in the area have surged, said Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, an investment advisory firm.  “We observe our customers and plan for them,” said Neville Noronha, managing director and chief executive officer at Avenue Supermarts, adding that D-Mart’s business model has evolved since its first store opened in 2002. It centers largely on everyday low prices -- a concept reminiscent of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company started by Sam Walton in 1962. Avenue’s approach is also to procure merchandise at low prices and to avoid relying on sporadic promotions on specific products, the Mumbai-based company said in a regulatory filing in September. ‘Unfancy Stores’ “D-Mart has unfancy stores,” said Technopak’s Singhal. “If other retailers became counter-intuitive and chased retail glamour by opening stores in malls, launching multiple formats and going national, D-Mart has been intuitive by sticking to the very basics.” It doesn’t hire high-profile executives, pay “stratospheric” salaries or overspend on marketing and advertising -- all of which are hallmarks of Indian retailers, Singhal said. “It’s not like Damani has stumbled on some magic formula -- he hasn’t,” Singhal said. “These should have been the basic rules for every retail business in India.” D-Mart outlets follow a simple design: wide aisles on white-tiled floors under fluorescent tube lights. Elevators move shoppers and their trolleys between levels, with groceries and food staples located below household goods and sports equipment, and textiles and soft furnishings on the floor above. No Time to Clean “D-Mart offers me the best prices, and the grains are very clean -- which is a big advantage over other retail stores in the vicinity,” said Varsha Nilesh Benke, a 35-year-old office worker, while on a twice-monthly weekend shop at the Seawoods store, 35 kilometers (22 miles) from downtown Mumbai. “Since I’m a working woman, I don’t have time to clean grains.” Shoppers browse different varieties of rice at a D-Mart supermarket. Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg Benke said she’s happy to purchase apparel online, but prefers to see for herself the rice and pulses she needs before buying. “D-Mart also offers free gift-wrapping services, which makes it convenient to buy a gift here,” Benke added. Retiree V.P. Sharma, who lives in Navi Mumbai, a satellite town east of the city, also says D-Mart has a distinct advantage over online retailers. “They show something on the net and deliver something else,” he said, while shopping at the same store. “Also, the delivery at odd hours, making e-commerce very inconvenient.” Exclusive insights on technology around the world.

Domestic consumption will triple to $4 trillion by the middle of the next decade as rising affluence drives consumer behavior and spending, including in nascent agglomerations like the ones D-Mart is focusing on.  “Damani may not have the size and scale of Wal-Mart, but certainly Damani is Sam Walton in the making,” said Kejriwal at KRIS.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(Photo Illustration by Liz Martin/The Gazette) Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers have been invited to attend a three-day gathering in May at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. (Photo Illustration by Liz Martin/The Gazette) By Bloomberg News Mar 30, 2017 at 3:52 pm | Print View Amazon has invited some of the world’s biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to persuade them that it’s time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass chains such as Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to CEO Jeff Bezos. Amazon is seeking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a store aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. “Times are changing,” Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. “Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.” Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they’re packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It’s unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market-an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. “Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,” says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. “But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.” Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores convinced brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. “There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth,” says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a possibly welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages’ tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of “frustration-free” products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike COO Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon’s Seattle gathering. The event’s co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O’ Lakes butter. Amazon’s pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with things like buy-online, pick up in store. Startups like Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Wal-Mart and Amazon squared off last week in Las Vegas with keynote speeches at the ShopTalk conference that drew more than 5,000 attendees, including executives with major brands. Marc Lore, who heads Wal-Mart’s e-commerce initiatives, touted the price leverage of the world’s biggest retailer that buys products by the truckload. Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon’s marketplace, said the online retailer would continue to narrow shipping times and talked up a future when one-hour delivery is the standard. Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, says Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren’t willing to sell on its marketplace. “Fear, more than anything else,” Cassar says, “may compel these companies to pay attention.” Like what you're reading?

Print   Email   Font Resize Local News Sterling Walmart apologizes after couple ejected over service dog New Sterling residents reluctant to return to store By Jeff Rice Journal-Advocate staff writer Posted:   03/30/2017 02:18:28 PM MDT Donnie Hogan with Sonya, his 8-year-old American pit bull service dog. (Jeff Rice / Sterling Journal-Advocate) Management at the Sterling Walmart has issued an apology to a Sterling couple and reaffirmed its commitment to allowing service animals after a misunderstanding last weekend caused the couple and their service dog to be escorted from the store. Donnie and Micki Hogan told the Journal-Advocate they were shopping at the Sterling Walmart on Sunday, March 26, with Donnie's service dog, an American pit bull named Sonya. Donnie suffers from a condition known as ankylosing spondylitis, a painful spinal disease that tends to fuse the vertebrae together and causes stiffness in the joints. Sonya helps Donnie stand up and steadies him as he stands and walks. The dog, the Hogans said, was wearing her harness, which clearly identified her as a service dog. Donnie said he had dropped Sonya's leash to hang onto a shopping cart to steady himself while he talked to an associate about a product he wanted to buy. Micki Hogan said while they were talking with the associate they were accosted by an employee named Lori who identified herself as an "asset control" person and who demanded to know the breed of Donnie's service dog, Sonya. When the Hogans tried to answer the associate's questions, they were told the dog had to be on a leash. When they tried to explain why Donnie Hogan had dropped the leash, the employee identified as Lori let them know she didn't believe them and, according to Micki, continued to harangue them about store policies. Advertisement Micki said more employees were called over along with an assistant store manager, and after several minutes the couple was escorted out of the store. "We wanted to continue shopping but they virtually pushed us out the door," Micki said in an email to the Journal-Advocate. "It was the most humiliating thing we have experienced." By Tuesday afternoon, however, Walmart management had had a change of heart. Micki Hogan said store manager Tanya Berner called her, said managers at the Sterling store reviewed video of the incident, and confirmed that the Hogans were doing nothing wrong. In a prepared statement issued Thursday afternoon by Khim Aday in Walmart's corporate communications office in Bentonville, Ark., the company re-asserted its pro-service animal policy. "Service animals play a vital role in helping those with challenges live happy, independent lives," the statement said. "We're committed to providing a safe shopping experience for those shoppers and associates relying on assistance from service animals. To help provide guidance, we base our store policies on the rules provided by the ADA." In an interview earlier in the week, the Hogans said even after the apology they were reluctant to return to the Sterling store because of the crowd that had gathered around them. They said they've only lived in Sterling a couple of weeks, having moved here from Superior, Nebraska, to open a business. "We're new here, nobody knows us, and now, if we go back to the store, people are going to think we're thieves or something," Micki said. "That's how we were treated and I'm afraid that's what people will think if we show our faces there again. It's hard enough for him to go into any store anyway. He's on anti-anxiety medication because his condition makes him really self-conscious and nervous." Because life in a small rural town almost requires doing business with WalMart at some point, for the time being the Hogans drive over to Fort Morgan to do most of their shopping.

For years, Walmart had dominated the retail landscape on the back of its “Everyday Low Price” guarantee. But now, Walmart was too often getting beaten on price. So company executives were there, in part, to reset expectations with Walmart’s suppliers — the consumer brands whose chips, sodas and diapers line the shelves of its Supercenters and its website. Walmart wants to have the lowest price on 80 percent of its sales, according to a presentation the company made at the summit, which Recode reviewed. To accomplish that, the brands that sell their goods through Walmart would have to cut their wholesale prices or make other cost adjustments to shave at least 15 percent off. In some cases, vendors say they would lose money on each sale if they met Walmart’s demands. Brands that agree to play ball with Walmart could expect better distribution and more strategic help from the giant retailer. And to those that didn’t? Walmart said it would limit their distribution and create its own branded products to directly challenge its own suppliers. “Once every three or four years, Walmart tells you to take the money you’re spending on [marketing] initiatives and invest it in lower prices,” said Jason Goldberg, the head of the commerce practice at SapientRazorfish, a digital agency that works with large brands and retailers. “They sweep all the chips off the table and drill you down on price.” But this time around, Walmart’s renewed focus on its “Everyday Low Price” promise coincides with Amazon’s increased aggressiveness in its own pricing of the packaged goods that are found on supermarket shelves and are core to Walmart’s success, industry executives and consultants say. The result in recent months has been a high-stakes race to the bottom between Walmart and Amazon that seems great for shoppers, but has consumer packaged goods brands feeling the pressure. The pricing crackdown also comes in the wake of Walmart’s $3 billion acquisition of Jet.com and its CEO Marc Lore. Lore now runs Walmart.com and has said one of his mandates is to create new ways for the retailer to beat everyone else on price, including Amazon. The pricing pressure has ignited intense wargaming inside the largest CPG companies, according to people familiar with discussions at Procter & Gamble, Unilever, PepsiCo, Mondelez and Kimberly-Clark. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. “It’s dominating the conversation every week,” said an executive at one of these companies. Representatives for these companies either declined to comment or failed to respond to requests for comment. Executives inside these companies would only speak on a condition of anonymity because negotiations with retailers are confidential. An Amazon spokesperson said in an email: “At Amazon we protect low prices for our customers, every single day — nothing has changed in terms of our focus or how we operate.” Walmart did not provide a comment. Amazon algorithm One piece of the battle, executives say, is an Amazon algorithm that works to match or beat prices from other websites and stores. Former Amazon employees say it finds the lowest price per unit or per ounce for a given product — even if it’s in a huge bulk-size pack at Costco — and applies it across the same type of good on Amazon, even when the pack size is much smaller. So let’s imagine Costco is selling a pack of 10 bags of Doritos for $10 — or $1 per bag. Amazon’s algorithm notes that one bag is $1 at Costco and, in turn, lowers the price on Amazon of a single bag of Doritos to $1. That is a great deal for customers — something that is likely driving the decision at Amazon, where an obsession with customer value dominates its strategy. But now, Amazon is selling individual items at Costco prices while not getting the same wholesale price that Costco enjoys. In short, it’s going to be really hard for Amazon to turn a profit on those goods. When Walmart sees this, it freaks out on the supplier, industry executives say. And it doesn’t matter to Walmart that Amazon may not be getting the same wholesale price that retailers like Costco or other membership clubs receive. In other words, even if Amazon isn’t profiting from its extremely low prices, Walmart is still demanding the same bulk-rate discount applied to individual items. “Walmart has had it explained to them by myself and others,” said one industry insider who asked for anonymity talking about private discussions. “My conclusion has been that they beat all suppliers up regardless because they need it to be a problem at the senior levels of these companies.” In some instances, Amazon is willing to lose money for some period of time on a product it feels it has to have. Jeff Bezos’s company knows, after all, that it has to continue to increase its selection in non-perishable grocery goods if it is going to really challenge Walmart in the $800 billion category. But, more so than in the past, Amazon is ratcheting up the pressure on manufacturers of goods that the online retailer is unable to sell for a profit, executives say. Separate from the algorithm, brands are also facing the realization that their products that are sold profitably in stores may become unprofitable online when shipping costs are factored in. Unprofitable items are known inside Amazon as CRaP products — the acronym stands for “Can’t Realize a Profit.” And Amazon is not afraid to kick off big and small brands alike. Case in point: On a Friday afternoon last month, all Pampers diapers sold by Amazon were unavailable on the site. Industry speculation was that Amazon may have kicked Pampers off the site as part of a negotiation over prices. Neither Amazon nor Pampers parent company Procter & Gamble would comment on whether this was the case. But the bigger point may be that senior industry executives thought such a move was even a legitimate possibility. “I’m very concerned,” one of them said. “Do all CPG goods get commoditized to 40 percent below where they’re used to being? The long-term implication is you just don’t know where the bottom is at.” Get the CRaP out When Amazon warns suppliers that a product is pre-CRaP, meaning it’s in jeopardy of being kicked off the site for profitability issues, it makes demands. Oftentimes, to lower wholesale prices. But that doesn’t always work, especially if a brand has the leverage of also selling into Walmart, which is still the biggest retail customer for many manufacturers. In these instances, Amazon may transfer the product to Amazon Pantry, a smaller catalogue of goods restricted to Prime Members. All Pantry orders come with a $5.99 shipping fee per box, which helps cover Amazon’s costs, if fewer than five items are ordered at one time. Another Amazon tactic is to prohibit some brands from buying ads within the site for a product that Amazon can’t make profitable on a standalone basis. Like paying for prominent placement in a store, a brand can buy ads within Amazon to promote their products. Blocking these ads is another way of burying a product. “They are playing Jekyll and Hyde,” said an executive at a large grocery goods manufacturer. “At times, it’s all about growth; at times, it’s all about profitability. They keep switching back and forth.” “They are playing Jekyll and Hyde.” Another factor: As Amazon Prime becomes a bigger part of Amazon’s business, Amazon ships more orders that consist of just one item. These orders can typically be tougher to make profitable than multi-item orders — a trend that could explain the renewed focus on profitability. “Amazon realizes Walmart is serious,” the executive said, “and is basically asking manufacturers to subsidize their unprofitable shipping costs for them.” No easy solution What is a brand to do? There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Some do give in and offer Amazon a better price if they can afford it. Some push Amazon to keep the unprofitable product, but give them a better deal on a more profitable item. Another strategy is to stop selling to Amazon as a wholesaler and instead sell directly, or through resellers, on Amazon’s marketplace. Amazon cannot control the price of an item sold by marketplace sellers, though it can make it harder to find items that aren’t priced aggressively. The longest-term solution, however, is perhaps the most difficult: Reimagining how a product should be designed and packaged from the ground up, specifically for e-commerce sales. That often means cutting the weight of low-price goods since shipping costs tend to eat into a product’s profitability. (Amazon, in fact, is trying to capitalize on this potential shift by asking brands to reformulate their packaging to make it easier to ship — all done via Amazon, of course.) Big brands, however, have been doing more talk than action when it comes to pursuing this solution — a fact that you can be sure Amazon has noticed. But Andrea Leigh, an ex-Amazon general manager who now runs her own brand consultancy, has come across a few examples of brands redesigning goods for e-commerce. One of them, from the brand Celsius, is an energy drink that has been transformed into powdered packets that the customer mixes with water at home. Then there’s the brand Green Works, which has sold household cleaners in concentrate form, along with an empty spray container. “If competitors go away and you can live it out, it presents you with an opportunity where you can steal share in a relatively easy way,” she said. “Figuring out how to do online better and not getting CRaP-ed out, that’s a huge opportunity.” The rise of direct to consumer? Perhaps the toughest part of being a traditional consumer packaged goods brand today is that you don’t know who your customer is because you sell to them via a middleman: Retailers like Amazon and Walmart. And if you try to sell direct through your own website — which requires a different set of skills — retailers often raise hell. Yes, the same retail partners that are putting the squeeze on wholesale prices. So some of these multinational companies are dabbling with diversifying their sales channels through acquisition. Unilever, the owner of brands like Dove and Hellmann's, last year purchased the subscription razor startup Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion. The vast majority of Dollar Shave Club’s sales come through its own website. Venture capitalists are betting that that deal will be the first of many acquisitions of digital-first brands that would traditionally sell their goods on supermarket shelves — though no major ones have yet followed. If they’re right long-term, however, this pricing pressure from Amazon and Walmart may be partly to blame — or thank.

Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. (Bloomberg News photo by Luke Sharrett) Print Email Bloomberg News By Bloomberg News The Times-Picayune on March 30, 2017 at 3:45 PM comments Many of America's biggest corporations including Apple and Wal-Mart Stores are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor's environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. "This work is embedded in our business," Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It's "good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that's a win, too." Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Trump signed an order Tuesday (March 28) that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama's climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. "Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real," Geoffrey Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. "They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump's government does." Business's biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump's order calling that shift "vital to stimulating economic growth." The group argues that Obama's regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group's members and other corporate titans supported Obama's Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. "We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," General Electric's CEO Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions." Mars, the maker of M&M's, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is "disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations." Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama's policies. "We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth," the companies said in a joint statement after Trump's order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. "We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture," Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump's rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. "People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats," Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. "Mr. Trump is doing the right things." Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn't enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. - Christopher Flavelle (c) 2017, Bloomberg Most Read Find Local Real Estate Jobs Autos Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Business Names in the News Does your company have a recent hire, promotion, appointment or honoree to announce?

It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jup in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker, also announced on March 29 that it would get 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. "We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," General Electric Co.’s CEO Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions." Mars Inc., the maker of M&M’s, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” ‘American Competitiveness’ Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

It appears the e-commerce giant also is stepping onto the turf of traditional retailers by trying to convince major brands to ship directly to consumers. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By Spencer Soper and Craig Giammona Amazon has invited some of the world's biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to persuade them that it's time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass chains like Walmart, Target and Costco. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfilment centre and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Walmart aisle. Instead, they'll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers' doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. "Times are changing," Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. "Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking." Manufacturers would have to reimagine everything from the way products are made to how they're packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It's unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfilment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market — an $800-billion category still dominated by Walmart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. "Most of these people haven't been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales," says Melissa Burdick, vice-president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. "But we've reached a tipping point. We're at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out." Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years, toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages' tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of "frustration-free" products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike chief operating officer Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon's Seattle gathering. The event's co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM's advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O' Lakes butter. Amazon's pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Walmart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with things like buy-online, pick up in store. Startups like Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Walmart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, says Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren't willing to sell on its marketplace. "Fear, more than anything else," Cassar says, "may compel these companies to pay attention."

The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

Lawmakers Reach Deal on Bathroom Bill Repeal » Thursday Mar302017 Toddler Found Alone, Asleep at Liberty Highway Walmart  Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 8:51AM A toddler wearing only a sweatshirt and a diaper has been reportedly found abandoned this morning at the Walmart on Liberty Highway in Anderson. Reports confirm the child was found alone and asleep in the arcade area of the store this morning. Anderson City Police are investigating the incident. If you have any information or were at the store and witnessed anything unsual this morning, call the police at 231-2272. Update:  The Anderson Police Department said a woman was arrested on Thursday and charged with child neglect. Officers said they were called to the Walmart on Liberty Highway just before 8:30 a.m. in regards to a sleeping child being left alone in a shopping cart for a long time in the store's game center. According to the incident report, the victim is 2 years old. Walmart employees said they tried calling for the child's parents over the store intercom, but no one could be found. Police said when they arrived, they called the Department of Social Services. A woman, later identified as 29-year-old Ashley Spivey, was reportedly spotted by officers "staring at us and seemed very interested in what we [were] doing." Spivey was identified as the child's mother. She reportedly told officers she left the child with her boyfriend and didn't know where he went. Police said they called the suspect's boyfriend, who had been at work. When he arrived at the store, officers said he was in a work uniform which confirmed he was not present during the incident. He told police his girlfriend took muscle relaxers which may be the reason for her strange behavior. After reviewing surveillance video, police said it showed Spivey enter the store with the baby in a shopping cart just before 7:30 a.m., dropping him off in the game center, and later leaving the store. She reportedly left on the opposite side of the store where the child was found. She later reentered the store but again walked out, police said of the video. Officers said when she spotted their patrol cars outside, she stared and then walked back inside to the point where they made contact with her. Police said over the course of an hour, Spivey only checked on the child once. The child was placed in protective custody and Spivey was placed under arrest for unlawful neglect of a child.

Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Wal-Mart Stores aisle. Instead, they'll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers' doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Times are changing," Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. "Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking." Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they're packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It's unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market-an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. "Most of these people haven't been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales," says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. "But we've reached a tipping point. We're at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out." Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores convinced brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. "There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth," says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a possibly welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages' tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of "frustration-free" products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike COO Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon's Seattle gathering. » Next page...

Print   Email   Font Resize Canon City News Fremont County officers recall "shots fired" moments in Devlin Palaza trial By Sarah Matott The Daily Record Posted:   03/29/2017 07:38:31 PM MDT Officers from two law enforcement agencies recalled the 2015 incidents when they were shot at Wednesday, as day three of a jury trial for Devlin Palaza continued. Palaza, 43, is accused of attempted murder against law enforcement after allegedly shooting at law enforcement on two occasions in December 2015 while attempting to flee in a vehicle. He has been charged with three counts attempted second-degree murder, two counts of weapons possession by a previous offender, two counts of being a habitual criminal, eluding, vehicular eluding, criminal mischief and an attempt to escape custody. On Wednesday, Sgt. David Baroz with the Fremont County Sheriff's Office and Detective Sgt. Patrick Slattery with the Florence Police Department each testified regarding their involvement with two vehicle pursuits. Baroz, who testified first, said the FCSO received a notification on Dec. 20, 2015 about a car in the area that law enforcement should be on the look-out for. He said that night, he came across a car matching the notification at the Wal-Mart parking lot in Cañon City at approximately 11:13 p.m. After Baroz arrived in his patrol vehicle, the car he spotted proceeded to leave Wal-Mart. After some pursuit, Baroz was joined by additional officers from FCSO and the Cañon City Police Department. A video recording from Wal-Mart's parking lot was shown to a panel of jurors, featuring a dark car parked in the parking lot and an FCSO patrol car. The video shows the FCSO car pull around to shine its lights at the suspected vehicle - at the same time the vehicle simultaneously left the parking lot. Advertisement CCPD attempted to make a traffic stop, Baroz said, but that ultimately was the start of a vehicle pursuit. Baroz described in detail the route FCSO officers took on U.S. 50, CO-9 and Fremont County Road 11 to pursue the vehicle. Baroz also used multiple maps provided by the district attorney's office to point to the jury panel where the pursuit took place. He told jurors the fleeing vehicle swerved into oncoming traffic and a semi truck that was parked on the side of the road. Speeds during the chase varied from 60 mph to 80 mph, he said. When the chase passed 8-mile, Baroz said shots were fired. "I would admit to my embarrassment, it was terrifying," Baroz said after being asked what it was like to be shot at. "Offices are supposed to be brave. We run head on into danger — it's our job," he said. He said he knew it was a gun because he saw a cylindrical object from the suspect's car and when it fired, the muzzle flashed and a "pop" noise was heard. Baroz said the pursuit of the suspect's vehicle ended in Teller County and was terminated because of the dangers it would have presented if it had continued. After Baroz finished his testimony, Slattery testified to the jury about a different pursuit that occurred on Dec. 21, 2015. In his testimony, he discussed a pursuit that occurred on CO-115 with a different vehicle. He said they found this car after receiving a warrant for Palaza's phone. This warrant sent Slattery GPS locations of Palaza's phone about every 15 minutes. While patrolling CO-115, he said, they received a GPS location of Palaza's phone that showed Palaza was possibly south of them on CO-115, heading toward Fremont County. Slattery, who was in an unmarked vehicle, found a car that was driving abnormally. He said the car was driving obviously slower in an area where people are often seen speeding and that the driver was in a "tunnel vision" mode. "He was wearing a hoodie, his hands were at a 10-and-2 position and he wasn't moving at all," Slattery said. After some time, Slattery described how he was joined with a Colorado State Patrolman and a Colorado Wildlife Officer and how he attempted to make a traffic stop in Penrose. At this point, two of the three vehicles that made the traffic stop with Slattery were marked, he said. Slattery exited his car and asked the driver to show him his hands as he approached the car. But, he said, "before I finished, the vehicle took off." As he described the second chase, Slattery also used maps to show jurors the route where the chase occurred. He then told jurors how the person in the fleeing vehicle shot three times: twice from the passenger side and once through the rear window. "The third shot, I saw the muzzle flash and the back window shatter," Slattery said, adding that the third shot caused debris to strike his own car. He said bullets never penetrated his car, but did leave dents. He also said officers later discovered a shotgun inside the fleeing vehicles. Slattery continued by describing how the vehicle came to be stopped on Q Street in Penrose and how he chased after the driver on foot to ultimately arrest him. After being asked by the DA, Slattery identified Palaza, who was sitting at the defense's table, as the person he arrested that night. Jurors also heard testimony from FPD Detective Jason Dorman, who was in the same car as Slattery when they pursued Palaza. Dorman said that he ducked down after the third shot was fired and when it appeared that bullets, most likely birdshot, were fired at their car. "I felt he was a harm to the public ... (I) felt like this person was going to do anything to get away," Dorman said. Palaza's trial will continue Thursday as testimony from additional law enforcement is expected to be heard. Additionally, a "site visit" is expected, to see the car Palaza was allegedly driving on Dec. 21, 2015.

At first, security noticed the suspect concealing items in their clothing. They first took some clothing, then a candle, then some bananas. Security continued to watch to see what else the suspect would do while waiting for police to arrive, and that's when things got weird. According to the report, "They continued to watch as the suspect began to open small jars of paint and consume them." The suspect then attempted to leave the store but was stopped before they could do so. They were found to be impaired — although it's unclear whether that was a cause or effect of the paint consumption — and had been banned from several other area Walmarts. Helpfully noted at the end of the report: "The merchandise was recovered, except for the consumed paint." Antiques A 43-year-old northeast Charlotte woman called police after someone broke into her car and stole some relics of the past. The woman reported that she woke up to find that someone had gotten into the vehicle, but the only items listed as stolen were CDs — $40 worth. It's unclear how the thief plans to play them, but they'll good mementos of a time gone by. Merry Christmas A 35-year-old man in south Charlotte finally filed a police report last week regarding an incident that apparently took place last Christmas. The man described a vandalism case to officers in which the suspect seemed to be very deliberate about vandalizing a home when nobody else was there. The victim told police that the suspect damaged a plastic Christmas tree, ripped pieces off of a chandelier, pulled the strings out of the ceiling fans, cut two cords leading to the television, scratched up a dresser and — in a grand finale — shattered a large fish tank, killing the five fish inside and damaging the ceiling, floor and television (further). Nothing to See Police responded to a vehicle break-in call in northwest Charlotte last week after a burglar used the most conspicuous means possible to get into someone's car. The 27-year-old victim said she was watching the suspect the whole time as he threw "a yellowish-red brick" (very descriptive) at the windshield of her Chevrolet Cobalt repeatedly until it shattered. He then reached through the windshield to unlock the driver's side door, opened it and rifled through the front seat. It was a dumb crime, but one that paid — at least for the time being. The thief found $340 in a man's wallet inside the car and got away with it before police could arrive. Keys to Success While handing over your car keys to anyone save for the most trusted loved one is usually a recipe for a stolen car in this here Blotter, some times it can lead to less dramatic but equally troubling issues. A 42-year-old woman told police that she handed her keys over to a friend before going to work the other day so he could work on her car while she was gone. When she returned home, her car was there but the friend wasn't. She eventually got a hold of him and he said he had to grab some more tools, but hours later, she was unable to get a hold of him and still unable to get into her apartment. Insurance Fraud Fails The CMPD Arson unit responded to an apartment fire on the banks of the Catawba River last week after it quickly became clear that there was foul play involved. Investigators eventually determined that a man had assembled a homemade explosive incendiary device and set it off in the garage connected to the apartment. In the end, he only did about $500 in damage, so whatever the end goal was, it didn't pan out. Also, he now has some serious charges on his record. So, all in all, he'll have to chalk that one up as a loss. Cash Be Inside, How Bout Dat Police responded to a BB&T in northwest Charlotte after some unknown suspect(s) put a whole lot of effort into robbing the unrobbable. Employees showed officers where the thieves pried open the metal door and broke the deadlock to an outdoor ATM overnight, only to learn that they still couldn't access any cash. They did $1,000 in damage, with nothing to show for all that effort. Wanna Party? Two 19-year-old women were a bit shaken after coming in contact — although not physical contact, thankfully — with a hitchhiker who may have had too much to drink that night, but was a predator any way you look at it. The girls told officers they were driving down Mallard Creek Road near the intersection of Prosperity Church Road at 1:30 a.m. when a man suddenly approached their car with no clothes on and tried to get in. Luckily, he wasn't able to do so and they drove to safety. Mooching a Moocher A woman in southwest Charlotte filed a fraud report after some stranger claimed a portion of the tax returns she was justly due for raising her son, without doing any of the work. The woman said that she had filed her 14-year-old son as a dependent on her tax returns, only to later be rejected and told that someone else had already claimed him as such. The woman said there is no other person who she can think of that would have the right to claim as much, so she filed a report for impersonation and fraud.

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 NEW DELHI: Global retail giant Walmart is looking to locate nearly half of its 50 stores in the country in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as it seeks to ramp up operations in the cash-and-carry segment, while also eyeing food retail if the government eases the norms. Sources told TOI that Walmart, which currently has 20 stores across the country, is planning as many stores in the two northern states, where BJP recently swept to power. In addition, the US retailer plans to open 10 stores each in Maharashtra (where it currently operates its 'Best Price outlets in Amravati and Aurangabad), Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Walmart is looking at two more stores in Lucknow in addition to Ghaziabad, Noida, Kanpur, Allahabad, Haridwar, Dehradun and Haldwani. With each store providing direct and indirect employment to 2,000-2,500 persons, the company may end up creating over 40,000 jobs in UP and Uttarakhand. The sources said that retailer, which parted ways with Bharti a few years ago and had put its store expansion on hold for a while, sees enormous opportunity in UP and Uttarakhand where there is little competition from others (such as Metro AG and Reliance) operating in the cashand-carry format. Cash-andcarry stores are wholesale outlets, which are only allo wed to sell to retailers, canteens and hotels. "Our commitment to the country is very deep and we are growing our footprints in India further by opening 50 more cash-and-carry stores in next few years across key focus states, including AP, Telangana, UP, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Maharashtra etc.Our development team is growing this store pipeline for last couple of years and we're confident of continuing our contribution to the creation of thousands of skilled jobs, helpings kiranas, farmers & SME suppliers succeed through our cash & carry business," a Walmart India spokesperson said in response to a questionnaire from TOI. The 50 new stores will be opened over the next three-to-four years. So far, the company has developed hubs, which are its focus areas. For instance, Punjab, Haryana, UP and Uttarakhand comprise the northern cluster, the second one includes Andhra and Telangana with the third one in Maharashtra. Walmart is, however, awaiting clarity on the food retail guidelines as it does not want to limit itself to domestically produced and manufactured food products. With the government looking at relaxing the rules, the Walmart spokesperson said: "As we've said earlier, allowing 100% FDI in food retail is a very progressive step, but having a certain percentage of non-food items in this policy will make it economically viable."

Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in an aisle at Walmart. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. “Times are changing,” Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. “Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.” Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they’re packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It’s unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market-an $800 billion category still dominated by Walmart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. “Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,” says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. “But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.” Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores convinced brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. “There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth,” says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a possibly welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages’ tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of “frustration-free” products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike COO Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon’s Seattle gathering. The event’s co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O’ Lakes butter.

Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon’s marketplace, said the online retailer would continue to narrow shipping times and talked up a future when one-hour delivery is the standard. Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, says Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren’t willing to sell on its marketplace. “Fear, more than anything else,” Cassar says, “may compel these companies to pay attention.” Bloomberg writer Matthew Boyle contributed to this story.

In the photo are (left to right) Alex Gorsky, CEO of Johnson & Johnson; Muhtar Kent, CEO of Coca Cola; Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup; and McMillon. (The photo is from McMillon’s Facebook page.) Over the past five years Wal-Mart Stores achieved its goal to buy $20 billion in goods and service from women-owned businesses in the U.S., according to the retailer. However, the retailer said it fell short of goal to double the amount of products sourced from businesses owned by women outside the U.S. The retail giant has found a gender gap on a global scale, particularly in countries like China which is the source for many products. Just 2% of Wal-Mart’s global purchases come from women-owned businesses which is whey the retailer says it continues to invest time and money to equal the playing field. Wednesday (March 29) at the Women’s Economic Empowerment Summit in Washington, D.C., the retail giant announced it is one of nine corporations in an effort to track and report sourcing from self-identified and certified women-owned businesses (WOBs) over the next five years. The report will be comprised by Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) and based on industry data. Wal-Mart said this is the first time a public report has been attempted. The retailer said it worked to get a eight of its largest suppliers involved to create a more visible movement and raise awareness for the importance of sourcing from women-owned businesses. The nine company collaboration includes Wal-Mart, Campbell Soup, Coca-Cola, ExxonMobil, General Mills, Johnson & Johnson, Mondelez, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble. The companies plan to report their progress each year to the WBENC who will validate the companies that are owned or operated by women, given that government agencies and the private sector run programs to promote women-owned businesses. The council will use the data to produce an annual report. “Creating economic opportunity and growth is central to who we are as a company,” said Doug McMillon, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Stores, who attended Wednesday’s Summit. “We are proud to be part of this important initiative, and together we can make an even bigger impact in elevating these successful women-owned businesses. Our customers care where products are sourced, and we believe supporting women-owned businesses helps us put innovative products on our shelves while helping these businesses thrive and grow.” McMillon posted on his social media site Thursday that his favorite quote from the Summit came from Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company who said, “Declare who you want to be, because you will need people to help you get there.” INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES The new initiative is needed because Wal-Mart has found it underestimated the challenges women entrepreneurs face in some countries, according to Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, who also attended the Summit. She said Wal-Mart has been able to double the amount spent to source goods from women-owned businesses in Mexico, but that’s not the case elsewhere. “In China, for example, it’s taken us years just to identify the women-led businesses because there was no private or government data to help with the research,” she said. “In Japan, women haven’t traditionally been encouraged to start businesses, so we had to begin with pitch contests there to inspire women to participate.” She said Wal-Mart understands the difficulties of creating a lasting change in some cultures which is why it’s intensifying the effort to support women business leaders by asking its large, male-led suppliers to report on the gender makeup of employees on their key, internal teams. She hopes other companies will join the effort of Wal-Mart and the eight other companies. BETTER MARGINS “Supporting women-owned businesses and diversity across our suppliers is central to who we are at PepsiCo,” said Indra Nooyi, chairman and CEO of PepsiCo. “Our commitment to diversity is not only a source of pride, it is a source of strength. And it’s part of our broader commitment to what we call Performance with Purpose, our approach to building a healthier, sustainable future for all our stakeholders – from our suppliers to our shareholders to our consumers, customers, employees, and the communities we serve.” McLaughlin said Wal-Mart has learned that promoting women-owned businesses is also a sound financial strategy. “We’ve found that products from women-led companies have better sell-through rates and better margins,” McLaughlin said. She believes women entrepreneurs do well in part because they tend to get involved in businesses while making use of their own personal experiences. She said Wal-Mart buys products and services from more than 1,500 women-led businesses around the world. The retailer has also given out $134 million in grants for training 1 million women in and outside of its global supply chain.

Walmart representatives presented the grant check to school and district officials during a special assembly at Caughman Road March 16. Richland One Superintendent Dr. Craig Witherspoon, members of the Richland One Board of School Commissioners, and members of Richland County Council joined Caughman Road students and staff for the big announcement. When the 2017-2018 school year begins in August, students at Caughman Road Elementary School will have a new outdoor learning center to enjoy, thanks to a grant from the Walmart Foundation. Walmart representatives presented a $35,000 grant check to school and district officials during a special celebration held March 16 at Caughman Road. The school’s Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) raised $10,000 for new playground equipment, and the Walmart grant provides the remainder of the funding needed to make the project a reality. “We believe that this joint alliance will assist us in providing an outdoor learning space which will benefit thousands of students in the years to come,” said Principal Shawn Hall. “When students have a safe space to release their stress and physical energy in a positive way, disciplinary problems decrease, and academic success increases.” The equipment selected for this area will provide a safe and accessible area for Caughman Road students and community children to play. The main focus of the outdoor learning center is action-based learning and the growth of the school’s cultural kinetics classroom. Local Walmart associates will remain hands-on partners by assisting with the development of the outdoor learning center and exploring volunteer opportunities at the school. “We’re proud to partner with Caughman Road Elementary and its PTO to help build this creative outdoor learning area for the children,” said Brooke Mueller, Walmart public affairs director. “We salute the community teamwork that’s making it possible and believe it will be a valuable addition to the education experience kids will enjoy here for years to come.” Return to top Tweets by @TheColumbiaStar To advertise with us call 803-771-0219 or email GailT@TheColumbiaStar.com.

A big contract win at UPS in 2018 will help draw sympathetic union supporters from Amazon to the Teamsters. (Alan Levine/ Flickr)   This article was first posted by Jacobin. The modern economy revolves around the sprawling logistics industry. Nothing demonstrates this more clearly than the current situation at Amazon and UPS. If Amazon makes good on its recent pledge, it will add another 100,000 workers to its U.S. workforce by 2018, making it one of the country’s largest—and one of the largest nonunion—employers. The U.S. labor movement faces several existential threats right now, but Amazon’s is a special kind. The company’s breakneck expansion has revolutionized the logistics industry. Its impact is most deeply felt at United Parcel Service (UPS), the country’s largest private-sector, unionized employer, with nearly 250,000 of its workers represented by the Teamsters. UPS already lashes the Teamsters with the threat of Amazon undercutting the union’s gains to justify the miserable wages paid to part-timers, impossible productivity demands, and the subcontracting of union work to non-union contractors. It will no doubt use the competition from Amazon to demand further concessions from the Teamsters during the next round of contract negotiations. Teamsters United (TU), the reform challengers in last year’s union election that nearly toppled the scandal-ridden and unpopular incumbent Teamster General President Teamsters James P. Hoffa, recently announced the launch of a new UPS contract campaign. Fred Zuckerman, TU’s candidate for general president, told supporters, we “are going to have to fight for ourselves.” Such a campaign has the potential to take on the package giant, but it can also serve as a beacon for future activists among Amazon’s rapidly expanding workforce. And if socialists in the United States can develop an industrial organizing strategy, we can play an important role in helping to organize some of the most powerful workers in this country. Seattle origins UPS was founded as a bicycle messenger service in 1907 by James E. Casey. Casey, known for his taciturn personality, did few interviews during his long tenure as the company head. Forbes magazine in 1970 dubbed UPS the “Quiet Giant” because of the stealthy way it snuck up on and overwhelmed its rivals. The company did little to no advertising. Forbes reported that UPS “officials believed only one parcel shipping company could exist in the United States, and it hoped that keeping a low profile would prevent anyone from copying its methods.” Keeping that low profile would quickly prove impossible. The company soon became known as “Big Brown” and developed into a global behemoth. Today, UPS employs 440,000 people worldwide—a workforce nearly as large as the United States’ standing army of 460,000. It has one of the largest commercial airlines fleets in the world and delivers 2.7 million packages and messages in the United States and 2.8 million to 220 other countries daily. UPS boasts, “We’re a company that every day moves 6 percent of US GDP and 2 percent of global GDP through our system.” UPS is densely unionized, unlike its almost entirely nonunion twin FedEx. Both are the darlings of the business media. Along with 250,000 members of the Teamsters—mostly drivers and hub workers—UPS pilots are represented the Independent Pilot Association (IPA), and some of its mechanics are members of the International Association of Machinists (IAM). UPS Freight, formerly Overnite transportation, has around about 13,000 Teamsters based in the traditional heavy-duty bulk freight industry who work under local union contracts. The package delivery wing that most people are familiar (with their ubiquitous brown delivery trucks) has over 230,000 members. A majority—somewhere around 55 percent, according to organizers’ independent estimates—of these UPS Teamsters are part-timers whose start pay is an abysmally low $10 to $11 per hour. For three decades, starting pay for part-timers was a miserable $8 to $8.50 per hour. Part-timer poverty, along with brutally high productivity, subsidized UPS’s massive expansion in the 1980s and 1990s. Yet, despite all the logistic services that UPS offers—and the declaration of Jack Levis, UPS’s senior director of process management, that, “We’ve really turned from a trucking company with technology to a technology company with trucks”—it is still primarily a package delivery company. UPS doesn’t manufacture any goods nor it is a retailer. Amazon’s inspiration lies elsewhere. Sam Walton’s heir Unlike UPS’s early attempts at flying under the radar, Amazon’s rise has been anything but quiet. Founded in Seattle in 1994, it has become one of the most visible brands in the world and an intimate part of their daily lives of tens of millions of people. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the fifth-richest person in the world, worth nearly $72 billion and treated by some with a similar cult-like reverence to the late Apple founder Steve Jobs. Unlike the taciturn Casey, who lived and died in a cloistered world of UPS, Bezos is a highly visible public figure. He recently purchased one of the most important newspapers in the country, the Washington Post. Billboard actually asked him if he had any plans to run for president. (He said no.) He even made a cameo appearance in Star Trek Beyond. His flair for public relations is well known. Amazon’s promotion of drone deliveries has captured the attention of the general public. The company also was granted a patent Jules Verne-like floating warehouses. Much of Bezos’s business model has been influenced by Sam Walton’s Walmart. In the last chapter of Walton’s autobiography Made in America, published around the time of his death in 1992, he mused on whether another company could match or surpass Walmart’s success: My answer is of course it could happen again. It’s all a matter of attitude and the capacity to constantly study and question the management of business. He added: If I were a young man or woman starting out today with the same talents and energies and aspirations that I had fifty years ago, what would I do? … Probably some of kind of specialty retail, something to do with computers, maybe. Walton’s musings strongly hint at the possibility of an Amazon-like company as his successor. But what did Bezos learn from Walmart? “Bezos had imbibed Walton’s book thoroughly and wove the Walmart founder’s credo about frugality and a ‘bias for action’ into the cultural fabric of Amazon,” according to business reporter Brad Stone in his book The Everything Store. Bezos was especially taken by Walton’s willingness to use “the best ideas of his competitors.” Bezos was so enamored by Walmart that he poached a large number of its executives in the late 1990s. Walmart sued in response, arguing that Amazon was stealing its “trade secrets”; Walmart ultimately lost the suit. One of the ideas Bezos borrowed from Walton was working his employees past the point of exhaustion. An early Amazon executive, for example, suggested to Bezos that because parking was so expensive near Amazon’s first headquarters and warehouse in Seattle, the company should subsidize bus passes for its workers. Bezos apparently “scoffed” at the suggestion. “He didn’t want employees to leave and catch the bus,” the executive said. “He wanted them to have their cars there so there was never any pressure to go home.” Amazon’s working conditions worsened through the two decades of the twenty-first century as it rapidly expanded its warehouses or distribution centers (“fulfillment centers” in Amazonese) across the country. The Allentown Morning Call conducted an investigation into Amazon’s working conditions in its Breinigsville, Pennsylvania, warehouses. After interviewing twenty current employees in 2011, the Morning Call reported: Workers said they were forced to endure brutal heat inside the sprawling warehouse and were pushed to work at a pace many could not sustain. Employees were frequently reprimanded regarding their productivity and threatened with termination, workers said. The consequences of not meeting work expectations were regularly on display, as employees lost their jobs and got escorted out of the warehouse. Such sights encouraged some workers to conceal pain and push through injury lest they get fired as well, workers said. In 2015, working conditions for Amazon’s staff at its Seattle campus were exposed by the New York Times to be just as horrendous: Workers are encouraged to tear apart one another’s ideas in meetings, toil long and late (emails arrive past midnight, followed by text messages asking why they were not answered), and held to standards that the company boasts are “unreasonably high.” The internal phone directory instructs colleagues on how to send secret feedback to one another’s bosses. Employees say it is frequently used to sabotage others. (The tool offers sample texts, including this: “I felt concerned about his inflexibility and openly complaining about minor tasks.”) The white-collar staff are told to be guided by the company’s leadership principles, “14 rules inscribed on handy laminated cards.” One of those rules: “Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts.” Amazon’s success is due to its massive online retail operation, honed to customer satisfaction on a mind-boggling array of products that few other traditional brick-and-mortar retailers—notably the venerable and declining Sears, which Walmart surpassed in sales in 1989—or other online retailers have been able to compete with. So the announcement in July 2015 that Amazon was valued more than Walmart shouldn’t have come as a total surprise. While Walmart is still the world’s biggest retailer in terms of revenue, Amazon’s evolution from a start-up in a modest office building to a retail juggernaut employing more than 97,000 employees [in 2015] has changed the shape of the retail industry. Walmart pioneered the creation of the modern logistics corporation with the management of entire supply chains, from the manufacturer of consumer goods to their placing on the store’s shelves. Amazon is attempting to do the same thing—without, until recently, the construction of retail stores—with one addition: controlling customer delivery through its own fleet of drivers. Operation Dragon Boat If Amazon is able to build its own delivery fleet, its impact on the logistics industry could have the greatest impact on the warehousing and delivery business since the deregulation of the U.S. freight and aviation industries in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Amazon has launched its own air transport network, an ocean freight forwarding company, direct delivery operations, and the myriad of small, barely “independent” subcontractors servicing the final customer delivery of packages. Not since UPS’s frantic efforts to build an air delivery operation to catch up with overnight pioneer FedEx or FedEx’s construction of a freight operation to match its Big Brown rival has a logistics company in so short a time built such a formidable operation. According to documents obtained by Bloomberg, “Amazon intend[ed] to create a revolutionary system that will automate the entire international supply chain.” Furthermore, A 2013 report to Amazon’s senior management team proposed an aggressive global expansion of the company’s Fulfillment By Amazon service, which provides storage, packing, and shipping for independent merchants selling products on the company’s website. The report envisioned a global delivery network that controls the flow of goods from factories in China and India to customer doorsteps in Atlanta, New York, and London. The project, called Dragon Boat, is proceeding, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Four years later, according to Business Insider, Amazon has 214 logistics facilities across the United States, including fulfillment-center warehouses; sortation centers, where packages get presorted for shipping; Amazon Pantry and Amazon Fresh, which deliver groceries; and Amazon Prime Now hub, a separate building to store one-hour delivery items. Twenty-eight more distribution centers are expected to be built this year. Amazon recently announced that it will invest $1.5 billion to build a massive air hub based in the Cincinnati/North Kentucky (CVG) International airport. “The project will bring up to 2,700 jobs and forty Boeing 767s to CVG, according to officials, with six hundred full-time jobs coming initially,” according to the Cincinnati Business Courier. The air hub is squarely within the region known as “Cargo Alley,” where planes can reach nearly 80 percent of the continental United States within two hours. “We believe Amazon may be the only company with the fulfillment/distribution density and scale to compete effectively with global UPS/FedEx/DHL,” declared a report by Baird Equity Research, a leading financial consulting firm. Walmart consciously built its distribution centers in remote, conservative regions of the country to avoid the threat of unionization. “Amazon, on the other hand,” Mark Meinster, the director of Warehouse Workers for Justice, told me, builds in or close to major cities. Their Kenosha facility (and nobody had built warehouses in Kenosha before Amazon) the workforce is more diverse. Amazon builds in bigger labor markets [like] Chicago, [where] they have fulfillment centers on Goose Island, 28th and Western, Lisle, Joliet, and Morton Grove [both inside the city and in several surrounding suburbs]. Amazon has reversed the model of warehousing pioneered by Walmart. This offers an opportunity to organize Amazon workers, since its drivers interact often with Teamsters drivers. Socialists and the workplace struggles ahead Ken Paff, national organizer of the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, says the lessons of past contract battles at UPS will be important for future organizing during the upcoming contract battle at UPS and for future organizing at Amazon. “When the Teamsters decisively defeated UPS during the 1997 strike, under the banner of “Part-Time America Won’t Work,” John Sweeney, the then-head of the AFL-CIO, said that ‘the successful 1997 UPS strike was worth a million house calls,’ ” Paff said, referring to the organizing tactic of visiting workers at home that is central to any organizing campaign. “He was right. Amazon workers—just like all workers—will want to join a union that knows how to win.” When the Teamsters won their battle against UPS in 1997, expectations were raised throughout the entire labor movement. Immediately following the strike, activists began talking about organizing FedEx (a campaign that has yet to be successful). A fighting union is the best advertisement for organizing new, nonunion workers. A big contract win at UPS in 2018 will help draw sympathetic union supporters from Amazon to the Teamsters. Kim Moody, one of the founders of Labor Notes, wrote last year: Eighty-five percent of the nearly three-and-a-half million workers employed in logistics in the United States are located in large metropolitan areas—inadvertently recreating huge concentrations of workers in many of those areas that were supposed to be “emptied” of industrial workers. There are about sixty such “clusters” in the United States, but it is the major sites in Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York-New Jersey, each of which employs at least 100,000 workers, and others such as UPS’s Louisville “Worldport” and FedEx’s Memphis cluster, that exemplify the trend. The organizing opportunities this presents—at both companies—should be clear to the Left. When I spoke to Mark Meinster last year about the many challenges facing organizers in the non-union logistics industry, he thought we needed a spark to ignite organizing efforts. “We need something big like the 1997 UPS strike or the 2006 immigrant’s rights marches.” Do we have that now with millions marching against Trump? The widespread interest in socialist ideas and the explosive growth of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) shows that there is a generation willing to fight for greater political change. If socialists are able to channel that willingness into an industrial strategy, a plan to head to the shop floor and organize one’s coworkers, we could shake the foundations of the twenty-first century American economy. This August is the twentieth anniversary of the 1997 UPS strike; a strike that defeated one of the most powerful corporations in the world. Now that much more of the U.S. economy revolves around the logistics industry, the 1997 contract campaign and strike looked like the strike of the future. Let’s seize the opportunity.

Franklin &#x2022; Associated Press Amazon.com employees go back to work after a short break at an Amazon.com fulfillment center in Phoenix. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Amazon.com Inc. has invited some of the world’s biggest brands to its Seattle headquarters in an audacious bid to persuade them that it’s time to start shipping products directly to online shoppers and bypass chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco. Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Amazon’s worldwide consumer chief, Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Wal-Mart aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. “Times are changing,” Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. “Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.” Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they’re packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It’s unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market — an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. “Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,” says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at the Mars Agency marketing firm. “But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.” Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores convinced brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. “There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth,” says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a possibly welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages’ tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of “frustration-free” products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike, which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike COO Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon’s Seattle gathering. The event’s co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O’Lakes. Amazon’s pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with things like buy-online, pick up in store. Startups like Instacart and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Wal-Mart and Amazon squared off last week in Las Vegas with keynote speeches at the ShopTalk conference that drew more than 5,000 attendees, including executives with major brands. Marc Lore, who heads Wal-Mart’s e-commerce initiatives, touted the price leverage of the world’s biggest retailer that buys products by the truckload. Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon’s marketplace, said the online retailer would continue to narrow shipping times and talked up a future when one-hour delivery is the standard. Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, says Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren’t willing to sell on its marketplace. “Fear, more than anything else,” Cassar says, “may compel these companies to pay attention.” View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Amazon.com apparently is going straight to major food and consumer packaged goods makers like Mondelez and General Mills to say they don’t need the likes of Walmart or Target anymore. The online retailer has invited those and other companies to a three day summit at its Seattle headquarters to make their case for selling directly to shoppers and bypassing the big box stores altogether, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing an invitation to the gathering the news agency obtained. Amazon did not respond to a request from Fortune for confirmation and comment. Bloomberg reported that the executives will get a tour of an Amazon fulfillment center and get a pitch from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, a top executive who reports directly to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The move represents a major new challenge to retailers like Walmart, Target and Costco Wholesale cost as they look to hang onto shoppers’ business at a time much of it is migrating online. Walmart, for one, has bet heavily that building up its grocery pickup infrastructure is a key way to combat Amazon, which this week announced its own food pick up effort. “Times are changing,” Amazon writes in the invitation obtained by Bloomberg. “Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking.” The invitation comes at a time chains like Target and Walmart are reportedly putting even more pressure on vendors to change package size and design and offer exclusive variations on their product as they struggle to standout. The challenge for Amazon is to break the stranglehold of big box retailers on foods and packaged goods. But as more and more customers shop online for staples, an area with still low e-commerce penetration, Amazon will likely become a more attractive partner.

Just two days after the online retailer said it is testing free grocery pickup that could eventually be rolled out to paying Prime members, Bloomberg reports it is working to convince major brands they'd be better off selling their goods directly to shoppers. That means bypassing brick-and-mortar chains like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco, according to Bloomberg. The news service obtained an invitation Amazon sent to packaged goods companies for a meeting in May to discuss the initiative, which would require them to package their products in new ways. General Mills and Mondelez are among the companies expected to attend, Bloomberg reported. In response to a request for comment from CNBC, Amazon said: "This conference is about encouraging our biggest suppliers to innovate with us across the supply chain to benefit customers. We will discuss topics like packing reduction, which has a broad range of benefits from faster delivery to customer delight to reduced waste." Spokespersons from Costco and Mondelez did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment. Target declined to comment. A spokeswoman from General Mills said the maker of Cheerios and Yoplait typically doesn't discuss relationships with its retail partners. "Clearly e-commerce is an emerging area, and we're working to grow our business in this space, but we're also continuing to work with our established retail partners," the spokeswoman said in an email. "We're always looking at ways to update our packaging, but don't have anything to share with you today." A spokesman from Wal-Mart said the company has a "huge food and consumables business online," and is "constantly talking with suppliers about creating efficiencies in shipping." Just looking at Wal-Mart's scale shows how detrimental it would be for a brand to ignore. In fiscal 2016, Wal-Mart and its affiliates accounted for 20 percent of General Mills' consolidated net sales and 30 percent of net sales at U.S. retail. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of its consolidated net sales, according to General Mills' annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In total, grocery accounts for more than 50 percent of Wal-Mart's annual U.S. sales. Additional challenges companies would face in cutting out retailers include the high cost of delivering small orders to individual households. This step in the fulfillment process, known as last-mile delivery, is the most expensive. The grocery business has been one of the most resistant categories in the shift to online spending. Not only do most shoppers prefer to pick their own produce, but fresh food is a notoriously low-margin business. It requires a sophisticated supply chain and quick sales to prevent items from spoiling. Yet while Cowen & Company estimates online sales will account for less than 6 percent of total grocery revenue this year, it expects that penetration to double in five years. Millennials between ages 25 and 34 are seen driving much of that growth, Cowen said. Amazon and Wal-Mart are expected to be two of the biggest beneficiaries of this transition. Wal-Mart's online grocery service, which lets shoppers order food online and schedule a pickup time, has been credited with much of the momentum in its consumables business. After rolling that initiative out to more than 600 locations last year, it will add 500 in 2017, a spokeswoman said. Amazon's foray into grocery has been slower to take hold. The retailer last year eliminated the $299 annual fee for its AmazonFresh service, opting instead for a monthly $14.99 charge. And on Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported the public rollout of Amazon Go, a Seattle test store that ditches the cash register, has been postponed. "The bigger story here is what going direct through Amazon and having these relationships in place would mean for [Amazon's] future," Forrester analyst Brendan Witcher told CNBC. "Anyone who is paying attention can see that Amazon is building a 'grocery-to-home' ecosystem not unlike what Apple did for the music industry." "All retailers should see this as a shot across the bow," since the model could easily be applied to any type of commodity product, Witcher said.

Enter the I4U News Nintendo Switch Giveaway now to get a chance to win a free Nintendo Switch. The new Nintendo Switch launched on March 3 and as expected, it sold out on launch day. Nintendo's comments that there would be enough Switch consoles in March to satisfy demand turned out to be untrue. Nintendo now plans to double the production of the Nintendo Switch. The company plans to make 16 million Switch consoles starting April 1 until March 2018. The original plan was to produce 8 million Switch consoles. The colorful Switch is slightly harder to find than the console with gray controllers. The premium resellers charge is with 50 to 65% still much lower than it is the case for the Nintendo NES Classic. Nintendo is expected to ship 2 million Switch consoles in March for the global market. The number is too low and finding Nintendo Switch in stock after the initial launch batch sells out is very difficult. The Switch gave Nintendo their biggest console launch ever. The first 2-days of sales beat the Wii and all other Nintendo consoles. The $59.99 NES Classic continues to be also in extreme short supply and Nintendo is unable to ship a significant resupply to resellers in weeks. Nintendo sold through 1.5 million NES Classic consoles and the demand is by far not satisfied. It might take Nintendo until Fall to make enough Switch consoles to satisfy demand. The Switch will be one of the most popular Holiday gifts for the Holiday shopping season 2017.  For video game fans who have not pre-ordered a Switch yet, there are still chances on launch day. There have been midnight launches for the Nintendo Switch at several retailers. The online availability of the Switch is expected to be very limited on launch day. The Nintendo Switch is a completely new video game concept. It's a mobile console first with removable small controllers. The mobile unit with display rest in a Nintendo Switch console connected to your TV. The mobile unit slides inside the Switch docking station, where it also gets charged. The small controllers that are detachable from the mobile unit also slide onto a home controller. A new Zelda game will be amongst the launch titles for the new Nintendo Switch, formerly known as Nintendo NX. The Nintendo Switch games sell for $59.99 like the games for the PS4 and Xbox One. The announced Nintendo Switch game line-up includes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Nintendo killed region locking on the Nintendo Switch. Any game sold in any region will be playable on the Nintendo Switch. The system will include the main console, Joy-Con (L) and Joy-Con (R) controllers, a Joy-Con grip (to which two Joy-Con are attached and used as one controller), a set of Joy-Con wrist straps, a Nintendo Switch dock (which holds the main console and connects it to a TV), an HDMI cable and an AC adapter. Two stylish versions of the system will be released: a version with a set of gray Joy-Con, and a version with one neon blue and one neon red Joy-Con. Both versions will be the same price.

Mount Storm Generating Station in Mount Storm, West Virginia, on Jan. 25, 2017. MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Luke Sharrett. Luke Sharrett, Bloomberg .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple and Wal-Mart Stores are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. Companies say their pledges, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come. “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025. Advertisement Continue reading Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. “Most big companies in the U.S. recognize that climate change is real,” Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. “They need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does.” Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. “We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted,” General Electric’s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. “We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions.” Mars, the maker of M&M’s, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Advertisement Continue reading Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future. — Bloomberg contributors: Ari Natter, Matthew Boyle, Christopher Martin, Lauren Coleman-Lochner, Craig Giammona, Lindsey Rupp, Molly Smith and Eric Roston contributed.

The former Walmart executive announced his immediate resignation last month as president of the chamber. And while calling the decision “personal,” Bernard suggested he favored a return to larger corporate opportunities. “I made a personal decision that I wanted to pursue a different opportunity,” Bernard said. “It was not anything the chamber did and is not anything the community did. I just woke up one morning and made a personal decision.” Coming to Johnston County had been something of a homecoming for Bernard and his family; he grew up in nearby Fayetteville and his wife is from Kenly. Bernard said he doesn’t expect to stay in the area and that he plans to make a return to management at a larger institution or Fortune 500 company. Bernard came to the Smithfield chamber from a career in compliance management with Walmart and the federal government. “Nothing changed except I just made a personal decision,” Bernard said. “Things were going absolutely fantastic.” Bernard had been visible at meetings in and around Smithfield and Selma in his time, introducing himself to local boards and organizations. His departure is in contrast to his predecessor Rick Childrey’s 30 years with the chamber. By both Bernard’s account and that of chamber board chairwoman Corina Knott, everyone was enthusiastic about the promise Bernard had shown in his first few weeks on the job. “It was rather sudden; things were going well, and we seemed to be off to a strong start with Frank,” Knott said. “He basically expressed the fact that he enjoyed working with the chamber but that it didn’t seem like it was going to be the right fit.” Knott said she was taken aback initially by the resignation. But the chamber has accepted its new reality and is restarting its search for a leader. An interim director will be named soon, Knott said. “There’s no back story, no bad blood, it was just all rather sudden,” Knott said. “That’s the most dramatic part about it. We didn’t really get a reason, but things like this happen.” In filling the role, Knott doesn’t expect to reach out to the runners-up for the job. The chamber will reactivate the search committee and work with a recruiter. “We are very disappointed Frank didn’t work out,” Knott said. “We would have loved for his ideas and experience to have made their way into our chamber. He was our first choice, and even in the short amount of time here, he put forward some really great ideas. We’ll use this as a learning experience.” It seems to be an important time for Johnston County’s largest towns, and Smithfield and Clayton seem to be mirroring one another. Just last fall Clayton changed its chamber leadership, hiring Dana Wooten to replace Jim Godfrey. Also, each town has hired a new town manager in the last 12 months, and while Smithfield has a new police chief, Clayton is deep into its search for one. Clayton and western Johnston County area driving the area’s growth, but Knott sees opportunity in Smithfield and Selma to build on that growth. She thinks the chamber job is an exciting one. “This area has so much going on, so much infrastructure; we’re at the head of so many highways and byways,” Knott said. “With so much growth in the Clayton area, we’re excited for our neighbors, but we want that growth to come to the Smithfield-Selma area. This is an opportunity for true leadership, to make some of those great things happen in our area. What an exciting time to be part of the chamber.” The loss of Bernard seems to sting, but the chamber is confident the president’s job is an attractive one, and Knott said the search will be very thoughtful. “While this is not the outcome we would have hoped, we’re excited and anxious to get somebody in that role, someone that is excited about the opportunity that’s out there and excited about the things that are about to happen to the area,” Knott said.

(MU) Stock Without Risk Recent Posts: How to Trade BlackBerry Ltd (BBRY) Stock Around Q4 Earnings Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT) Stock: Get Paid to Feed the Bears Short Micron Technology, Inc. (MU) Stock Without Risk View All Posts Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) is a giant of retail, but the past 12 months have seen Walmart stock move sideways. The fundamental story hasn’t changed much — Walmart’s management is still sticking with its low-price leader strategy. It’s made an effort to ameliorate the public perception of fair pay to its employees, but it remains a dinosaur in a sector marred by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Before AMZN, WMT was the king of low margins. This perhaps minimized the Amazon effect on it. Otherwise, AMZN demolished the rest of the sector. Click to Enlarge Technically, the weekly chart points out two areas where Walmart stock didn’t belong. Those were upside and downside overshoots. Somewhere in the middle lies the truth. Focusing on that, I see a clear channel slightly descending, but not alarmingly so. Most traders risk money based on price targets. I find it easier to identify areas where price is not likely to go and sell risk there. In WMT’s case, and as long as equity markets don’t collapse, I can generate income from selling downside risk below proven support in Walmart stock. The Bet: Sell the WMT Oct $60 put naked for 80 cents. This trade has a 90% theoretical chance of success. If WMT stock falls below the strike price, you will have the stock put to you (meaning that the buyer of the put will have the option to sell it to you at the strike price). Anything below $59.20 per share would accrue losses. Usually, I like to sell upside risk to balance my trade, but in this case, I feel comfortable that I would be able to manage my risk against the short-term price gyrations. Selling naked puts is risky and is not suitable for all trades. I can change my trade to make it more palatable to more investors. The Alternate: Sell WMT Oct $60/$55 credit put spread. This is also a bullish trade that has a 90% chance of delivering 8% yield on risk. Learn options as easy as 1-2-3 here. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

Bartholomew County Sheriff’s Sergeant Dean Johnson was on SR 46 in front of Walmart around 9 p.m. when he heard units being dispatched to the parking lot in reference to a possible overdose. Johnson searched the parking lot for the victim and saw a running vehicle with its lights on. When he looked inside, he saw a young female unconscious in the front seat. The 17-year-old girl had a pulse, but she was not breathing well, so Johnson administered two doses of Narcan. EMS arrived at the scene and transported the girl to the hospital. Sheriff Matthew Myers is urging parents to monitor their children’s activity and talk to them about drugs and the consequences. “We must create a strong foundation of communication with our children. Talk with them about drugs and alcohol and let them know the consequences for bad choices. Know where they go, who they are with and when they will be home. Monitor cellphones and Internet activity. The signs are there – a change in their behavior, personality or physical appearance and a change in friends,” Myers said. 39.206801 -85.889555 Filed in: Crime, News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Reddit Email Google Pinterest Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Tech Apple Science Cars Baselworld 2017 Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES     NES Classic Edition Stock Updates Posted: Mar 30 2017, 9:53am CDT | by Luigi Lugmayr, in News | Technology News   NES Classic Shopping Guide   Here are the latest Nintendo NES Classic restocking updates. Best Buy sold the NES Classic online yesterday. As expected it was a disaster to get one. Today the NES Classic is only going to be available for the most part through Amazon Prime Now. Amazon continued on Wednesday with NES Classic offers in San Francisco, San Diego, New York and other metropolitan areas. Don't Miss: Today's Electronics Bargains at Woot.com Updates: 10:48am ET: NES Classic also available for shoppers in Brooklyn, San Antonio and Indianapolis on Amazon Prime Now. 10:45am ET: NES Classic in stock for Baltimore on Amazon Prime Now. We tested to add a NES to the cart and it worked. See below. The retail giant makes small batches of the NES console available on its local delivery service since a couple weeks now. This is an obvious marketing campaign for Amazon Prime Now. Check the NES Classic listing for your Zip code on Amazon Prime Now. Las Vegas was the latest city to that was offered the NES Classic. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint. Shoppers can get notified about the NES Classic availability on Amazon Prime Now with iStockNow. Reseller prices start at $130, plus $3.99 shipping on amazon.com from legit appearing reseller. The first offers in the list on amazon.com are obviously a scam. Nobody is selling a new NES Classic for $10.75. Please avoid the fake low priced reseller deals on the Nintendo Switch. These offers are a scam that lock up your cash. Read our report on the Nintendo Switch and NES Classic Amazon scam for details. Our NES Classic Giveaway has ended. We have notified the winner of the brand-new NES Classic EU version. The Nintendo Switch Giveaway is still available. Enter now to win a new Nintendo Switch Several resellers offer still the original Nintendo NES Controller for $39.99 on Amazon.com. This is though four times the regular price. There are plenty of 3rd party NES controller that sell for around $10. The NES Classic supply has not improved significantly after months on the market. Target and Walmart stores have been the source of NES hunters a couple weeks ago, but both stores have not gotten significant new inventory in a long time. The last time the NES was on sale on amazon.com for the regular retail price of $59.99 was on Feb. 23. NES Classic on Amazon Prime Now The only option that has worked in past days is Amazon Prime Now. The local delivery service of Amazon has offered the NES in select cities. The supply is extremely constraint and very sporadic. It is suspicious that only Amazon has the NES in stock and only sells them through Amazon Prime Now. It looks like Amazon set aside some NES inventory to use it to promote its local delivery service. Amazon only allows one NES Classic order per person. There is strict limit on how many NES an account can order for a set period of time, at least 24 hours. Ordering a NES via Amazon Prime Now is though great, but its a hassle to spot one in stock and ready for order. It arrives in 2 hours for free in the cities where Amazon Prime Now is available. NES hunters have to refresh the search for the NES Classic for their ZIP code on a regular basis to spot the NES in stock. There is also no pattern where the NES Classic will be available next on Amazon Prime Now. Target and Walmart stores have not shown significant inventory in the past days. Consumers scored NES classic consoles through Amazon Prime Now and Amazon Spain. NES Classic Edition Stock Updates NES Classic at Amazon.com The NES Classic reseller prices keep stable. Reseller prices on March 20 start to $130, plus $3.99 shipping on amazon.com. There are several offers under $135 mark. Prices have been $40 higher at the beginning of the week. The first offers in the list are obviously risky, as the start at $9.99. This low priced offers are from just launched accounts. Amazon Prime Now has shown the NES Classic available in select cities for very short period of times throughout Wednesday. Most recent cities included Las Vegas and Nashville. Check the NES Classic listing for your Zip code on Amazon Prime Now. NES hunters also are keeping an eye on Amazon.es as NES supply in the United States has dried up. Cost of ordering a European version of the NES on Amazon Spain is reasonable. NES Classic at Target The NES Classic at Target stores availability is still very low with 1% according to BrickSeek. The chances to find a NES at a Target store are low.  NES Classic at Walmart The NES Classic at Walmart stores stock indicator drops to 1% according to BrickSeek. The chances to find a NES at a Walmart store are low. iStockNow reports several Walmart stores with NES inventory. NES Classic at GameStop The NES Classic was last in stock at GameStop online on March 17. GameStop only offered the NES Classic as part of bundles priced at $79.99. Inventory lasted about 30 minutes. The $79.99 NES Classic Edition bundle included the Miniboss Wireless controller. NES Classic at Best Buy The Nintendo NES Classic was on sale online at bestbuy.com on Wednesday, March 29. NES Classic at ToysRUs Stores No new updates. NES not in stock at ToysRUs stores and online shop. TRU is only selling NES accessories online. See also our latest Nintendo Switch Stock Updates. To check the NES stock situation at a nearby Walmart use this page on brickseek and for NES stock at Target stores use this page. Zoolert is now also offering a service to check inventory of retail locations. Zoolert supports besides Target and Walmart also ToysRUs, GameStop and Best Buy. The ability to mod the NES Classic and install an unlimited number of games has renewed the hype around the retro console. The latest version of hakchi2 allows NES owners to install over 800 NES games. A new hack even allows NES owners to run SNES games via an emulator.  It is easier to find NES Classic controllers Amazon now, although they are not from Nintendo. Here is a list of popular NES accessories on sale on Amazon. NES Classic Edition Accessories Original Nintendo NES Controller Nyko MiniBoss Controller for NES Classic Edition My Arcade GamePad Classic - Wireless Controller for the NES Classic Edition Ortz 10 Feet NES Classic Edition Mini Controller [TURBO EDITION] Cacly NES Classic Controller, approx 6 Feet Long Cord 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Controller USB Cable for NES Classic (Eliminates the Need for AC Adapter) Classic USB NES Controller for PC / Mac Pernos 2Pack 10ft 3M Extension Cable for Nintendo NES Classic Mini Edition Controller Ortz 10ft Controller for NES Classic Mini [TURBO EDITION] Buttons 8Bitdo NES30 Classic Edition Wireless Controller Set with Bluetooth Retro Receiver 10ft Extend Link Extension Cable For Nintendo Mini NES Classic Edition RDS Industries NES Classic Edition Carrying Case Nintendo Classic Mini: Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Controller Nintendo is under criticism for bad demand forecasting since years. Part of it is intentional as shortage generates buzz. The downside are the countless hours of people spent in line and the caused frustration. There is no update from Nintendo when the Japanese video game maker will resolve the shortage. The $59.99 Nintendo NES Classic Edition console launched on November 11 in stores and online. The supply was extremely constraint in stores and especially online. The palm-sized NES console, retailing for $59.99 list price, features the classic Nintendo NES controller many geeks have grown up with. The retro console comes pre-installed with 30 classic NES games including Super Mario Bros., Pac-Man, Metroid, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda and Kirby's Adventures. The NES Classic Edition system is a miniaturized version of the groundbreaking NES, originally released in 1985.

(View our Privacy Policy) Port Richey Walmart now closed during overnight hours, and police chief couldn't be happier By Robert Napper, Times Correspondent ROBERT NAPPERTampa Bay Times Thursday, March 30, 2017 8:00am Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Chief Gerard DeCanio says the high volume of calls from the store drains police resources. PORT RICHEY — It is not often that the head of a police department feels the need to comment on a retailer's decision to reduce its hours of operation. Related News/Archive Port Richey's new police chief is a familiar face about town 5 Months Ago Suspect shot during Port Richey home invasion 7 Months Ago Clearwater police searching for suspect in overnight shooting 5 Months Ago But when Walmart decided this month to close its Port Richey store for six hours each early morning, it brought a sigh of relief from Port Richey police Chief Gerard DeCanio, and he was not bashful about expressing his opinion. "I was happy to hear it, and so were our guys" DeCanio said. The reduced hours, he said, will finally give his officers a break from the high volume of calls for service that come from the retail giant's store. The Walmart store, at 8701 U.S. 19, which previously operated 24 hours a day, has begun closing from midnight to 6 a.m. DeCanio said details have been few from local store managers as to why hours were cut, but there have been discussions over shoplifting problems at the store during meetings with staffers there. "They are saying they are taking some pretty big hits. I don't know if it's any more than any other of their stores," he said. One thing is for sure, DeCanio said. The store is a major drain on police resources, regularly tying up hours of officers' time. Ironically, on March 11, the day the Walmart began closing, Port Richey officers responded to 11 calls at the store — from trespassing to grand theft to dealing with a fight, the chief said. Law enforcement issues at local Walmarts was chronicled in a Tampa Bay Times analysis published last May. The Times found nearly 16,800 calls in one year to Walmarts in Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco and Hernando counties, or about two calls an hour, every hour, every day. SPECIAL REPORT: Police are called to Walmart more than anywhere else — and you foot the bill "There's a myriad of things we are called for there," DeCanio said of the Port Richey store. "It just eats up our resources. Any law enforcement agency that has a Walmart is just getting killed." It is not a new complaint from Port Richey police. DeCanio's predecessor, Rob Lovering, delivered a scathing report to the City Council in 2015 showing that the local Walmart was the source of nearly half of the city's crime statistics submitted to the state. DeCanio said he plans to continue to meet with Walmart managers to come up with ways to ease the burden on his department, but solutions are difficult. One request made by the chief — for Walmart to put uniformed security officers in the store — has been rebuffed, he said. A Walmart spokeswoman in Arkansas, Leslee Wright, did not address questions as to whether crime was the reason for the change at the Port Richey location. In an email, she said: "We are constantly reviewing our business to determine operations decisions at our stores. Based on a recent review of our customers' shopping patterns we have made the decision to adjust hours at this store. This is the kind of decision we make on a store-by-store basis and will allow us the ability to reallocate resources to serve our customers during peak shopping hours." DeCanio isn't sure closing overnight will help, but at least it's something. "At least it will give us a six-hour block," he said, "where we don't have to go up there." Port Richey Walmart now closed during overnight hours, and police chief couldn't be happier 03/30/17 [Last modified: Thursday, March 30, 2017 12:11pm] Photo reprints | Article reprints © 2017 Tampa Bay Times      Abuse Policy Commenting Guidelines Join the discussion: Click to view comments, add yours Loading...

India allows 100 per cent investment by foreign wholesalers, but if they want to access the burgeoning retail market, they can only have a 100 per cent holding to sell food items. This forces them to overhaul their businesses instead of replicating models that have worked abroad, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, minister for food processing industries, said in an interview at her official residence in New Delhi. “Wal-Mart, Tesco, etc have said that they should be allowed non-food items and that’s a decision the government has to take now,” she said. “The government’s decision will come before the World Food India event being organised for November.” The government is looking at allowing global companies with a permit to sell local food items to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25 per cent of total sales, an official with the knowledge of the matter had said earlier this month. One of the reasons for current restrictions is that small traders have traditionally formed the backbone of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, though that could change following his landslide victory in state elections this month. The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make in India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion (Dh1,190 billion) foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has allowed more foreign direct investment and the government on Wednesday took another step toward meeting its July 1 deadline to create a common market under a single national sales tax. Nearly 45 per cent of the average Indian household’s consumption is on food, according to World Bank data. Food accounts for about 70 per cent of India’s $600 billion retail market, and the government is looking at tripling this over the next five years, Badal said. Global companies “are willing to adapt to Indian ways to tap the Indian market,” she said. If allowed to sell non-food items too, they will foster competition and so “companies which will have the edge are the few who will adapt to what we are allowing and come and capture the market.” More from Retail Marka steps into beauty segment Sharjah to host watch and jewellery show XTouch aims 50% growth in UAE sales H&M launches new upmarket brand as profits slow Tier-two e-commerce players to face squeeze Brands need to differentiate wearables India may ease rules for foreign food retail The Mideast eCommerce revolution has just begun tags from this storyNarendra Modi follow this tag on MGNBharatiya Janata Party follow this tag on MGNIndia follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsRetail tagsNarendra Modi follow this tag on MGN+ MGNBharatiya Janata Party follow this tag on MGN+ MGNIndia follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In RetailJadoPado to build Dubai's next largest mall Business Gallery Manufacturing is order of the day Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Big discount on these brands in Dubai 02Amazon reaches deal to acquire Souq.com 03Souq.com wooed from all sides for mega deal Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 11Images Pink diamond worth millions shown in London Mar 21, 2017 6Images Manufacturing is order of the day Mar 28, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 8Images Dubai’s next big mall gets into project mode Mar 16, 2017 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Big discount on these brands in Dubai 3 women jailed for prostitution in spa More rain with cloud-seeding? 2017 UAE holidays New UAE fuel prices for April 2017 UAE visa on arrival for Indians with US visa When will rainy conditions end in UAE?

Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Jeff Bezos Photographer: Patrick Fallon/Bloomberg Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. "Times are changing," Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. "Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking." Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they're packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It's unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment.  Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market—an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. “Most of these people haven’t been interested in e-commerce because e-commerce has been such a small piece of their overall sales,” says Melissa Burdick, vice president of e-commerce at The Mars Agency marketing firm. “But we’ve reached a tipping point. We’re at a time when companies are ready to start figuring this stuff out.” Amazon is looking to influence product makers the same way Costco and other club stores convinced brands more than 20 years ago to create bulk sizes sold at a discount. "There was a big perceived penalty for missing the boat, fear of missing out on growth," says Jim Hertel, senior vice president at the marketing firm Inmar Inc. Just like Costco, he says, Amazon will encourage the changes by promising increased sales, a possibly welcome pitch for companies struggling to rekindle sales growth amid rapidly changing consumer tastes and shopping habits. Amazon has already forced some manufacturers to revolutionize their packaging. For years toy and electronics makers have packaged their wares to help prevent theft and to maximize store display. But the packages' tough plastic was hard to open, turning off millions of consumers. Amazon pushed manufacturers to develop packages that pop open more easily. Today thousands of "frustration-free" products are sold on its site. Some brands will be easier to persuade than others. One could be Nike Inc., which has an Amazon store and has been experimenting with selling directly to consumers. Nike COO Eric Sprunk is scheduled to speak at Amazon's Seattle gathering. The event's co-host is SCM World, a research and conference group that serves the supply-chain industry. SCM’s advisory board includes executives from Unilever, Kimberly-Clark and Land O’ Lakes butter. Amazon’s pitch comes as brick-and-mortar competitors try to blunt its momentum by enhancing their own online shopping options. Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers are experimenting with things like buy-online, pickup in store. Startups like Instacart Inc. and Deliv make deliveries from stores to homes, helping retailers keep up with Amazon. Looking to match the quick delivery benefits of Amazon Prime membership, Wal-Mart offers a free two-day delivery on orders of $35 or more. Wal-Mart and Amazon squared off last week in Las Vegas with keynote speeches at the ShopTalk conference that drew more than 5,000 attendees, including executives with major brands. Marc Lore, who heads Wal-Mart’s e-commerce initiatives, touted the price leverage of the world’s biggest retailer that buys products by the truckload. Peter Faricy, who runs Amazon’s marketplace, said the online retailer would continue to narrow shipping times and talked up a future when one-hour delivery is the standard.

Sign Up Despite the long relationships between brands and traditional stores, Amazon has leverage to convince manufacturers to rethink their operations, says Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence. He notes that Amazon has 300 million shoppers and can make its own products if brands aren’t willing to sell on its marketplace. "Fear, more than anything else,” Cassar says, “may compel these companies to pay attention." —With Matthew Boyle Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By: Bloomberg | Published: March 30, 2017 4:29 PM The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make in India campaign to boost local manufacturing.(PTI) Following calls from global retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Tesco Plc, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to decide by November whether India is prepared to ease strict rules on food retailers, a minister said on Tuesday. India allows 100 percent investment by foreign wholesalers, but if they want to access the burgeoning retail market, they can only have a 100 percent holding to sell food items. This forces them to overhaul their businesses instead of replicating models that have worked abroad, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, minister for food processing industries, said in an interview at her official residence in New Delhi. “Wal-Mart, Tesco, etc. have said that they should be allowed non-food items and that’s a decision the government has to take now,” she said. “The government’s decision will come before the World Food India event being organized for November.” You may also like to watch: The government is looking at allowing global companies with a permit to sell local food items to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25 percent of total sales, an official with the knowledge of the matter had said earlier this month. One of the reasons for current restrictions is that small traders have traditionally formed the backbone of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, though that could change following his landslide victory in state elections this month. The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make in India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has allowed more foreign direct investment and the government on Wednesday took another step toward meeting its July 1 deadline to create a common market under a single national sales tax. Nearly 45 percent of the average Indian household’s consumption is on food, according to World Bank data. Food accounts for about 70 percent of India’s $600 billion retail market, and the government is looking at tripling this over the next five years, Badal said. Global companies “are willing to adapt to Indian ways to tap the Indian market,” she said. If allowed to sell non-food items too, they will foster competition and so “companies which will have the edge are the few who will adapt to what we are allowing and come and capture the Please Wait while comments are loading...

Companies say their promises, coordinated by the Obama administration, reflect their push to cut energy costs, head off activist pressure and address a risk to their bottom line in the decades to come.  “This work is embedded in our business,” Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said in an email. It’s “good for the business, our shareholders and customers; if ultimately we are able to positively impact the environment in the process, that’s a win too.” Wal-Mart was one of 81 companies that promised to reduce emissions in the run up to the 2015 Paris global climate negotiations. The company upped its targets last November, saying it would get half its power from renewable sources by 2025.  QuickTake What Trump’s Climate Views Might Mean Trump signed an order Tuesday that tells the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider former President Barack Obama’s climate rules, and rescinds a series of orders Obama issued to embed consideration of climate change in government actions from where to lease buildings to whether to allow oil pipelines to be built. Read More: Trump Sweeps Away Climate Rules Vowing ‘New Energy Revolution’ Companies need to move ahead on the climate change front no matter what Trump’s government does, Geoffrey M. Heal, a professor at Columbia Business School, said in a telephone interview. "They don’t have the luxury of denying," Gina McCarthy, head of the EPA under Obama, said on Bloomberg Television. "They have to invest wisely." Keep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Business’s biggest lobbying force supports Trump on this issue. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce welcomed Trump’s order calling that shift “vital to stimulating economic growth.” The group argues that Obama’s regulations held back economic growth, preventing business owners from constructing needed pipelines, roads and other infrastructure. It also warned that the climate push would lead to a jump in energy prices. But many of the group’s members and other corporate titans supported Obama’s Clean Power Plan, or have set their own goals. Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker, also announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges, according to the Sierra Club. "We believe climate change is real and the science is well accepted," General Electric Co.’s Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt, wrote in an internal blog post shared by the company. "We hope that the United States continues to play a constructive role in furthering solutions to these challenges, and at GE, we will continue to lead with our technology and actions." Mars Inc., the maker of M&M’s, committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040. Andy Pharoah, vice president of corporate affairs, said that Mars is “disappointed the administration has decided to roll back climate regulations.” ‘American competitiveness’ Technology companies including Apple, Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp. also expressed their support for Obama’s policies. “We believe that strong clean energy and climate policies, like the Clean Power Plan, can make renewable energy supplies more robust and address the serious threat of climate change while also supporting American competitiveness, innovation, and job growth,” the companies said in a joint statement after Trump’s order was signed. Other companies, while stopping short of criticizing the Trump administration, said they would keep pursuing lower emissions in their own operations. Procter & Gamble, Nestle Inc., Ikea, Levi Strauss & Co. and Best Buy Co., which all signed the 2015 pledge organized by the Obama administration, said they still intended to honor their commitments. Trump Says Executive Order Ushers 'New Era' in Energy “We will continue to integrate sustainability into our business practices, operations, innovation, brand building and culture,” Damon Jones, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble said. Read More: Trump’s Order Won’t Resurrect Jobs of Miners Key to His Campaign Many energy businesses welcomed Trump’s rollback. The Independent Petroleum Association of America, which represents oil and natural gas producers, joined the Chamber of Commerce in praising his move. So did the National Federation of Independent Business, which challenged the Clean Power Plan in court. “People are going to freeze in the dark because of the destruction of the reliable electric power grid under Obama and the Democrats,” Robert Murray, the president and CEO of coal-mining company Murray Energy Corp. said in an interview. “Mr. Trump is doing the right things.” Some environmental groups cautioned that action from the private sector, wasn’t enough to make up for the pullback in federal policy. “Policy is going to be required to get us where we need to be,” said Karen Palmer, research director at Resources for the Future.

As the online advertising race between Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG)  and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) intensifies, the internet giant has no choice but to address the issue quickly. To wrap up the show, the team also answers a listener question for Canadian investors before discussing the state of March Madness. A full transcript follows the video. 10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks  for investors to buy right now… and Wal-Mart wasn’t one of them! That’s right — they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. Click here  to learn about these picks! *Stock Advisor returns as of March 6, 2017 The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. This video was recorded on March 27, 2017. Chris Hill: It’s Monday, March 27th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I’m Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Million Dollar Portfolio , Jason Moser; and from Stock Advisor Canada , Taylor Muckerman. Happy Monday! Jason Moser: Hey, now! Taylor Muckerman: We’re doing it! Hill: We are doing it. Welcome back! You’ve been busy. Muckerman: Yeah, a couple weeks. You were at South by Southwest. We’ve been overlapping each other. Hill: There we go. It’s good to have you back in the studio. Muckerman: It’s good to be back. Hill: We’re going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We have to start with a story that’s been brewing for a little while. I’ll be honest. This is a story, I saw a headline on this a week or two ago, and it registered like, huh, that’s interesting, and it continues to balloon. This is the fact that a week ago, Google formally apologized for running customer’s ads alongside objectionable videos. We’ve talked before about YouTube and how important it is in the world of search, and how it’s one of the most popular places to search. And you see these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company, it’d be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we are a week later, and I guess, among other things, Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really big place with lots of videos, and therefore it’s hard even for the owners to monitor it. The Wall Street Journal had this big story about how Coca-Cola ,  Microsoft , Amazon , Procter & Gamble , these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, „I don’t want my ads next to that.” Moser: Yeah. We’re going to hit a point here, sooner or later, it’s going to be like you do with your kids, they can say sorry only so many times before you’re like, „I get that you’re sorry. Just don’t do it again. I’m not looking for sorry anymore.” So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is obviously something that’s a big deal. It’s not something that immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the bread and butter for Google’s money-making machine, it’s search advertising. But, there’s a good percentage, close to 20% of that money, comes through advertising with third-party customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of course, those parties are going to express concern, they want to know what’s going on, why is this happening, and what are you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle ground here. It’s just, flat-out, „This is unacceptable, don’t let it happen anymore.” This is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as we go more toward automating everything, particularly on the consumer-facing side, I think it’s really difficult to ever fall back on the old, „Well, the algorithm did it, it wasn’t our fault.” Because, ultimately, someone built the algorithm. I think what Google needs to figure out here is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it’s through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing on more people to add a human touch to these customer relationships, they need to do something with this before this gets out of hand. We’ve talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own shares of Alphabet, and we own shares of Facebook: We own a far larger position in Facebook, and part of the reason for that is, when you look at the direction things are headed in social, and in internet behavior, there’s no question that Facebook is becoming a place, not just Facebook, but its properties, whether it’s WhatsApp or Instagram or whatever properties they buy in the future, that’s a place where eyeballs go to hang out for a while. Google is more utilitarian in nature, right? You need some information, you find it on Google, and you go to your next place. Facebook is catching up very quickly. They’ve expressed some concerns that perhaps the last decade was the Google decade, and perhaps this next decade is the Facebook decade. If that is the case, and the numbers certainly point toward that, the argument could at least be made there, Google has got to figure out something yesterday as to how to address this and fix it, because blaming it on the technology is not going to fly. Muckerman: I’m pretty confident that they’re going to figure out a way to fix it. Especially when you’re talking about Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election with fake news on their site. And you had a group of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was able to identify fake news on the site, and they’ve been able — not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been able to address that. I’m confident that Google will. You talk about big headlines about this, but I’m waiting for the headline to come out that says, right now, people think that less than 1% of Google’s revenue is at risk because of this. It’s a $90 billion revenue company, I’ve seen headlines that say $750 million might come off of YouTube’s revenue in 2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube’s revenue, but you’re not just an investor in YouTube when you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I’m still confident that they’ll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook and Google, they’re pretty much the only two that are growing in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that advertisers are going to completely move away from Google. Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there was a mass exodus from Google. I’m fairly confident that, because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search advertising, they’re going to figure this out. Hill: It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at the headline of Pepsi , Starbucks , General Motors , Wal-Mart  have pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those are big-name companies. I think, if you’re Facebook, you’re not throwing a parade over this, but I think if you’re selling video advertising for Facebook, you’re on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think television networks. If you’re a broadcast network or cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you’re putting the human touch to work, and you’re calling these companies and saying, „Listen, don’t take a risk with the programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You know what you’re going to get with our networks, and you’re going to get something that associates well with your brand.” Muckerman: With some of those companies you mentioned, those are companies that can afford to pull back for a week or two on advertising and make a statement. That’s almost advertising in itself. They’re still advertising using Google’s name, just not using Google’s platform. So, I think they’ll come back eventually. Probably not too far down the line. Those brands are brands already. You’re probably looking at the smaller players, questioning whether or not they can afford to back off of Google’s platform a little bit more than Coke or Pepsi. Moser: Yeah, and I think it’s also worth noting, for the longest time, YouTube has been synonymous with online video. That’s what got this ball rolling. And they’ve enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so long. What an acquisition Google made for … what did they buy it for? Hill: $1.6 billion. Muckerman: Pennies on the current dollar. Hill: And the reason I remember it was $1.6 billion is because I was one of the people saying, „Boy, they sure did pay a lot of money for that.” Moser: So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube are not the only players in the online video space. And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook and Twitter  to Verizon  and AT&T  developing their online video offerings. To your point, I think it’s very easy to see these customers pulling back for a week, a month, and saying, „Hey, let’s reasses what’s going on here.” Google and YouTube are too big to say, „We don’t want to be a part of your environment.” That’s just foregoing a tremendous reach that anybody in their right mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I don’t see any reason why they can’t fix it. I guess it’s going to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly they go about fixing it, because they don’t enjoy that same competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years ago. Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com . From Matt Saunders in Nestleton, Ontario. „I was hoping you could explain the effects of currency exchange on stock purchases. I’m in Canada and our dollar is quite low compared to the U.S. dollar. However, it wasn’t too many years ago, we peaked a little higher than the U.S. dollar. My concern is that if I buy a U.S. company at this point and the dollar rises again, will that work against the value of the U.S. company that I purchased? Or does buying on the TSX compensate for that somehow? Thanks for all your help with this. P.S. please tell Steve Broido, we just made a trip to Orlando and had a great visit to an Olive Garden there. Definitely a fan.” Steve will appreciate that, I’m sure. Muckerman: Yeah. Thanks for listening all the way from Ontario. This was a question that we receive quite often in Stock Advisor Canada , Pro Canada , and now Dividend Investor Canada . We put a special report about this a couple years back. Over those couple years, not much has changed. Remain to see the Canadian dollar still trading below the U.S. dollar. I think right now, it’s around $0.75 to the U.S. dollar. As you did mention earlier in the 2000s, the Canadian dollar did peak around $1.20 to the U.S. dollar. That ramp-up really did cramp Canadian investors’ returns when you look at it, from investing in the U.S. dollar. When the Canadian dollar does appreciate, you lose a little bit there when you sell back into the Canadian market. So, what we generally tell our members to do is, A) we absolutely recommend investing in the U.S. market, because when you look at the Canadian market, about two-thirds of it relies on the energy, financials, and the materials sector, two very volatile sectors, in the energy and materials sector and then financials, really, the bulk of that is driven by the big banks, TD , Scotia , CIBC , BMO , and RBC . They’re very highly concentrated if you don’t move outside of the Canadian market. When you look at the largest sector in the U.S., IT, I think that’s around almost 22% of the S&P, it’s 2.7% of the S&P TSX. So, you’re missing out on a lot of potential growth there. And less than 1% of the S&P TSX is healthcare. If you think about that, you’re missing out on some huge potential growth there. It was a little higher, but Valeant  obviously reduced the share of that overall market when that fell precipitously over the last couple years. But, the long-term average of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar is right around $0.85. There’s about 13% upside from where it is right now until it reaches the long-term average, I think we have information going back to 1971 on our site. That’s over 30 to 40 years of data with the long-term average of $0.85 to the U.S. dollar. So, you’re not far away from that. Compared to that $1.20 you saw in the early 2000s, we view that as a one-off event, especially with oil where it is these days, and the likelihood that remains subdued as compared to when it was over $100, which, coincidentally, timed very well with when it was peaking with the U.S. dollar there. So, we advocate people considering the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, but we don’t say, „Just invest Canadian only.” Put some dollars into a separate account, leave them there for the long-term so you don’t have to pay the cost to exchange back and forth, because banks do charge for that. And you don’t get charged if the company pays you a U.S. dollar dividend and you leave it in U.S. dollars. You don’t get charged every time they deposit the dividend to your account. You only get charged if you put it back into CAD. So, if you’re a long-term investor, we just say, create two accounts, one with Canadian dollars and one with U.S. dollars, and let it ride, because if you don’t, you’re going to miss out on tons of opportunity. TSX and TSX Venture stocks make up about 20% of the — Hill: Toronto Stock Exchange. Muckerman: Yep. They make up about 20% of the total stocks available to you in U.S. markets. So, not only are you missing out on diversification, but you’re missing out on opportunity, in terms of breadth of choices. So, don’t let the currency fluctuations scare you away from it. That’s our opinion. Hill: You’ve been to the Toronto Stock Exchange, haven’t you? Muckerman: Yeah, it’s pretty cool. We went there a few years ago, poked around when we were first launching Stock Advisor Canada in 2013. Been up there a couple times since, but to not the same fanfare that we went up there a few years back. Hill: Definitely a lot of fun. Fitting that I’m sitting with too proud sons of the Carolinas because, for any sports fans out there, the final four is set. We have Gonzaga, we have the University of North Carolina, we have Oregon, and we have, surprisingly, the University of South Carolina. And the potential for an all-Carolina final. Moser: Amazing. If you think about it this way, you had Clemson just win the National Championship in college football. There is still the potential, certainly, for the Gamecocks to go in there and win this thing in basketball. Which, I mean, there’s no way that’s ever been achieved before. Muckerman: They have to win this, because the likelihood of a potential rematch with North Carolina in the final, highly unlikely. Although, this could boost recruiting. Moser: About half of my graduating class in high school went to USC. The other half — Hill: The other USC. Most people hear USC and they think University of Southern California. Moser: The East Coast, South Carolina. The other half went the Clemson. And I was the one lone straggler that went the opposite direction and went to a 15-person liberal arts college. Go, Wofford Terriers. Hill: Wait, isn’t Wofford in North Carolina? Moser: Wofford is in South Carolina. You have Davidson that’s in North Carolina. Muckerman: Steph Curry. Moser: But, wow, the finish to that game yesterday was … Muckerman: The Carolina game? Yeah, my gosh. Moser: Yeah, it was unbelievable. I have to believe that right now, the Carolinas are figuring out a way to, perhaps, join together, erase that border. Hill: There was a story I read this morning — and, obviously, there’s so many millions of dollars involved in the NCAA basketball tournament. But one of the stories I read this morning was about the business impact in North and South Carolina. And, not surprisingly, bars and restaurants doing huge business over the weekend, and presumably will do it again next weekend. Moser: That’d be like one of those things in an earnings report where, that’s one of those one-time events. So, when you’re saying, „Well, we don’t expect this next March, but we had a very robust beginning of 2017, thanks to … „ Hill: You’re saying Jason’s Barbecue and Sports Bar, in South Carolina, when it’s reporting earnings in the spring of 2018, it’s like, „Look, tough comp. Last year, we had the final four. We had Clemson in the football championship.” Muckerman: Seriously. Clemson. USC has to catch up. Maybe think about extending Tobacco Road a little for their South. Hill: I don’t know how big the concentration of Buffalo Wild Wings is in the Carolinas but I do remember — Muckerman: There’s quite a few. Hill: — two years ago, when Tom Brady was first suspended by the NFL, and he was going to miss four games, and this was going into the fall of 2015, I do remember that on a conference call, there was an analyst who asked CEO Sally Smith, this analysts had the numbers and basically said, „Here’s how many Buffalo Wild Wings locations are in New England. Tom Brady is going to miss,” and he ended up appealing and not missing, but he missed the first four of this most recent season, but — and I give credit to this analyst, he did his homework. It’s just like, „Look, you have a bunch of Buffalo Wild Wings locations in New England. The star quarterback of the home team is going to miss the first four games. Are you factoring that?” Legit question. Moser: I guess my question here is, Oregon is with Under Armour , too. Hill: Wait a minute, Oregon? No, that’s a Nike — Moser: Is Oregon Nike? OK. I was just thinking, I saw something, I was looking at this headline, Oregon Signs Record-Breaking Apparel Deal With Under Armour , and — Hill: Are you sure it’s not Oregon State? Moser: No, it says Oregon. Hill: Because University of Oregon is Phil Knight’s alma mater. Muckerman: Their football field is Nike sole turf. Moser: I’m aware! Let’s go in and confirm this, but this is back from 2014, but Oregon signs record-breaking apparel deal with Under Armour. The deal was announced just hours after Phil Knight announced he would no longer allow Nike to be associated with Oregon, citing his frustration with a lack of national championships. Muckerman: This isn’t The Onion ? Moser: No, this is SB Nation. [laughs] I guess Phil Knight got sick of a bunch of losers! And he decided to bag it. If that’s the case, how interesting that you would then have two representatives of Under Armour and two of Nike. Muckerman: So, Gonzaga and Carolina obviously — Moser: Carolina is Nike, and I think Gonzaga is too. Oregon is the one I was questioning, because South Carolina is definitely Under Armour, and I think Oregon is, too. Muckerman: Michael Jordan hasn’t eschewed Carolina just yet, I guess. Moser: That’s pretty cool. Hill: Yes. And the University of Oregon women’s team is in the regional final that’s being played tonight. They’re playing UConn. Muckerman: I’m so sorry for them. Moser: Right, I was going to say, why don’t they just hand them the trophy? It’s Connecticut, can they really … Hill: You know what? That’s what amazing Cinderella stories are made out of. Moser: At some point, everybody thought Kentucky was going to win, but Wisconsin, was it Wisconsin? Hill: Yeah, back in the day, a couple years ago. Look, if Goliath was undefeated, where’s the fun in that? We need David to knock off Goliath every once in awhile. So who knows? The lady Ducks might get it done against UConn. Muckerman: Lady Ducks and the Gamecocks. Hill: That’s your lead story, by the way, if the UConn women don’t end up winning the national championship. All right, Jason Moser, Taylor Muckerman thanks for being here, guys. Muckerman: Cheers!

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 By Shruti Srivastava Following calls from global retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Tesco Plc, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to decide by November whether India is prepared to ease strict rules on food retailers, a minister said on Tuesday. India allows 100 percent investment by foreign wholesalers, but if they want to access the burgeoning retail market, they can only have a 100 percent holding to sell food items. This forces them to overhaul their businesses instead of replicating models that have worked abroad, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, minister for food processing industries, said in an interview at her official residence in New Delhi. "Wal-Mart, Tesco, etc. have said that they should be allowed non-food items and that’s a decision the government has to take now," she said. "The government’s decision will come before the World Food India event being organized for November." The government is looking at allowing global companies with a permit to sell local food items to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25 percent of total sales, an official with the knowledge of the matter had said earlier this month. One of the reasons for current restrictions is that small traders have traditionally formed the backbone of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, though that could change following his landslide victory in state elections this month. The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make in India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has allowed more foreign direct investment and the government on Wednesday took another step toward meeting its July 1 deadline to create a common market under a single national sales tax. Nearly 45 percent of the average Indian household’s consumption is on food, according to World Bank data. Food accounts for about 70 percent of India’s $600 billion retail market, and the government is looking at tripling this over the next five years, Badal said. Global companies "are willing to adapt to Indian ways to tap the Indian market," she said. If allowed to sell non-food items too, they will foster competition and so "companies which will have the edge are the few who will adapt to what we are allowing and come and capture the market."

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Opinion India’s harvesting losses at near Rs 93,000 crore: Why more cold chains, Amazon in food retail augurs well India’s harvesting losses at near Rs 93,000 crore: Why more cold chains, Amazon in food retail augurs well Once large retailers such as Walmart and Tesco set up shop, they would start buying directly from farmers. By: FE Bureau | Published: March 30, 2017 5:36 AM If, however, a WalMart was to come in and assure a certain level of business, cold-chain units would be more ready to come and invest. (Reuters) With harvest- and post-harvest losses, in 2012-13, estimated at nearly R93,000 crore—or 8-10% of production according to a study just done by CIPHET—it is not surprising that, for several decades now, allowing FDI in retail has been touted as the single-biggest solution to agriculture’s problem. Once large retailers such as Walmart and Tesco set up shop, they would start buying directly from farmers. Once they did this, not only would farmers get a higher share of the final price of the fruits and vegetables as compared to the fraction they get today, the high level of losses due to a virtually non-existent cold chain would also fall considerably since the time from farm to fork would reduce sharply; as a corollary, high inflation in the sector would also dampen. While the government has, historically, offered incentives for setting up cold chains, the progress has been slow since, without an assured front-end offtake for fruits and vegetables, few cold-chain suppliers have wanted to invest. If, however, a WalMart was to come in and assure a certain level of business, cold-chain units would be more ready to come and invest. Sadly, opposition from retailers in India ensured the FDI proposal went nowhere and while home-grown organised players did expand their retail footprint, the pace was limited and the proportion in fruits and vegetables was relatively low. While the BJP has traditionally been opposed to FDI in multi-brand retail, the government changed the nature of the debate by saying it was going to push for FDI in food retail since this would directly benefit farmers. Initially, the proposal didn’t look like it was going anywhere, especially since there was no provision for allowing such stores to stock non-food items—even now, while food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has been pushing for a high share of non-food items in food-retail outlets, there has been no final resolution on it. Also Watch: Despite that, however, with top firms like Amazon planning to invest $500 million over the next few years, it would appear a promising start has been made in terms of organised food retailing. Though it may not be directly related, it is also interesting to note the government has just awarded grants to companies to build 101 cold chains with a total capacity of 2.8 lakh tonnes. With local e-tailers—mostly funded by foreign money though—now looking at increasing their footprint in the fruits and vegetables space, and foreign giants like Amazon firming up their plans to set up brick-and-mortar stores, a significant step has been taken as far as Indian farmers are concerned.

THI is a capacity-building organization, meaning that they work with other organizations to increase collaboration and use existing resources efficiently, director of THI Dr. Kathy Krey said. THI works at the local, state and federal level to combat hunger through community engagement, developing policy and research, Krey said. It started out with an emphasis on combating child hunger, Krey said, but has extended its work to address hunger affecting families and senior citizens. “That’s what makes THI really unique, being housed at a university, is that we can connect all of Baylor’s great resources to the larger social issue of hunger,” Krey said. THI is part of Baylor’s “informed engagement” initiative, working with faculty and students to conduct research, Krey said. In 2015, the USDA reported that Texas was one of 12 states with a food insecurity rate higher than the national average. Krey said that this is not due to a lack of resources, rather that the existing resources are underutilized, not well coordinated or not well-known. THI helps fight those problems, Krey said. THI’s work is innovative, sustainable and research based, Krey said, which is one of the reasons that it received the grant from the Walmart Foundation. The grant will allow THI to continue outreach for child nutrition programs like school breakfast and afterschool meal programs and will help THI build coalitions in communities throughout Texas. These coalitions consist of bringing organizations and people together to maximize the efficiency of these programs. “When you can be more efficient and get more coordination, then that can go a long way as a really effective model for addressing hunger at the local level,” Krey said. Craig Nash, THI’s child hunger outreach specialist for Waco, works with organizations and school districts to aid school meal programs. His main goal is to expand access to these programs. Nash said that THI is unique because they act as a middleman to connect organizations. “I want as many kids as possible to be eating lunch through the summer food service program, through school breakfast program and after school meals,” Nash said. Krey said that being based at Baylor allows THI to work with passionate students and faculty across many disciplines to develop innovative solutions to hunger. Krey also said that there can be a disconnect between organizations trying to combat the issues of poverty and hunger and universities that have expertise on the issues. “It can be hard to bridge that gap between those two, and we stand in that place which, I think, is an important and needed role,” Krey said. In addition, Krey said that they have seen the impact of their work through a decrease in the food insecurity rate in Texas. Since THI was started, 300,000 more students are eating breakfast at school each day, 10 million more meals are being served at after school programs and there are 2,000 more summer meal sites in Texas, she said. “We play such a unique role in the anti-hunger landscape that’s really exciting, and it’s really needed because we help bolster and increase the efficacy of those organizations on the ground that really are trying to meet the need right in front of them,” Krey said.

A wild turkey has been seen the past few days trotting around the walmart parking lot off of Winchester Road. “Well first thing that comes through is, well, Thanksgiving came early," Walmart customer Roger Lawrence said. "Second thing that you think of is safety, we don’t want that to come into play with drivers coming through. Third thing is the surprise element of it. What is a turkey doing here, this isn’t it’s natural habitat, and then you have to laugh about it.” An employee told WHNT News 19 that the turkey has been the talk of the store for several days, and that almost every customer that walks in points it out to everyone else. There’s no saying what’s keeping her around, but she’s certainly drawing attention. Little does this turkey know that hunting season starts April 1st, and she may want to scout out a better hiding spot! 34.820173 -86.492530 Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Heavy showers, gusty winds possible through late this evening Schools announce early dismissals because of threat of severe weather RECAP: Strong to severe storms moved through the Tennessee Valley Monday Latest News Huntsville crews work to remove graffiti at Fern Bell park Spring football underway at Alabama A&M Big Spring Park opening delayed by wet weather Police search for Decatur man in connection to shooting incident News At least 38 killed, several others wounded after Saturday’s twin bombings in Istanbul News Do you hunt spring turkeys?

Oklahoma’s OK Foods, Inc. recalled approximately 933,272 pounds of breaded chicken products that could be contaminated with extraneous materials, specifically metal, according to an announcement from the U.S. Department of Agricultural Foods Safety and Inspection Service. The breaded chicken products were produced on various dates from Dec. 19, 2016 through March 7, 2017, and feature establishment number “P-7092” inside the USDA mark of inspection. There have been no reports of any health issues as of yet, but the FSIS is encouraging people not to eat the products if they happen to have them. OK Foods Inc. received five consumer complaints regarding metal objects in the chicken products last week, and FSIS inspection personnel confirmed the presence of potentially dangerous objects during verification activities. An internal investigation by the firm found the affected products and found that the objects in the food complaints came from metal conveyor belting. The FSIS listed 7.5 lb. cases containing five 24 oz. packages of Great Value Fully Cooked Chicken Fillets Breaded Chicken Breast with Rib Meat bearing case code 201258 and “Best by/Use by” date of 3/2/2018 as part of the recall. A comprehensive list of all affected brands and products can be found at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls. Consumers are advised to return any contaminated product to the place of purchase, or to throw them away. Questions about the recall can be directed to Abby Brown at (479) 312-2409.

(Harry Scull Jr./Buffalo News) By Samantha Christmann Published Thu, Mar 30, 2017 SHARE TWEET EMAIL Shawn Bell was having a glue crisis. His 10-year-old daughter, Genevieve, had requested Elmer's glue for a project she wanted to do during a sleepover. He drove around for nearly three hours, trying Target, Walmart and two Wegmans stores before going home empty-handed. "I couldn't believe it," Bell said. "Why in the world would there be no glue in these stores?" He soon found out. White glue is an ingredient used to make homemade slime – stretchy, gooey ooze that has exploded in popularity with kids of all ages. It's so hot in fact, that demand has created a shortage of glue, causing stores to sell out, leaving parents in the lurch and prompting Elmer's to increase production. The craze began with online videos of bloggers and YouTubers playing with their own homemade creations. Search "slime" on YouTube and you'll find hundreds of videos. They feature slime lovers stretching their homemade slime, swirling it, poking it with their fingers, kneading it together to make crackle and popping sounds. Watchers describe the videos as "relaxing," "satisfying" and "comforting." [Gallery: How to make Genevieve's Puffy Slime] Retailers have been scrambling to meet consumers' voracious glue appetite. "We have seen the demand in all of our stores," said Michele Mehaffy, a spokeswoman for Wegmans. Ella Whitney, 11, and Genevieve Bell, 10, form slime. (Harry Scull Jr./Buffalo News) The grocer has finally managed to keep its supply stable, Mehaffy said. It has added other brands besides Elmer's and has begun placing much bigger orders to keep the shelves stocked. The Office Depot store on Main Street in Clarence is making hay of the run on glue. The store has added signage pointing customers to where it can be found on shelves, and employees have done interactive slime-making demonstrations in the store to play up the trend. Customers at the store regularly buy glue in eight-packs or by the gallon. "I would say we run out every week," said Sydney Dunn, a store employee. But the store is getting a handle on out-of-stocks and also helps people order from their online store, she said. The increased glue sales have been a bright spot for the struggling office supply retailer, which has been battered by competitors such as Walmart and Amazon. But the craze has been a downright windfall for Elmer's, the Atlanta-based company that makes the most popular brand of white glue. "Elmer’s has indeed seen a surge in sales thanks to the slime craze," said Virginia Mayo, a spokeswoman for the company. The company saw an increase in liquid glue sales in the second half of 2016, with a big spike throughout December. Elmer's retail liquid glue sales more than doubled during the holiday season. The company is planning to increase production of Elmer's White School Glue, as well as Glue-All, Glitter Glue and Clear Glue, which are also used to make slime. The company is leveraging the trend by featuring slime-making videos on its homepage and designing new fun, safe recipes to share. Along with glue, water and borax are the main ingredients in homemade slime. But after reports of burns caused by borax, experts are warning families to keep it out of the mix. The household cleaner, which can cause eye, nose or respiratory irritation, has a label warning parents to keep borax out of the reach of children. There's also the danger of younger children ingesting slime with borax. Kid's paint is used to color homemade slime. (Harry Scull Jr./ Buffalo News) Alternate recipes using cornstarch or other substitutions have also started appearing online. But some kids insist borax is a necessary ingredient to get the results they want. In that case, experts urge them not to touch their eyes while playing with slime and to wash their hands afterwards. So what is it about slime that has the kids so obsessed? Genevieve Bell, 10, said making slime is like doing a science experiment. She doesn't measure her ingredients and experiments with different additives to make her slime shinier, more stretchy or less sticky. She adds glitter, paint, Orbeez, even packing  beads, since, she said, the best slime is crunchy and makes popping noises when you play with it. She names each slime, keeps them in special containers, and shows them off on her slime-only Instagram account. But the best part, she said, is that slime helps her relax. "If you're stressed out, it calms you down," Genevieve said. "It's soothing." Click here to see the comments. Add yours now!

Next to her are plaques for local businesses that have donated to the project. By Callie Jones News editor The Sterling VFW Auxiliary had reason to celebrate Wednesday, March 22, as they marked their anniversary and showed off the VFW facility’s newly renovated restrooms. A dinner kicked off the evening. While it was supposed to be the men making the meal to honor the auxiliary anniversary, in true fashion the auxiliary pitched in as well, to make sure a great meal was served. Following dinner, Lori Davison, auxiliary president, spoke to the group about her goal to remodel both the men’s and women’s restrooms at the VFW facility. She thanked sponsors who donated items for the remodel, including: Ace Hardware, BVB Contractors in Brighton, Home Depot, Logan County Lumber, Mead Lumber, RL Designs and Wal-Mart. Davison also acknowledged volunteers who helped with the remodel. “We’ve been varnishing the doors, we moved them, we painted the walls in the bathroom, we painted the tile, cleaned up the work on the men’s meeting room to do the base boards in there,” she said. The work is not finished though. Now that they have more paint they plan to paint in the women’s meeting room, paint the stage and they will be repairing the supply room ceiling. Guests at the Sterling VFW Auxiliary’s anniversary celebration were invited to check out the post’s newly remodeled women’s and men’s restrooms. They now have a fresh coat of paint and new fixtures. Davison said the VFW Auxiliary has put in for some grants from Home Depot and Wal-Mart. “Our work isn’t done, but we think we’ve done good with what we’ve done already,” she told the audience, adding that the goal with the grants is to redo the flower bed. Davison was also excited to share they have received $1,000 from the VFW Foundation to help with the project. The anniversary celebration also included recognition of several auxiliary and VFW members. Edna Nichols was recognized as the longest auxiliary member at 65 years. Katie Stroup and Norma Timmerman were also honored as 59-year auxiliary members. John Lester received an award for his many years as the VFW’s bingo manager and Dale Hurst was given award for helping out with bingo and all that he has done with the building and VFW activities in the past. Freda Moore was recognized for her help with bingo, as well as VFW dinners. Lori Davison was honored for her excellent work for both the VFW and the auxiliary, as well as the upgrades to the post home. Dan Torres was given an award for faithfully promoting the Voice of Democracy and Patriot’s Pen programs for local youth for several years, and Lonnie Brungardt was recognized for promoting school and youth participation and aiding the VFW with design, decorating and outside work. Frank Garcia was honored for “jumping in from day one,” helping setup for bingo and dinners and re-varnishing the doors and frames. Warren Davison was recognized for his never-ending work making the VFW hall and grounds a better place for all. Paul Jones received an award for plumbing and tile work to improve the VFW. Bertha Jones was recognized as the All-Around Top Promoter of VFW Auxiliary Programs at the auxiliary’s annivesary celebration Wednesday, March 22, 2017. Maxine DeMers was recognized for her dedication to the Poppy Poster Contest, collecting funding for the local veterans and educating the public about the VFW and the auxiliary. Ardis Garcia was named the Top Auxiliary Member of the Year for 2016-17. It was noted that her transfer from Nebraska to Sterling is one of the best things to happen for the Sterling auxiliary, as she “jumped in and made a big splash.” Lastly, Bertha Jones was named All-Around Top Promoter of VFW Auxiliary programs, as she has covered more programs than the rest of the members combined. Following the awards presentations, Torres thanked the women of the auxiliary for what they do, pointing out that without an auxiliary the VFW would likely have a meeting once a month and that would be the extent of the post. “They are awesome. They make us look good,” he said.

By Scot Wingo Feature  Shares As an entrepreneur who has moved from the e-commerce world (products going digital) to the on-demand world (services going digital), I believe the ODE has a shot at being as big if not substantially bigger than e-commerce.  To understand why I’m so optimistic about the ODE, let’s look at four consumer behaviours that are driving the rapid adoption of the industry.   Ask any retailer or brand manufacturer and they will tell you that consumer behaviour has changed more in the last 5 years than it did in the 150 years prior.  For me, the ODE sits squarely at the intersection of four of the largest consumer behaviour changes: Mobile – You’d have to be living under a rock to not have already seen probably 50 interesting stats about this trend that was kicked off 10yrs ago with the release of the iPhone. My personal favourite: the average American looks at their phone 82 times a day (sorry I probably just ruined your day….21, 22, 23, 24…ugh!) Social – Again, I’m probably not going to surprise you with this one, but here’s one from Facebook’s 2016 Q4 results: Facebook had 1.8b monthly users and 1.2b of them (66 per cent) are DAILY and 1.1b of them are mobile daily users. It’s important to note this is all of Facebook’s properties which include Facebook proper, messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Bifurcation – Bifur-what? Ok, this is probably a new one for you, so I’ll spend a bit more time on it. The ‘Great Recession ‘of ’08 changed consumer behaviour in very interesting ways. The biggest change (as reported by Deloitte and Forrester) is what they call the “Bifurcation”. Basically, US consumers had two reactions to the recession – they either became value oriented or convenience oriented and they have split pretty evenly. o Value oriented – This group will spend large amounts of time and effort to save a dime. Their reaction to the recession was to become super financially conservative, focus on paying off all debt and minimising purchases overall and when they do buy, it is carefully considered and usually at a substantial discount. One of the biggest success stories since the recession in the world of retail is TJ Max – this is their perfect target market. o Convenience oriented - This group came out of the recession with a different lesson – they valued their personal time more highly. The existential crises of the recession made them think: “Wow, I’d rather spend time with my kids, hobby, etc.” vs. mowing the yard, cleaning the house, driving around looking for things, etc. These folks jump on Amazon Prime (to the tune of 65m+ US households) because they quickly decide that spending $100 to get free 2-day shipping will pay for itself on just 1-2 trips to the mall, Walmart or Target. Another way to illustrate bifurcation is through a retail example – if you are a retailer that doesn’t focus on one of these two areas (Nordstrom and TJ Max) , you are painfully stuck in the middle and either closing a lot of stores (Macy’s, Sears, JC Penney), or filing chapter 11 (The Sports Authority, Radio Shack, etc.). Zero Friction – The last trend is a little more subtle until you think about your daily transactional experiences and I call it zero friction. The best way to describe Zero Friction is that great low to zero friction customer experiences dramatically bend your expectations both for one vendor and most importantly ALL vendors. Most folks use the Uber example here (press a button on phone, car comes in <5mins – now how does it feel to stand on a curb waving your hands in the rain for 30mins?) But my personal favorite example is Starbucks. Starbucks added mobile ordering to their app in Q3 2015 and the adoption rate has been so insane that a year later and Starbucks is struggling to keep up with demand because peak times are seeing mobile orders hit 20 per cent+. Whenever I go to a Starbucks and forget to mobile order, the exact same experience from mid-2015, now feels like it takes a lifetime. The kicker for zero friction though is that it spills outside of that one vendor experience. For example, imagine after the zero-friction Starbucks mobile order+pay experience that you are now in Walmart and there are 200 people checking out and 3 registers open.  Suddenly that experience is 100x worse now because I’ve readjusted my expectations thanks to the Starbucks app, Uber, self-service checkout, 2-day Prime shipping, same day Prime Now shipping, etc..  The punch line of zero friction is that if you are a business and aren’t spending a large chunk of your time figuring out how to make a zero friction consumer experience, you can bet your competition IS and you may find yourself facing an existential crisis very quickly.  It took Starbucks customers less than a year with mobile order+pay to get north of 20 per cent and cause them to start thinking about completely retooling their stores to handle the surge. At the heart of these four big changes in consumer behaviour is an intersection where the ODE lives.  ODE users are mobile, social, love convenience and want zero friction.  They don’t want to call you three times to schedule an appointment.  They don’t want 8hr arrival windows.  They don’t want to DIY.   Conversely if you can give them a disruptively and innovatively low or zero friction option, you will win their hearts and minds.   Instead of DIY (Do It Yourself), give them DIFM (Do It For Me).  Give them an app and communicate with them that way (or text).  Give them flexibility and transparency. Put the control of the transaction in their hands vs yours. For me, any company that fits in that realm, is part of an already large ODE space and over time this space should be 4X as big as e-commerce because when you look at US GDP, Goods are 20 per cent and services are 80 per cent. Where is ODE in the ‘hype cycle’? With that background on the ODE, you would think I’m about to show you a chart that is up and to the right at a greater than 45 degree slope right?  Not so fast.  It turns out that new disruptive technologies or what I prefer to call ‘Waves of Innovation’ go through a pretty well known adoption lifecycle that Gartner calls the hype cycle and is illustrated here: Even in the modern age when you have platforms like FB growing much faster than anything before, we still go through the hype cycle, but in 5-10yrs vs. the previous 20-40yrs (Microwaves for example).  I remember camping out for my iPhone 1, literally overnight.  I opened it, got it setup and then after a couple of days realised that all it was was a phone/ipod and camera in one device vs. the 3 I had before.  It was cool, but you couldn’t really do anything ‘new’ with it.  Then a year later the app store came out.  Boom, it was off to the races.  When a new technology is past that initial excitement with early adopters, but has lost a bit of its lustre, that’s what Gartner calls (are you sitting down) the trough of disillusionment!  With that quick tour of the hype cycle behind us, let’s look at where the ODE space is at.  Analyst firm CB Insights publishes a quarterly review of funding for on-demand startup companies and in February released their Q4 2016 report which is best summarised with this graphic: Does this look familiar to you?  What we are seeing is that the ODE space is clearly in the trough of disillusionment.  In fact if we took the big three transportation companies out (Uber, Lyft and China’s Didi Chuxing), it would be even more pronounced. What’s happening is outside of transportation a lot of companies were founded like Homejoy, Luxe, Instacart, Postmates, YourMechanic, Handy, etc. that have fallen into three buckets: Failed – Homejoy is the poster child for this category. They were an ODE home-cleaning service that used a marketplace model and famously burned through over $60m in capital and went out of business in dramatic fashion. In the car wash space you have several such as Cherry and Squeegy. Jury still out – Instacart (grocery delivery), Postmates (product delivery), Handy (home cleaning) Clearly succeeding – The transportation companies have not revealed their financials, but several Uber leaks have indicated they are not only growing rapidly (over 100 per cent y/y), have tremendous scale (~$7b/yr ARR), but also are at a minimum profitable in many cities, regions and countries. Blue Apron in the on-demand food/meal delivery space is doing very well reportedly on track to hit over $1b in ARR in 2017. How does ODE get out of the ‘trough of disillusionment?  I believe the number one thing that many of the failed and potentially failing ODE companies suffer from is that they put the financial model in front of the consumer experience.  Homejoy is a great example: If you were a happy customer that had a great cleaner, Homejoy would not guarantee you that cleaner in the future. So you were incented to go direct to the cleaner. Since Homejoy collected 30 per cent plus from the cleaner, the cleaner was also incented. Therefore, every good customer experience resulted in churn of BOTH the customer and the cleaner. If you were an un-happy customer that had a bad cleaner, Homejoy would refund your money but couldn’t guarantee the quality of the next cleaner (see the first bullet). The result – death by accelerated churn on both the demand and supply side of the marketplace.  What if Homejoy employed the cleaners full-time? They would have been able to more completely control the good experiences and limit the bad experiences.  Their margins wouldn’t have been as artificially high and perhaps they wouldn’t have been able to raise as much capital, but at least they would still be around. For ODE to make it out of Gartner’s Trough of Disillusionment through the Slope of Enlightenment to the Plateau of Productivity (mainstream adoption), companies have to focus on creating great customer experiences and constantly challenge themselves: How do you work from the ‘customer back’ vs. worrying first about margins or the ability to raise capital? How can you appeal to the convenience oriented consumer by making their lives easier and DIFM vs. DYI? Consumers want transparency, give it to them. In today’s world, if you, for example, mark up the groceries you are delivering, the consumer is going to find out very quickly and be upset at the lack of transparency. Another example is bait-and-switch. The classic example is auto services like Jiffy Lube. You go in expecting a $60 oil change and leave having spent $200 on strongly recommended upsells. Consumers hate these experiences. Consumers want control of the transaction, give it to them. Allow them to change, modify and cancel whatever they want without having to jump through hoops. Instead of letting a marketing metric drive your thinking, give your customers options. Maybe it will be hard to measure or less impressive to your investors, but customers love choice. For example, instead of forcing all customers to download an app, give them a phone number to call or a transaction web experience for desktop/mobile. The final point I want to re-iterate that is even broader than the ODE: if you don’t provide an amazing zero friction experience, someone else will and the way these platforms work, your customers are a click, app-install, tap or swipe away from switching.

It’s one of the company’s largest acquisitions that run six shopping sites, like diapers.com, wag.com and soap.com. As soon as it takes effect, 263 people will be unemployed. However, some of the workers could apply for a new position at Amazon, as reported by Bloomberg. Profitability Issues The shutdown of those sites is caused by profitability issues. In a statement, Amazon spokesperson said that the company worked hard for the past seven years just to make Quidsi profitable. Unfortunately, it didn’t reach its goal. It also added that Quidsi is a great brand. It’ll continue to offer various products on amazon.com. But the software development team will concentrate on creating technology for the company’s AmazonFresh. When the sites are going offline? Unfortunately, the spokesperson failed to mention it. Amazon bought Quidsi six years ago. The deal, at that time was around $545 million. It was one of the fourth-largest acquisitions of Amazon. The acquisition was the result of an intense price battle among companies that threatened to push Quidsi to bankruptcy. The co-founder of Quidsi, Marc Lore, worked at Amazon for a few years after the deal. But it was known that he didn’t enjoy his time there. Because of that, he went on to introduce jet.com, a major competitor of Amazon. But he sold it to Walmart last year for $3.3 billion. Lore is now running all the e-commerce operations for Walmart, which is Amazon’s biggest competitor in the US. He stated that his long-term goal for Walmart is to win the e-commerce battle in America. That means, he wants to be the number 1 and, not behind Amazon. Unfortunately, the Seattle giant has a massive lead. Some assumed that diapers.com and soap.com are hard to maintained separately because most of the Prime members are no longer shopping there. Thus, it makes total sense just to shut them down. But it’s also possible that the decision of Amazon is a result of the company’s taking a shot at Quidsi’s co-founder, Lore, because of his effort in boosting Walmart’s e-commerce platform. On Tuesday, the company revealed that it’s testing AmazonFresh Pickup. It’s a similar program being offered by Walmart. With that in mind, you could order online and schedule a pickup at the stores you’ve chosen. Quidsi Specialities Quidsi specializes in various categories, like baby products and household items. Amazon, on the other hand, is offering an infinite inventory. However, diapers.com and other websites’s attraction faded since Amazon acquired Quidsi. People prefer to shop at the world’s biggest online shopping retailer. It has become a go-to online shopping site. According to Bloomberg: “Amazon is closing Quidsi in order to pull Quidsi users into the Amazon ecosystem,” Sargent said. “Amazon wants to be the single easy place to go for everything. The timing is not coincidental as Amazon wants to bring more attention to its specific brand entities in areas like grocery where it wants to expand.” Share the joy                 Share this: Reddit Email Facebook Skype Twitter Tumblr Google LinkedIn More Pinterest Author: Jane Danes Jane has a lifelong passion for writing.

Tax planning: How to complete all tax work before March 31 NEW DELHI: Walmart Stores Inc, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, would consider opening physical outlets and selling products online if New Delhi allowed overseas supermarkets that directly sold Made-in-India products to consumers. “We are okay with selling only ‘Make in India’ products because even in our cash-andcarry stores, imported items make up for only 5% of our total products,” Krish Iyer, chief executive of Walmart India, told ET. Imports don’t make sense for supermarkets such as the Bentonville, Arkansas-based giant, as high customs duties raise prices, negating the sourcing efficiency that makes Walmart among the cheapest global retailers. Iyer said that with more than 95% local sourcing, Walmart India is already a partner in the government’s Make-in-India initiative, which seeks to establish the South Asian nation as a manufacturing hub. ET had reported last month that India plans to unshackle the grocery retailing industry for foreign companies as long as they sold goods sourced and produced locally. Two industry executives requesting anonymity said that bankers are mapping the retail industry, and making presentations to Walmart, preparing the deck for acquisitions of local entities when the government allows Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail. Iyer declined to comment on the likelihood of an acquisition, but a person aware of the development said that the US behemoth would like to acquire a company locally, although compliance remains a a hindrance. Walmart currently operates 21 of its Best Price branded wholesale chain in the country. The retailing giant had bought the 50% share from Bharti Enterprises in the cash-and-carry joint venture after the alliance ended in October 2013. Analysts say that it has become imperative for Walmart to move forward with its strategy on selling directly to Indian consumers after Amazon.com in February applied to the government to invest $515 million into a venture that would sell foods online and through physical stores, becoming the first global retail titan to take advantage of the policy. “Globally, Amazon is nimblefooted and led by founder Jeff Bezos himself, while Walmart is weighed down by bureaucracy that delays decisions. But things may change now as Walmart has started to catch up in some areas,” said Harminder Sahni, founder of retail consultancy firm Wazir Advisors. Last year, India allowed 100% subsidiaries of global companies to sell food products through brick-and-mortar stores and the Web as long as the products were locally produced. The BJP government, that has otherwise opposed foreign supermarkets into India, said the policy change was aimed at creating jobs, helping farmers, and reducing India’s notorious food wastage that is blamed on the country’s antiquated supply chain. After the policy was unveiled, New Delhi had hoped that global chains such as Walmart or Tesco would welcome the foodonly retailing: However, overseas retailers were lukewarm to the proposal, suggesting that only low-margin food items do not make such businesses viable. According to a source, Walmart had asked the government to let it sell some non-food grocery items to make the proposal workable.

BankThink How states can still outmatch OCC over fintech Why advocates of splitting chairman, CEO roles are gaining ground search goes here BankThink Is one-stop banking viable anymore? By Kevin Tynan Published March 30 2017, 1:10pm EDT More in Customer data Consumer banking Nonbank Print Email Reprints Share Share on Online shopping is taking a huge sales bite out of retail brick-and-mortar stores. The owners of Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic have reported seven straight quarters of sales declines, Sears is on its last legs and mega-retailer Walmart is scrambling to keep up with Amazon. If legacy retailers are in trouble, can legacy banks be far behind? So far, the only reason banks haven’t experienced the same dramatic sales decline as retailers is because of the banking industry’s tightly controlled regulatory environment that limits market entry. However, protective policies will only slow down competition; they won’t stop it. Banks must prepare now for what could become significant threats to their bottom lines. Already, innovative banks and fintech companies are gradually short-circuiting the protective barriers by offering customers cheaper and more convenient purchasing alternatives than what incumbents offer. Bank customers are responding by bypassing their primary institution and going directly to online providers for other products and services. As a result, the concept of a primary bank that satisfies most customer needs is becoming a relic of the past — a transformation that will have serious implications for traditional institutions with revenue models that hinge on selling checking account customers multiple products. Banks, after all, often lose money on checking accounts; however, the losses have been subsidized by institutions’ success in selling profitable customers lucrative credit cards, automobile loans and commercial products. But increasingly, customers are looking beyond their current bank for cheaper and more convenient financial providers. According to a 2016 report from Accenture, consumers are purchasing low-margin products from their primary bank but shopping around for higher-margin services. For instance, the majority (61%) of consumers indicated they choose other sources for brokerage accounts, 70% choose other sources for auto loans and 52% choose other sources for home mortgages. Stickiness, in other words the hoops customers have to jump through trying to change banks, is losing its effectiveness at keeping customers tied to their primary financial institution. In the same Accenture survey, 40% of customers felt they were less dependent on their primary financial services provider and reported going to nonbank providers in the previous 12 months. Customer satisfaction doesn’t seem to be as big a retention factor as was once thought either. A 2017 study by J.D. Power found that customer satisfaction has reached record highs since the financial crisis; however, the industry is still seeing an increasing number of accountholders shift to more convenient, lower-priced alternatives. Another indication that customers are looking outside their bank for products is seen in the area of nonbank lending. For the first time in more than 30 years, banks accounted for less than half of all mortgage loan dollars extended to U.S. borrowers in the third quarter of last year. Nonbank lenders — such as Quicken Loans and PennyMac Financial Services — were responsible for 51.4% of the loan dollars for the third quarter, up from 9% in all of 2009. As customers flee to lower cost-providers, banks will take a double hit. Revenues from high-profit products will decline, and banks will see minimal lift from additional product purchases. National banks are largely immune from the trend. Big banks, which appeal to such large audiences, are so driven by economics that they manage fees like a hatchet, poised to chop off customers whenever they become unprofitable. Community institutions, on the other hand, have stronger customer relationships, smaller bases and reputations to worry about when hiking fees or shedding customers. Nonetheless, community institutions must determine if their current strategy of subsidizing unprofitable customers is tenable in the long–term. Initially, the shift will be hard to detect unless marketers dig deep into service usage. Clients, after all, won’t close an account. They will simply open a new one elsewhere. Banks can respond to the trend in several ways. First, look closely to see if your institution is being affected. Create alerts for any drops in deposit balances or account inactivity, monitor customer sentiment through periodic surveys and watch your services-per-account ratio to see if it’s dropping. Calculating your service ratio over the entire customer base could make recent customer departures imperceptible. Consider establishing a rolling service ratio of your best or most active accounts over the past twelve months. It may help you spot a trend earlier. Second, think about introducing a series of low-cost products that appeal to discount shoppers. Just strip away some features in the higher-priced line. You will keep customers who are seeking discount-priced alternatives without cannibalizing profits generated by high-margin customers. Third, let unprofitable customers leave. A study from professors at George State University found that one in five customers are unprofitable. They divide unprofitable customers into four categories: service demanders who overuse service in various channels; revenue demanders who request fee reversals and frequent overdrafts; promotion maximizers who seek special rates and extra services; and spending limiters with small, unprofitable accounts at many institutions. Identify the accountholders who drain your income and you’ll see a big impact on your bottom line.

Retail BI Intelligence Events Trending Tech Insider Finance Politics Strategy Life Sports Video All × From To You have successfully emailed the post. I'm ditching Amazon for Walmart's e-commerce competitor — here's why Emily Cohn Mar. 30, 2017, 11:09 AM 101,316 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jet.com Amazon announced Wednesday that it was shutting down Quidsi, the subsidiary that runs a bunch of popular e-commerce sites like Soap.com and Diapers.com.  Amazon will reportedly lay off hundreds of workers and move the inventory on those sites over to Amazon.com. I was pretty bummed when I read the news. As a city dweller, I'm a big fan of Soap.com, which I use to buy things like toilet paper, paper towel, laundry detergent, and other household items that are difficult to carry home from the store. But I figured the transition would be a good reason to check out Soap's competitors. Perhaps I could find cheaper prices on other sites, like Jet.com. Jet.com was actually founded by Marc Lore, who also started Quidsi. After Amazon bought Quisdi in 2010, Lore went on to start Jet, which was bought by Walmart in 2016 for $3 billion.  A lot of my friends use Jet and rave about its low prices, so I decided to give it a try and see how it stacks up to Amazon's Soap.com in terms of product availability and prices.    View As: One Page Slides I started by looking at my "Easy Reorder" list on Soap. Soap.com When you login to Soap, you can find a convenient list of all the products you've ordered in the past. This makes re-stocking very easy.  I decided I would go through this list and try and find the same products on Jet to compare prices.  A 24-pack of Charmin double roll toilet paper cost $21.99 on Soap. Soap.com I was shocked to see that the same 24-pack of Charmin was only $12.47 on Jet. Jet.com Next up: tissues. A box of 75 Kleenex ultra-soft tissues cost $4.61 on Soap. With a 25% coupon, the cost came down to $3.92 per box. Soap.com I couldn't find the same single box of 75 Kleenex tissues on Jet, but I did find a 4-pack of boxes that only cost $6.90, making each box cost only $1.73. Much cheaper than Soap. Jet.com Paper towels were next on my list. An 8-pack of Bounty "select-a-size" paper towels was $26.50 on Soap. Soap.com That same 8-pack of rolls was only $19.99 on Jet. Jet.com Jet also offered discounts for buying in bulk. Buying 2 8-packs would have brought the cost down to $19.67 per pack. Unfortunately, I don't have the storage space in my Brooklyn apartment to take full advantage of the deal.  I'm always looking for a good deal on contact solution, which always strikes me as a ripoff. On Soap, a pack of 2 10-ounce bottles of Opti-Free solution cost $21.28. Soap.com I couldn't find the same 10-ounce twin pack of solution on Jet.com. But I did find a twin pack of larger 14-ounce bottles that actually cost less than the twin pack on Soap: $21.09. Sweet. Jet.com The final item on my list is laundry detergent. A 50-ounce jug of Tide is on sale on Soap for $11.55, discounted from $15.99. Soap.com The same 50-ounce bottle is $10.57 on Jet. Again, cheaper. Jet.com My final total on Soap: $101.71 Soap.com One thing I love about Soap is its extremely fast shipping. If you spend more than $49, you don't have to pay an extra shipping fee, and orders often come in the next day or two. From the looks of it, my full order will arrive the day after I place this order.  My total on Jet is $75.38. That's 25% cheaper than Soap. Jet.com One downside of Jet is that it looks like my order will appear in two shipments. The first will arrive the next day. The second shipment could take as long as a week! Overall, I'm pretty excited about Jet. It had all the same products I normally buy on Soap, and it was much, much cheaper.

Kristian Rouz – Wage stagnation, which has plagued the US economy for almost two decades, is particularly acute when it comes to recent college graduates, whose living standards happen to be the lowest of all the post-WWII generations of Americans. While a record number of young professionals are working minimum wage jobs, the role of formal education as a means of social betterment is rapidly eroding as it also entails a massive accumulation of student debt, averaging at some $30,000 per student. Since the Great Recession, worker compensation for recent graduates with four-year bachelor’s degrees has hardly increased, and, in some cases, has actually shrunk. While the past eight years were characterised by low inflation and near-zero interest rates, the recent acceleration in price growth and the Federal Reserve’s lifting of base borrowing costs are starting to bite. The heavily-indebted college grads are mired in economic despair, and there are no immediate solutions to the gaping abyss of highly-qualified poverty. © Flickr/ Mike Mozart Trump's Jobs Creation Agenda Gains Traction on GM, Walmart AnnouncementsAccording to a white paper by researchers from the Washington-based Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, young professionals are facing low wages combined with significant increases in rents and home prices, as well as other living costs, both essential and complimentary. Based on US Census figures, the research shows that a biology major, for example, earned an average of $31,000 per year in 2015, some $4,000 less than five years prior. When adjusted for inflation, the loss in effective wages is even more spectacular. The highest-paid entry-level positions for recent graduates are in chemical engineering and IT, which pay an annual average of about $60,000. However, most IT jobs are concentrated around the Silicon Valley tech hub, where rents are stunningly high, starting at $2,500 per month for very basic accommodation. Homeownership is hardly a realistic scenario for most young professionals in this overpriced market reality. "It has been like this for the past five, six years now," Ban Cheah of Georgetown said. "It's a little depressing." Graduates with social sciences majors earned about $41,000 per year on average in 2009, and $39,000 in 2015, while a graduate holding a major in law and public policy earned $39,000 in 2009, and only $33,000 in 2015. Liberal arts graduates were paid some $33,000 a year in 2009, and $32,000 in 2015, while architecture graduates earned some $59,000 in 2009, and $56,000 in 2015. Again, adjusted for inflation, even though it had been dismally low during the period of 2009-2015, these numbers look even more desperate. Facing the tough reality of working in their field of study, young professionals are looking at other, faster-growing and better yielding areas of the labour market. "If you’ve tuned into CEO earnings calls recently, you’d know that a common theme is wage pressure, especially in low-pay sectors such as restaurants. CEOs cite the need to attract quality hires, a tightening labour market, and the push from higher minimum wages,” Emanuella Enenajor of Bank of America said. “Last year (in 2015), companies like McDonalds and Walmart announced higher wages, raising fears of a sudden pick-up in wage pressure, which we argued against in our piece “Fast food, fast wages?” Lower-paying jobs are ugly and unattractive at first glance, but in fact, vertical mobility and greater prospects for raises happen to be significantly better than those in professional fields. In 2016, the lowest-paying 20pc of US industries saw average wage gains of 3.4pc per year, significantly outpacing the inflation, whilst the rest 80pc of the labour market saw salaries rise by an average 2.4pc. © AFP 2017/ Brendan Smialowski US Sees 'Unexpected' Boost in Jobs Creation Driven by 'New Spirit' - TrumpFairly sold consumer demand, legislative raises in minimum wage, and the need for better workforce have all motivated the low-paying employer to raise worker compensation at a quicker pace, and that is how they managed to attract many higher-skilled college grads. They might not be able to utilise their qualifications at their workplace, but the economics of the labour market are keeping them in place. The top 80pc of US industries are facing tough competition for jobs on the supply side of the labour market. The bottom 20pc, or the lowest paying employers, however, have more openings than they are able to fill. In late 2016, some 23pc of low pay sector workers had a Bachelor’s Degree or higher, which is above the 2001 figure of 18pc. It is worth noting that the US labour market has expanded significantly during those 15 years, meaning in absolute numbers there are many more college grads working restaurants and hospitality jobs, for example,  than before. Still, the risks of poverty and indebtedness are not offset by the gains in hiring and wages in the low-paying sectors. Worker compensation for young Americans is generally in a downward spiral. “While those with college degrees or advanced degrees saw wage growth of 8.5pc and 6.9pc, respectively, from 2000 to 2016, educational attainment has not been sufficient to return many workers to where they were before the recessions of the 2000s,” analysts from the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute (EPI) wrote. Such an economic reality is discouraging the most pragmatic of the American youths from putting any effort into obtaining any higher education whatsoever, as if the student debt nightmare alone was not enough to hamper the prospects of education in the US. ...

The Wall Street Journal first reported Fiona Tan’s promotion to senior vice president of U.S. customer technology. Previously, she worked as vice president of engineering in the retailer’s international division. Jaya Kolhatkar was promoted to senior vice president of Walmart’s global data and analytics platform. She joined WalmartLabs in 2013 as part of the Inkiru acquisition. Jae Evans was promoted to vice president of global technical engineering and operations with responsibilities over core infrastructure services. Lore said recently at the ShopTalk Conference in Las Vegas that the new structure would align more executives toward improving customers’ shopping experience regardless of whether that’s online or in physical stores or a combination of both. He said it won’t happen overnight, but consumers will begin to see more convenient shopping options deployed with it’s mobile application.

New Market Track Study Reveals Retail Sector Now in an Age of “Channel-Less Shoppers” Regardless of Demographics Data Reveals In-Store Shopping Still Happening With Purchase Intention Being Heavily Influenced By Online Pricing Research Shopper preferences on buying specific categories online or in-store (Graphic: Business Wire) Download Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail ???pagination.previous??? ???pagination.next??? Shopper preferences on buying specific categories online or in-store (Graphic: Business Wire) Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail Full Size Small Preview Thumbnail March 30, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--With the likes of Amazon Prime, Jet.com and the recent free shipping offensive at WalMart and Target, most retail observers have been commenting about brick and mortar survival. “Not true,” according to a recent study by Market Track, LLC, the leader in advertising, eCommerce, brand protection, and promotional intelligence solutions. The shopper study reveals despite declines in foot traffic and same-store sales numbers, most consumers still prefer to buy most categories in-store, but do research online before doing so. In a nationwide survey of over 1,200 primary household shoppers, the majority of respondents indicated that they prefer making most purchases at a physical location. However, for all sixteen categories for which the study surveyed, 80% of respondents also said they would do online price comparisons, signaling a true shift to the age of the “channel-less shopper.” According to the study, consumers noted the bigger the ticket on the item, the more likely they were to research prices online. For example, respondents indicated for items like computers, tablets, electronics and major appliances they were more likely to compare prices online before going in-store to ultimately make a purchase. “Even with consumers indicating their preference to purchase items in-store, the highly competitive online environment is impacting brick and mortar results. Decreases in profit margins can be attributed to shoppers being armed with more pricing and comparison information,” said Traci Gregorski, Senior Vice President of Marketing at Market Track. “With real-time price data and other online information such as ratings and reviews at their disposal, it is much easier to decide which retailer to visit and which brand to buy. With prices fluctuating more frequently due to competitive pressures, it behooves shoppers to do their homework no matter where they decide to make their purchase.” Adding yet another dimension is the rising consumer adoption of mobile. This is especially true in the “digital native” groups where they have never known a world without the internet and online shopping. The study indicated that for those in the 18-20 age group, 40% prefer to do most of their shopping for non-grocery items on mobile, 38% prefer shopping online and 22% would rather go in store. For the 21-29 age group mobile is even more pronounced, with 47% saying they primarily use their mobile device to shop, 31% indicated they prefer online and only 22% want to make a trip to the store. Then there’s Amazon. 87% of shoppers surveyed said they shop on Amazon, with more than one in three saying they shop on Amazon at least once a week. Why? The majority indicated "selection of products" as the main driver for shopping on Amazon. The 30-39 age group has the most Prime members at 63%, however, every age group except those 50 and above had over half as Prime members. “The increase in dollars being spent online is significant, however, the influence of eCommerce is much broader. The transactional data is only one dimension. What is most meaningful about eCommerce in our survey is that it shows it is the great equalizer, placing additional advantage on the consumer side and necessitating a more strategic approach from retailers and brands participating in the online space. Increased competition, marketplaces and emerging specialty e-retailers require both retailers and brands to be vigilant in monitoring, analyzing, and changing course quickly in order to remain profitable,” continued Gregorski.

Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf START THE SHUTDOWN CLOCKS -- The government shuts down one month from today, and there are just eight legislative days left to pass a spending bill. Our sources tell us that Congress plans to deal with avoiding a shutdown the week of April 24 -- meaning they will push it off until the last minute, and give themselves five weekdays to avoid a shutdown. WHAT CAN GO WRONG?! Story Continued Below ABOUT THAT HEALTH BILL … -- PAUL RYAN talks to NORAH O’DONNELL on this morning’s “CBS THIS MORNING”: “What I worry about, Norah, is that if we don’t [pass a GOP health care bill], then [Trump will] just go work with Democrats to try and change Obamacare and that’s not -- that’s hardly a conservative thing. ... [I]f this Republican Congress allows the perfect to be the enemy of the good, I worry we’ll push the president into working with Democrats, he’s been suggesting that as much.” ON TRUMP WORKING WITH DEMOCRATS: “I don’t want that to happen. You know why? I want a patient-centered system. I don’t want government running health care. The government shouldn’t tell you what you must do with your life, with your health care. We should give people choices.” -- JUST A NOTE: This is a pretty striking comment. The Republican speaker of the House acknowledges that the Republican president will abandon their party and work with Democrats if the GOP doesn’t step up its game soon. BREAKING OVERNIGHT -- BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP’S TRAVEL BAN -- AP/HONOLULU at 3:48 a.m.: “A federal judge in Hawaii who temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s revised travel ban hours before it was set to take effect issued a longer-lasting order Wednesday. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson held a hearing Wednesday on Hawaii’s request to extend his temporary hold. Several hours later, he issued a 24-page order blocking the government from suspending new visas for travelers from six Muslim-majority countries and halting the U.S. refugee program. “Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin argued that even though the revised ban has more neutral language, the implied intent is still there. He likened it to a neon sign flashing ‘Muslim Ban,’ which the government hasn’t bothered to turn off. Chad Readler, a Department of Justice attorney defending Trump’s executive order, told the judge via telephone that Hawaii hasn’t shown how it is harmed by various provisions, including one that would suspend the nation’s refugee program. Watson disagreed.” http://apne.ws/2nyt4A8 YASHAR ALI in the Daily Intelligencer on NYMag.com -- “What George W. Bush Really Thought of Donald Trump’s Inauguration”: “Bush gave a brief assessment of Trump’s inaugural after leaving the dais: ‘That was some weird s***.’ All three heard him say it. A spokesman for Bush declined to comment.” http://nym.ag/2nj3yNq RUSSIA WATCH -- “Senate steps up as House Russia probe flails,” by Austin Wright and Martin Matishak: “The House investigation into Russia’s election meddling is in shambles. The Senate is more than happy to fill the void. As the House probe continued its collapse into a partisan shouting match Wednesday, Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr and his Democratic counterpart, Mark Warner, stepped into the spotlight to present a stark contrast. Their message? We are the adults in the room.” http://politi.co/2mRZlVG -- “Who is ‘Source D’? The man said to be behind the Trump-Russia dossier’s most salacious claim,” by WaPo’s Rosalind S. Helderman and Tom Hamburger: http://wapo.st/2nlZVqU --Kevin Baron (@DefenseBaron): “.@FBI Dir. Comey spoke tonight at the intelligence assoc @INSAlliance dinner. And sent a little message...” The message, per Patrick Tucker (@DefTechPat): “Comey on #russiagate investigation: politically, we don’t care who ‘Is gored by our work. I hope that’s reassuring.’ so @realDonaldTrump” ALL IN THE FAMILY -- NYT A19 “Ivanka Trump, Shifting Plans, Will Become a Federal Employee,” by Maggie Haberman and Rachel Abrams: “Ivanka Trump, the elder daughter of President Trump, is becoming an official government employee, joining her husband, Jared Kushner, in serving as an unpaid adviser to her father in the White House. The announcement on Wednesday amounts to the formal recognition of the value Mr. Trump places on the judgment and loyalty of both his daughter and his son-in-law. While relying on family members for advice is hardly unusual for a president, giving them a formal role has few precedents. Ms. Trump, 35, will be an assistant to the president; Mr. Kushner, 36, has the title of senior adviser.” http://nyti.ms/2niOhfG -- @BraddJaffy: “November 13, 2016 Q [on “60 Minutes” from Lesley Stahl] ‘People think that you’re going to be part of the administration, Ivanka.’ Ivanka: ‘I’m— no. I’m going to be a daughter.’” http://bit.ly/2ojTiGo -- “Lara Trump hired by Trump campaign’s digital vendor,” by AP’s Julie Bykowicz: “The New Yorker, Eric Trump’s wife, will serve as a liaison for San Antonio, Texas-based Giles-Parscale to Trump’s ongoing campaign, based at Trump Tower in Manhattan. Giles-Parscale President Brad Parscale says she’s an ‘incredibly talented person with the right experience for us.’ Parscale says Lara Trump has a background in marketing and helped on Trump’s 2016 political bid.” http://apne.ws/2mRIwdx THE JARED BEAT -- “Kushner Cos. Ends Talks With Chinese Firm for Skyscraper Deal,” by WSJ’s Peter Grant: “Negotiations between New York real-estate developer Kushner Cos. and a large Chinese company over a planned $7.5 billion tower in Manhattan collapsed amid an outcry over possible conflicts of interest involving the Trump administration. Anbang Insurance Group Co., which has close political and family ties to the Chinese government, began pursuing a possible investment of as much as $1.25 billion in the project at 666 Fifth Ave. last July, according to people familiar with the discussions. But Anbang began backing away from the deal in recent weeks as it became a lightning rod for critics of the Trump administration who have said President Donald Trump and some of his top advisers haven’t taken sufficient steps to avoid possible conflicts between their government roles and their former businesses.” http://on.wsj.com/2oaRQZP U.S. AT WAR -- NYT A1, “U.S. War Footprint Grows in Middle East, With No Endgame in Sight,” by Ben Hubbard and Michael R. Gordon: “The United States launched more airstrikes in Yemen this month than during all of last year. In Syria, it has airlifted local forces to front-line positions and has been accused of killing civilians in airstrikes. ... Two months after the inauguration of President Trump, indications are mounting that the United States military is deepening its involvement in a string of complex wars in the Middle East that lack clear endgames. Rather than representing any formal new Trump doctrine on military action, however, American officials say that what is happening is a shift in military decision-making that began under President Barack Obama. On display are some of the first indications of how complicated military operations are continuing under a president who has vowed to make the military ‘fight to win.’” http://nyti.ms/2ojN6OH -- @jimsciutto: “Just in: CENTCOM Commander says #Russia is likely ‘providing some kind of support’ to the Taliban in Afghanistan” HMM -- “Trump Drops Human Rights Demand in Bid to Sell Bahrain F-16 Jets,” by Bloomberg’s Anthony Capaccio: “The U.S. State Department told Congress it backs the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin Corp. F-16 fighters to Bahrain without preconditions on improved human rights previously demanded by the Obama administration, according to two people familiar with the proposal. ... Wednesday’s request triggers a roughly three-week informal notification period that will be followed by a formal, publicly released document that Congress has 30 days to approve.” https://bloom.bg/2nCyrQf ****** A message from the Coalition to Protect America's Health Care: America's hospitals provide critical, often life-saving care — and other primary and preventative care services — within and outside their four walls. But that hasn’t stopped Congress from cutting vital federal funding for patient care. Join us to protect America's hospitals and the vital care they provide to their communities. http://politi.co/2mZqMIh ****** BUZZ -- CONWAY CAUSING CONTROVERSY… AGAIN -- Kellyanne Conway received the American Association of Political Consultants MVP award earlier this month, but the award led to a major controversy among both GOP and Democratic members of the organization. Several operatives have voiced concerns that Conway got the prize despite the Trump campaign violating the AAPC’s code of ethics, which members sign. The AAPC code http://bit.ly/2nyiTvo One longtime Democratic consultant and AAPC member told us members were upset over everything from whether she is a current member of the group (but still got the prize) to “questioning her ability and how much say she had in the campaign as well as the ethics of her participation in the campaign.” Another Democratic consultant member said “people were angry. It blew up on Facebook” during the conference. “There were people questioning ... whether to go to [AAPC] events in the future.” Conway didn’t attend the conference but instead sent in a video accepting the award. Giving the award to Conway was a matter of intense debate among AAPC’s board but they determined that it was unlikely that the Trump campaign would have been successful without Conway and found no evidence she lied in a substantial way to the press during the campaign or committed other violations. AAPC declined to comment. The White House did not provide comment in time for publication. THE NEW REALITY -- “Energy Department climate office bans use of phrase ‘climate change,’” by Eric Wolff: “A supervisor at the Energy Department’s international climate office told staff this week not to use the phrases ‘climate change,’ ‘emissions reduction’ or ‘Paris Agreement’ in written memos, briefings or other written communication, sources have told POLITICO. Employees of DOE’s Office of International Climate and Clean Energy learned of the ban at a meeting Tuesday, the same day President Donald Trump signed an executive order at EPA headquarters to reverse most of former President Barack Obama’s climate regulatory initiatives.” http://politi.co/2nlC8HH BUT, BUT, BUT -- “Apple, Wal-Mart Stick With Climate Pledges Despite Trump’s Pivot,” by Bloomberg’s Christopher Flavelle: “Many of America’s biggest corporations including Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are sticking by their pledges to fight climate change even as President Donald Trump guts his predecessor’s environmental policies. ... Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s largest beer-maker … announced Tuesday that it would get 100 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Nearly 90 companies have made similar pledges ... One of them is Mars Inc., the maker of M&M’s. The company committed to eliminating its emissions entirely by 2040.” https://bloom.bg/2oBH0Zt -- Isaac Dovere: “General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt says [in an internal company blog post that] President Donald Trump’s imagination is at work if he doesn’t believe in climate change science or the Paris agreement that President Barack Obama signed onto before leaving office. And Immelt is calling on other companies to step up to fill the void that the administration is leaving behind.” http://politi.co/2niIA1a -- “Trump EPA declines to ban pesticide that Obama had proposed outlawing,” by WaPo’s Brady Dennis: “The new head of the [EPA] refused Wednesday to ban a commonly used pesticide that the Obama administration had sought to outlaw based on mounting concerns about its risks to human health. The chemical compound chlorpyrifos, also known as Lorsban, has been used by farmers for more than a half-century to kill pests on crops including broccoli, strawberries and citrus. The EPA banned its spraying indoors to combat household bugs more than a decade ago. But only in recent years did the agency seek to ban its use in agriculture, after mounting scientific evidence that prenatal exposure can pose risks to fetal brain and nervous system development. ... Environmental activists were incensed Wednesday, saying that [Scott] Pruitt had ignored substantial evidence of potential harms.” http://wapo.st/2ok3Ntl MAKING AMENDS -- NYT’s Mark Landler: Wednesday was “a day in which the White House reached out to women, and sought to make amends for bruised feelings. At the daily White House news briefing, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, called first on April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks. On Tuesday Mr. Spicer had a tense exchange with Ms. Ryan, who is African-American, which culminated with him ordering her to stop shaking her head during one of his answers. ‘How are you today?’ a solicitous Mr. Spicer asked Ms. Ryan, who said she was fine.” http://nyti.ms/2nOq0lz WHAT TRUMP LIKES TO TALK ABOUT WITH HIS FRIENDS -- AP’s Julie Bykowicz: “Billionaire Las Vegas casino owner Phil Ruffin has never been to the White House. On Thursday, he’ll have dinner there with his friend, Donald Trump. ... Few know Trump as well, or in as many capacities, as Ruffin, who described their friendship in two recent interviews with The Associated Press. They’re business partners and social friends who enjoy talking about corporate jets and golf games and business deals their acquaintances have made -- the usual billionaire stuff, Ruffin said.” http://apne.ws/2nlZ6hP THE JUICE … -- THE PLACE TO BE … THE TRUMP HOTEL: Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Jason and Kelly Miller, Republican Reps. Mike Gallagher (Wis.) and Mike Fitzpatrick (Pa.) and Eric Peterson were all spotted last night at the Trump Hotel bar. Also on hand: A strong happy hour crew of former HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson alumni, including Bob Wood, Pam Stevens, Kevin Keane, Patty Conrad and Craig Stevens. -- KATE BEDINGFIELD, former deputy assistant to President Barack Obama and communications director for Vice President Joe Biden, is joining Monumental Sports & Entertainment as its vice president of communications. Monumental Sports owns the Wizards, Capitals, Mystics and Verizon Center. Bedingfield will report to founder Ted Leonsis. -- NFL TO CAPITOL HILL -- Current and former NFL players Anquan Boldin, Malcolm Jenkins, Johnson Bademosi and Donte’ Stallworth are back in Washington today to try and build support for their work on criminal justice reform and improving police and community relations. They are slated to meet with several lawmakers, including Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) and Scott Peters (D-Calif.). -- JIM JORDAN, a veteran Democratic media consultant, is joining California-based SCN Strategies. Jordan will anchor the firm’s east coast operations. Founder of the Thunder Road Group, Jordan has worked with GMMB; Shorr, Johnson, Magnus and Purple Strategies over the years. -- ALYSSA MASTROMONACO is a best-selling author. Her memoir of working for Barack Obama -- entitled "Who Thought This Was a Good Idea?: And Other Questions You Should Have Answers to When You Work in the White House" -- will debut at No. 10 on the New York Times bestseller list. -- NEWS MEDIA STEPS UP ITS GAME -- The New Media Alliance is pushing back hard against the spread of fake news. The group is engaging in a sustained coordinated campaign running full-page ads in several major newspapers, including the New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, LA Times, Chicago Tribune, Orlando Sentinel, Miami Herald and many more.

The unlikely rise of Steve Bannon’s right-hand woman,” by WaPo’s Ben Terris: “‘She’s the most wonderful, brilliant, kind, principled human being I’ve ever met,’ [Ann] Coulter said in an email. ‘I want her to be president as soon as she’s old enough.’ ... Friends who partied with her at the Coachella music festival, or decorated gingerbread houses with her at her family’s Beverly Hills home, recall a brainy and ambitious young woman who was unfailingly kind. She organized a fundraiser to bring foreign orphans to the United States. She shined in mock trial ... [When she moved to D.C. she] landed a gig with conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. According to three people who worked with her there, it sparked her political evolution: She came into the job holding many liberal views, including on immigration — but she moved quickly to the right as she rose to executive producer of the show.” With cameos from Ryan Williams, Alex Conant and Charles C.W. Cooke http://wapo.st/2mRKUB8 ... Her New Yorker Talk of the Town profile, “Becoming Steve Bannon’s Bannon” http://bit.ly/2kCBvZI DUNCAN HUNTER SAYS HE’S INNOCENT -- “Hunter: ‘I was not involved in any criminal action,’” by John Bresnahan and Kyle Cheney: “California GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter -- under criminal investigation by the Justice Department over alleged campaign violations -- insists he did nothing wrong. Hunter won’t say who is responsible for tens of thousands of dollars in campaign charges for personal expenses, but he says it wasn’t him and he’s broken no laws. ‘I was not involved in any criminal action,’ Hunter said in an interview Wednesday. ‘Maybe I wasn’t attentive enough to my campaign. That’s not a crime.’” http://politi.co/2nmCIok FOR YOUR RADAR -- “Years After 9/11 Chaos, U.S. to Build Wireless Network for Police, Firefighters,” by WSJ’s Ryan Knutson and John D. McKinnon: “The Trump administration on Thursday is expected to announce a $6.5 billion deal with AT&T Inc. to build a nationwide wireless broadband network for first responders, a project that was proposed after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but has struggled to get off the ground. The decision is a major step forward for FirstNet, as the program is called, though it still faces challenges. Some states are unsure whether to join FirstNet or build their own networks, and a politically connected startup that lost out on the contract is encouraging them to opt-out.” http://on.wsj.com/2mS2Vzi ****** A message from the Coalition to Protect America's Health Care: The Coalition to Protect America’s Health Care was formed to protect access to the best quality health care for all people. Our community of over one million grassroots supporters fight back against congressional and executive action that threatens America's hospitals. When our caregivers, our patients, or our communities are at risk, our supporters speak out and advocate. Join our community and protect access to quality patient care for all. http://politi.co/2nZNSjR ****** FUN READ -- “Sean Spicer’s kiss of death: ‘Phenomenal’: The White House press secretary has a curious habit of deploying the adjective,” by Matt Nussbaum: “The health care debacle, the travel ban setback, difficulties with Mexico, a slew of empty positions across the government -- all are symptoms or causes of President Donald Trump’s rocky first few weeks in office. They also have another thing in common: White House press secretary Sean Spicer has used the word ‘phenomenal’ to describe them. To be fair, Spicer has also deployed the term with more auspicious results — including the president’s ability to get his message out, to describe Terry Branstad’s prospects as ambassador to China and to discuss the Governors Ball. But there’s an unmistakable connection between his use of ‘phenomenal’ and issues that seem to be not going so hot for the White House.” http://politi.co/2nOmzet BEYOND THE BELTWAY -- UPDATE ON THE BATHROOM BILL -- “NC lawmakers, gov reach deal to end ‘bathroom bill’ standoff,” by AP’s Gary D. Robertson in Raleigh, North Carolina: “North Carolina Republican lawmakers and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper said late Wednesday that they have agreed on legislation to resolve a standoff over the state’s ‘bathroom bill’ through a replacement measure that still restricts LGBT nondiscrimination protections. GOP leaders announced the new legislation would be debated and voted on Thursday, but it was unclear whether there were enough House and Senate votes to pass it.” http://apne.ws/2ny6yr5 DREAM ON – “A Liberal Fantasy Ripped from a Hollywood Script: No, Democrats—the 25th Amendment won’t save you from Donald Trump,” by Jeff Greenfield in Politico Magazine: “The dream burns bright in countless liberal hearts and minds: President Donald Trump embraces one too many fever-swamp conspiracy theories, tweets one too many palpable falsehoods, threatens a nuclear attack on Mexico for not paying for the wall. A terrified Cabinet meets in Vice President Mike Pence’s home at the Naval Observatory, and, in a written declaration to the speaker of the House and president pro tempore of the Senate, that the president ‘is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.’ And just like that, Trump is dispatched to Trump Tower, or Mar-a-Lago, and Pence becomes acting president of the United States. Right? Yes -- assuming it’s a movie or a TV series or a Netflix or Amazon offering.” http://politi.co/2odnF4G HOLLYWOODLAND -- “$3-million real estate deal with Paul Manafort’s son-in-law goes south for Dustin Hoffman and son,” by L.A. Times’ Daniel Miller: “It is the most famous street in one of Los Angeles’ most coveted neighborhoods. High up in the hills above the Sunset Strip, Blue Jay Way is home to several A-list celebrities who enjoy panoramic views from glassy estates that can cost $10 million or more. But a property on Blue Jay Way is now at the center of legal proceedings involving actor Dustin Hoffman and Jeffrey Yohai, a real estate developer who is the son-in-law of Paul Manafort, the former chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.” http://lat.ms/2niWGQ9 -- “PwC wins reprieve for role at Oscars after award mix-up: Controls over firm’s part in ceremony process to be tightened,” by FT’s Jennifer Thompson in London: “PwC has managed to save its position overseeing the prizegiving at the Oscars ceremony, following a humiliating blunder by two employees last month that led to the wrong film being declared Best Picture. … On Wednesday the body said that it would retain the services of PwC, which has overseen Oscar voting for 83 years, but with different employees and a ban on the use of electronic devices backstage. “In a message to Academy members following a board meeting on Wednesday, president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said they had been ‘unsparing in our assessment that the mistake made by representatives of the firm was unacceptable’. Ms Boone Isaacs said: ‘From the night of the ceremony through today, PwC has taken full responsibility for the mistake. ‘After a thorough review, including an extensive presentation of revised protocols and ambitious controls, the board has decided to continue working with PwC.’ She said Tim Ryan, PwC US chairman, would now take a ‘greater oversight role’ at future ceremonies.” http://on.ft.com/2nCGRas MEDIAWATCH -- YA CAN’T MAKE IT UP -- “IJR hires Mediaite’s controversial managing editor ‘Jon Nicosia,’” by Peter Sterne: Nicosia will be “managing editor of content … He was most recently the managing editor of Mediaite. Nicosia is a colorful and controversial figure. As POLITICO first reported in 2014, his real name is Zachary Hildreth and he was convicted in 1989 of larceny and bank fraud and in 2002. Following two stints in prison, he began uploading clips from cable news shows onto YouTube and eventually caught the attention of Mediaite founder Dan Abrams. Nicosia began contributing to Mediaite in 2010 and was promoted to managing editor in 2013. ... During his time at Mediaite, he misrepresented himself to many of his colleagues, lying about his real name and background by describing himself as a trauma surgeon who worked in the Washington area.

James S. McMurray, 35, remains in Schuylkill County jail under $10,000 cash bail. He’s charged with disregarding traffic lanes, failing to use a safety belt/driver and vehicle occupant, careless driving, criminal mischief, reckless or negligence, failure to notify authorities of a change in address, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. McMurray on Tuesday waived his right to a preliminary hearing before District Judge James R. Ferrier of Orwigsburg. According to an affidavit of probable cause filed by Officer Denna V. Krammes, on Jan. 18, she responded to a crash in the 500 block of West Penn Pike (Route 309). The driver was out of the vehicle, and told her he wasn’t hurt. He said he was on his way to the Walmart in Rush Township when he hit some gravel and lost control of the Jeep. The driver, McMurray, explained that the owner of the Jeep was on vacation, and that he had permission to use it. McMurray also said he wasn’t wearing a seatbelt, and a witness said he was speeding and weaving in and out of traffic. The Jeep had to be towed. Four hours later, Krammes was contacted by a police officer in West Virginia, who said the Jeep had been reported to his department as stolen. The officer had just entered the vehicle into the NCIC database, hours after Krammes had checked to see if it was stolen. According to West Virginia police, the Jeep’s owner said McMurray had driven there with her and her husband to visit her family. During the night, McMurray got up and drove the Jeep back to Pennsylvania without permission. On the way, he stopped to steal a wheelchair from a Rite Aid drug store in West Virginia, and items from a Lehigh County Walmart. he was on his way to the Rush Township Walmart to “return” the items for cash when he crashed the Jeep. The owner is asking $2,600 restitution for the vehicle.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 30 March 2017 by Military News Amazon Shuts Down Quidsi Resulting in 263 Lay-Offs Shutterstock photo On Wednesday, Amazon AMZN announced it will be shutting down its fourth largest acquisition, Quidsi. Quidsi was acquired by Amazon in 2011 for $545 million and is the owner of Diapers.com and Soaps.com. The shutdown is due to Amazon’s inability to make Diapers.com and Soaps.com profitable. As a result, a notification sent to the New Jersey Department of Labor shows 263 employees will lose their jobs at Quidsi’s customer service operation in New Jersey. The story, however, seems to be about a bit more than profitability. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has a long running fued with Quidsi founder Marc Lore. Lore was forced to sell to Amazon during the U.S. Great Recession and has been hashing it out with Bezos ever since. Lore, today, runs all e-commerce operations for Amazon’s largest competitor, Walmart WMT . His hopes are to make Walmart the number one U.S. e-commerce site over Amazon. There’s a possibility that Amazon’s move is partially due to Mr. Bezos’ and Mr. Lore’s rivalry. Even if that’s a fun thought to have, it’s highly unlikely with Amazon’s highly data driven strategies. „We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable, and unfortunately we have not been able to do so. Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selection on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh,” said Amazon officials.

Read More NEW DELHI: Walmart Stores Inc, the world’s biggest retailer by sales, would consider opening physical outlets and selling products online if New Delhi allowed overseas supermarkets that directly sold Made-in-India products to consumers. “We are okay with selling only ‘Make in India’ products because even in our cash-andcarry stores, imported items make up for only 5% of our total products,” Krish Iyer, chief executive of Walmart India, told ET. Imports don’t make sense for supermarkets such as the Bentonville, Arkansas-based giant, as high customs duties raise prices, negating the sourcing efficiency that makes Walmart among the cheapest global retailers. Iyer said that with more than 95% local sourcing, Walmart India is already a partner in the government’s Make-in-India initiative, which seeks to establish the South Asian nation as a manufacturing hub. ET had reported last month that India plans to unshackle the grocery retailing industry for foreign companies as long as they sold goods sourced and produced locally. Two industry executives requesting anonymity said that bankers are mapping the retail industry, and making presentations to Walmart, preparing the deck for acquisitions of local entities when the government allows Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in multi-brand retail. Iyer declined to comment on the likelihood of an acquisition, but a person aware of the development said that the US behemoth would like to acquire a company locally, although compliance remains a a hindrance. Walmart currently operates 21 of its Best Price branded wholesale chain in the country. The retailing giant had bought the 50% share from Bharti Enterprises in the cash-and-carry joint venture after the alliance ended in October 2013. Analysts say that it has become imperative for Walmart to move forward with its strategy on selling directly to Indian consumers after Amazon.com in February applied to the government to invest $515 million into a venture that would sell foods online and through physical stores, becoming the first global retail titan to take advantage of the policy. “Globally, Amazon is nimblefooted and led by founder Jeff Bezos himself, while Walmart is weighed down by bureaucracy that delays decisions. But things may change now as Walmart has started to catch up in some areas,” said Harminder Sahni, founder of retail consultancy firm Wazir Advisors. Last year, India allowed 100% subsidiaries of global companies to sell food products through brick-and-mortar stores and the Web as long as the products were locally produced. The BJP government, that has otherwise opposed foreign supermarkets into India, said the policy change was aimed at creating jobs, helping farmers, and reducing India’s notorious food wastage that is blamed on the country’s antiquated supply chain. After the policy was unveiled, New Delhi had hoped that global chains such as Walmart or Tesco would welcome the foodonly retailing: However, overseas retailers were lukewarm to the proposal, suggesting that only low-margin food items do not make such businesses viable. According to a source, Walmart had asked the government to let it sell some non-food grocery items to make the proposal workable.

Shruti Srivastava Food accounts for about 70% of India’s $600 billion retail market. Photo: Mint New Delhi: Following calls from global retail giants such as Walmart Stores Inc. and Tesco Plc, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to decide by November whether India is prepared to ease strict rules on food retailers, a minister said on Tuesday. India allows 100% investment by foreign wholesalers, but if they want to access the burgeoning retail market, they can only have a 100% holding to sell food items. This forces them to overhaul their businesses instead of replicating models that have worked abroad, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, minister for food processing industries, said in an interview at her official residence in New Delhi. “Walmart, Tesco, etc. have said that they should be allowed non-food items and that’s a decision the government has to take now,” she said. “The government’s decision will come before the World Food India event being organized for November.” The government is looking at allowing global companies with a permit to sell local food items to market made-in-India non-food products such as toothpaste and towels worth about 25% of total sales, an official with the knowledge of the matter had said earlier this month. One of the reasons for current restrictions is that small traders have traditionally formed the backbone of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, though that could change following his landslide victory in state elections this month. The proposals can also help Modi’s flagship Make in India campaign to boost local manufacturing. While India attracted $324 billion foreign direct investment from 2000 through the end of 2016, the biggest share of $58 billion has gone to services and only about $14 billion has come into trading. Since coming to power in 2014, Modi has allowed more foreign direct investment and the government on Wednesday took another step toward meeting its 1 July deadline to create a common market under a single national sales tax. Nearly 45% of the average Indian household’s consumption is on food, according to World Bank data. Food accounts for about 70% of India’s $600 billion retail market, and the government is looking at tripling this over the next five years, Badal said. Global companies “are willing to adapt to Indian ways to tap the Indian market,” she said. If allowed to sell non-food items too, they will foster competition and so “companies which will have the edge are the few who will adapt to what we are allowing and come and capture the market.” Bloomberg Shruti Srivastava Topics: Foreign food retailers Foreign food foreign food retail India Walmart Tesco More From Livemint READ MORE DA case: Delhi HC dismisses Himachal CM Virbhadra Singh’s plea against CBI The poet who wasn’t Shelley Global gold prices fall on dollar strength First Published: Thu, Mar 30 2017. 10 17 AM IST Editor's Picks Hero, Honda offer discounts of up to Rs12,500 on BS-III models to beat SC ban Snapdeal misses out on funding as SoftBank feuds with Kalaari Capital, Nexus UDAN: Govt awards 128 regional routes to Air India, SpiceJet among others Latest News The poet who wasn’t Shelley Global gold prices fall on dollar strength Ayodhya-Babri Masjid case: SC dismisses Swamy’s plea for early hearing Contempt case: SC grants Calcutta HC judge Karnan 4 weeks to clear his stand ‘Naam Shabana’, Rahul Bose directed ‘Poorna’ top Bollywood releases this week Mint On Sunday When songs from rural grind mills make it online Musings from the IISc Open Day: Bringing science to the masses How to get rich like Warren Buffett Secrets from the highest-grossing restaurant in New York Letter from... a biennale Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Chris Hill (TMFWizard) Mar 29, 2017 at 10:58PM In this podcast, the Market Foolery team turns its attention to the latest controversy at YouTube as major advertisers have complained about their ads appearing next to objectionable videos. As the online advertising race between Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) intensifies, the internet giant has no choice but to address the issue quickly. To wrap up the show, the team also answers a listener question for Canadian investors before discussing the state of March Madness. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 27, 2017. Chris Hill: It's Monday, March 27th. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me in studio today, from Million Dollar Portfolio, Jason Moser; and from Stock Advisor Canada, Taylor Muckerman. Happy Monday! Jason Moser: Hey, now! Taylor Muckerman: We're doing it! Hill: We are doing it. Welcome back! You've been busy. Muckerman: Yeah, a couple weeks. You were at South by Southwest. We've been overlapping each other. Hill: There we go. It's good to have you back in the studio. Muckerman: It's good to be back. Hill: We're going to dip into the Fool mailbag. We have to start with a story that's been brewing for a little while. I'll be honest. This is a story, I saw a headline on this a week or two ago, and it registered like, huh, that's interesting, and it continues to balloon. This is the fact that a week ago, Google formally apologized for running customer's ads alongside objectionable videos. We've talked before about YouTube and how important it is in the world of search, and how it's one of the most popular places to search. And you see these stories about, if YouTube was a stand-alone company, it'd be worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $75 billion. Google makes this apology a week ago, and here we are a week later, and I guess, among other things, Jason, probably a reminder that YouTube is a really big place with lots of videos, and therefore it's hard even for the owners to monitor it. The Wall Street Journal had this big story about how Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, these mainstream brands, are still seeing their ads alongside videos with racist content, anti-Semitic, all of this stuff where the advertisers, rightfully so, say, "I don't want my ads next to that." Moser: Yeah. We're going to hit a point here, sooner or later, it's going to be like you do with your kids, they can say sorry only so many times before you're like, "I get that you're sorry. Just don't do it again. I'm not looking for sorry anymore." So, I think with Google and YouTube, this is obviously something that's a big deal. It's not something that immediately impacts their bottom line. When we talk about the bread and butter for Google's money-making machine, it's search advertising. But, there's a good percentage, close to 20% of that money, comes through advertising with third-party customers. So, when ads go next to objectionable content, of course, those parties are going to express concern, they want to know what's going on, why is this happening, and what are you going to do to make it stop? Because there is no middle ground here. It's just, flat-out, "This is unacceptable, don't let it happen anymore." This is sort of one of those things with this age of automation, as we go more toward automating everything, particularly on the consumer-facing side, I think it's really difficult to ever fall back on the old, "Well, the algorithm did it, it wasn't our fault." Because, ultimately, someone built the algorithm.  I think what Google needs to figure out here is, what is happening to make this happen, and how do they fix it? And whether it is through technology, whether it's through humanizing it a little bit more, and actually bringing on more people to add a human touch to these customer relationships, they need to do something with this before this gets out of hand. We've talked about this a lot, especially in MDP, we own shares of Alphabet, and we own shares of Facebook: We own a far larger position in Facebook, and part of the reason for that is, when you look at the direction things are headed in social, and in internet behavior, there's no question that Facebook is becoming a place, not just Facebook, but its properties, whether it's WhatsApp or Instagram or whatever properties they buy in the future, that's a place where eyeballs go to hang out for a while. Google is more utilitarian in nature, right? You need some information, you find it on Google, and you go to your next place. Facebook is catching up very quickly. They've expressed some concerns that perhaps the last decade was the Google decade, and perhaps this next decade is the Facebook decade. If that is the case, and the numbers certainly point toward that, the argument could at least be made there, Google has got to figure out something yesterday as to how to address this and fix it, because blaming it on the technology is not going to fly. Muckerman: I'm pretty confident that they're going to figure out a way to fix it. Especially when you're talking about Facebook, they had the whole issue around the election with fake news on their site. And you had a group of college kids come out and make an algorithm that was able to identify fake news on the site, and they've been able -- not using their algorithm, but, Facebook has been able to address that. I'm confident that Google will. You talk about big headlines about this, but I'm waiting for the headline to come out that says, right now, people think that less than 1% of Google's revenue is at risk because of this. It's a $90 billion revenue company, I've seen headlines that say $750 million might come off of YouTube's revenue in 2017 because of this. Bigger fraction of YouTube's revenue, but you're not just an investor in YouTube when you buy a stock in Alphabet. So, I'm still confident that they'll figure it out. And between the two of them, Facebook and Google, they're pretty much the only two that are growing in the digital ad space. So, I find it hard to believe that advertisers are going to completely move away from Google. Right now, Facebook is really the only alternative, and that space would become far too crowded too quickly if there was a mass exodus from Google. I'm fairly confident that, because you said 20% of their revenue comes from that search advertising, they're going to figure this out. Hill: It is a small amount of money, and yet, when you look at the headline of Pepsi, Starbucks, General Motors, Wal-Mart have pulled some of their ad spend with YouTube. Those are big-name companies. I think, if you're Facebook, you're not throwing a parade over this, but I think if you're selling video advertising for Facebook, you're on the phone to different media agencies, and I also think television networks. If you're a broadcast network or cable network, to use your phrase, Jason, you're putting the human touch to work, and you're calling these companies and saying, "Listen, don't take a risk with the programmatic algorithm approach to YouTube. You know what you're going to get with our networks, and you're going to get something that associates well with your brand." Muckerman: With some of those companies you mentioned, those are companies that can afford to pull back for a week or two on advertising and make a statement. That's almost advertising in itself. They're still advertising using Google's name, just not using Google's platform. So, I think they'll come back eventually. Probably not too far down the line. Those brands are brands already. You're probably looking at the smaller players, questioning whether or not they can afford to back off of Google's platform a little bit more than Coke or Pepsi. Moser: Yeah, and I think it's also worth noting, for the longest time, YouTube has been synonymous with online video. That's what got this ball rolling. And they've enjoyed such a phenomenal competitive position for so long. What an acquisition Google made for ... what did they buy it for? Hill: $1.6 billion. Muckerman: Pennies on the current dollar. Hill: And the reason I remember it was $1.6 billion is because I was one of the people saying, "Boy, they sure did pay a lot of money for that." Moser: So, I think you fast forward today and you see how this competitive environment has changed, Google and YouTube are not the only players in the online video space. And you see all sorts of companies, from Facebook and Twitter to Verizon and AT&T developing their online video offerings. To your point, I think it's very easy to see these customers pulling back for a week, a month, and saying, "Hey, let's reasses what's going on here." Google and YouTube are too big to say, "We don't want to be a part of your environment." That's just foregoing a tremendous reach that anybody in their right mind would want to be a part of. But, what it could do is, it could result in some pricing competition. It can certainly make Google have to get in there and compete a bit more on pricing, lose a bit, perhaps, of that pricing power, particularly as we ship to mobile, and we know those mobile advertisements are not nearly as lucrative as the desktops were, from a real estate perspective. But, these are smart people running a very, very big company. The solution to this really is as simple as, listen to your customers and give them what they want. So, from that perspective, I don't see any reason why they can't fix it. I guess it's going to be interesting to see how they fix it, and how quickly they go about fixing it, because they don't enjoy that same competitive position that they enjoyed, perhaps, five years ago. Hill: Our email address is marketfoolery@fool.com. From Matt Saunders in Nestleton, Ontario. "I was hoping you could explain the effects of currency exchange on stock purchases. I'm in Canada and our dollar is quite low compared to the U.S. dollar. However, it wasn't too many years ago, we peaked a little higher than the U.S. dollar. My concern is that if I buy a U.S. company at this point and the dollar rises again, will that work against the value of the U.S. company that I purchased? Or does buying on the TSX compensate for that somehow? Thanks for all your help with this. P.S. please tell Steve Broido, we just made a trip to Orlando and had a great visit to an Olive Garden there. Definitely a fan." Steve will appreciate that, I'm sure. Muckerman: Yeah. Thanks for listening all the way from Ontario. This was a question that we receive quite often in Stock Advisor Canada, Pro Canada, and now Dividend Investor Canada. We put a special report about this a couple years back. Over those couple years, not much has changed. Remain to see the Canadian dollar still trading below the U.S. dollar. I think right now, it's around $0.75 to the U.S. dollar. As you did mention earlier in the 2000s, the Canadian dollar did peak around $1.20 to the U.S. dollar. That ramp-up really did cramp Canadian investors' returns when you look at it, from investing in the U.S. dollar. When the Canadian dollar does appreciate, you lose a little bit there when you sell back into the Canadian market. So, what we generally tell our members to do is, A) we absolutely recommend investing in the U.S. market, because when you look at the Canadian market, about two-thirds of it relies on the energy, financials, and the materials sector, two very volatile sectors, in the energy and materials sector and then financials, really, the bulk of that is driven by the big banks, TD, Scotia, CIBC, BMO, and RBC. They're very highly concentrated if you don't move outside of the Canadian market. When you look at the largest sector in the U.S., IT, I think that's around almost 22% of the S&P, it's 2.7% of the S&P TSX. So, you're missing out on a lot of potential growth there. And less than 1% of the S&P TSX is healthcare. If you think about that, you're missing out on some huge potential growth there. It was a little higher, but Valeant obviously reduced the share of that overall market when that fell precipitously over the last couple years.  But, the long-term average of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar is right around $0.85. There's about 13% upside from where it is right now until it reaches the long-term average, I think we have information going back to 1971 on our site. That's over 30 to 40 years of data with the long-term average of $0.85 to the U.S. dollar. So, you're not far away from that. Compared to that $1.20 you saw in the early 2000s, we view that as a one-off event, especially with oil where it is these days, and the likelihood that remains subdued as compared to when it was over $100, which, coincidentally, timed very well with when it was peaking with the U.S. dollar there. So, we advocate people considering the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, but we don't say, "Just invest Canadian only." Put some dollars into a separate account, leave them there for the long-term so you don't have to pay the cost to exchange back and forth, because banks do charge for that. And you don't get charged if the company pays you a U.S. dollar dividend and you leave it in U.S. dollars. You don't get charged every time they deposit the dividend to your account. You only get charged if you put it back into CAD. So, if you're a long-term investor, we just say, create two accounts, one with Canadian dollars and one with U.S. dollars, and let it ride, because if you don't, you're going to miss out on tons of opportunity. TSX and TSX Venture stocks make up about 20% of the -- Hill: Toronto Stock Exchange. Muckerman: Yep. They make up about 20% of the total stocks available to you in U.S. markets. So, not only are you missing out on diversification, but you're missing out on opportunity, in terms of breadth of choices. So, don't let the currency fluctuations scare you away from it. That's our opinion. Hill: You've been to the Toronto Stock Exchange, haven't you? Muckerman: Yeah, it's pretty cool. We went there a few years ago, poked around when we were first launching Stock Advisor Canada in 2013. Been up there a couple times since, but to not the same fanfare that we went up there a few years back. Hill: Definitely a lot of fun. Fitting that I'm sitting with too proud sons of the Carolinas because, for any sports fans out there, the final four is set. We have Gonzaga, we have the University of North Carolina, we have Oregon, and we have, surprisingly, the University of South Carolina. And the potential for an all-Carolina final. Moser: Amazing. If you think about it this way, you had Clemson just win the National Championship in college football. There is still the potential, certainly, for the Gamecocks to go in there and win this thing in basketball. Which, I mean, there's no way that's ever been achieved before. Muckerman: They have to win this, because the likelihood of a potential rematch with North Carolina in the final, highly unlikely. Although, this could boost recruiting. Moser: About half of my graduating class in high school went to USC. The other half -- Hill: The other USC. Most people hear USC and they think University of Southern California. Moser: The East Coast, South Carolina. The other half went the Clemson. And I was the one lone straggler that went the opposite direction and went to a 15-person liberal arts college. Go, Wofford Terriers. Hill: Wait, isn't Wofford in North Carolina? Moser: Wofford is in South Carolina. You have Davidson that's in North Carolina. Muckerman: Steph Curry. Moser: But, wow, the finish to that game yesterday was ... Muckerman: The Carolina game? Yeah, my gosh. Moser: Yeah, it was unbelievable. I have to believe that right now, the Carolinas are figuring out a way to, perhaps, join together, erase that border. Hill: There was a story I read this morning -- and, obviously, there's so many millions of dollars involved in the NCAA basketball tournament. But one of the stories I read this morning was about the business impact in North and South Carolina. And, not surprisingly, bars and restaurants doing huge business over the weekend, and presumably will do it again next weekend. Moser: That'd be like one of those things in an earnings report where, that's one of those one-time events. So, when you're saying, "Well, we don't expect this next March, but we had a very robust beginning of 2017, thanks to ... " Hill: You're saying Jason's Barbecue and Sports Bar, in South Carolina, when it's reporting earnings in the spring of 2018, it's like, "Look, tough comp. Last year, we had the final four. We had Clemson in the football championship." Muckerman: Seriously. Clemson. USC has to catch up. Maybe think about extending Tobacco Road a little for their South. Hill: I don't know how big the concentration of Buffalo Wild Wings is in the Carolinas but I do remember -- Muckerman: There's quite a few. Hill: -- two years ago, when Tom Brady was first suspended by the NFL, and he was going to miss four games, and this was going into the fall of 2015, I do remember that on a conference call, there was an analyst who asked CEO Sally Smith, this analysts had the numbers and basically said, "Here's how many Buffalo Wild Wings locations are in New England. Tom Brady is going to miss," and he ended up appealing and not missing, but he missed the first four of this most recent season, but -- and I give credit to this analyst, he did his homework. It's just like, "Look, you have a bunch of Buffalo Wild Wings locations in New England. The star quarterback of the home team is going to miss the first four games. Are you factoring that?" Legit question. Moser: I guess my question here is, Oregon is with Under Armour, too. Hill: Wait a minute, Oregon? No, that's a Nike -- Moser: Is Oregon Nike? OK. I was just thinking, I saw something, I was looking at this headline, Oregon Signs Record-Breaking Apparel Deal With Under Armour, and -- Hill: Are you sure it's not Oregon State? Moser: No, it says Oregon. Hill: Because University of Oregon is Phil Knight's alma mater. Muckerman: Their football field is Nike sole turf. Moser: I'm aware! Let's go in and confirm this, but this is back from 2014, but Oregon signs record-breaking apparel deal with Under Armour. The deal was announced just hours after Phil Knight announced he would no longer allow Nike to be associated with Oregon, citing his frustration with a lack of national championships. Muckerman: This isn't The Onion? Moser: No, this is SB Nation. [laughs] I guess Phil Knight got sick of a bunch of losers! And he decided to bag it. If that's the case, how interesting that you would then have two representatives of Under Armour and two of Nike. Muckerman: So, Gonzaga and Carolina obviously -- Moser: Carolina is Nike, and I think Gonzaga is too. Oregon is the one I was questioning, because South Carolina is definitely Under Armour, and I think Oregon is, too. Muckerman: Michael Jordan hasn't eschewed Carolina just yet, I guess. Moser: That's pretty cool. Hill: Yes. And the University of Oregon women's team is in the regional final that's being played tonight. They're playing UConn. Muckerman: I'm so sorry for them. Moser: Right, I was going to say, why don't they just hand them the trophy? It's Connecticut, can they really ... Hill: You know what? That's what amazing Cinderella stories are made out of. Moser: At some point, everybody thought Kentucky was going to win, but Wisconsin, was it Wisconsin? Hill: Yeah, back in the day, a couple years ago. Look, if Goliath was undefeated, where's the fun in that? We need David to knock off Goliath every once in awhile. So who knows? The lady Ducks might get it done against UConn. Muckerman: Lady Ducks and the Gamecocks.  Hill: That's your lead story, by the way, if the UConn women don't end up winning the national championship. All right, Jason Moser, Taylor Muckerman thanks for being here, guys. Muckerman: Cheers! Moser: Thank you! Hill: As always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.

The changes in question would allow global retailers to sell a percentage of non-food items, said Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal. "It would be at least $10 bn initial investment if 'food plus' gets the final nod. Not just for India; we have the UAE and Japan planning on making in India and taking it to their country. Before (the) 'World Food India' (event, scheduled for September), a lot of things might just get tied up," she hopes. The ministry of food processing industries (MoFPI) hopes some of these decisions would be taken by the year-end. Badal stresses the 'food plus' component in the policy on FDI in retailing suggested by her ministry would not be a backdoor entry for multinational entities such as Walmart, Tesco or Auchan. She said global retailers would only be allowed to set up shop if they put investment in the back-end, at the 'farm gate' level which would directly benefit cultivators. "I put in a request that if besides their investment in retail, if they put some extra investment at the farmgate level, then the government might think of allowing them some small percentage of other home care products. I have made it clear that whatever investment they do at the farmgate level, some percentage of that they may be allowed to keep on other things, which also must be manufactured in India," she said. Food accounts for about 70 per cent of India's $600-bn retail market. The government is looking at tripling this over the next five years, Badal said. Major retailers had said they have an existing model which would cover items beside food, the minister explained. Only food does not manage to meet their costs. While the definition of 'food plus or non-food' and what all would be allowed in food plus has not been decided, Badal said it would mainly have home care and fast moving consumer goods, fully made in India. "First of all, we have to see whether we allow it or not. I have sent suggestions and a note to the prime minister's office. Once the PM says yes to the suggestions, further details of the plan would be charged," she said. On the percentage of non-food items to be allowed, MoFPI is playing it safe. "I have suggested that whatever investments they make in the back-end infrastructure, it should be around 20 per cent of that," added Badal. According to the ministry, not only Walmart but other global entities such as Tesco, Auchan, Harrods, Partridges and Marks & Spencer had all shown interest in setting up shop in India if 'food plus' was allowed. "I am pushing the policy (change). We have got a company like Auchan which has said that they would like to work with farmers. Our aim is that major companies tie-up with farmers," she said.   Govt plans Model Food Policy The Ministry of Food Processing Industries has come out with a Model Food Policy which it has uploaded on its website for comments. It hopes that states will adopt a final policy before the World Food Fair. For the next round of 50-odd cold storages, approval for which has been sought by various companies, Harsimrat Kaur Badal said that she would do a proper satellite mapping of food and vegetable clusters before inviting expression of interests.

Just the other day a 17-year-old girl overdosed in the parking lot of a shopping store in Bartholomew County. The Bartholomew County Sheriff’s Office is working with other agencies to do whatever they can to stop the drugs from making its way to Bartholomew County. So far this year they have seen an increase in the number of overdose calls in the county and city of Columbus. The latest overdose call for Bartholomew County happened Tuesday night in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart on State Road 46. “The actual call came in as just a 911 call and they responded to the reported 911 and when they arrived they ended up finding a young person in an OD state,” said Major Chris Lane, Bartholomew County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office said a deputy was in the area and responded to the call. He found a car running with lights on and inside a 17-year-old girl in the front seat. The sheriff’s office said the deputy used two doses of Narcan to bring the girl back. “It’s unfortunate in that it’s almost becoming routine that between, not only my agency or the sheriff’s office or the city police or the state police, we routinely are running on overdose calls,” he said. Lane is the Chief Deputy for the sheriff’s office. He said so far this year the city and county responded to 72 overdose calls and that number was 35 last year. “I’ve never seen anything like the opioid issue that we’re struggling with and again it’s not just here it’s a national problem,” he said. Lane said this problem affects everyone in the community from parents to kids. “Obviously, parents that are struggling with when they got kids that are struggling with addiction or kids that have parents that struggle with addiction,” he said. He believes there’s also a desperate need for more treatment facilities in the area. “Our community is no different than any other community. Everybody is struggling with this and everybody is struggling with a place for these folks to go,” he said. “They show up at hospitals, a lot of time hospitals have limited resources on what they could do for long-term treatment.” Lane knows change won’t happen overnight. He said building awareness is important and stopping people from moving the drugs into the community. “If somebody got an addiction they need the help but if somebody is pushing this poison I got a place for them and it’s in the jail,” he said. As for the 17-year-old girl, the sheriff’s office said she was taken to Columbus Regional Hospital. At this time, her condition is still unknown. A community forum to talk about the heroin epidemic in Columbus is happening on April 19 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. It will be held at The Commons located at 300 Washington Street in Columbus.

Billion-dollar deals, millions in tournament prizes, and a massive, enthusiastic audience explain the attention eSports has been getting from major gaming companies. Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Mar 30, 2017 at 5:15PM In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, Vincent Shen recruits Fool.com contributor Seth McNew to share the latest news from the world of eSports. Competitive gaming events are selling out arenas and awarding millions of dollars to tournament champions. Though revenue opportunities for the growing industry have yet to reach traditional sport levels, analysts estimate eSports will top $1 billion in the next year with more growth on the way. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 23, 2017. Vincent Shen: You mentioned Oculus. I want to get to virtual reality, we'll save some time for that. But eSports is what really blew me away. It's March, we're in the thick of March Madness. My team might be out as a UVA alum. But, while watching that game, I could not believe it, I saw commercials for a Street Fighter 5 championship eSport event being aired on ESPN. The first time I've seen -- maybe I don't watch enough network cable television with commercials, because I'm usually on Netflix. But I was blown away by this. It made me realize that a lot of companies point to eSports as a big opportunity, but the legitimacy there, I feel like anybody that's watching these games and sees that is like, "What is this doing on ESPN?" And now, you get an idea of how big this opportunity is. What do you think about this? Seth McNew: Yeah, certainly, seeing it on TV, there's a lot of companies that are trying to play in the space right now, not just the players we've mentioned so far, but ESPN, YouTube, recently Amazon bought Twitch, which is known for its eSports. But, what I think is interesting here is, first of all, we should just talk about what eSports is. It's electronic sports. Essentially, there's pro gamers playing against each other, usually for a cash prize. As you would imagine, there are people watching this. There is a fan base which leaves open the door for advertisements and other revenue. Shen: You brought this to me, and I think I've touched on this in a previous episode before, but some of these tournaments, the prize pools are not trivial at all. McNew: Yeah, you're talking about prize pools of tens of millions of dollars. The most recent one was over $20 million. That's incredible.  Shen: Yes. So, as you can imagine, with that kind of money on the line, you're going to start really attracting a bigger and bigger pool of people wanting to get into this in a professional manner. But the thing is, I was trying to get a sense of the scale for this, 385 million people globally in terms of audience size for eSports. Huge, right? McNew: Have you ever watch eSports, or any gaming? Shen: I have, through YouTube. I haven't seen it on television, I haven't taken that step yet. Funny enough, I have been to a live event before at the conference center here in D.C., just out of curiosity, to get a lay of the land. And it was for Pokemon. McNew: Does it feel like a sporting event, with all the fanfare? Shen: You have everybody seated. There wasn't tens of thousands of people, of course. But seeing people playing with the big screens, I saw a lot of potential. And I can imagine that going to a full event with tons of fans in an arena -- because this was more of just a conference for Pokemon -- I could see that having an energy level that people might typically associated with professional sports. 385 million globally in terms of audiences for eSports. And the thing is, this is really in its infancy, really early stages. I found an analysis that said the revenue for this market is not expected to break $1 billion until next year. So, the companies that are investing heavily in this, including Electronic Arts and Activision, they're really not making that much money on this, if any at all. But the idea is, you could attract more gamers, you could build more buzz and publicity for various titles, and ultimately, people are starting to say, 385 million viewers, some of these audiences are bigger than major professional sports leagues like the NBA, does that mean they can make more money? The issue right now is, by comparison, the NFL generated $11 billion in 2015 from ticket sales, TV rights, and sponsorships. eSports hasn't even broken that $1 billion marker. The problem is, I think, ultimately, the number of events you can have between NFL games and different franchises, the number of games played in the season, you have a lot of events generating those ticket sales, and a lot of money from those TV deals. You've heard about these billion-dollar deals signed to air football games, for example. Whether we reach that threshold, that point for eSports remains to be seen. But ultimately, it's definitely an exciting avenue. Anything else you've seen with eSports that you want to leave listeners with? McNew: That's a good point, how small it is right now comparative. But I think it's interesting that there can be new content that drives its own leagues. It might be a place where there's just as many opportunities to have these kinds of competitions, as you have different leagues that are devoted to a specific game, more games have more leagues, and also the ability to have these in house ones in any arena, you don't have to have them in an arena that's specific for gaming, you just need to have a TV there. So I think it's possible that this could grow much more regionally. Shen: OK. Something else I've also kept in mind, and people stress with eSports, is that it can change as the technology we have available to us, in terms of how we consume our media, it changes. Virtual reality, some of the first major headsets or devices for that, the hardware for that, went on sale last year. That could potentially change how we view an eSports tournament.

Scott Harper Jr., 26, was charged Thursday with theft with a prior retail theft conviction following his arrest Wednesday evening by Urbana police in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart store at 100 High Cross Road. Sgt. Harley Rutledge said store employees summoned police to look for a man who had allegedly shoplifted a four-pack of "Ultra Duster" canned air, commonly used to clean computer keyboards. Officers were given a description of the man and the car he got in. Patrol officers found Harper in his car in the parking lot just before 6 p.m. He appeared to be intoxicated, had difficulty standing, had slurred speech and was wearing pajama pants, Rutledge said. In the car, officers could see about 30 cans of compressed air in the front and back seats. After initially denying having taken the canned air, Harper told the officers he stole it to "huff" it and that he was struggling with an addiction to that practice. Champaign police also found Harper on Sunday in the parking lot of the Meijer store, 2401 N. Prospect Ave. He was found "huffing" that day and police found at least six cans of Ultra Duster in his car. He admitted he had been inhaling enough to pass out. Inhaling vapors from pressurized containers can produce a brief intense intoxicating effect. Long-term, the practice can cause brain damage. On Sunday, police gave him a notice to appear in court next month; but in the wake of his arrest Wednesday by Urbana police, the state's attorney's office filed the single felony count against Harper. Use of intoxicating compounds is a less serious misdemeanor offense. If convicted, he faces penalties ranging from probation to one to three years in prison. Court records show he has prior convictions for domestic battery, retail theft, violation of bail bond and traffic convictions.

Sundeep Khanna India’s floundering e-commerce start-ups such as Snapdeal need new and innovative ideas to enhance the shopping experience. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint Every week now, there’s news of one more e-commerce start-up finally accepting it has no future. As the irrational cost structure overlaid with a business model solely driven by deep discounts, catches up, the limitations of online shopping are being laid bare. Last week Mint reported that facing an asphyxiating funds crunch, Snapdeal, owned by Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd, was in talks with its two larger rivals Paytm E-Commerce Pvt. Ltd and Flipkart India for what would amount to a fire sale. Snapdeal’s woes are neither new nor unique. Increasingly, e-commerce’s lead companies are finding that the number of transactions and the value thereof, isn’t a good enough indicator of their own health or that of the sector.  Consequently, valuations have slumped, in some cases to a third of what they were even a year ago, indicating how much funders have lost faith in their investees as well as how the outlook on the sector has dimmed dramatically. Contrast this with the striking success of supermarket chain, Avenue Supermarts Ltd, the parent of D-Mart, which is both profitable and growing, entirely in the physical retail space. It isn’t a coincidence that at the same time as pure play e-commerce start-ups are cutting back on costs, laying off people and pulling out of Tier-II and Tier-III cities, the big daddies of brick-and-mortar retail, companies like Reliance Retail and even Walmart India, are now stepping up their investments in stores and what is called in-store experiences after a period of strategic consolidation. There’s a pattern to why start-ups like Snapdeal and ShopClues and even Flipkart are suffering. All of them set themselves up as pure online plays and nothing more. Today, without their deep discounts, they offer a customer virtually nothing else. The centuries-old offline retail system has quickly adjusted to anything else the newbies brought in. Home delivery, orders on phone, vast menu options, procuring off-the-menu items, loyalty points, various payment methods, anything the newcomers can do, they can do. In most cases now, offline retailers have a strong online presence as well and thereby allow customers the option of checking out products in the physical space while allowing them to order online.  Instead of trying to complement a well-established if unorganized retail system, the e-commerce companies focused purely on replacing it with something of their own. If they had concentrated instead on removing the hurdles for shoppers, in much the way the first malls did on their appearance (basement parking, clean washrooms, children’s play areas, places to eat, ATMs), they might have found themselves fitting better into the overall ecosystem of shopping. Most Indian online retailers are clones of their counterparts in the US and would do well to take a cue from what’s happening in the world’s most complex retail market. Data from US Census Bureau shows that in the US, Amazon-dominated non-store retailer’s category posted the fastest pace of growth in sales in February (up 13% year-on-year) even as department store sales reported continuing weakness in their results (down 5.6% year-on-year). While that’s encouraging, the fact is, two decades after Amazon kicked off online shopping, the category still accounts for less than 10% of global retail sales. While growth will continue to be robust, they will not match offline retail any time soon. According to projections by eMarketer, retail e-commerce sales will increase to $4.058 trillion in 2020, still accounting for just 14.6% of total retail spending. That shows the way forward for India’s stricken online retail start-ups. There is clear evidence based on tracking of shoppers’ navigation to show that a bulk of those who search and evaluate products and services on the web, eventually end up buying offline. Indeed, the future of retail lies in optimum combination of various channels, both offline and online, what is now called cross-channel retail.  According to Forrester Research, cross-channel retail sales will reach $1.8 trillion in the US by 2017. A 2015 Mastercard report, The Omnishopper Project, identified the physical store as the Centerpiece of the Omnishopper’s Universe. As the report said, “The omnishopper goes to physical locations for the entertainment value of shopping, superior inventory levels and social interaction.” The high street isn’t disappearing, not now, not perhaps ever. India’s floundering e-commerce start-ups need new and innovative ideas to enhance the shopping experience. But vitally they also need to ensure they are in a place where shoppers look for them, online as well as offline.  Sundeep Khanna is a consulting editor at Mint and oversees the newsroom’s corporate coverage.

After a brief struggle, the female got back into the Nissan.  A white male with dark hair was in the Nissan at the time but never exited the vehicle. The vehicle possibly had Kansas tags with the numbers 959. This case currently under investigation. There is no indication at this time that this incident has anything to do with Human Trafficking or that the public is in any immediate danger. We do ask that as always, be vigilant in parking lots and if something does not feel or look right, walk away and call the police. If anyone has any information on this case or can identify the vehicle attached to call the police department at 762-5912, Crimestoppers at 762-8477 or leave a web tip at https://www.tipsubmit.com/webtips.aspx?AgencyID=1216.

David Eulitt deulitt@kcstar.com i By Jesse Newell jnewell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story MARYVILLE, Mo. Ben McCollum isn’t finished with his Blitz burger yet — or his cheddar chips, a specialty at Carson’s Sports Grille downtown — when an old friend makes the way to his booth. It’s the third time Northwest Missouri State’s men’s basketball coach has been greeted in the last 20 minutes, and this conversation ends with the man telling McCollum he’s already paid for his lunch. McCollum admits he’s not yet accustomed to all this yet — the life of a national championship coach and changes that have taken place since Northwest Missouri’s 71-61 victory over Fairmont State (W. Va.) last week in Sioux Falls, S.D. A trip to Wal-Mart took twice as long because of the well-wishers. McCollum had 289 text messages after the game and has gotten double that in the days since … and that’s even without him checking his inboxes on Twitter and Facebook. “It’s nice,” McCollum said, “but I’m more of a low-key guy.” That hasn’t changed in the past few days. The 35-year-old McCollum pokes his head up over the booth a few times to chat with Northwest fans at the table next to him. He tells the owner of the bar, Carson, that he’s working too hard, and an hour later near his office, he greets the janitor Mark on his way down the stairs with the national championship trophy. “Do you carry that all the time?” Mark says. “I don’t want anyone to touch it,” McCollum answers with a laugh. Perhaps these moments help explain how the Bearcats were able to win their first men’s basketball championship at a school known more for its football dominance. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:15 Frank Mason's father: "Can't describe how proud I am" Pause 3:54 'The Gorsuch situation is really hard,' says McCaskill in leaked audio 1:34 A block from future tiny houses, veterans help veterans 2:21 Lyric Washington-Gaw stared death in the face 'and gave it a raspberry' 4:12 Kansas City will host the centennial celebration of U.S. entry into WWI 12:27 Surveillance video shows robbery that led to Independence officer shooting 2:50 See inside new Church of the Resurrection in Leawood 0:48 Frank Mason accepts AP Player of Year award 4:29 North Carolina doctor raps about a major public health concern that 'never gets old' 20:45 Crown Chasers: After long journey to the top, can the Royals reign again in 2017? Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Ben McCollum and Northwest Missouri State brings championship trophy to Maryville Northwest Missouri State University men's basketball coach Ben McCollum spoke about his Bearcats team winning the NCAA Division II championship Saturday in South Dakota. David Eulitt The Kansas City Star   McCollum, from all appearances, appears to embody the culture he wanted to build long ago. “There’s natural rules that are set up that aren’t ever written or spoken,” he said. “It’s just, ‘This is how you act.’ “I don’t have to tell you to say thank you to a waitress. I don’t have to tell you if you see somebody cleaning something up to help them clean it up. I don’t have to tell you to open doors for people. That’s what you do.” McCollum admits this success wouldn’t have come if not for some helpful words from his mother. He didn’t start out as a winner. McCollum, who was hired as his alma mater’s coach when he was 27, went 12-15 in 2009-10, his first season, and 10-16 in his second. He was so dejected after one loss his second year he remembers telling his mom he didn’t think he could do this anymore; he simply wasn’t a good enough coach. Mary Timko was the voice of reason. She spoke to him about his tone, telling her son he couldn’t expect his players to not get frustrated on the court if he was angry himself. “After that, I was just positive and understood my impact on their emotion and the next-play mentality,” McCollum said. “It seemed to help quite a bit.” The birth of Northwest’s two mantras came shortly after that. One was “Impose your will.” McCollum stole inspiration from the fifth century B.C. book “Art of War,” wanting his players to be proactive in all aspects of life, whether that was attacking a workout or sprint drill or responding to an official’s call. “If you don’t respond to it and move onto the next play, you’ve imposed your will on it,” McCollum said. “You’re going to act how you act regardless of what’s going on.” That served Northwest well in its final game. Because Fairmont State played a West Virginia-like havoc style — coach Jerrod Calhoun was a former assistant coach for Bob Huggins — McCollum’s main message to his team was to be the aggressor and play its tempo with physicality. The Bearcats did that, handling Fairmont State’s press while holding a double-digit lead through the majority of the game. McCollum also believes in the words “Culture wins.” He’s learned there’s one type of player he doesn’t mesh with it, and that’s someone he describes as “moody.” The coach works hard to make sure those guys don’t end up on his team. He does extra research on personalities, and it’s probably not a coincidence that 13 of the 14 players on this year’s roster came from places that are within two hours of Maryville — a town of about 12,000 tucked in the northwest corner of Missouri. McCollum also has created his own rule with recruits: He wants them to pick up his phone call, but he promises that the conversation won’t last more than four minutes. That way he can develop a relationship while also catering to the faster-paced lifestyle of millennials. The methods appear to have worked. It helped bring McCollum point guard Justin Pitts, the consensus NCAA Division II player of the year from Blue Springs South whose original offers included MidAmerica Nazarene, Graceland and a partial-scholarship tender from Northwest. Zach Schneider shot fewer than 100 three-pointers in his career at Shawnee Mission East, but made 111 of them this season alone after pledging to become the best stretch-4 he could be. Through it all, the culture began to take shape. McCollum not only had four- and five-year guys — and the hard workers he desired — but he also saw the older players setting the guidelines for the program. “You don’t really have to set rules,” McCollum said. “The culture sets the rules.” McCollum also focused on getting players to recognize how they can help the team. “Be who you are” he tells them often, which encourages both shooters and screen-setters to embrace their strengths. “It just works out,” Schneider said, “and it results in that special season that we had.” When former Northwest coach Steve Tappmeyer made the 10-hour drive to Sioux Falls to watch the Bearcats, he wasn’t surprised to see so many Northwest players taking to their roles. McCollum had done the same thing some 15 years earlier. When Tappmeyer coached McCollum at Northwest Missouri from 2001-03, he could tell the guard was destined for big things. In finance, that is. “I thought he was going to go and make money, and he came walking in said, ‘I think I want to coach,’” Tappmeyer said with a laugh. “I was kind of like, ‘Why?’” Best known for his intangibles when he was a reserve for the Beatcats, McCollum showed early coaching potential, even if the decision meant a potential hit to his future earnings. He became a graduate assistant at Northwest, where his high energy commanded respect from both players and coaches. When Tappmeyer retired in 2009, he suggested that McCollum — who had moved on to become an assistant at Emporia State — was the ideal replacement even as a 27-year-old. “I thought he had everything it took except experience,” Tappmeyer said. McCollum has gained that over the last eight seasons. Though he admits that he didn’t have enough of a coaching emphasis in his first two seasons, McCollum remedied that while winning conference titles in five of the last six seasons. A key moment came that second year after a loss against Nebraska-Omaha. When McCollum rewatched film, he became frustrated when his team allowed layups simply because it wasn’t getting back defensively. McCollum decided a personal philosophy was going to be an emphasis on areas not determined by luck. Transition defense and rebounding drills would take up a majority of the team’s practice time. Taking care of the basketball and putting up good shots on offense became main points offensively. “The only thing you really can’t control is officiating and shot-making,” McCollum said, “but we control everything else.” It all came together in the postseason this year. Northwest previously had three Sweet 16 losses, the first of which starting an unexpected chain reaction. Three years ago, Northwest Missouri faced Central Missouri in the regional championship when the Bearcats’ all-league post player Dillon Starzl went down with a torn Achilles injury four minutes in. Central Missouri won 60-59 in overtime — and followed that with three more victories to take the national championship. Shortly after that, Central Missouri coach Kim Anderson became the successor to Frank Haith at Missouri, with McCollum joking with him over the phone this week that it all wouldn’t have happened if not for a freak injury. In many ways, McCollum’s life hasn’t changed, even after a national championship. While some of the texts he receives are about recruiting, others are about his 10-year-old son Peyton’s baseball team; McCollum is one of the team’s coaches during the summer. The coach isn’t oblivious to how this past week could change things. Anderson parlayed his success into another gig, and just earlier this week, Calhoun — the coach McCollum defeated in the title game — left Fairmont State for Division I Youngstown State. “I’m not in a rush,” McCollum said of taking another position, “because I’ve got a good job.” Someday, a mid-major Division I program could be a fit. He’s still only 35, and that type of job would allow him to keep his focus on the kinds of kids he likes to coach. McCollum, who was planning to attend the Final Four in Glendale, Ariz., has always been someone driven by specific goals. When he was a graduate assistant at Northwest, he wrote down that he wanted to become a head coach or Division I assistant by the age of 27. He was hired as full-time coach at Northwest on April 11, 2009 — the day before his 28th birthday. For now, McCollum says he and his staff are trying to enjoy as much as they can. And while the goals will remain the same — establishing a culture, imposing their will — this nonetheless will be new. Maryville is just starting to celebrate its newest national champion, which means free meals and longer trips to Wal-Mart might be part of the deal for the foreseeable future. And while McCollum appreciates those who stood by the team before this season, he admits the recent response has been gratifying as well. “We’ll still welcome anybody,” he said with a smile, “who wants to jump on the bandwagon.” Jesse Newell: 816-234-4759, @jessenewell Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story College Sports Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:15 Frank Mason's father: "Can't describe how proud I am" Pause 3:54 'The Gorsuch situation is really hard,' says McCaskill in leaked audio 1:34 A block from future tiny houses, veterans help veterans 2:21 Lyric Washington-Gaw stared death in the face 'and gave it a raspberry' 4:12 Kansas City will host the centennial celebration of U.S. entry into WWI 12:27 Surveillance video shows robbery that led to Independence officer shooting 2:50 See inside new Church of the Resurrection in Leawood 0:48 Frank Mason accepts AP Player of Year award 4:29 North Carolina doctor raps about a major public health concern that 'never gets old' 20:45 Crown Chasers: After long journey to the top, can the Royals reign again in 2017?

Mar 30, 2017 Share Tweet Image via WikiCommons There was once a time when you could just go get some Oreos and your choice was simple: normal or double-stuf? That's it. Then Nabisco realized the cookie consumer wanted more options and, subsequently, went completely nuts and started throwing out whatever they (or their kids) were telling them to make. Fruit punch? Done. Root beer float? Done. Swedish fish? Done. Lots of other crazy flavors? Done. Related Limited Edition Cookies n' Cream Oreos Mean Oreo Overload Study Claims Oreos Are Basically a Drug Oreo Machine Allows Clean Division of Cream and Cookie It's up to you to decide when they jumped the shark or even if they jumped the shark. After all, we have no doubt some of these flavors are freakin' amazing. But recently things got super meta for Oreo fans when the company rolled out "Cookies & Creme Oreos," which seems like another way of saying Oreo-flavored Oreos. The limited edition cookies, which are now here, are a Wal-Mart exclusive that will feature "additional cookie flakes mixed into the creme filling," and were voted in last year over caramel apple and jelly donut. Food site Junk Banter reviewed them on Wednesday, where they pointed out the seemingly obvious. "Of course these taste good, because they taste like Oreos," they said. "It’s as if someone took Oreo crumbs and dumped them into the regular creme." Some people on Twitter also made that same observation. If we were executives we'd just counter with, "OK, so what the hell are your ideas then?": You know the world is running out of good ideas when they make Oreo flavored oreos... I mean cookies and creme oreos. — Taylor Lysenko (@taylorlysenko) March 27, 2017 only fucking cookies and cremé shit is only oreos like the fuck, there different cookies that oreos get some fucking choco chunk of sum damn — yung potato salad (@TheOriginalAct) March 13, 2017 @Oreo, cookies and creme flavored oreos are a little redundant, don't you think? — ♡ Mindy Reindeer ♡ (@MindyReininger) March 29, 2017 Cookies & Creme Oreos are just Oreo flavored Oreos and I'm just now noticing that. 🤔 — Le4che (@le4che) March 27, 2017 Cookies N creme is smashed up oreos.... and oreos has a cookies n creme flavor.... so smashed up oreos in an oreo? 😂😂😂 — Haleigh Botello (@halsss23) March 9, 2017 @MiniT46 Oreos are cookies and creme already!

So, naturally, you got to wonder whether these Wal-Mart customers are nostalgic for a return, or whether Nabisco just found an old warehouse full and said, "We got to get rid of these things, man. Think of something quick."

Blue Apron could deliver an IPO in 2017, but should it? Posted 8 hours ago by Jordan Crook (@jordanrcrook) 0 SHARES Next Story SpaceX successfully re-launches an orbital Falcon 9 rocket for the first time Advertisement Meal kit makers Blue Apron may be preparing to file for a 2017 IPO, according to Reuters. The report says that the food startup has hired bankers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup to this end. The whole thing has stirred up quite the conversation over here at TechCrunch, and we’ve been arguing amongst ourselves about the likelihood that the Blue Apron IPO happens soon, or at all. For what it’s worth, we have sources saying there is no IPO effort under way for Blue Apron yet, and Reuters’ source may have had his or her own agenda. There are three obvious possibilities here: Blue Apron is actually exploring the idea of an IPO. It’s in the early stages, but the company is exploring it nonetheless. Blue Apron and/or its bankers are floating the rumor of an IPO to attract potential acquirers. Blue Apron neither has imminent IPO plans, nor is it interested in an acquisition. Any of the above would make for a fairly standard business tactic and story. But here’s the thing: Blue Apron is at the point where it could just sit tight. The company is facing lots of competition, but it’s an early mover with great brand recognition. The range of M&A suitors one can imagine is broad and varied. While Blue Apron is not reported to be profitable — yet — it’s been investing in marketing and expanding its operations, making quite a land grab. We asked Blue Apron to confirm or correct the Reuters report earlier today and didn’t receive a response. Let’s say… Blue Apron is prepping for an IPO If this scenario turns out to be true, it wouldn’t be the first time in recent history that an unprofitable company went public with candid warnings that business investment outweighed profits. Snap said in its own IPO prospectus that it may never achieve profitability, operating at a net loss of $514.6 million in 2016. Remember, profitability isn’t the white whale it once was. Just look at Amazon. It’s also worth noting that the preparatory stages of an IPO can last a couple of years, if not longer, and that Blue Apron could be merely dipping its toes in the water to see if it’s warm. A company might go public before stabilizing margins and achieving steady profitability for several reasons. The first is that there is a valid growth strategy in place, and a story that the public market can believe in; meanwhile, the company doesn’t have to carve out more equity for private investors. Latest Crunch Report Dropbox Uploads $600 Million Credit Line | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes There’s also the possibility that investors — who’ve now provided Blue Apron with nearly $200 million — are pressuring Blue Apron to get them an “exit,” beat others to a listing and hope public market investors will be convinced into believing there’s a there there. We think this seems improbable, though. No doubt Blue Apron is tackling a difficult problem. They want to help people eat high-quality food at home in a more convenient way than they could before. And they’re doing a lot of expensive things to solve that problem — sourcing ingredients, preparing them, packaging and distributing the final product, while also creating recipes and keeping its website fresh. Blue Apron also sells wine and cookware. However, the pre-profitability requirement for any IPO-seeking company is a good growth story. And Blue Apron has also continued to grow over the years. Toward the end of 2014, Blue Apron announced it was serving up 1 million meals per month, which averages out to a $120 million revenue run rate, with meals priced around $10 a pop. By the summer of 2015, Blue Apron was operating at a $360 million run rate with 3 million meals sold each month. Around the same time, Blue Apron ate up $135 million in funding at a $2 billion valuation. In April of 2016, Blue Apron was selling 8 million meals per month. Its estimated revenue last year approached $1 billion, according to an analyst’s note viewed by TechCrunch. And there’s the added point that Blue Apron struck up a deal with Bill Niman to buy BN Ranch and supply the company with pastured beef, pork, turkey and chicken. The stage seems to be set rather nicely for the company to eventually go public. Blue Apron is courting suitors I’m not saying that Blue Apron’s IPO rumor is merely bait for potential acquirers, but let’s not rule out the possibility that it might intrigue a suitor. There are a number of obvious candidates: Costco, Whole Foods, Sysco Food Services, Amazon, Walmart or maybe even a food and beverage producer like a Unilever or PepsiCo. And I’m sure there are a few more “outside-the-box” firms also in the running. Some are less likely than others. While Whole Foods made a bold investment in Instacart, signaling a willingness to bet on the food-tech startups, it also has been struggling of late to merely hold on to customers. It may have more important fish to fry right now. Crunchbase Blue Apron Founded 2012 Overview Blue Apron is a New York-based start-up that is changing the way people cook at home.

But they’re retailers at heart, and may want to keep their platforms open to selling a range of meal kit, or boxed meal products. Then there’s Unilever, flying high from a seemingly successful acquisition of Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion in 2016. Unilever paid five times the amount of revenue Dollar Shave Club was bringing in, emphasizing the fact that the company values at a high level both a brand’s relationship to its customers and the subscription commerce model. A massive acquisition is possible, but an IPO rumor might fire up some fear of missing out among potential buyers, and hasten this kind of deal. The price tag, however, for Blue Apron, has to be pretty high. Blue Apron has no imminent plans to IPO There’s a possibility that this is the earliest stage of exploration and that this IPO is potentially years away. For one, sources tell TechCrunch that there is no movement on either the IPO front or the M&A front for Blue Apron. Secondly, Blue Apron still has to prove it can scale sustainably and find its way to healthy margins. E-commerce, at the moment, represents a small but growing portion of overall grocery sales. Meal kit companies, and there are many, are planning to rise on those tides for some time. Alongside Blue Apron, competitors include Plated, Hello Fresh, Sun Basket, Purple Carrot, Home Chef, Green Chef, FreshDirect’s Food Kick service and scores of others, including lots of regional and specialty players. Why give away your playbook to competitors, and the public, when you’re one of the leading brands in the U.S. market? That’s what it would take to go public. And it’s one reason we don’t think Blue Apron is there quite yet.

Jake Files speaks to the House Revenue and Taxation Committee in Little Rock, Ark., on Thursday, March 30, 2017, about his proposal to force online retailers to collect Arkansas sales taxes. The committee revived Files' proposal and sent it to the House, two days after a lawmaker behind the bill said it was dead for this year's session. (Photo: Andrew DeMillo / AP) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Little Rock, Ark. — A House committee revived a proposal Thursday forcing online retailers to collect Arkansas sales taxes, just two days after a lawmaker behind the bill declared it dead for this year’s session. The measure advanced by the House Revenue and Taxation Committee requires companies without a physical presence in Arkansas that make more than $100,000 in annual sales or at least 200 transactions in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on those purchases. Amazon this month began collecting Arkansas sales taxes on purchases made by state residents. The e-commerce giant recently announced it would begin collecting in every state that charges sales tax. Supporters of the measure say it’s needed to ensure other online retailers also collect the tax. “This gives us an opportunity, as you all know, to level the playing field for our mom and pop businesses and to continue to do what’s right by the people of Arkansas and not reward out-of-state sellers,” Republican Sen. Jake Files told the committee before the vote. The Senate measure, backed by Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, would require retailers that don’t collect and remit the tax to send information about purchases made by Arkansas residents to the state. The proposal is expected to go before the House on Friday and faces an uphill fight to win final approval before the majority-Republican Legislature wraps up its session early next week. If the House approves the measure, it still faces one more vote in the Senate before going to the governor’s desk. The proposal had failed three times previously before the panel, facing resistance from conservatives who called the move a new tax and Democrats who wanted the revenue directed to specific needs. A House sponsor of the bill on Tuesday told reporters he didn’t expect the bill to come up for another vote. The committee rejected a proposal from Democrats to direct $100 million of the expected revenue toward highways. The rejected amendment also called for directing some of the money toward other needs, such as pre-kindergarten. State finance officials have not estimated how much additional revenue the state would see if the measure is enacted. The top Democrat in the House said he expected the legislation to get bipartisan support in the chamber, but said he was still undecided on whether to back the bill. House Minority Leader Michael John Gray said he was concerned the measure would hit lower-income people disproportionately. “There are many outside this Capitol building who see this as a new tax,” he said after the vote. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon had relied on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company had shifted in recent months. The Arkansas bill, modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, is aimed partly at getting the high court to reconsider that 1992 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to a Colorado law requiring online sellers to notify customers about how much they owe in taxes.

Motley Fool Staff (the_motley_fool) Mar 30, 2017 at 3:10PM In this segment from Industry Focus: Consumer Goods, the cast discusses Nintendo (NASDAQOTH:NTDOY), which has plenty to celebrate this month as the release of its newest console -- the Switch -- has been greeted with sold out shelves and excellent reviews. Will the company be able to recreate the success of its original Wii? Tune in to learn more. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 23, 2017. Vincent Shen: On the console side, there's been a lot of news -- now we're diving a little into things that might be driving the industry. I saw some rumors around new console generations. Since the last big release of the Xbox and PlayStation, around 2013, approaching that time when we usually get a refresh. But I want to talk first about something that is out now, which is the Switch from Nintendo. This latest device so far, from what I've heard from some friends and also for the inability for people to find these in stores because they're selling out so quickly, it's doing quite well. Keep in mind that Nintendo, right now, is in a position where they really want the Switch to succeed, especially after the struggle they had with the Wii U. To give you some perspective, the Wii U only sold about 13.5 million units in its entire four years on the market. A strong year for a more popular console like the PlayStation, that might be one year or 1.5 years of sales for them. So, in terms of lifetime volume, that's quite low. And compared to the original Wii -- even my wife, who is not a video gamer at all, she has one -- it was the kind of console that really brought in a lot of new gamers, or people who hadn't played video games since they were much younger. The original Wii sold 17 million units in its first calendar year. Eventually, it topped 100 million units in its lifetime. PlayStation 4 right now has an installed base of around 50 million. The numbers that Nintendo is hoping to put up for the Switch, management expects it to move about 2 million units by the end of March, some estimates say that 1.5 million units were sold in just the first week of its release. Have you followed this at all? Seen any demonstrations of it? What do you think, in terms of how this can drive competition with the other major consoles? Seth McNew: Yeah, at the beginning, you couldn't find a Switch in any stores, they were sold out right away. I wasn't quite sure, maybe that created some scarcity there, they were trying to drive up some of the interest. But so far, it seems like it has been selling really well, so maybe it's just beating their own expectations there. Shen: A report recently -- I forgot to add this -- from The Wall Street Journal said that management planned to double its production. For the fiscal year ending March 2018, their production would jump from 8 million to 16 million, indicating potential first year sales of over 10 million units. This is outperforming a lot of analyst estimates. I think initially, for that first year of the release of this device, some analysts were putting total sales at just in the 4 to 5 million range. So, really blowing that out of the water. From what I've seen, the only thing that is holding this back from hitting that threshold and taking off and being a huge success for the company is titles. This is where, I think, the more well-known PlayStation and Xbox have that advantage. Right now, with the Switch, the only game that I know of that's really drawing in people, it's called Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. The reviews for this are fantastic. I think the Switch console actually sells with this game to 90% of customers. McNew: Yeah. This was the game that they really marketed as they were talking about the device, this is the one they were saying was going to be the big game. Shen: So, right now, otherwise, from Nintendo, a lot of their other major releases, in terms of those most famous franchise characters they have, which, people have pushed them in the past to move away from producing consoles and just try to monetize their very rich library of IP. But, they're not expected to release more games for Mario, for example, until later in the year, hitting the holiday season a little bit better, and also just trying to give a little bit of runway so they can slowly build up steam. But, I'm interested to see if that holds them back at all, because even the best game, if you have only one title to really hold on to people at first, we'll have to see how their momentum builds over time. McNew: Of course. And they do have a really rich library, like you were saying. But I think there's also the risk -- I mean, look at Super Mario Run that they released for mobile earlier this year or last year, it didn't perform nearly as well as they thought it would. So, I think there is that risk, you can't just say just because those are iconic names that the games themselves will perform well. But I hope they do, because I think this could be a really interesting change to the gaming industry. Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Many commentators have noted that the next item on the legislative agenda — rewriting and reforming the tax code — might be just as hard as repealing the ACA, but this depends on just what we mean by “tax reform.” Revenue-neutral tax reform that permanently changes rates and the tax base is not going to happen. Instead, we are much more likely to get a deficit-financed, regressive tax cut that will likely expire in 10 years, much like the 2001–03 Bush tax cuts did. Before explaining why revenue-neutral reform is likely to fail, I want to be clear that not too many tears should be shed over its future demise. If it’s going to be useful, tax reform should raise more revenue. And yet, as unneeded as revenue-neutral reform is, what we’re likely to get will be worse — deficit-financed tax cuts for the rich that will just exacerbate inequality. Why will revenue-neutral, permanent reform fail? First, to get around the 60-vote threshold for a filibuster, congressional Republicans are planning on using the “budget reconciliation” process. But there’s a catch — for a reconciliation bill to make it through the Senate and become permanent, it can’t increase the deficit any year outside the 10-year budget window. So they’ll have to pay for any tax cuts. And so far, their proposed pay-fors are clear political quagmires. For example, the Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that the House GOP “Better Way” tax plan would increase the debt by $3.6 trillion over the second decade following its passage. Astoundingly, 99.6 percent of its benefits will go to the top 1 percent by 2025. How will they pay for this under reconciliation? One previously anticipated offset is already gone — spending cuts embedded in the proposed ACA repeal. Maybe congressional Republicans can just resuscitate huge Medicaid spending cuts to finance high-end tax cuts, but last week’s ACA repeal debacle should not raise their hopes that this is a winning strategy. Additionally, the TPC score of how much the GOP plan adds to the deficit is kept low by revenue from the “destination-based cash-flow tax (DBCFT)"; sometimes called the “border adjustment tax”(BAT). This is problematic on two fronts. First, it’s unpopular. Exporters love the DBCFT because it gives them rebates, but importers hate it because it taxes imports. When Wal-Mart hates your Republican tax plan, it is pretty hobbled. Wal-Mart’s home-state senator, Sen. Tom CottonTom CottonFractured GOP may revert back to Bush-era tax cuts for the rich Meet President Trump’s Ms. Fix-It Cotton: House 'moved a bit too fast' on healthcare MORE (R-Ark.), described it by saying, “Some ideas are so stupid, only an intellectual could believe them.” The second problem for the DBCFT is that, because imports are taxed but exports are given rebates, it only raises money so long as the United States continues to run large trade deficits. Are official tax scorers willing to make this blanket assumption for the next two decades? That’s far from obvious. The TPC score of the Republican plan also includes substantial revenue raised from closing special interest loopholes in the tax code. As always, this is easier said than done. For example, the TPC score assumes that the itemized deduction for state and local taxes paid will be done away with. We’ll see if they keep this in the face of voters’ howls. So, the GOP plan for revenue-neutral, permanent reform was already starting about $3.5 trillion in the hole before the ACA spending cuts melted away. The DBCFT offset has already sparked a savage pushback, and the remaining pay-fors include zeroing out very popular itemized deductions. This sounds very hard, and there’s a much easier path. They can follow the lead of the Bush tax cuts, and just say that the tax cuts will disappear after 10 years. Remember, they can increase the deficit as much as they want within the 10-year budget window, just not outside of it. If the real plan is just to permanently reduce taxes paid by high-income households, this is awfully tempting — the vast majority of the Bush tax cuts actually never went away. At the end of the day, budget math makes it unlikely that Republicans will be able to engineer permanent, revenue-neutral reform. Instead, the bill that seems most likely to gain enough support from a fractured Republican caucus is just a dusted-off, deficit-financed tax cut for the rich that “sunsets” in 10 years. At least this will prove whether congressional Republicans really care about lowering deficits, or just care about giving tax cuts to the rich.   Hunter Blair joined is a budget analyst for Economic Policy Institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank created to include the needs of low- and middle-income workers in economic policy discussions.

Online tax effort revived at last minute in Arkansas World by Andrew Demillo, The Associated Press Posted Mar 30, 2017 1:10 pm MDT Last Updated Mar 30, 2017 at 4:00 pm MDT LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A House committee revived a proposal Thursday forcing online retailers to collect Arkansas sales taxes, just two days after a lawmaker behind the bill declared it dead for this year’s session. The measure advanced by the House Revenue and Taxation Committee requires companies without a physical presence in Arkansas that make more than $100,000 in annual sales or at least 200 transactions in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on those purchases. Amazon this month began collecting Arkansas sales taxes on purchases made by state residents. The e-commerce giant recently announced it would begin collecting in every state that charges sales tax. Supporters of the measure say it’s needed to ensure other online retailers also collect the tax. “This gives us an opportunity, as you all know, to level the playing field for our mom and pop businesses and to continue to do what’s right by the people of Arkansas and not reward out-of-state sellers,” Republican Sen. Jake Files told the committee before the vote. The Senate measure, backed by Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, would require retailers that don’t collect and remit the tax to send information about purchases made by Arkansas residents to the state. The proposal is expected to go before the House on Friday and faces an uphill fight to win final approval before the majority-Republican Legislature wraps up its session early next week. If the House approves the measure, it still faces one more vote in the Senate before going to the governor’s desk. The proposal had failed three times previously before the panel, facing resistance from conservatives who called the move a new tax and Democrats who wanted the revenue directed to specific needs. A House sponsor of the bill on Tuesday told reporters he didn’t expect the bill to come up for another vote. The committee rejected a proposal from Democrats to direct $100 million of the expected revenue toward highways. The rejected amendment also called for directing some of the money toward other needs, such as pre-kindergarten. State finance officials have not estimated how much additional revenue the state would see if the measure is enacted. The top Democrat in the House said he expected the legislation to get bipartisan support in the chamber, but said he was still undecided on whether to back the bill. House Minority Leader Michael John Gray said he was concerned the measure would hit lower-income people disproportionately. “There are many outside this Capitol building who see this as a new tax,” he said after the vote. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon had relied on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company had shifted in recent months. The Arkansas bill, modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, is aimed partly at getting the high court to reconsider that 1992 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to a Colorado law requiring online sellers to notify customers about how much they owe in taxes. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Movie Trailers March 31, 2017 to April 6, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Weekend Listings: Beauty and the Beast (PG) 3D 10:00pm 12:00pm / 3:00pm / 3:45pm / 6:15pm / 7:00pm / 9:15pm Kong: Skull Island (PG) 10:30pm Goon: Last of the Enforcers (14A) 3:30pm / 6:45pm / 9:45pm Get Out (14A) 4:00pm / 7:15pm / 10:15pm Logan (18A) 3:15pm / 6:30pm / 9:30pm 660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL Sweep away your carts and cars: Street cleaning begins Monday Mar 30, 2017, 6:49 PM Former ‘Top Model’ contestant among Houston shooting victims Mar 30, 2017, 5:53 PM 2nd turkey in 2 days flies into windshield in Indiana Mar 30, 2017, 5:36 PM Florida man gets year in jail for burning girlfriend’s bunny Mar 30, 2017, 5:36 PM PUBLISHERS WEEKLY Bestsellers Mar 30, 2017, 5:08 PM Alberta RCMP officer charged with sexual assault, breach of trust Mar 30, 2017, 5:06 PM Alberta RCMP officer charged with 2 counts of sexual assault, breach of trust Mar 30, 2017, 3:02 PM The Thursday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories Mar 30, 2017, 2:42 PM Nova Scotia premier says miniseries about Canada must be corrected Mar 30, 2017, 1:52 PM Did Brad Wall break trade deals by inviting a Calgary company to Saskatchewan?

Google and Facebook have built huge businesses by promising that online ads are more effective and easily measured than traditional media, such as television, radio and print. This year the amount spent on internet advertising, globally and in America, is forecast to surpass television advertising for the first time (see chart). But a controversy at YouTube, an online-video site owned by Google, shows how digital advertising still has problems to sort out before it lives up to the dazzling sales pitch. A slew of advertisers, including stalwarts such as Coca-Cola, Walmart and General Motors, have announced plans to suspend usage of, or move ad spending away from, YouTube because ads (in some cases their own) were appearing alongside offensive content, including videos by jihadist and neo-Nazi groups. Google’s own brand has suffered: the damage to the firm’s sales could be as much as $1bn in 2017, or around 1% of its gross advertising revenue. Shares of its parent company, Alphabet, have fallen by around 3% owing to the controversy.

In 2013 Nissan drew headlines when it placed an ad alongside a video of a beheading on the website Forbez DVD. There have been other incidents. But never before have so many advertisers raised concerns about what they call brand “safety” all at once and staged such a dramatic boycott. The timing may not be coincidental. Television networks are gearing up for negotiations with advertisers as part of America’s “upfronts”, in which brands commit around 70% of their TV-ad budgets for the year. It is in their interest to encourage big brands to look critically at digital advertising, which has been trouncing nearly all the other categories. The furore over extreme content escalated after the Times, a London-based newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose empire also contains many television properties, ran a story in mid-March with the headline, “YouTube hate preachers share screens with household names”. Advertisers may also be hoping to negotiate better pricing on their future internet-ad buys by taking a strong stand on this issue, says Mike Henry of OpenSlate, which helps brands place ads on YouTube. Few can now do without ads that are bought “programmatically”, meaning in an automated fashion using algorithms. The technique allows brands to follow internet-goers wherever they spend time and direct ads specifically at them. “What’s strange is that everyone was so fascinated with targeting ads that they forgot to ask themselves the mundane question of what content they are appearing next to,” says Rich Raddon of Zefr, an ad-tech firm. In other ways, too, digital advertising is falling short. In September Facebook admitted that it had inflated the reported time consumers spent watching video advertisements, and since then has acknowledged further measurement snafus. All these issues have invited censure, including from Marc Pritchard, whose role as marketing chief of the consumer-goods giant Procter & Gamble makes him one of the overlords of advertising. “Surely if we can invent technology for driverless cars and virtual reality we can find a way to track and verify media accurately,” he said. Although advertisers may be frustrated with YouTube’s poor oversight of where ads appear, there is a limited supply of high-quality online video. YouTube is like a restaurant in a small town: the service may be slow and the quality of food unpredictable, but there are few alternatives, so the clientele sticks around. Today Google and Facebook control around three-fifths of spending on digital ads in America, and their share is only expected to rise. Google and Facebook might consider making concessions to advertisers. At the moment Google does not allow third parties, such as the firm Integral Ad Science, to filter or block inappropriate content on behalf of advertisers, even though these independent firms have the technological tools to do so. That could change if advertisers continue to exert pressure. Advertisers can monitor ad placement, too. There are tools for this: on YouTube and elsewhere on the internet, firms can select keywords so that they stay away from certain contexts. Banks can avoid videos and articles that mention foreclosure, for example, and carmakers can choose not to bid on ad space near articles about crashes. But only about 15% of advertisers are using this sort of tool, reckons Scott Knoll, the chief executive of Integral Ad Science. In the future more will probably turn to such solutions, and also pay for outside measurement to check if their ads are being seen. Technology has brought headaches for advertisers, but that won’t prevent them investing in more of it. twitter icon facebook icon linkedin icon mail icon print icon View comments Reuse this content Editors’ picks The White HouseThe Trump presidency is in a hole And that is bad for America—and the world Leaders A tale of two scarvesAustralia’s stalled treaty with China highlights its dilemmaAsia A race against timeThe two-year countdown to Brexit has begunBritain The Economist explainsThe link between video games and unemploymentThe Economist explains You are seeing the beta version of Economist.com Leave feedback Need assistance with your subscription?

That wasn't the case at the Osage Beach Walmart Sunday. A boxer dog sitting in the driver's seat of an SUV put its paw on the sensitive part of the steering wheel, and this was the result. Shoppers said the noise lasted a good five minutes. Tarah Kenney of Osage Beach recorded the event on her phone but never got to speak to the dog's owner. The dog, however, has become quite well- known. The video had more than 10,000 views and close to 600 shares on Facebook. Kenney said even after the thousands of views online, she has yet to find the owner. close Trending 1   Sheriff's office: 8 arrested after deputies raid Madison County 'flop house' 2   Watch out for the 'one ring' wireless phone scam 3   The Latest: 'Bathroom law' passes General Assembly, heads to Governor Cooper 4   Woman learns of identity theft when doctor tells her she's pregnant 5   Top local stories we are following today DON'T MISS OUT Stay Connected with WLOS Like Follow © 2016 Sinclair Broadcast Group TermsPrivacyFCC InfoEEO News In Pictures Sheriff's office: 8 arrested after deputies raid Madison County 'flop house' Man finds bear cub while hiking, takes it to wildlife center 911 call details woman's abuse, escape from kidnapper Front of Asheville's BB&T building being stripped LOADING ShareTweet × Trending 1 Sheriff's office: 8 arrested after deputies raid Madison County 'flop house' 2 Watch out for the 'one ring' wireless phone scam 3 The Latest: 'Bathroom law' passes General Assembly, heads to Governor Cooper 4 Woman learns of identity theft when doctor tells her she's pregnant 5 Top local stories we are following today 6 Asheville Police ask for help finding woman who's been missing 3 years 7 Republican lawmakers say they have a deal to repeal HB2 8 911 call details woman's abuse, escape from kidnapper 9 Major US utility sues insurers over coal ash cleanup costs 10 NC ‘brunch bill’ could mean earlier drinking hours on Sundays

Top Retailers>Kroger Kroger trims new-store plans by 35% Parallels widespread slowdown in development as retailers invest in remodels, digital Mark Hamstra 1 | Mar 30, 2017 Kroger Co. plans a 35% reduction in new-store development, store expansions and relocations in 2017, with 55 projects planned, versus 85 in 2016, according to its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. The filing confirmed the Cincinnati-based company’s previous projections that it would trim capital expenditures by up to about 13%, to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, compared with $3.7 billion in 2016. The company previously had said it would slow new-store development in 2017, but had not disclosed more specific plans. The company said in the 10-K filing that it expects square footage to increase by 1.8% in 2017, compared with 3.4% in 2016. In addition to the 55 planned new stores, expansions and relocations, the cap-ex plans would also include about 175 major remodels, plus investments in digital, technology and other areas. “Capital expenditures in 2017 will be focused on sales-generating initiatives, remodels, upgrades to our logistics network and merchandising systems and digital and technology initiatives,” Michael Schlotman, EVP and CFO, said in a recent earnings conference call. The cutback in new-store development parallels slowdowns in new-store development among other major players across the industry, including at Walmart Stores and Whole Foods Market, as many observers see the industry as being over-stored. Whole Foods, which spent $716 million on capital expenditures in fiscal 2016, or 4.5% of sales, said it would spend about 4% of sales on cap-ex in fiscal 2017, as it continues to slow down its new-store development. In 2016, Whole Foods opened 25 new stores and relocated three, versus 32 new stores and six relocations in 2015. The Austin, Texas-based company said it had opened 11 new stores in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and relocated two stores in Philadelphia and Winter Park, Fla., where the replacement stores are nearly twice the size of their predecessors. Three more relocations are planned for 2017, the company said. Walmart, meanwhile, last October detailed its plans to scale back its capital expenditures and new-store openings. The company projected capital expenditures in the U.S. (excluding Sam’s Club) of $6.1 billion in the current fiscal year (fiscal 2018), versus $6.4 billion in fiscal 2017, which ended in January, and $6.8 billion in fiscal 2016. Walmart’s expenditures reflect a sharp decline in new U.S. supercenters — 35 in the current fiscal year, versus 60 last year and 69 in the preceding year, and an even steeper decline in small-format stores, with 20 planned in the current fiscal year, versus 70 last year and 161 in fiscal 2016. Sprouts Farmers Market, one of the fastest-growing food retailers in recent years, is also moderating its store-opening pace in 2017 and beyond. The company opened 36 new stores in fiscal 2016, and has 32 new stores planned for 2017. Sprouts said it expects to open about 30 new stores per year going forward. The Phoenix-based company projected cap-ex spending at $155 million to $165 million in 2017, compared with $180.8 million last year. One company that is bucking the cap-ex cutback trend is Lakeland, Fla.-based Publix Super Markets, which is projecting $1.85 billion in cap-ex in 2017, versus $1.44 billion in 2016. Spending last year by the relatively fast-growing retailer included the construction of 32 new supermarkets — including seven replacement stores — and 156 remodels. Jose Tamez, managing general partner at Austin-Michael Executive Search, Golden, Colo., said the slowdown in new-store development will force many retailers to rethink their organizational charts, and is likely a force behind some recent staff cutbacks at large retail chains. “It ends up affecting how companies define themselves and position themselves for the future,” he told SN, citing the increased focus on e-commerce and the in-store experience. “When they reformulate their strategy, they look at the organizational chart, and they say, ‘Does our organizational chart look like this strategy?’” TAGS: Walmart Retail & Financial Store Design & Construction 0 comments Hide comments Comment * More information about text formats Text format CommentsPlain text Comments Allowed HTML tags: <em> <strong> <blockquote> <br> <p> Plain text No HTML tags allowed.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Andrew Demillo, The Associated Press on March 30, 2017. LITTLE ROCK, Ark. – A House committee revived a proposal Thursday forcing online retailers to collect Arkansas sales taxes, just two days after a lawmaker behind the bill declared it dead for this year’s session. The measure advanced by the House Revenue and Taxation Committee requires companies without a physical presence in Arkansas that make more than $100,000 in annual sales or at least 200 transactions in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on those purchases. Amazon this month began collecting Arkansas sales taxes on purchases made by state residents. The e-commerce giant recently announced it would begin collecting in every state that charges sales tax. Supporters of the measure say it’s needed to ensure other online retailers also collect the tax. “This gives us an opportunity, as you all know, to level the playing field for our mom and pop businesses and to continue to do what’s right by the people of Arkansas and not reward out-of-state sellers,” Republican Sen. Jake Files told the committee before the vote. The Senate measure, backed by Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, would require retailers that don’t collect and remit the tax to send information about purchases made by Arkansas residents to the state. The proposal is expected to go before the House on Friday and faces an uphill fight to win final approval before the majority-Republican Legislature wraps up its session early next week. If the House approves the measure, it still faces one more vote in the Senate before going to the governor’s desk. The proposal had failed three times previously before the panel, facing resistance from conservatives who called the move a new tax and Democrats who wanted the revenue directed to specific needs. A House sponsor of the bill on Tuesday told reporters he didn’t expect the bill to come up for another vote. The committee rejected a proposal from Democrats to direct $100 million of the expected revenue toward highways. The rejected amendment also called for directing some of the money toward other needs, such as pre-kindergarten. State finance officials have not estimated how much additional revenue the state would see if the measure is enacted. The top Democrat in the House said he expected the legislation to get bipartisan support in the chamber, but said he was still undecided on whether to back the bill. House Minority Leader Michael John Gray said he was concerned the measure would hit lower-income people disproportionately. “There are many outside this Capitol building who see this as a new tax,” he said after the vote. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon had relied on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company had shifted in recent months. The Arkansas bill, modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, is aimed partly at getting the high court to reconsider that 1992 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to a Colorado law requiring online sellers to notify customers about how much they owe in taxes. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/ademillo 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    At a conference last week, Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos climbed into the control cockpit of a giant, 14-foot-tall robot and moved its arms menacingly, waving them back and forth. According to a 3/20 CNN article, he quipped: “Why do I feel so much like Sigourney Weaver?,” referring to the epic scene in “Alien” when she wore an exoskeleton to battle and beat the alien. In the business world, Bezos has no need for such armor, but his competitors must identify with the alien and feel the creature’s pain. Started in 1994 as a book retailer, Amazon now sells just about everything you can imagine at prices that make it a fierce competitor. It offers furniture for the living room, cookware for the kitchen, and tools for the garage. It hawks arts and crafts, food, electronics, toys, sporting equipment, and towels. Amazon created the Kindle, has us talking to Alexa, and became a web-hosting powerhouse. Bezos even attended the Academy Awards because Amazon Studios distributed “Manchester by the Sea,” which won two Oscars. Amazon is killing lots of businesses. In the process, it may also be killing inflation. In the early 1980s, Paul Volcker seriously wounded inflation with killer interest rates (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This monster has struggled to raise its ugly head only to be subsequently whacked back down by deregulation that started under President Jimmy Carter and continued under President Ronald Reagan. Then came the end of the Cold War in 1989, unleashing globalization, which increased global competition. Walmart’s “everyday low prices” reflected the disinflationary impact of the retailer—which became a publicly traded company in 1970—distributing cheap imported goods in the US. Then the “China price” continued to put downward pressure on inflation after the country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Now Amazon has turned into the price killer in retailing and increasingly in other businesses. As the world’s largest retailer and the sixth-largest publicly traded company, Amazon has single-handedly disrupted the retailing industry, the tech industry, and the entertainment industry. It employs 341,400 people, but it has caused competitors to close their stores and lay off countless employees. The company arguably has done as much as the Chinese to kill jobs and keep a lid on inflation by enabling fast and easy price discovery for anyone with a cell phone. I’ve asked Jackie to look at the impact Bezos and Amazon have had on us mere mortals so far. Here is what she found: (1) Retail’s category killer. Last year, Amazon sold $94.7 billion worth of products around the world, and it continues to expand its offerings. One area of growth is private-label brands for men’s, women’s and children’s clothing, according to a 3/27 Business Insider article. It cites a Cowen & Co. research report that estimates Amazon will become the biggest apparel seller this year. “The company’s clothing and accessory sales are expected to grow nearly 30%, to $28 billion. Macy’s apparel sales, by comparison, are expected to drop 4%, to $22 billion, in the period,” the article states. Amazon is also experimenting with a small-format, bricks-and-mortar grocery store, Amazon Go. Consumers would use their phones to pay, eliminating cashiers and checkout lines. The rollout of Amazon Go has been pushed back due to technological hitches the company is addressing, but it envisions opening roughly 2,000 stores if the format is ultimately successful. The company also announced earlier this week that it’s launching a grocery store that offers curb-side pickup, dubbed “AmazonFresh Pickup,” according to a 3/28 WSJ article. Watch out, Walmart! The online retailer’s impact on the bricks-and-mortar set is hard to overstate. A 3/15 MarketWatch article looked at retailers that fell into the GAFO category, General Merchandise Apparel and Accessories, Furniture, and other stores. Sales at GAFO retailers have “stalled, falling $1.8 billion (or 0.6%) in the past year. … Meanwhile, online sales jumped by $13.7 billion through the third quarter of 2016, with Amazon accounting for most of that,” the article reported. The US Census Bureau reports that online shopping rose to a record $521 billion (saar) during January (Fig. 3). Debbie calculates that it now accounts for a record 29.1% of total online and in-store GAFO sales (Fig. 4). Sales at general merchandise stores were relatively flat as a percentage of GAFO from 1992 through 2008 at around 43%, while the percentage at warehouse clubs and super stores (which are included in general merchandise stores) rose from about 7% to 27% over that same period (Fig. 5). Since 2009, the percentages of the former and the latter are down to 37.8% and 25.2%, respectively. Some retailers have been laying off workers, but overall headcount has grown. “While sales fell 0.6% in 2016, employment at GAFO stores increased by 1.6%, or about 95,000,” according to the MarketWatch article cited above. That implies more layoffs are needed, the article states. Amazon may absorb some of those laid-off employees. Earlier this year, it announced plans to hire more than 100,000 people in the US over the next 18 months. But the MarketWatch article contends that Amazon needs about half as many workers to sell $100 worth of merchandise as Macy’s does. Amazon has automated much of the work done in its warehouses, it hopes to eliminate grocery store cashiers at Amazon Go, and it’s working on using drones to deliver packages, endangering the local delivery guy. The monthly employment report shows that 15.9 million workers are employed in retail trade (Fig. 6). There are 6.2 million people working in GAFO stores, 3.4 million workers in grocery stores, and another 700,000 or so working at pharmacies and drug stores. That might still be less than the 12 million folks employed by manufacturers, but the numbers are large enough that President Trump might want to start paying attention. If nothing else, he should think long and hard about introducing a border adjustment tax at a time when the industry is already under intense financial pressure due to the competition from Amazon. (2) Dearly departed and walking dead. All manner of retailers have gone bust during Amazon’s expansion over the last two decades. Granted, some retailers accelerated their demise by taking on too much debt, and others were felled by the drop in demand during the Great Recession. But the competition from Amazon shouldn’t be underestimated. The list of deceased over the past 13 years includes Tower Records, CompUSA, Circuit City, KB Toys, Linens ‘n Things, Blockbuster, Borders, and RadioShack. What’s notable today is that retailers are going bust or shuttering stores at a pace that would normally indicate an economic recession. Current moderate economic growth and strong consumer confidence haven’t helped some retailers improve their fortunes. Bebe Stores, a women’s apparel chain, recently announced plans to shutter its physical stores and sell exclusively online, while shoe retailer Payless is expected to file for bankruptcy protection and close 500 stores. Many department stores have been shuttering stores as they face competition from Amazon as well as discount and fast-fashion retailers like T.J. Maxx, H&M, and Zara. Sears, which has been closing stores for years, warned investors in its annual report that “‘substantial doubt exists related to the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,’” reported a 3/22 WSJ article. “Sears quickly added that it is ‘probable’ that cost cuts, asset sales and other actions would mitigate its problems.” Sears is shutting 108 Kmart stores and 42 Sears early this year, in addition to closures in previous years. “[T]he retailer will have fewer than 1,500 stores left by early 2017. That’s down nearly 60% from 2011, when Sears had more than 3,500 stores,” calculated a 1/4 Business Insider article. Sears may face the most dire situation, but it’s not the only department store shutting stores. Earlier this year, J.C. Penney announced plans to close 130 to 140 stores and two distribution centers. And after Macy’s reported that same-store sales fell 2.1% over the November-December holiday period, it warned that it could lay off as many as 10,000 workers, noted a 1/4 FT article. The retailer is in the midst of closing 100 stores. (3) Hole in the mall. Investors in real estate also have begun to fear the Amazon threat. Shares of the FTSE NAREIT Equity Regional Malls Index are down 15.8% over the past year as of Tuesday’s close, compared to the 17.6% gain in the S&P 500. Store closures affected 97.8 million square feet of retail space in 2016, more than double the 41.4 million affected in 2015. So far, strong malls have managed to replace closing stores with other tenants. The net absorption rate in 2016 was 105.7 million square feet, more than the 97.8 million square feet of closed stores, according to a JLL research report. Strong malls have replaced closing stores with new, expanding retailers or with new types of tenants, like grocery stores or bowling alleys. Weak malls, however, have had a tougher time. “For malls in strong locations, these vacancies may actually be a boon, allowing them to trade up to a more productive anchor (like Nordstrom or Saks) or shift to a strong non-traditional anchor, like Bass Pro Shops. However weak malls will likely struggle to replace these tenants, resulting in a domino effect of decreasing performance and increasing vacancy.” The market may be anticipating tougher times ahead, even for strong malls: Shares of Simon Property Group, known for its high-end properties, are down 17.25% over the past year. (4) Hollywood’s horror show. Were its domination of the retailing industry not enough, Amazon has expanded into and is disrupting new areas, including the entertainment and technology industries. It’s producing award-winning TV shows and movies, and throwing around big bucks to attract talent and distribution rights. Amazon purchased the distribution rights to “Manchester by the Sea” at last year’s Sundance Film Festival for $10 million, the second-largest sum paid to acquire a film at the festival in 2016. “The e-tailer has also made the biggest acquisition so far of this year’s Sundance: $12 million for comedy ‘The Big Sick,’ according to a person close to the deal,” the 1/24 WSJ reported. As is industry custom, Amazon has released its movies in traditional theaters and waited before allowing access to the videos online. To watch a streamed movie over the Internet, Amazon customers must have a Prime membership, at the cost of $99 a year, which also gives them free two-day shipping. Netflix, another recent comer to the Hollywood game, streams its films the same day they are available in the theater. The competition is pushing Hollywood studios to change the way they release films. Today, movies are available for at-home on-demand viewing 90 days after opening in theaters. Releasing the films with a lag time insulates theater ticket sales from competition. By yearend, however, studios may make films available on demand just a few weeks after they’ve appeared in theaters for between $30 and $50, the 3/26 WSJ reported. The Journal article explained: “To compensate theaters for lost box office, studios may share 10% to 20% of premium VOD revenue with them if the window is less than 30 days after the cinema debut, people with knowledge of the talks said. A key sticking point is for how many years theaters would be guaranteed to receive their share and that prices for early home release won’t fall too low.” Of course, empty movie theaters would be yet another blow to malls. (5) Shoot-out in Westworld. It became clear that Amazon could do tech devices well when its Kindle e-reader outsold Barnes & Noble’s Nook. And now we’re all talking to Alexa, not to Siri, at home. But Amazon’s most impressive tech offering is certainly Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing business that’s growing 50% annually and is expected to generate $13 billion in revenue this year, according to a 1/19 Information Week article. The business goes toe-to-toe with Microsoft and has a lead on both Google and IBM. And perhaps most importantly, AWS’s juicy operating profit margin of more than 25% gives Amazon a way to fund its new ventures and a retail business that has notoriously skinny margins. The cash and financial flexibility AWS provides ensures that Amazon will be a lethal competitor in the retailing industry for many years to come.

(AP) — A House committee revived a proposal Thursday forcing online retailers to collect Arkansas sales taxes, just two days after a lawmaker behind the bill declared it dead for this year's session. The measure advanced by the House Revenue and Taxation Committee requires companies without a physical presence in Arkansas that make more than $100,000 in annual sales or at least 200 transactions in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on those purchases. Amazon this month began collecting Arkansas sales taxes on purchases made by state residents. The e-commerce giant recently announced it would begin collecting in every state that charges sales tax. Supporters of the measure say it's needed to ensure other online retailers also collect the tax. "This gives us an opportunity, as you all know, to level the playing field for our mom and pop businesses and to continue to do what's right by the people of Arkansas and not reward out-of-state sellers," Republican Sen. Jake Files told the committee before the vote. The Senate measure, backed by Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, would require retailers that don't collect and remit the tax to send information about purchases made by Arkansas residents to the state. The proposal is expected to go before the House on Friday and faces an uphill fight to win final approval before the majority-Republican Legislature wraps up its session early next week. If the House approves the measure, it still faces one more vote in the Senate before going to the governor's desk. The proposal had failed three times previously before the panel, facing resistance from conservatives who called the move a new tax and Democrats who wanted the revenue directed to specific needs. A House sponsor of the bill on Tuesday told reporters he didn't expect the bill to come up for another vote. The committee rejected a proposal from Democrats to direct $100 million of the expected revenue toward highways. The rejected amendment also called for directing some of the money toward other needs, such as pre-kindergarten. State finance officials have not estimated how much additional revenue the state would see if the measure is enacted. The top Democrat in the House said he expected the legislation to get bipartisan support in the chamber, but said he was still undecided on whether to back the bill. House Minority Leader Michael John Gray said he was concerned the measure would hit lower-income people disproportionately. "There are many outside this Capitol building who see this as a new tax," he said after the vote. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon had relied on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don't have a physical presence in the state. But the company had shifted in recent months. The Arkansas bill, modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, is aimed partly at getting the high court to reconsider that 1992 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to a Colorado law requiring online sellers to notify customers about how much they owe in taxes. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Students from the Austin area were invited to participate in a youth job fair at Austin High School on Wednesday afternoon. In the commons area, employers from around the city, such as Wal-Mart and the city of Austin, set up booths to interest those seeking a summer job or potential career in the workforce. This marked the second annual youth job fair offered to students in the community. Sandy Forstner, executive director of the Austin Area Chamber of Commerce, said the chamber's Business Education Committee partnered with Workforce Development and Austin High School to feature over 100 jobs for youth. "It's just a piece of the puzzle," Forstner shared. "It's efficient in connecting employees with employers for the summer. I think it's mutually beneficial, and it offers a lot of opportunities to get kids connected with potential employers." The students asked a few questions: How flexible would the work schedule be with their extracurricular activities? What are the exact qualifications to get a job in a certain department? What amount of work experience did they need for the position being offered? Throughout the commons, students browsed job options, took down information and scheduled future job interviews. Among potential employers was Hy-Vee. Now that a new storefront is being relocated and constructed at the old Oak Park Mall, the establishment is looking to add about 100 more positions to several new departments at the new store, according to Cody Wiltgen, recruiting specialist. Wiltgen said interviews for jobs at the new store begin Wednesday, and the new location possibly might be ready to open sometime in early summer. "I thought this fair went over very well," he said. "We are finding kids who may come for part-time jobs or are interested in a potential career path with us. We're excitement from kids who want jobs." Here's what the students said about the job fair and what they're hoping to get out of their summer jobs: +4  Buy Now Nathan Drees Hannah Yang / hyang@postbulletin.com Name: Nathan Drees Age: 18 School: Pacelli Catholic Schools senior "I'm looking for a summer job and need some money to help pay for college.

Raisman, a native of Needham, Mass., discovered Cheribundi two years ago and integrated the drink into her daily exercise routine for post-workout recovery and sleep. “When we found out that Aly was a huge fan we knew she was the perfect person to support the continued education of the public. We are delighted to have her share her real life experience with Cheribundi products,” said Steve Pear, Cheribundi CEO. Raisman shot to fame during the 2012 London Summer Games when she finished the competition as the most decorated U.S. gymnast, making history by becoming the first American to win gold in the floor exercise. The article did not specify in what capacity Raisman would be integrated into Cheribundi’s overall marketing strategy. MILK PRICES DROP IN TOLEDO The price of milk in Toledo, Ohio, has dropped to less than half of the U.S. average cost, according to an article in The Toledo Blade. Citing statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index, the article reports that the price of a gallon of milk has been dropping steadily over the past two years and currently sits at $2.58 a gallon. In Toledo, a gallon of milk at the area’s three major grocery retailers — Walmart, Meijer and Kroger — costs between $1.09 and $1.19, as of this week. Local grocers cited in the article said that the low prices were likely the result of a pricing strategy from the three grocery chains. “I think you have some stores that are lowballing milk. They’re using it as a loss leader,” said Jim Sautter, owner of Sautter’s Five-Star Markets. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Marketing Service told the Blade that there is a dairy surplus that is keeping prices depressed. Chris Hurt, an agriculture economist for Purdue University who was interviewed for the story, said that the surplus is a result of dairy farmers increasing production in recent years following the stabilization of grain prices. TRAFFIC DROPS AT WHOLE FOODS Financial news website The Street proclaimed that “Whole Foods is no longer the dominant force in organics,” citing an industry analyst’s estimate that the retailer has suffered a “staggering” decline in traffic to the tune of 9 to 14 million customers. Karen Short, a Managing Director at Barclays Capital, included the estimate in a note on Monday, according to the article. Short posited that much of that lost traffic is being driven by expanded organic offerings and discounts at conventional supermarket chain Kroger. “As most retailers know, once traffic has been lost those patterns rarely reverse. As a result, in our view Whole Foods might face significant challenges to reverse behavioral changes even if execution improves because execution at competing retailers remains very strong,” wrote Short. The latest news adds to Whole Foods’ already grim outlook, following the company’s sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales, which were down 2.4 percent in Q1 2017. Through the first five weeks of the second quarter, same-store sales are down 3.2 percent. According to the article, the recent closure of nine stores is “calling into question the past five years of aggressive store openings (100 or so in past three years, many of which are larger locations) and the brand’s longer-term potential.” SHAMROCK FARMS EXPANDING VIRGINIA FACILITY WHSV-TV is reporting that dairy company Shamrock Farms has announced a $40 million expansion of its manufacturing facility in northern Virginia. The expansion, which is slated to be finished in late 2018, will include 70 new jobs, bringing the plant to a total of 120 employees. The new facility will also include a “significant increase” in filling capacity and an expansion of product varieties, sizes and formats. According to Shamrock, the revamped facility will allow the company to produce shelf-stable products in plastic single-serve bottles. “As a company, we’re always looking for ways to grow and innovate,” Ann Ocana, Chief Marketing Officer for Shamrock Farms, told WHSV-TV. “The expansion gives us the capacity and the technology to meet growing demand, expand our offerings and propel milk-based beverages into the future.” PHILLY REAPS SWEET REWARDS OF SODA TAX Philadelphia’s controversial soda tax is turning into a gravy train for the city’s coffers, as the Philadelphia Business Journal reported that the city’s Department of Revenue announced it had topped its own estimates with $6.4 million in taxes collected in February. Mayor Jim Kenney’s office projected soda tax revenue in February at $6.3 million, according to the administration’s budget proposal. The Revenue Department also bumped up the initial revenue figures from January from $5.7 million to $5.8 million. The Business Journal report places total revenue for the tax so far at $12.3 million, and added that the city “remains confident” it will meet its fiscal year projection of $46 million. However, the tax “does not appear to be deterring consumers at the rate that city officials expected nor at the levels Pepsi and others claim,” according to the Business Journal. The article also cites a story from BillyPenn.com stating that PepsiCo is no longer distributing 2 L and 12-packs of soda to Philadelphia grocery stores and will instead be supplying retailers with smaller-sized items that offer healthier profit margins.

Lange & Sšhne. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post) Braden Holtby’s runway is the walk from Verizon Center parking garage to the Washington Capitals locker room before each game. His carefully assembled suit typically elicits compliments from arena staff, and the fashion choices that used to be the subject of light ribbing from his teammates now earn a nod of appreciation. “The bar has been set,” defenseman Nate Schmidt said. “And the bar is, what is Holts wearing today?” Holtby is the Capitals’ all-star goaltender, just the third in NHL history to post three straight 40-win seasons. He’s also the team’s best dresser with a style that ranges from 1960s and 70s rock-inspired looks to Navajo ensembles, depending on his mood. “It’s a bit of everything, which I think reflects him,” said former teammate Joel Ward. “It’s like New York meets Montana meets California.” [As battered Penguins hit the skids, their Stanley Cup odds take a big hit] Holtby’s interest in fashion is unexpected considering he grew up on a farm in Canada, but daring to be different even at a young age fits the confidence he now displays. As he’s become more established in Washington’s locker room, Holtby’s felt at ease using his attire to express himself. “I’ve just always viewed fashion as bringing out your personality,” Holtby said. “It took a while being on a hockey team. You don’t know what you can get away with or whatnot, guys bugging you or giving you a hard time about things. The older I’ve gotten, the more comfortable I am. I don’t really care about that anymore. I just do my own thing.” ‘He’s always liked to look nice’ Holtby poses in a suit by John Varvatos. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post) Growing up in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Holtby was awarded a clothing allowance from his parents every summer for back-to-school shopping. He had peculiar taste even then. “He wouldn’t go to Walmart and pick up 10 shirts,” said Greg Holtby, Braden’s father. “He would go somewhere and pick out two that he really wanted.” The Holtbys have a cattle and grain farm that Braden would work on in the summers, helping with everything from fixing fences to hauling hay bales. Greg noted his son was a hard worker, but farm work wasn’t his specialty. “It’d be pretty tough to be out here feeding cows in that three-piece suit he wears all of the time,” Greg joked. When Braden left Lloydminster and its population of less than 30,000 to play Canadian junior hockey in Saskatoon, the bigger city helped him appreciate fashion. Holtby was drawn, as he puts it, “to the beauty of it.” The summer he was drafted by the Capitals, rather than work on the family farm, Holtby got a job at the local menswear store, Cliff Rose for Clothes. [Boswell: Washington is being treated to a rare delight by Caps and Wizards] “I’ve always had an appreciation for things that are well-made, be it art or houses or carpentry, woodworking, clothes, I find the details very impressive for people putting their work into their craft,” Holtby said. “They see visions and they see those things come out, and you can see when someone cares about what they’re making. I think fashion’s a bit along the lines of that. “It goes with hockey.” 1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Braden Holtby sets the fashion bar high as the Washington Capitals’ best dresser View Photos “The bar has been set,” defenseman Nate Schmidt said. “And the bar is, what is Holts wearing today?” Caption “The bar has been set,” defenseman Nate Schmidt said. “And the bar is, what is Holts wearing today?”   Washington Capitals goalie Braden Holtby lets his fashion sense bring out his personality. Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Holtby’s attention to detail manifests in his play as well. The saves that appear simple are the product of methodical and precise movements, repeated over days and months and years until the maneuvers become instinct. With a 2.04 goals against average and a .926 save percentage, he’s likely again to be a finalist for the Vezina Trophy, awarded annually to the league’s best goaltender. He’s also expected to backstop the Capitals through what many believe could be a long postseason run. At the NHL awards in Las Vegas last summer, Braden took his father to buy a suit from John Varvatos, one of his favorite designers. When they got there, the store had already pulled some options based on the sizes Braden had provided, and Greg was simultaneously impressed and amenable. He appreciated how his son was pickier, asking to see other items and crafting his own look. [McDavid’s historic season puts him in the rare air of Gretzky and Lemieux] “Braden’s always been into that kind of thing,” Greg said. “He’s always liked to look nice, and he’s going to wear what kind of goes with whatever. I don’t have the ability to go in and say, ‘hey, I think I’m going to pick that shirt and it’s going to go really good with that blazer and those pants.’ I can’t do that, but he knows exactly what he wants in there.” ‘You just have to have confidence’ Holtby sports pants, a shirt and tie by Suitsupply, jacket and shoes by John Varvatos and a vest by Oliver Spencer. (Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post) When the Capitals were in Nashville for a game on Feb. 25, Holtby wasn’t scheduled to start, so while his teammates took their routine naps, he decided to spend his afternoon shopping. He purchased some jewelry from a small local store and another hat from “two old hippies” for his collection. Colorful headwear has become an expected accessory for Holtby because he doesn’t like styling his hair all of the time and hats are classier than baseball caps. But when he showed up at the rink in a wide-brimmed beige hat earlier this season, there were some “Smokey Bear” jokes from teammates. “Yeah, I got a lot of flak for that one,” he said. Drawing attention to yourself is often frowned upon in the NHL, but Holtby was encouraged by how accepting Washington’s locker room was of former Capitals defenseman Mike Green, now with the Detroit Red Wings. He respected how Green used his style and tattoos to express his personality, and it reassured Holtby that standing out wouldn’t be seen as a bad thing. He’s now influenced some of his teammates. “I love it,” Schmidt said. “It inspired me. I went and bought a hat. It’s not very good though. He said I need to go back and try again.” When the team is on the road, Schmidt has occasionally tagged along on Holtby’s spontaneous shopping trips to some of his favorite boutiques — John Varvatos, Ralph Lauren’s Double RL and Suitsupply. “I just kind of hang out and watch in awe, then flip over the price tag every once in a while,” Schmidt said. If Schmidt feels conflicted in what he should wear, he texts Holtby for guidance. The advice Holtby would give him is what he’s followed since discovering this passion 10 years ago. “You just have to have confidence if you’re going to wear something that you think is your personal style or personality,” Holtby said. “You can’t get flustered if people make fun of it. You’ve just got to go with it. That’s the secret.” sports capitals-insider Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Jayson Derrick , Benzinga Staff Writer   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} March 30, 2017 2:35pm   Comments Share: Related AMZN The Market In 5 Minutes Shuttered Retail Is Amazon's Gain Stocks Up, But Gains Pared; Nvidia Advances (Investor's Business Daily) Related COST Shuttered Retail Is Amazon's Gain Household Names JPMorgan Initiated Ratings On This Week How to Find Wide Investment Moats the 'Easy' Way (GuruFocus) The battle between Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) could soon emerge in a different arena: food purchases. According to a Bloomberg report, Amazon invited food executives from some of the biggest brands to its Seattle office. The online retailer invited executives from General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS), Mondelez International Inc (NASDAQ: MDLZ) and other notable brands for a three-day gathering in May. The purpose of the meeting is to persuade food companies to ship their products directly to consumers through Amazon's platform, rather than relying on retail chains like Wal-Mart, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). The food executives will tour Amazon's fulfillment center and will be hosted by the company's Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke. 'Times Are Changing' Amazon's pitch to the food executives will focus on how the evolution of business has changed. "Times are changing," Bloomberg quoted the invitation sent to the food executives as saying. "Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking." The Bloomberg report further noted that Amazon hasn't gained traction in the food and packaged goods market. The problem Amazon faces is that it is nearly difficult, if not impossible to ship various food products. Consider Mondelez's oreos, which come in a flimsy package that is designed specifically for the grocery aisle. Amazon would need to convince food and consumer good companies to re-imagine packaging and other aspects of their products. Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence, told Bloomberg that Amazon boasts 300 million shoppers. This is notable because Amazon has the power and scale to make its own products if brands pass on selling on its platform. "Fear, more than anything else," Cassar said, "may compel these companies to pay attention." Related Links: Wal-Mart Vs.

(AP) — A House committee revived a proposal Thursday forcing online retailers to collect Arkansas sales taxes, just two days after a lawmaker behind the bill declared it dead for this year’s session. The measure advanced by the House Revenue and Taxation Committee requires companies without a physical presence in Arkansas that make more than $100,000 in annual sales or at least 200 transactions in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on those purchases. Amazon this month began collecting Arkansas sales taxes on purchases made by state residents. The e-commerce giant recently announced it would begin collecting in every state that charges sales tax. Supporters of the measure say it’s needed to ensure other online retailers also collect the tax. “This gives us an opportunity, as you all know, to level the playing field for our mom and pop businesses and to continue to do what’s right by the people of Arkansas and not reward out-of-state sellers,” Republican Sen. Jake Files told the committee before the vote. Online Chat: DJ Kachman, the Veterans Affairs Department’s director of mobile and security technology transformation lead, on April 10, at 1 p.m. Advertisement The Senate measure, backed by Bentonville-based Wal-Mart, would require retailers that don’t collect and remit the tax to send information about purchases made by Arkansas residents to the state. The proposal is expected to go before the House on Friday and faces an uphill fight to win final approval before the majority-Republican Legislature wraps up its session early next week. If the House approves the measure, it still faces one more vote in the Senate before going to the governor’s desk. The proposal had failed three times previously before the panel, facing resistance from conservatives who called the move a new tax and Democrats who wanted the revenue directed to specific needs. A House sponsor of the bill on Tuesday told reporters he didn’t expect the bill to come up for another vote. The committee rejected a proposal from Democrats to direct $100 million of the expected revenue toward highways. The rejected amendment also called for directing some of the money toward other needs, such as pre-kindergarten. State finance officials have not estimated how much additional revenue the state would see if the measure is enacted. The top Democrat in the House said he expected the legislation to get bipartisan support in the chamber, but said he was still undecided on whether to back the bill. House Minority Leader Michael John Gray said he was concerned the measure would hit lower-income people disproportionately. “There are many outside this Capitol building who see this as a new tax,” he said after the vote. White House details how it wants civilian agencies to cut $18B in FY2017 To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon had relied on a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that bans states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes if they don’t have a physical presence in the state. But the company had shifted in recent months. The Arkansas bill, modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, is aimed partly at getting the high court to reconsider that 1992 decision. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected a challenge to a Colorado law requiring online sellers to notify customers about how much they owe in taxes. ___ Follow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo Topics: All News Business News Government News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Government News » Online tax effort revived… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1981: President Reagan shot Federal News Radio presents a daily update of important moments in the history of the U.S. government.

By David Moye 170 When Bryce Maine was thinking about who to take to his senior prom, he had no doubt who the lucky person should be. “My grandma’s always been an important part of my life, like, my only woman figure in my life, so I was thinking, ‘Why not take her?’ he told WTVM TV. Maine, a high school senior in Eufaula, Alabama, said Catherine Maine, the woman he calls “Nanny,” never had the chance to go the prom so he wanted to make that happen for her, according to Atlanta news station WAGA. He even put together the perfect promposal. “I went to Walmart and I got a little canvas and started doing my handprints around it in paint and I just put ‘PROM,’” he told WTVM. Nanny said yes to the invite and even bought a new dress for the April 8 occasion. However, their plans of a wonderful night together were brought to a screeching halt when Eufaula High School Principal Steve Hawkins told Maine he couldn’t bring Nanny. Maine said he asked the principal his reasoning for the decision. “I said, ‘Give me one reason why,” Maine said in the video above. “And he said, ‘Alcohol. In case, she was trying to distribute it to minors.’” The principal’s decision so angered Maine’s cousin, Sarah Catherine, that she blasted him in a scathing Facebook post. She also claimed school board officials told them they were afraid allowing Nanny to be Maine’s date would set a precedent that could inspire “future students” to “do it as a joke and make the school a mockery!” She asked people to post their outrage on social media using the hashtags #letnannygotoprom and #letnanniegotoprom. The Eufaula City Schools Board of Education responded to the prom scandal by releasing a statement from Hawkins: Safety of students and staff is the first and most important of the many tasks of a school administrator. For the 10 years I have been high school principal, we have denied requests each year from students asking to bring older dates to prom.  We do not chance leaving any stone unturned when it comes to safety. Most high schools have an age limit for prom attendees. Maine and Nanny might not be going to prom, but the two still plan to dress up and have a nice dinner and evening out on the town.

What the heck is going on? Posted: Thursday, March 30, 2017 1:31 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, March 30, 2017 3:31 PM EDT Sears stock is up nearly 50% in the past six days, or 25% this year. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Sears continues to lose lots of money. Sales are plunging. Shoppers have abandoned its stores and they aren't going to Sears-owned Kmart either. The company even recently warned that it may go out of business. And yet, Sears stock is up nearly 50% in the past six days, or 25% this year. What the heck is going on? Earlier this year, the stock hit an all-time low. Two of the company's biggest fans have been busy buying shares in the past week -- and that has boosted investors' hopes that the company won't go under after all. CEO Eddie Lampert has scooped up some stock to prop it up. So has the influential investment firm Fairholme Capital, which is run by Bruce Berkowitz -- a Sears board member. Lampert, through his personal stake and the holdings owned by his investment firm ESL, and Fairholme collectively own more than 75% of Sears. So any moves by Lampert and Fairholme to prop up Sears go a long way toward easing some of the insolvency and bankruptcy worries. This is not to suggest that Sears is all of a sudden a healthy company again. Nobody's going to mistake Sears for Amazon, Walmart or Home Depot. But Lampert does have a plan. It's not a plan that will allow Sears to return to its former glory. But it could keep the company afloat. Earlier this year, Sears announced plans to close 150 Sears and Kmart stores. That will save Sears nearly $1 billion in operating costs and may help it trim its massive debt load. Sears also sold its Craftsman brand of tools to Stanley Black & Decker to raise cash. And it is looking to sell its Kenmore appliances and its Diehard auto parts businesses too. The company has also spun off pieces of its Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores division, Lands' End and Sears Canada. Sears also set up a separate public company for some of its real estate assets -- Seritage Growth Properties. And one of the owners of that is none other than investing guru Warren Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha has personally invested in that company. It's not a holding of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway though. Make no mistake. Investors should probably stay far away from Sears stock unless they are a billionaire like Buffett who has the financial wherewithal to stomach a big loss. And the line in a recent Sears regulatory filing about there being "substantial doubt" regarding its "ability to continue as a going concern" is undoubtedly alarming. But you need to read the next sentence in that filing too. Sears added that all the moves it has in the works to raise cash are "probable of occurring" and that they should mitigate "the substantial doubt raised by our historical operating results" and also satisfy our "estimated liquidity needs." In other words, fears of the imminent demise of Sears -- which have now been circulating for several years -- may be overblown. So opportunistic shoppers looking for a going out of business sale may not get the chance. Sears and Kmart may not close their doors for good after all.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links and the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1). The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2). the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now. These days only, I generated close to $36k so far with nothing but my computer and some free time, however i have a full-time nine to 5 job. Even everyone new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income may go much very high over time... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they?

Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market.

Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability?

Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean it's fully unlocked and has the bands for all carriers...... But the unlocked S7 still doesn't have nougat....So theres that. Leonardo Baez You will get updates faster on an unlocked device than a carrier one Good_Ole_Pinocchio No. The US Unlocked models still don't have nougat. All the carrier variants do. Leonardo Baez I bet you that will be an upgrade OTA on the first week after unboxing it Good_Ole_Pinocchio Bro I'm taking about the unlocked S7 from last year lol. Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release. Eddy Nelson Lopez Look at the model number, if it ends with the letter U do not buy it if you care about software updates, if the variant ends with the F then do buy it, that's the best variant to receive Software updates and rhe Fastest thanks to the exynos processor. Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat. (He works closely with samsung and got a preview sample unit) https://youtu.be/n0makpckS8c Maybe is the unfinished firmware or something else.... but the image quality of video and pictures looks better in the iPhone. Maybe something that can be corrected with an update? Jay Quir Not going to lie I have recently thought about going from cricket to att because of their direct tv cell phone plan bundle. Yet still trying to see if it will save me money in the long run. Anyone have that plan and dont mind saying how much they pay a month for it? Ailín Ó’S Irish pricing (probably same in the rest of the EU.) S8: €799.99 S8+ €899.99 Interestingly there's a network here (3) which will sell the phone 8 days before general release if someone preorders. Must be preordered by 12/4 however which means the phone will be available on 20/4 instead of 28/April. Richard Markert 95xU news? Mr. Robot "Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173" I strongly doubt there's much interest in the S8 by 20173 ;-) brgulker Is it just me, or is that fingerprint sensor in just about the worst possible spot imaginable? Who likes fingerprints all over their camera lenses!?!?! Bonedatt It's just you 😉 Wildcard Funny, if this were a HTC phone, you guys would have been killing them over the pricing Bonedatt Yea but htc screwed themselves. Always one step forward two steps backwards. They just started listening again to their customers. A little too late if you ask me, but I wish them well. I'm a fan of their designs. dblock Really on the fence about getting one of these. They appear to be quite nice, but I don't know if I want to lock myself into Verizon or not. Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus. Dllemm It would help their credibility if (A) they were upfront about pricing and (B) acknowledge that most people use phone cases in their marketing and build the back of their phones more rigid. Daniel Tiberius Anyone know if I can still use Jump On Demand on T-Mobile for this? Flo R.

That's the equivalent (processor wise) to the G6. Eddy Nelson Lopez I can't believe people still buy phones from US carriers, that's the stupidest idea you can have, just buy the european variant at full price and forget about US carriers controlling your software updates and Just use a pre-paid company like Simple Mobile. lomsha You do that and let others make purchases as they wish.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More ‘Troublesome indeed’: Windsor police inexplicably loses $25,000 worth of cocaine Sarah Sacheli, Postmedia News  03.30.2017 Windsor Police Chief Al Frederick ShareAdjustCommentPrint Nine ounces of cocaine worth $25,000 disappeared from the drug vault at Windsor police headquarters and no one can say for certain what happened to it. The revelation came during a drug trial that concluded earlier this month in Superior Court. In a written decision obtained Wednesday by the Windsor Star, the judge in the case found the accused drug dealer guilty nonetheless, but said the fact police lost track of nine ounces of cocaine “troublesome indeed.” “The Windsor Police Service allowed $25,000 worth of cocaine to go missing. How did that happen?” said Justice Pamela Hebner. “The only explanation they were able to offer is they assume the substance was destroyed on a day when other such exhibits, no longer needed, were also destroyed.” Criminal defence lawyer Ken Marley had argued that the missing drugs, and the manner in which he learned of their disappearance, should have triggered an acquittal in the case against his client. Also at issue, he said, is police accountability. “I find it suspicious that nine ounces of cocaine would go missing,” Marley said. “I find the circumstances suspicious but I have no idea what really happened.” Marley’s client, Miles Patrick Meraw, 30, was convicted of possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. He was picked up as part of a sting operation that centred on a local drug dealer named Michael Stiller. Police had Stiller’s cellphone tapped and had a bug in his car. Officers were listening on Aug. 21, 2013 as Meraw made arrangements to buy a “nine pack” from Stiller. They then watched the transaction take place in the east-end Walmart parking lot and followed Meraw as he drove away in his Pontiac Sunfire. They arrested him on Jefferson Boulevard, finding the nine ounces of cocaine in a shopping bag that also contained a banana, a yogurt and two boiled eggs. Court heard an officer took the drugs to police headquarters where he weighed them, took photos of them and took a small sample to send to Health Canada for testing that determined it was indeed cocaine. He then turned the drugs over to the officer in charge of the drug vault. When the officer went to the vault a year later to retrieve the cocaine in preparation for a September 2014 preliminary hearing in the case, it was gone, court heard. In an interview Wednesday, police Chief Al Frederick said he believes the drugs were “found to be missing” much sooner. He said the disappearance was discovered during a routine audit of the drug vault in Oct. 30, 2013. “Sept. 11 was a scheduled purge,” he said, explaining that drugs no longer needed for court proceedings would have been removed from the vault at that time and destroyed. “I have full confidence that this was inadvertently destroyed,” Frederick said. Frederick bristled at the suggestion that one of his officers would have stolen the drugs. No one would be foolish enough to take drugs needed for trial because their disappearance would be noticed, Frederick said. He said no one but a single constable and a staff sergeant have access to the vault to remove drugs for destruction. “I trust my officers,” Frederick said. Missing drugs “doesn’t happen very frequently.” Later, he called this instance “a one-off.” But John Sewell, co-ordinator of the Toronto Police Accountability Coalition, said one instance of drugs disappearing is too many. “This is very serious when police are not able to control evidence that they have,” Sewell said. “Suppose a bank has $25 million sitting there and it disappears and they say, “Oh, well, we’re not sure what happened to it.’… That’s not a good enough answer.” Frederick admitted he doesn’t know the inner workings of the drug vault. He said he thinks audits are conducted on an annual basis, but said he isn’t sure. He said he has no idea how many items are contained in the vault, but believes they would number in the hundreds. He couldn’t even comment on the physical size of the vault. “I’ve never been it in.” Sewell, a former Toronto mayor turned activist, suggested Windsor needs someone independent of the police department to conduct its drug audits. “Maybe they should bring in an outside investigator.” Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

According to reports, a woman at the business said two black, heavy set females entered the business and inquired about purchasing two dolls. The business owner said the suspects asked if she could get a box for the dolls. The business owner said she went to the back of the store and retrieved a box. When she returned the women told the business owner they needed to go to an ATM machine and left. The business owner said the women never came back but she did start receiving calls from her bank warning her that her debit card was being used to make unusual purchases. The owner said that was when she realized that her wallet was missing from her purse. Reports state that an officer retrieved surveillance video of the same two women making more than $1,700 worth of purchases from Wal Mart using various cards and forms of payment. Most of the purchases, reports state, were for gift cards and pre-paid phone calls. Officers were also told that the same two suspects in a red Ford Focus attempted to make a purchase at Chick-Fil-A but that the card was rejected and the woman paid cash for the food and left. A Chick-Fil-A employee said there were five children in the vehicle and that the children were unsecured. The South Main Street business owner said she had more than $1,000 in cash in her wallet along with business checks. On March 23 a forgery warrant was issued for Lastar Blackwell, 22, Monroe. According to reports, a woman contacted authorities regarding the possible forgery of her father’s name to secure funding for a vehicle. The woman said another woman, who police said is having a relationship with the victims grandson, came to a South Main Street auto dealership and secured funding for a Dodge Dart. The woman said she was contacted by a finance company who said that the vehicle, which is allegedly in Blackwell’s possession, was due for repossession. The complainant said her father had not agreed to finance the vehicle and, in fact, was not in a physical condition to sign any documents. Reports allege that Blackwell took the documents from the dealership unsigned and returned with signatures claiming that the complainant’s father had signed the documents. Officers were able to obtain a sample of the signature in question and reported that the original signature was “very different” from the one found on the financing documents. On March 21 an information report was filed at the mile marker 113 section of Interstate 20. According to reports, an officer working a construction detail on the interstate observed a white pickup truck with a trailer drive through a wet patch of concrete on the interstate. The driver of the truck told the officer he was attempting to exit the interstate because of mechanical failure. A construction superintendent told the officer that if the state demanded that the section be replaced the cost of concrete would be $2,500. On March 21 Joseph Daniel Frick, 39, Madison was arrested and charged with interfering with property of the city of Madison. According to reports, an officer stated that on March 20 he was informed by the city of Madison that Frick’s water account for his Pine Tree Circle residence had been cut off on March 7 due to lack of payment. Utility workers alleged that sometime after the service was cut off, the meter was turned back on and 700 gallons of water was consumed. A city worker on March 17 went back to the meter and turned the service off a second time and placed a lock on the meter. On March 20 the worker went back to Frick’s residence and found that the lock was missing and that the water meter had been turned back on and  500 gallons had been used. Frick allegedly agreed to come to the Madison Police Department to discuss the allegations but failed to meet a scheduled appointment with officers. Frick was located walking on Pine Tree Circle and was detained. Officers also were informed that Frick has an outstanding arrest warrant against him from Walton County. Morgan County Sheriff’s Office On March 26 a simple battery complaint was filed at a Holland Springs Road residence. According to reports, deputies arrived and were told by a man at the residence that he had not called authorities but his sister, who was not present, had in concern for his safety. The man said that his brother had been drinking all day and was “extremely intoxicated” and had, at some point, pushed him on two different occasions. Deputies were able to observe the brother sleeping on a bed in a bedroom with a locked door. The deputies, reports, state, knocked several times on the bedroom door but the man did not wake up. On March 25 Jeffery Dean Waller, 32, College Park was arrested and charged with driving without license on person and DUI. According to reports, Waller was arrested during the operation of a roadblock at 11:20 p.m. on Eatonton Road. Reports allege that Waller told officers he did not have his driver’s license on his person during the stop. The deputy also said Waller could not follow instructions during a field sobriety test. On March 25 a verbal altercation report was filed at a Newborn Road residence. According to reports, a man called deputies and said he was having problems with the mother of his children who lived in the home and had allegedly been drinking. The man said the woman drank during a party at the residence and was now yelling and cursing. The woman told deputies she was “an adult and no one was going to tell her not to drink. On March 25 a juvenile complaint was filed at a Prospect Road residence. According to reports, a father said his 15-year-old son continued to act disrespectful, steal from relatives and attempt to start fights with the complainant. The father said the teen had also become aggressive towards fellow students and staff at the school he attends in Athens. The teen told an officer that he “cannot do any better” and that he was taking the items from family members “because he is entitled to anything they have.”  The teen told the deputy he wanted to change his life but that the “poor quality” of life he had prior to moving to Morgan County was a hindrance. On March 23 a battery complaint was filed at a Deerwood Drive residence. According to reports, a deputy responded to Morgan Memorial Hospital where he observed a 64–year–old woman lying in a hospital bed with an injured hand. The woman said earlier she and her son had engaged in an argument regarding the 38–year–old son losing his job and his son had slammed the door to his bedroom on the woman’s hand. The woman reiterated that the incident was an accident and that she did not want o press charges against the son. On March 22 an unruly child complaint was filed at a Fears Road residence. According to reports, a grandmother alleged that her 14–year–old granddaughter was having sexual relations with an 18–year–old man who, reports, state, was living in  the same house as the granddaughter. Reports allege that deputies spoke with the father of the 14–year–old who told them he did not know about the sexual allegations but that the daughter was “a very unruly child” and that he wanted to do something about her behavior. He also said another man had been arrested for alleged sexual relations with the juvenile. The grandmother alleged that the juvenile tells men that she is actually 18–years–old. On March 21 a tearing down mailboxes and criminal trespass complaint was filed at a Chilton Woods Road residence. According to reports, a man said sometime between 5 p.m. and 8:30 a.m. someone knocked his mailbox off the post. Two other mailboxes on Chilton Woods Road were damaged and a lock had been removed from a shed on Nunnally Street. On March 21 a burglary complaint was filed at a Cochran Road residence. According to reports, a man said someone had entered a metal shed on his property. A deputy noted that nothing was reported missing and that it appeared that someone was looking for a particular item in the shed. On March 21 a forgery complaint was filed at a Doster Road residence. According to reports, a woman said someone had cashed 12 counterfeit checks based on her account information. The woman said she was contacted by bank officials because, in part, the cashed checks had different fonts, misspelled words and other clues that the checks had been manufactured.

Through a partnership with the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC), NLC has supported more than 60 cities over the past five years. Those cities have served more than 10 million meals to 100,000 children through the federal afterschool and summer meal programs. The grant program is part of NLC's Cities Combating Hunger through Afterschool and Summer Meal Programs (CHAMPS) initiative, which receives support from the Walmart Foundation. "City leaders are well-positioned to support the nutrition of children in their communities," said National League of Cities (NLC) CEO and Executive Director Clarence E. Anthony. "We're excited to see cities from Alabama, California and Kansas make a commitment to ensuring that children have access to healthy meals. Afterschool and summer meal programs do more than provide nutrition — they can help prevent summer learning loss and provide a safe space for children to gather when school ends." NLC's CHAMPS initiative invited cities in Alabama, California and Kansas — states where meal program participation has a great opportunity to grow — to apply for technical assistance and grants of up to $40,000. Cities receiving CHAMPS grants in 2017 include: Alabama: Anniston, Brewton, Clanton, Florence, Hobson City, Prattville, Russellville, Sylacauga California: San Francisco, Oceanside, Palmdale, Rialto, Redlands, Lemon Grove, Oroville Kansas: Olathe, Topeka, Emporia, Arkansas City, Ottawa In Alabama and California, many children are not being reached with afterschool and summer nutrition despite increases in children receiving free or reduced lunch. In Kansas, a state with the lowest summer meal participation rates in the nation, fewer than one in 10 low-income children participate in summer nutrition programs. "The city of Sylacauga is committed to increasing the capacity of existing summer and afterschool meal sites, and adding new ones so that our children can access healthy meals when school is out," said Sylacauga Mayor Jim Heigl. "We've established a CHANGED committee — Children's Healthy Alternatives Now Given Every Day — with city leaders and community partners to support this effort to increase participation in afterschool and summer meals. We believe through CHAMPS, we will have a significant effect on our children in the city and surrounding areas, and we look forward to sharing our experience with other cities." NLC and FRAC are also funding state municipal leagues and state-based anti-hunger organizations in each of the three states to assist with outreach and provide technical assistance to cities over the course of the 16-month project. In late 2016, NLC awarded grant to 10 cities in Alabama, California and Kansas through this program. Grantees in 2016 include Alabaster, Huntsville, Mobile and Tuskegee in Alabama; Glendale, Riverside and Stockton in California; and Kansas City, Lawrence and Wichita in Kansas.

Published Wed, Nov 26, 2014  |  Floyd Brown, Political Expert Amazon (AMZN) started Black Friday deals early, but don’t count me in this year. I’ve been a customer of Amazon almost from the beginning, when all they delivered were books. I don’t know how many thousands of dollars of merchandise I’ve ordered over the years, but it’s likely in the tens of thousands. I adopted Amazon because it fit my busy lifestyle. Instead of having to visit Wal-Mart (WMT) and hustle from aisle to aisle… just to wait in a long line to pay for my merchandise… Amazon allowed me to buy with a few clicks and find the product at my doorstep just days later. But after making its worst business decision ever, I will forever boycott using the site. And I might not be alone… At first, Amazon’s premium service, Amazon Prime, improved on the customer experience. With no shipping and two-day delivery, there was no way to beat it. My Amazon purchases exploded. In fact, I was so addicted to Amazon last year that I spent most of Black Friday on the site completing my Christmas list. No need to fight the crowds at the mall. No need for rain checks. Heck, they even delivered my out-of-town gifts directly to the intended recipient. All of this joy is over now, however… Serious Lapse in Judgment If you’re a regular Amazon customer, you’ve likely noticed a change. Amazon dropped the United Parcel Service (UPS), and it increased shipping with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Amazon made a deal with the Devil, and the customers are now required to pay. Let me explain… When the deal was announced, the U.S. Postal Service thought it was the lifeline it needed to survive. Since bills and most correspondence now come via email – and checks are often delivered by Automated Clearing House (ACH) – the USPS has lost its reason to exist. Mail volume has plummeted and most of the mail delivered these days never makes it past the trash can into the house. They’re bleeding financially. Now, Amazon pays huge delivery fees, and it’s looking to build its own fleet of trucks and vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, it thought it had a match made in heaven: Take the excess capacity of the USPS, and make it the delivery system for Amazon. Makes sense, right? But there’s a major problem with the equation. Amazon is going from being the best firm at delivering products… to being one of the worst. From Pick-Up Lines to Picket Lines In the past, the United Parcel Service would leave the parcels at your doorstep. Instead, USPS wants to cram it into your mailbox. But if you miss your mail for a day or the package doesn’t fit into your mailbox, you’re out of luck… the parcels end up back in the dead letter room at your local post office. So instead of delivery, the Amazon customer has to go to pick up the package at the Post Office. That’s a line even more dreaded than Wal-Mart’s. Americans hate standing in the USPS line. And this is what’s happening to thousands of Amazon customers around the nation. Instead of enjoying the delivery of Amazon Prime, you’re now faced with the hell of waiting in the line at the Post Office. What sounded like a good idea on paper is a disaster for the Amazon customer. I wonder if Jeff Bezos and the other leaders of Amazon know what they’re doing to their own customers. If this keeps up, they soon will.

Every time I order something it seems there is a reason why it cannot be left at the house so a trip to the UPS office is in order and their lines and lack of caring is as bad or worse than USPS. I, for one, get better service from USPS. [Reply] V Paiva Reply: November 26th, 2014 at 12:04 pm Not only is a trip to UPS as bad as USPS, but here where I live I have to travel to another city to the UPS terminal. There isn’t one in this city. [Reply] Heather Reply: January 27th, 2015 at 12:59 pm My issue with the USPS delivery is that to fulfill their Amazon two day obligation they mark the package as delivered when they never even came to my house. Has happened at least ten times. This is hurting small business owners who use USPS and then have to eat the coast of the first order. I’ve called the post office before and I know they are lying about the delivery and I say that I will report it to the shipper and they just say “go ahead”. They have to scan a bar code on my mailbox for mail delivery. Not sure why they wouldn’t have to do that for packages. It’s a total scam. [Reply] Richard Reply: March 26th, 2015 at 11:44 am I agree! This has happened to me as well. I was definitely home early and awaiting my package in the room where a knock or doorbell would have definitely been heard. Screw them. My item was cheap. I’ll just not pick it up at all and they have send it back costing them more labor as I order my item from some place else. I don’t mind picking it up if they had actually come and missed me but they definitely lied in my case. Mike Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 7:31 pm This has happened to me several times recently. Our post office here in Corpus Christi says they “attempted delivery” but I was home each time and the doorbell never rang. I have had to wait until Saturday, when I am not working, to drive up to the post office to pick up my package. They have lost a priority mailed package and certified letter as well in recent weeks. I ask for a manager and the are always conveniently unavailable and never return my calls. I am done with USPS, and if Amazon doesn’t begin to offer options other than USPS I will cancel my prime membership and be done with Amazon. WhyMeLord Reply: August 8th, 2015 at 2:02 pm I can receive a package from China faster than I can a package sent one (small) town over. FWIW I can walk to that shipper’s location faster than USPS delivers. The problem has gotten so bad that on our purchase orders we advise vendors that any package shipped via USP is at their risk. USP tracking confirms the deliver two or three days BEFORE it is delivered. Complaints to Postal inspector are ignored. A letter to the Postmaster by name sent to the Washington Office the address was provided by my congress critter) was returned stamped “Addressee Unknown” david Reply: January 11th, 2016 at 10:21 pm The barcode they scan on your mailbox has nothing to do with your deliver of mail. That is scanned to show where they are at a given time and would be scanned regardless of whether you had mail or not. I’m curious why you people have so many problems having Amazon packages not delivered. 99% of the packages that Amazon sends out are sent “carrier-leave if not response” meaning the packages should be left whether you’re home or not. I’d drop that on the post office next time you call. Leaving that isn’t even optional for the carrier. great grandma Reply: February 13th, 2016 at 8:42 am Two companies that I ordered on line from,one sent UPS,but had them delivered to the Post Office,the other sent Fed Ex,who they also delivered to the Post Office.I will not order from either of these companies again.Ask who will be delivering your package,but make sure you ask if that company will be making that delivery to your home. Mike Reply: March 3rd, 2016 at 10:19 am Exactly right. This mostly happens for Sunday delivery. They simply will not deliver on Sunday. They lie about trying. I have been home and nothing was left on the door AND it was marked “LEAVE” which requires nothing else. Magically, the next business day they leave it at the door. Greg Brandeau Reply: December 30th, 2014 at 3:51 am I’m not sure if it is where I live (LA) or something else, but both USPS and UPS are terrific at leaving packages at my house that won’t fit in my mailbox and/or that need to be signed for. In addition, both UPS and USPS allow you to re-route your package or sign for your package on their websites. My experience with Amazon and USPS over the holidays has been fantastic! Same with UPS. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 7:50 pm I live in Baton Rouge, LA. I have had the same experience. However, my friends and family do not. I think it depends on the letter carrier and their delivery schedule. My packages always come to my doorstep on time. I have relatives that have home security cameras. We have evidence of the letter carrier leaving a notice in their mailbox instead of attempting a delivery. As a result of this, they only choose the one day shipping on Amazon so that UPS or FedEx will make a successful delivery. [Reply] Dawn N Reply: May 30th, 2015 at 9:54 pm I chose 1 day delivery, and it’s being shipped via USPS. JJthe DAGGER Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 8:45 pm I don’t get this. I’m a carrier with the USPS and I would rather deliver a package then sit in front of your mailbox and fill out a slip for you to pick the package up at the USPS, haul your package around all day and then haul it back into the office. I really can’t comprehend why any carrier would do this when most days you barely have any room to move. I question the validity of your responses. Think about what I just wrote because this leaving notices and hauling a full truck of parcels back to unload at the local USPS doesn’t sound realistic. I think most of you just have an ax to grind and decided to talk out of your rears. steven Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:56 am I work for the USPS and we are instructed to leave parcels at the doorstep unless it’s not considered safe or bad weather [Reply] Charlene Reply: October 21st, 2015 at 12:40 pm Well, you don’t work for every state now do you! People are not going to find the time to come on here and make a crazy remarks for the fun of it. I have been a amazon customer since 2000 and postal service has slacked off for about a year now in my area. I don’t get my packages left on my premises even though its secured and of course I am the one who is placing the order so I am fully aware that I would not be home to receive it. People do work and that was the benefit for becoming a prime member in the first place and be able to enjoy the 3 day delivery. Even now requesting redelivery attempts are not made until after my 3 requests on the USPS website. I don’t see the logic is wasting gas to come all the way to my home just to go back and dump it at the post office. If this is the method that supervisors are telling their workers to get people to come into the Post office then its a dumb idea. I can have a tiny amazon package that has a scented oil in the box go back to the post office! It’s ludicrous. Sm Reply: November 28th, 2015 at 4:50 am Same here. Been with USPS for a year. Its a total pain in the a$$ to bring parcels back with me. The only way I do is if the business is closed or it’s a signature confirmation and they weren’t home. RachelK Reply: February 7th, 2016 at 10:33 am The issues we have with nondelivery are that the carrier doesn’t even bring the packages, because my spouse has met him at the mailbox while he was filling out the slip and my spouse asked where the package was and the carrier responded that he left it back at the post office. We’ve also had A LOT of packages stolen, even spoke with an 1811 who said they are aware there are a lot of thefts going on and there is an active investigation (in other words, tough luck to us.) As I type this, I’ve had a puppet that I ordered for my play therapy kit marked as delivered, and it never was. Sadly, most of what disappears through the Houston Street office is toys (both sending and receiving.) and identification (My husband was notified that his DL was being used by someone else, the DL that disappeared at the Houston St office 3x.) I will probably order my books and play therapy stuff through other sellers that use UPS or Fed Ex. My Amazon Prime account though, I may just not renew because we never use it like netflix, and with everything going through USPS (meaning I may not get everything) it’s not worth the money. Joe Reply: July 2nd, 2015 at 4:21 pm I’m on hold with UPS right now and Amazon and I are begging them to allow store pick-up as I won’t be home to sign for the package. Instead of working with Amazon to fulfill MY request, this is supposed to be about me I thought, UPS is insistent they most uphold the terms of their contract with Amazon though we are requesting flexibility to fulfill my request. I guess it’s more important that the contract, which I’m not party to, be upheld despite Amazon’s request then the sale be completed. I thought “the market” was about responsiveness to customer needs? [Reply] sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:45 pm The customer you refer to is not the receiver of the package; for the delivery company their customer is the shipper who pays the postage. Terry Lamb Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 1:53 pm I think this author has been smoking something! Here it is, MLK day and the USPS just 2 packages at my front door. I get excellent delivery service no matter how they ship my order so go boycott all you want! [Reply] Numnutz2005 Reply: February 22nd, 2015 at 6:23 pm Thats imposible dude….usps delivers NO packages on MLK day so if your going to lie at least make sense.

I can’t get a package delivered by the Post Office. I think it is mainly because my carrier is too lazy or too stupid to do his job. I NEVER use the Post Office to mail a package. Some of them couldn’t pour piss out of a boot. [Reply] Jo Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 8:10 pm You don’t know what you are talking about, William Doores. Calling a carrier lazy or stupid…?

What I see is packages going straight to the post office for pickup so I can sign for them here as if I couldn’t do that if the mail man brought it here anyway. [Reply] Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 6:56 pm I am a Seattleite that is fed up with this “deal with the devil” Amazon has made with USPS. Amazon’s poor choice of shipping results in many lost hours & frustration to me, the customer. As a business owner, the hours I spend tracking down shipments, calling their customer service for refunds, not to mention the time I spent researching and ordering the items I chose to begin with – makes AMAZON the most COSTLY PLACE for me to spend money anymore. USPS will not even get out of their truck to walk a package to your front door. Nor do I have an option of choosing a delivery method that is reliable for me, the CUSTOMER. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone to cancel almost $700 worth of merchandise I purchased within the last couple of days. I received that same text message everyone else is talking about here: “Delivery Attempted: We were not able to deliver your Amazon package with Fujitsu ScanSnap IX 500 Scanner and 4 other items. We’ll try again tomorrow. Then it leaves tracking information.” When I log into my account it says I need to look for the Notice left on my door for further instructions. No Notice. Why? Because they didn’t even bother to get their lazy you-know-whats out of the truck to walk to the door. I have been waiting since 8:00 this morning and it is now 3:50 pm (PST) Nobody even ‘attempted’ to deliver and they couldn’t care less about the time Amazon’s customer’s waste away from work or other important parts of their lives as AMAZON & USPS continue to disappoint again and again. For condominiums (aka multifamily housing) USPS will only drop everything off at an office location on site wherein it is immediately lost, broken or only open during business hours – which are the same hours everyone else is at work! This is ridiculously frustrating and absolutely NOT “Customer-centric.” I used to have a lot of respect for Jeff Bezos and his philosophy to build a business by creating it from the customer point of view. Obviously he hasn’t googled his own shipping problems for quite a few years as rants about this same issue go back for years. This is nothing new and Amazon stands silent on the issue IGNORING THEIR CUSTOMERS. There are plenty of alternatives and AMAZON PRIME isn’t really worth much without the 2-day shipping guarantee. Buying from e-bay or a MULTITUDE of other online retail stores not to mention just walking into a local store is so much less frustrating and much more satisfying for my overall customer experience. Shame on you Amazon. This Seattleite is taking her business elsewhere from now on. You owe your customers a public apology for this fiasco. [Reply] Jen Reply: September 6th, 2015 at 4:29 pm Amazon bans you permanently from buying on their website if you complain or return items as well! Their attitude is basically you take what we give you regardless of what the terms were when you ordered, or you can stick it you-know-where. Customer-centric – haha what a joke! [Reply] Bmack Reply: August 27th, 2015 at 10:20 pm I work at a post office in Youngstown, Ohio and I ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx when I have the option. I told my Postal manager that 2 Amazon Prime packages were not delivered. He just laughed! [Reply] Frank Reply: September 19th, 2015 at 9:30 am I don’t care how my items come ups or fed ex I just prefer not the postal service. The idiots that deliver my mail can’t read. On this route we have yelled for years about wrong house number or wrong street on the mail. For some reason they can’t read the whole address when you call to complain all you get is we got a new carrier again since this walking house to house is too hard for one to stay on the route. I can’t even tell you how many deliveries have been lost both that I know about and never knew. I try to get everything shipped ups instead of USPS at least I know they will deliver it. If I ship something out I have to go to the post office and pay the extra signature required just to make sure it goes to the right place. I laugh every time I see those commercials about the USPS dedication to your mail. I understand there may be mistakes once on awhile but this happens every week for over 3 years now. [Reply] K.

Packages are being sent through FedEx and when the package reaches the nearest city they are given to the USPS adding 3 more days to the shipping. In addition, if a product doesn’t work, the customer has to pay for return shipping and the customer is charged for the original shipping on top of it. Therefore, I ended up paying $8 for a product I don’t have. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:20 pm that handoff only occurs when you use free super saver shipping. this article is about amazon prime. that said, however, I’ve had no problem with either one being left at the door. and have always received any packages with guaranteed delivery dates, on that date. [Reply] Namma Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 11:38 am That’s not true. I’ve been a Prime member for three years and the last seven month have been horrendous in getting a package delivered. One even was labeled Parcel Post even though I have never changed my default Prime Membership shipping method of 2 days. My last order was sent UPS Ground. Amazon is experimenting, however, they fail in that there is NO feedback and no way for the customer to insist on not using certain methods such as SurePost, SmartPost, etc., etc. WE, the customer, KNOW our delivery carriers strengths and weaknesses and Amazon DOES NOT. Nor is there a direct mechanism in place for Amazon to collect customer feedback about shipping and take the no doubt thousands of complaints up with their “shipping partners” as being violations of the contract, IF they included this in the contract. Hopefully they aren’t that stupid. If this continues I will quit Prime. There’s no point to it since the offerings on the remainder of Prime seem to fit a much younger demographic and are not to my taste. Businesses NEED to remember that they NEED the customer more than the customer needs them. If you doubt this simply search – DIY – and see the resurgence in making things on your own cutting out the merchant and the delivery nightmare that many have resorted to. 543 millions results are about what you will get. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 8:00 pm I completely agree. I don’t understand why the customer can’t be given the option to choose the shipping carrier as opposed to the delivery time. All three carriers are more than willing to negotiate and Amazon already has a built in shipping calculator. I wish Amazon would have the options laid out plain and simple, instead of letting the system or seller choose one by default. Example: What Amazon Currently Has: 1 Day Shipping- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) 2 Day Shipping- FREE (Guaranteed by March 15, 2015) Standard Shipping – FREE (Guaranteed by March 20, 2015) What I Would Like: UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) UPS 2nd Day Air- FREE FedEx 2Day- FREE USPS Priority Mail 2/3 Day- FREE UPS Ground- FREE FedEx Home Delivery- FREE USPS Parcel Select- FREE, $1 Back on Prime Membership Cost This way the customer has the option of choosing the delivery time AND shipping carrier. David Reply: June 3rd, 2015 at 8:28 pm Are you high? You can’t understand because your clueless of what the actual cost of shipping is, that’s made abundantly clear with this UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) USPS offers flat rate boxes at 44$ But you somehow think your 99 bucks means that amazon should eat 40 bucks. Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 7:00 pm Well said, Namma Tim Reply: August 30th, 2015 at 2:57 pm I agree. Amazon should allow the customer to choose the method – company, speed and cost – of shipping items they want. If you like priority mail, choose USPS, if you like UPS or FEDEX choose them. The company’s shipping matrix is broken. sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:57 pm GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND GO SHOPPING!!!!!

I used Amazon.com credit card, then it says use the free 2 day since I have prime. Dec 1. it says 2 day, plus I checked weekends are good, too. Friday gets here, no package. Then it is changed to Sunday. They apparently kept driving from central California, past Albany, Oregon another 1.5 hours to Portland. Then took the package all the way back to Albany, close to where I live. I gave them both my Box number and my physical address to make sure I get it. What could go wrong? They locked up my package in Albany and changed it to Dec 8. Now my 2 day delivery is locked up 20 minute from me and will be one week late. Screw Amazon, screw UPS! Screw Amazon credit card. I don’t need them. I have 50 CC’s, others with zero balance. Shove Amazon prime! 15 years of doing business with Amazon, and it just goes downhill. [Reply] Karen Reply: August 20th, 2015 at 7:35 am I worked for UPS for 27 years and recently retired. I can pretty much guarantee that UPS is not losing Amazon. What is happening is UPS and FedEx is contracting with the post office to pick up these packages in bulk from the shipper like Amazon, deliver to the post office and pay $1.00 for each package delivered that can be put in a mailbox. If an address is scanned in the UPS system like a large box that won’t fit in a mailbox and a smaller package is going to same address they are delivered by UPS, but if a small package is the only one going to that address it will be taken to post office for delivery. As drivers we didn’t like this because it held up the package for a day and customers couldn’t understand why it said UPS was delivering but it came by USPS. We could never understand how this could be profitable but I can guarantee that if it wasn’t UPS wouldn’t do it. Hopefully I have cleared up some of this but I may have made it more confusing. [Reply] Joe Reply: September 18th, 2015 at 7:37 am That is completely right. UPS takes packages to almost every post office every day. They give USPS packages that are not cost effective for their delivery person to deliver. [Reply] i hate people Reply: January 4th, 2016 at 3:28 pm No, you guys are dead wrong. I work at USPS, and Amazon made a deal with USPS to allow them to deliver their packages on Sundays. FedEx, UPS, and most carrier companies don’t deliver on Sunday but the post office do now. This is a contract between USPS and Amazon, and it has absolutely nothing to do with UPS and FedEx, and they are losing out in the end. Tom says: November 26, 2014 at 6:48 am Maybe you order things too small. I ordered from Amazon just last week, and UPS delivered yesterday to me. However, much of what FedEx has been charged with delivering by sellers has been coming the final step via USPS. Almost everything that has FedEx charges, USPS delivers to me.

[Reply] Kodster says: November 26, 2014 at 10:10 am I don’t have any problem with Amazon… I’m a Prime member, and I specifically choose a street shipping address in order to get the expedited, guaranteed shipping of 2-days, because I have a PO Box, as well, and that’s my billing address. I’m REQUIRED to have a PO Box in the town I live in, since I live within the city limits. The only issue I have is with FedEx… if they do SmartPost (deliver to the post office, who in turn delivers to me), I don’t have any issues… however, if they are required to deliver directly to my home? Forget it. If I’m lucky, I’ll see the package a week later than it was supposed to be guaranteed to be delivered. UPS… no problems, right on time, and as expected. Point is, we ALL have issues with the delivery systems that Amazon contracts with. Until people get it in their heads that they, as well as we, are customers of each other, and should treat each accordingly (that Golden Rule… treat others as you would want to be treated yourself), nothing is going to change.

It also happened when my friend bought me a hardrive through Amazon with expedited shipping and tracking showed that it was delivered but there was absolutely NOTHING in my mailbox nor anything at front door, porch, ANYWHERE! ! And OF COURSE it just happened to me again! Tracking said that it was delivered Monday july 13,2015. And I haven’t seen my package ANYWHERE nor was there even any notices left for me!! I think that the mail lady here COULD POSSIBLY be stealing the amazon packages. Or she’s just so much in a hurry that she could have placed it with one of my neighbors packages. I’ve seen her scanning A LOT of packages ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER and not put them in the mailbox after each scan. (I was tanning at the pool, mailboxes for our apartment complex is in clear view from the pool). I’ve received my neighbors packages with my packages SOOOOO many times before. I have the courtesy to just hand deliver them to the correct address (knocking at my neighbor’s door, if they aren’t home then I leave it at their front door) . That’s not my job to do that. But I do that only because I KNOW how it feels to lose a package. .. the USPS here in La Verne Had no phone number to call and complain to. No 800 number …nothing.. and the people at the post office don’t even bother to check. When my boyfriend went in there to try to pick up his package that was never delivered, the lady told him to come back later so that she has time to look for it. He came back a few hours later and she said she didn’t get to check yet. He asked her to please go and check, all she did was walk in the doors and walked right back out and said she couldn’t find it…. it’s like WTF??!! YOU DIDN’T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AROUND AND DIDN’T ACTUALLY CHECK ALL YOU DID WAS WALK IN AND RIGHT BACK OUT OF THE DOORS!! … no manager was available to complain to. .. USPS F***ING SUCKS! ! AND IS ALWAYS LOSING PACKAGES! !! ANY PACKAGES THROUGH UPS IS ALWAYS on time and I’d any delays.. you would know. .. customers are always able to know where their packages are with UPS. … I’M SO SICK OF LOSING PACKAGES THAT ARE BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON!!

Since USPS workers can access apartment buildings they can reach your apartment directly. This a problem for FedEx and UPS. The difference is that FedEx does allow you to pick up your package after certain hours. Good luck doing this with UPS. Overall, I’m glad that Amazon is not using UPS anymore. [Reply] THE POSTMAN says: November 26, 2014 at 4:11 pm Mr. Brown you can calm your nerves. The USPS has instructions (at least in south east Texas) to leave any Amazon package at the customers door, no matter what. So if you have the type of address where the postman has access to your front door, the package will be left. Have you communicated with your postman? Simple, DIRECT communication with your postman goes a long way to getting those Amazon packages delivered right.

[Reply] Jeff W says: November 27, 2014 at 10:18 am I don’t know who the author of this piece is but his bias against the USPS is pretty obvious. Also, he is completely wrong about how USPS delivers. I have worked at the USPS for 20 years , the last 8 have been in a branch office. I see Amazon packages everyday, brought to us from both fed ex and UPS for last mile delivery. On average between both carriers about 500-600 parcels a day, many more right now. I am also a loyal amazon prime customer, and have been for more than 5 years. Gotten many things from them as well. First of all, UPS still delivers Amazon. It does depend on size since UPS started doing dimensional pricing. If it is small, they will probably not deliver. But in some cases they do. I see people everyday come in our PO, complain about our price and say they are going to UPS. They always come back. As far as your package delivery, we leave parcels at places all the time! I have no idea where you live, but unless it is in a place where the carrier think it is unsafe, they will leave that parcel. If they don’t call and complain. Personally I would rather have someone who cares about my security than just leaving it and going. Also, sign the notice left for you and they will received. Happens all the time. This is really another case of some anti federal government idiot who thinks life would be better and his prices lower if we did not exist. We are the only ones that will deliver to every address. That is why the others drop off to us…they can’t deliver to certain places and keep costs down. If we weren’t around, you would be paying through the nose or driving to a centralized pick up point for your parcels. And as far as waiting at the PO for stuff, management has cut our staffing back so much that we cannot keep our unit fully staffed. That is a whole different issue that I would love to discuss with this moron. Bottom line, we do it right and it most cases cheaper. If he has problems I dare say they are of his own creation. This article was a biased piece of untruths and blather. [Reply] Ron W Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 10:43 am Jeff says they do it cheaper than fed-ex or ups. What about the Billions of dollars the post office lose each year. If they had to make a profit like private business does to stay in business. These billion dollar losses have to be paid sooner or later by the tax payers. The USPS would be higher than private services if they had to recoup their cost of doing business and having taxpayers pay. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:19 am Usps does not receive any taxpayer money. Do your homework before you say stupid things.

I’ve had a number of packages that “track your package” says it will be delivered by such and such day by 8pm, no way USPS delivers that late. Tracking say delivery attempted- couldn’t leave unattended. In variably the package appears the next day in or on my mail box which several hundred feet from my house next to a major expressway. A Macbook Air was left “unattended” on top of mail box in the rain. Found it before water had reached the laptop. Waiting today for package tracking says will be delivered by 8pm today, BS, won’t see it till Monday. [Reply] Chaupt Reply: February 18th, 2015 at 9:06 pm If the box is say 40-50lbs, USPS has either left if in the middle of my driveway so I have to get out of my car to remove it, or they put an “attempted delivery” notice in my mailbox and make me drive out of my way to go get it after standing in line to turn in the slip and waiting for them to find where the box was stashed and then get a dolly to roll it out to me. Amazon! This is not acceptable. And, yes, I have had the trouble of them smashing items that don’t really fit into the mailbox too! Had to actually cut one apart piece by piece to get at the item inside!! [Reply] Robbie Reply: February 21st, 2015 at 3:52 pm I don’t know if it’s regional or not, but the USPS carrier for my area will not leave any packages at the front door. If it won’t fit in the mailbox, it goes back to the post office. I am disabled and cannot get to the mailbox every day. Things were much better for me when Amazon used UPS and I could get everything delivered to the front door. [Reply] Dan Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 6:26 pm I don’t have an issue with my carrier, but the USPS has gotten so slow in my area, its plain ridiculous. It takes 7 days for a letter to get from Florida to Maine. Packages that use the USPS take 3-5 days longer than with UPS/FEDEX. Why does it take 2 days for a package to be delivered by my local postman? They tell me it’s because Amazon and some other stores use palletized shipping. It’s great if you are served by a post office serving thousands, but the rural post offices get the stuff when UPS/FEDEX feels like dropping off a pallet. Small PO’s may not get a pallet every day. It’s all about saving money, and I understand, but deliver that slow should be much cheaper than regular FEDEX or UPS. [Reply] Jenna says: November 27, 2014 at 4:32 pm I completely disagree!! It really depends on what you have ordered. I love Amazon like you do. And my brother has an Amazon prime membership as well. I have seen Amazon deliveries coming from UPS as well. I agree USPS delivers most of them BUT I can never blame them for poor service. Most of the times, my package is left at my front porch (behind a pillar) and my area has low theft rate (central CA). And in case the USPS employee takes it along, I do not encounter long lines- cause I know the USPS office opens at 8am when there will be no one there. If I am expecting a delivery today and I am too lazy to get it from the post office, then I’ll be sure to open my door when the postman rings my doorbell. I think Amazon is amazing as usual. Local post offices are closer to homes for a reason. And if they are really that FAR, and the lines are really that long 24/7, then shop at Walmart. 😉 [Reply] Dwiniger says: November 27, 2014 at 7:42 pm So true. Waiting on a watch now. Lost tracking of the item after 3 days when it went to Ohio by mistake. I paid for Prime. Item only needed to ship less than 100 miles from origin to my house. Instead it left the state and nobody knows why or can tell me when to expect delivery. Amazon Prime? USPS? What a waste. Amazon literally laughed at me when I called them. They said to reorder another one. Brilliant advice! Defines insanity right??? [Reply] Steve says: November 27, 2014 at 9:31 pm Normal people would just get on the internet at USPS.com and set up a new deliver date, or just call the toll free number to get the item redelivered. Floyd Brown isn’t the brightest light shining… [Reply] Robert says: November 28, 2014 at 6:52 am This article is absolutely stupid. Anyone can simply call the phone number on back of USPS notice and request a new delivery date or just sign the back and write in when you want your package brought back out, it has a section for that on back if you read the notice then simply put in your mailbox and flip up your flag and they bring it back out on day you request. No lines, No fuss…..I love that Amazon uses USPS now. I seem to get my stuff even faster now. [Reply] Annette says: November 28, 2014 at 7:52 am Starting with Floyd Brown, some of these comments are way off. The USPS does not return the amazon packages that do not fit in your box. As a matter of fact, carriers have specific instruction to leave the package at the door step even if no response at the door. Also, as for the FedEx packages that USPS delivers, it may take FedEx a week to ship to USPS; however carriers are required to deliver no later than next day. Track your shipment on the internet and you’ll see exactly what I’m saying. Stop trash talking, particularly when you obviously do not know what you’re talking about. Facts First! [Reply] Shannon Reply: February 17th, 2015 at 3:10 am Untrue, they WILL claim it doesn’t fit in the box. I was supposed to receive a package today but did not. The tracking shows a notice was left that it was undeliverable due to being too large for the box OR that my box was too full. My box was empty of anything, including a notice of any sort. The Amazon customer service guy told me on his end it showed USPS would deliver tomorrow. Everything the author complains about in this post, I have experienced. I am also fed up with Amazon Prime due solely to their use of our horrible local USPS. [Reply] Amy says: November 28, 2014 at 8:28 am I disagree with the post. I have been using Amazon like you from just about the beginning and yes I have noticed that USPS delivers a lot more, BUT I have never had a problem with packages left by my door or somewhere on my porch if it doesn’t fit. NOT once have I had to go to the post office to pick up. [Reply] Lenny Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 12:48 pm Wrong! USPS leaves a little notification in my mail box stating that I need to pick up the package. I have to leave work early to stand in line at the Post Office. More than six times so far since October of this year. It’s pure laziness. UPS and Fedex ALWAYS delivered to my door. like most, I’m at work during the day when deliveries are suppose to be made. Complaining to my local Post Office hasn’t helped. Coming home to a package waiting for me at the door was what made the Amazon ordering process great. That seems to be over now. I have a large number of co-workers that have the same complaint. Annette, it may be different from your experience however, please do a few Google searches and it will become clear to you that this is a problem for thousands of us. Maybe YOU should get the facts first. [Reply] Jamie F. says: November 28, 2014 at 8:36 am You know what’s worse than having to trek down to the postal service? Leaving a package outside my backdoor during a rainstorm that’s been going on for several days! No, not a freak, oops, it ended up raining, a serious rain storm! I’d rather travel a few miles to get my stuff from the postal service instead of having it ruined and get a “you don’t have insurance” excuse, which Amazon does not offer. [Reply] Jesse says: November 28, 2014 at 9:15 am I loved amazon, but now it seems like every order comes from USPS. I have never not had a bad experience with USPS. Unless they stop sending it with them and go back to the old way I will not continue my subscription and just get off my lazy butt and go pick the stuff up at the stores. [Reply] Jan says: November 28, 2014 at 9:21 am I haven’t had much trouble with Amazon, I get my kindle e books from them. Never a problem. Once in a while I order a regular book for my brother who is in prison and they follow through. I never had a problem with returns. They always give me credit back to my credit card and a return label. So Amazon is like everyone else: some like them, some don’t. [Reply] chad says: November 28, 2014 at 10:35 am I work for UPS and the USPS Amazon packages are parcel post and are too small for a driver to deliver it. Many times we deliver to a post office, a huge bag of letters and “smells” this is a way to help the post office out with business, and it helps UPS to focus on priority mail, ex. Next day air, Savers, two days, and just regular ground. When you have an organ on ice that is being shipped to a local hospital…..and you have the latest Nicholas Sparks book for a resident… It is easier to forget the book and give it to the mail service so you can focus on the priority. Hopefully this helps some of you understand this more. [Reply] Dustin Thomas says: November 28, 2014 at 3:48 pm I like the move to more USPS. I get my packages on Saturday or Sunday now when I’m actually home. My block has parcel lockers for when I’m not. UPS just “hides” them under the mat. Let’s be honest. USPS is cheaper anyway. They are lowering prices while UPS and FedEx are raising them. [Reply] Tiffany says: November 28, 2014 at 4:41 pm I think your article is very bias and left out much relevant information. I am an avid Prime user and I have many relatives that work for the USPS. You did not address the fact that you could actually schedule a redelivery online and make a request for the carrier to leave the package at your front step. You also left out that if you have to go to the USPS office for the package, they have a separate line (which is never long) for just picking up packages. Here’s another piece of info your “journalistic” writing failed to disclose: one of the reasons why Amazon did not extend their UPS contract is because they did not meet the 100% tracking protocol, while surprisingly, USPS did. Your article is full of misleading information. I wonder what your intentions were in writing this article? Maybe you want to SABOTAGE Amazon? Sorry, that’s pretty much impossible but your article is high up in SEO when I did a search for the USPS. Guess that was your strategy? [Reply] Quasi reporte^^ says: November 29, 2014 at 12:30 am What a misleading piece of ‘journalism’. Parcels are left at homes, notified via email of delivery time, and not brought back to a ‘dead letter’ office. Sheeeesh, do a little reseach into reality before relying on myths and/ or propagand. You got paid to do this? Sad. [Reply] Kelley says: November 29, 2014 at 12:38 am I’m preferring USPS these days because with UPS it ties me down waiting for the package whereas with the post office, the package goes in the mailbox and I can pick it up at my convenience. Also USPS packages move on the weekends while they stay put with UPS, which means sometimes the package arrives more quickly. To be fair, sometimes with the post office the pack comes more slowly. [Reply] Wendy says: November 29, 2014 at 12:53 pm I remember a few years ago the UPS strike had a lot of eBay sellers unexpectedly forced to use USPS. Quite a few stayed with USPS, finding UPS wasn’t the bargain they thought it was. As to the headache of standing in line for a package, that depends a lot on the LPO and the individual carrier. I’ve had carriers leave fairly large packages on a sopping wet driveway and fairly small packages held at the LPO. But I’ve rarely had to deal with long lines there. [Reply] Mike says: November 29, 2014 at 10:22 pm Floyd, take a 2nd think! You are obviously anti-USPS! I could tell you stories about white & brown! ALL carriers: brown, white, and red-white-blue, have their problems! And, exactly, where do you go to pick up that package that requires a signature from white or brown? Your U.S. Post Office is right there in your community and open. Have a problem with USPS? Call them and let them know. It is USPS policy to deliver those Amazon packages, and on Sundays in many communities. The USPS recognizes packages are their future. They are not perfect, but still provide a great service to us. [Reply] James Whitmore says: November 30, 2014 at 3:30 pm I am a rural mail carrier for the USPS who leaves parcels at doorsteps when they don’t fit in the mailbox – in addition, the recipient doesn’t have to be at home for me to leave the parcel at their doorstep – unless a signature is required. Other rural mail carriers at the post office where I work (Appleton, Wisconsin) follow the same procedure – we try to minimize trips to the post office whenever possible. I am sorry for your poor service and suggest that you contact your local postmaster, who hopefully will correct the problem. [Reply] Jerry says: November 30, 2014 at 6:32 pm First off, the USPS is the most economical way to ship packages. Second, the USPS services every home 6 days a week and is required by the postal regulatory committee. Third, the post office is actually is in the black 6 billion dollars because of its increase in parcel delivery. Forth, the post office provides free insurance and free tracking of your parcels which was a service that we charged for in the past. Maybe you outta get your facts straight before you bash the largest and oldest employer in the U.S.!!!! [Reply] Chris says: November 30, 2014 at 8:58 pm Every time that I have ordered from Amazon in the most recent past, it has been left at my doorstep by USPS. Packages have also arrived on-time or a day early. No issues in Chicago with needing to be picked up. [Reply] EMW Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 6:23 pm I feel the same. I have received all my packages on time with USPS. With UPS, I have to wait for one attempt for delivery, then let UPS know I want them to hold it, then travel to the UPS center across the river at limited times for pickup. I don’t dislike UPS or FedEx but I much rather USPS because it is more convenient. [Reply] Patricia Lynn says: November 30, 2014 at 10:46 pm I have the exact opposite opinion of this writer. My main concern is security. I DON’T want packages just left at the door, and that’s what UPS does. They either knock and immediately leave, or sometimes don’t even knock. I MUCH prefer having packages delivered to the apartment’s secure postal boxes, or having them delivered to my door by the USPS or any company OTHER THAN UPS, because none of them have ever just left a package outside my door where it might easily be stolen. I wish we were always allowed a choice of delivery method, because I would never choose UPS. [Reply] Pete says: December 2, 2014 at 1:31 am I usually get the packages delivered to my office address and I bring them home. That has been quite convenient for me. Pete [Reply] Denny says: December 4, 2014 at 10:17 pm I completely agreed. Just had 154 dollars refunded because the post office marked the items as delivered and I never got them. I decided not to purchase the items again and hit the stores. They are not only going to lose money but also customers. [Reply] Luke says: December 5, 2014 at 10:52 pm I agree with this article entirely. Amazon used to ship only small low cost items by Surepost and Smartpost. Now it seems almost anything can go this route. Here is a typical Surepost shipping experience for me, today is December 5th and the order seems to be lost.

Those who actually frequent real news sources, you know those that actually post sources or links to major announcements such as what you are claiming will know that Amazon is not carrier exclusive. During times of high volume such as Black Friday and Christmas Amazon will expand use of carriers they don’t typically utilize, such as the USPS. Another bonus is if you are a Prime customer and they are late delivering the package you can contact customer service (phone, live chat, and email work) and they will extend your Prime membership by a month or you may get a $10-15 credit to use. If you are not a prime member they will typically refund your shipping costs if it is late and shipped by Amazon. [Reply] Metatrox says: December 8, 2014 at 11:58 am I’m sooo disappointed with USPS. I signed up for prime primarily for the free 2 day shipping. USPS is not guaranteed! Thats not what I pay for! I cant count on them at all. I guess i’ll have to pay the extra for overnight in hopes to get it in 3 days or so! [Reply] Gallie says: December 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm Local USPS has a new contract w/Amazon to “leave if no response.” Several folks in my bldg have had their items stolen, just left on a doorstep on a weekend instead of a pick up at post office notice. [Reply] Joe Reply: December 18th, 2014 at 8:47 pm If you get a USPS account you can give delivery instructions on the tracking number page (eg authorize to leave with neighbor or custodian, put a hold on it etc.).

Customer service is great; if they make a mistake they usually give a gift card credit. Exchanges and returns are simple, just print the return label and drop off at a UPS Store. My packages arrive mostly by UPS still with an occasional FedEx. Since Prime is free two day shipping, if they don’t get it out of the warehouse in time, they overnight it FedEx at no extra charge to ensure I get it on the date promised. [Reply] jason says: December 10, 2014 at 2:28 pm I agree. Ever since they dropped UPS.

He can’t even close the doors on the mailboxes. [Reply] Chris says: December 12, 2014 at 9:17 pm “Dead letter room”??? You don’t know much about the post office do you? I have delivered thousands of Amazon parcels, it’s a fantastic cooperation between UPS and USPS. They fly them to us and process them down to individual offices then drop them off for us to take out, which eliminates the outdated excuse that USPS ruins every parcel. Most of their parcels won’t fit in a standard mailbox, but that does not mean we take them back to the office. We get out and take them to wherever the customer asks to have their parcels placed, typically the door. I have yet to encounter a package from Amazon requiring a signature, but there really would be no difference between USPS and UPS in regards of a signature, if they aren’t there they get a notification which they can sign and put in their mailbox for re-delivery (something ups can’t do, since they can’t use our mailboxes) or go pick it up at the nearest location and, for rural customers especially, their post office is always closer than a ups facility. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:32 am I also have delivered thousands of amazon packages to the door. And we deliver every package the day we get them. Even when UPS brings them late. And we deliver them on Sundays and holidays. And I have only seen one amazon package that required a signature. [Reply] Bill says: December 12, 2014 at 11:02 pm This article is clearly biased against USPS.. Maybe this guy has a lot of UPS stock? I am also a long time and frequent Amazon customer, and the recent change has actually improved my delivery. My UPS depot is on the other side of town, but I can walk to my post office. Also I have yet to have USPS not leave an Amazon package, but I have fought with UPS for years about why they won’t leave a package,. the surly attitude of their drivers, and the way they often smash packages. As much as I wish that Amazon would ditch UPS, I received Amazon packages in the last couple of days from UPS. I also get Fedex and Lasership delivery from Amazon, and have had only minor problems with all of them except UPS. [Reply] Gordon Reply: December 26th, 2014 at 11:27 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 3 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] Michele says: December 13, 2014 at 10:26 pm Fact: Since Amazon signed the contract with the USPS, four (count them, four!) Amazon packages delivered to our Post Office box were immediately and without notification to us *returned* to Amazon as “undeliverable.” We have been Amazon Prime members since 2001. Amazon Customer Service was mortified. We have spoken numerous times to our post office staff, begging them not to do this, to simply do what they would do with any other package we receive (ie, put a notice in our box and we then pick it up). Each time they vacantly nod their head and say they will. Each time our Amazon (and ONLY Amazon) packages are returned without notice to us. And this time – the final straw – was all of the grandchildren’s Christmas presents. Amazon is trying to make up for the incompetence of the USPS by now noting on our account to ONLY deliver via FED EX or UPS to our doorstep. This contract needs to go. I’ve never seen a more worthless group of people. If this is a common occurrence, Amazon will drop them like a hot potato and the USPS will be a thing of the past. [Reply] Marc says: December 15, 2014 at 6:09 pm I’ve got the same problem that Gallie noticed – the reverse of everyone else here. The latest way Amazon is trying to thwart the problem of missed deliveries is to release the carrier from liability for items left on doorsteps. I live in the city in Baltimore, and have had numerous packages, including a $700 camera, stolen in the last couple of months. Unless you, or a worthy neighbor, see a package being left outside your house, it will be stolen in what I would guess to be a matter of seconds. Thieves just follow the mail carrier through town and their Christmas shopping is complete. Idiotic policy. Adding insult to injury, our lazy local mail carrier in Baltimore has since applied the Amazon philosophy to ALL packages being delivered. [Reply] Don Reply: January 3rd, 2015 at 10:46 am Yes, that is my experience in Baltimore too. Have discontinued using Amazon Prime because of its use of the USPS in the Baltimore area.

[Reply] samiup says: December 16, 2014 at 5:05 pm I have noticed a difference. and it is a significant one. USPS delivered my package at 3pm,-when i was at work- the notice they left did not say much, no re-delivery attempt… i went to their website in order to ask for re-delivery, USPS web site was not working as i could not pick up a date from the calendar tool after filling up a long form… Then i said, OK maybe ill just pick it up, their office closes at 4:00 pm… WOW! now what should i do now? take a half day off from work to go to USPS everything i order from Amazon? pretty pathetic. Called Amazon, asked for replacement. the item that was “delivered” will leave USPS and go back to Amazon in 15 days… [Reply] I Do Not Like USPS! says: December 20, 2014 at 2:33 pm Another argument against USPS that no one, it seems, noticed: USPS does its delivery run once a day. So, if package has arrived to your local USPS facility at, say, 12PM, but your postman starts delivery route to your street at 11:59AM, you’re out of luck – you will have to wait extra day for your package. UPS will run delivery routes several times a day, as long as there are packages to be delivered. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:59 pm Maybe you have noticed that USPS delivers to every house on the route…not just parcels like ups, fedex. If we didnt…maybe we could make double runs. Also your carrier sorts and cases every piece of mail on his route as well as loading his vehicle. [Reply] Paul says: December 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm I have the same problem but I don’t blame UPS or USPS. If I have a guaranteed delivery date for the 24th and I’m told UPS will have it delivered then. I then find out it’s not to me but my post office and I won’t receive several items until the 26th. I called UPS and they said that’s how it is . Guarantee date by them but not USPS. This is all back on Amazon on how they ship now. I didn’t know this and I have been buying part of my Christmas items from them for awhile.

[Reply] Richard says: December 26, 2014 at 8:31 pm Thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing up this subject. And for those that are getting front door delivery of your mail and parcels from the USPS, I am happy for you. We moved into a neighborhood with new housing during the early part of this summer where front door delivery by the USPS is not available, by design. Instead, mail and parcels are delivered to a mailbox/parcel container clusters located at selected street intersections. I suppose it saves time and money for the USPS to do it this way. If there are no parcel containers vacant or if the package is over sized for the container, the USPS wont leave it, but will leave a notice in the mailbox to have it picked up. We tried several times to have them redeliver packages, but the problem of parcel container vacancies or package size also determine whether the attempt to redeliver is successful or not. When Amazon was shipping by UPS or FedEx, we would always get our packages delivered to the house, always. Now, we get about 30% of our packages if shipped via USPS. We’ve been Prime Members since 2004, and since October, we have substantially cut down our ordering from Amazon because of their heavy use of the USPS as shipper of 90% of our orders. Amazon should give shoppers the option of which carrier to use in order to work around obstacles like mail box clusters. [Reply] Tasha Miles says: December 28, 2014 at 1:22 am Amen to this author!! I too have been one of Amazon’s Number One Fans since early years. I also order all our small business supplies from them to the tune of 30K+ Per year. USPS is a disaster for me because we live on a rural route and we never get packages delivered to the door. This results in a trip to the post office which is 15 miles away and not well run. I can’t find a solution through Amazon. I’m willing to pay more and /or wait longer for my packages JUST DON’T USE USPS! .. but there is no way to opt out. Why a “can do” company like Amazon pairs up with a “can’t do and don’t want to try to do” government agency like the USPS is beyond my understanding. The results were predictable without having an MBA. [Reply] Calvin says: January 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm My problem isn’t so much that they are using the postal service (live an an area where we have the combined mailboxes), it is that they have increased the cost of Prime and are using a cheaper service altogether (USPS). For me it seems like they are trying to boost revenue and at the same time decrease costs. My Prime membership is about to end this January and I do not plan on renewing. $20 price increase for cheaper USPS package deliveries… no thank you. I can wait a few extra days with all the non-primies.

I used to order and then go to my UPS Online account to have my packages held for pickup. Now since they use the US Mail., I have had 5 packages turn up missing. This is horrible. After my amazon prime membership ends this year I am done with Amazon. Also size of package is not the issue. I have ordered……. 1 Sony PS4 bundle with 3 games. It came in a large box via US Mail… [Reply] Chris H Reply: February 14th, 2015 at 9:00 pm I too have had way too many issues with USPS in our area. So I cancelled my prime account that I’ve had since it started. Amazon pro-rated so I didn’t have to worry about losing money. Don’t wait until your membership is up, end it now and save your money. [Reply] Nick says: January 16, 2015 at 6:58 pm I’m not sure where the author lives, but at my house the USPS carrier places letters in the mailbox at the end of my driveway and packages on my front porch. Granted, I live in the suburbs and not a gigantic apartment building, but still the article is very misleading. The only time I’ve had to go to the post office to pick up a package is when a signature is required and I wasn’t home when USPS attempted to deliver. UPS and USPS are both really good about taking a note with my signature on it and leaving a signature required package as well. FedEx on the other hand is awful. They actually refuse to deliver a package early. Let me explain: say a seller uses ups ground to ship a parcel, that service has a 5 day guarantee. Many times it gets to the customer in 2-3 days, everyone is happy in this instance. Well, very recently I had that very thing happen with fedex, except those crooks actually held my package at a processing center for THREE DAYS before finally delivering it. I saw this on the tracking system with the message “package not scheduled for delivery today”, so I called their customer service department and my god were they awful. They could not have cared less, seriously. I even said that USPS and ups would never do something like this. Her response “well that’s our policy”, justifying NOT delivering it “early” and holding it to deliver on the 5th day. Fedex is also not good at all for working around “signature required” restrictions. I once left a note saying it was ok to leave the package at the door and provided my signature and telephone number, only to come home to a snippy “we missed you” flyer with “must get sig in person” written in pen on it. That fedex “smartpost” someone else mentioned (where fedex does the work from origin to destination city, then hands off to USPS for delivery) is another awful set up. That can often end up being a 8 day service in my experience. Needless to say I’d rather drive to pick up my purchase from the origin than be forced to use fedex again! [Reply] EMW says: January 19, 2015 at 5:56 pm This article is incorrect. The USPS has left several packages at my door. I have not had to go to the USPS to get a package.

[Reply] So...When Will Amazon Start with USPS... says: January 21, 2015 at 8:23 pm I just ordered a 1.4 ounce package from across the U.S. and Amazon shipped it via UPS Ground. *facepalm* So I’d like to know when Amazon will start capitalizing on this USPS relationship? [Reply] Anthony D says: January 23, 2015 at 1:39 am I live in an apartment building in NYC. USPS can enter the apartment complex and happily leaves all packages next to my mailbox without asking, if they do not fit inside. If it’s UPS and I don’t happen to be home (which is always), I have to take two buses and walk to the “local” UPS terminal. I for one am thrilled that Amazon will be relying more exclusively on USPS, though almost everything I order tends to come through them anyway.

Ive been a Prime customer for years and I have always had outstanding service. But since November I have had nothing but trouble. Ive always had issues with the post office and try my hardest not to deal with them. I hate that my packages now come through there on a regular basis and it doesnt make sense. I live in Columbia SC where there is a warehouse. Some of my packages, now that the USPS is involved, leave the Columbia warehouse, are shipped to Concord and then back to Columbia to me. What sense does that make? USPS is the worse and I for one, hope they become obsolete altogether. [Reply] Tricia says: February 6, 2015 at 7:04 am I have my Amazon packages delivered to my employer’s street address because UPS cannot get into my building at home. Unfortunately for me, my employer also has a P.O. box so now that USPS is being used, instead of delivering to the street address they mark all my packages as delivered and put them in the P.O. box room and isn’t physically delivered to me until the third day. Therefore, I pay the Prime fee but don’t get the 2 day shipping as promised. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:06 am USPS is far better than UPS. However Amazon tricks you into thinking you are paying $100 for prime getting free 2 day shipping, while the truth is that Amazon is actually only shipping it normal mail or slower. They get away with it because they have so many warehouses everywhere. But it is false advertising. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:09 am Many times packages sent by UPS still get dropped off by UPS at the USPS for delivery. [Reply] LW says: February 18, 2015 at 8:49 pm USPS is certainly NOT better than UPS for me. The postal service will not deliver to my door since I live inside a gated community and the USPS’s carrier union contract doesn’t require them to deliver inside the gate, so any parcel that won’t fit inside the small parcel boxes must be picked up from the post office — a 45 minute round trip. Super frustrating! I’ve started breaking up my orders into 1 thing at a time — sometimes one in the morning and one in the evening — to try to keep boxes as small as possible with hopes they’ll fit inside the parcel locker. Plus, I figure it costs Amazon a heck of a lot more by making them ship each item individually, so maybe they’ll reconsider allowing their customers to select their own carriers.

[Reply] Reid says: February 23, 2015 at 2:07 pm As others have said USPS carriers marks items as delivered to stay out of trouble for not getting their route finished. Then your lucky if you ever receive item.Next your left proving it didn’t get delivered and good luck with that USPS has no system in place to make sure carriers deliver package. I just had to go to Post Office to file a complaint about 4 packages that say delivered but weren’t. Well guess what they found all 4 in carriers truck in a bag with many other packages from up to a week ago that weren’t delivered. She had been fired they said and it looked like the packages were going to be taken home. No way to know how many end up in dumpsters or worse. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:45 pm Packages left in vehicle would be found the next day. I believe you made this up. Also postal management will scan parcels left in office as attempted because the clerks missthrow them and the carriers are instructed to leave them in a tub or on floor by supervisors desk before they leave. These packages may not be delivered until the next day. Try not to blame everything on your carrier especially if you don’t take the time to get to no them as your carrier. [Reply] Ace21 says: February 27, 2015 at 1:58 pm I am fed up with Amazon because of this. What used to take a few days to deliver a package now takes 1-2 WEEKS. Reason being is my UPS location is in a city 30 miles away. Yesterday, a package arrived at UPS, great, should be out for delivery that day. NOPE. Already gone through this once, I immediately contacted UPS so I could drive over and pick up the package. I was told NO, they are required to turn the package over to the Post Office in the city, which then sits on the package for a few more days ‘sorting it’ to be shipped to the Post Office in the city I live in. Once that finally happens, my local post office then sits on it for another day or 2 ‘sorting’ it, all the while the Post Office is telling Amazon the package has been delivered. EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE I have ordered that came USPS has stated ‘delivered’ when checked online at least 1-2 days BEFORE the package is actually delivered. Today, I just looked, and the post office is stating package is delivered, yet, it is still sitting in a post office in a different city from which I live in. No more Amazon for me if this is the service I can come to expect. I will pay a few more dollars to buy items as local as possible and if they have to be shipped, USPS will NEVER be an option for me as they are the absolute worst shippers I have ever experienced (of course that will vary city to city, but mine is terrible). [Reply] Tom says: February 28, 2015 at 1:32 pm My problem is that for large packages, my local USPS has been claiming “delivery attempted” even though I’m certain this did not happen. Twice in three weeks (original and replacement order) for a large (28 lb bag of dog food) package this has occurred. I was at home both times and there’s no way I (or my dog) missed any doorbell, nor were there any notices. I requested redelivery and the package goes into la la land both times (“delivery status not updated”). IMO this is Amazon’s responsibility. I have to go to the post office to pick it up, I might as well just go to the store. For example, I work for an IT company that provides web hosting services but we outsource to other data centers for the physical hosting. I can’t tell my customers “oh, your site is down, please call the data center”. I take responsibility for the vendors I choose, and Amazon must as well. [Reply] Kyle says: March 4, 2015 at 12:07 pm The business decision Amazon made is one of simple economics (short-sighted, but simple). Of the three major players (UPS, FedEx, and USPS), only one has no shareholders to answer to so that’s the only one willing to lose money on every delivery. Experience with all of these carriers depends, primarily, on the individual people involved (the driver for your route / your mail carrier). If you have a good one (I used to), then you might not even notice that Amazon made that decision. If you have a bad one (I do now), you’ll consider Amazon’s decision to be a bad one. The other difference in the carriers is that you have no recourse with USPS. My USPS carrier frequently scans the package as delivered even though he never even drives down my street (e.g., snow on the ground and no tracks whatsoever). Frequent trips to the PO have only created discord, not solutions. Sometimes my USPS carrier ends up delivering the package in another day or two, sometimes I never get it. Taking it up with the merchant is of no use because the tracking information shows it’s been delivered so I appear to be the liar. I continue to look for online merchants that ship via UPS or FedEx (without handing off to USPS). It’s becoming more and more difficult to find these because – as I stated originally, no one can delivery cheaper than the one who’s willing to lose money on every delivery. [Reply] Nevada says: March 8, 2015 at 12:31 pm Living in rural Nevada, I find USPS services to be the best option for me. USPS does not deliver to my house due to my choice in location, so I head to the Post Office daily. Using a PO Box means I know when I will get my mail and if I have a package a key is left in my box. That key is numbered and used to open a larger package box in the same area. I don’t want things left at the front door of my house. I want them inside dry and safe. Maybe instead of expecting free services from USPS people should purchase the use of a PO Box? There are no lines to pick up mail and it can be convenient. I’ve had really bad experiences with home delivery which included packages being left at the wrong house with Fedex and UPS and Ontrac (being the worst!). However, out of all three UPS is much better in following up with mistakes, but to pick up a package at their shipping department means a 45 min drive (one way) for me! I dislike ordering from companies that use anything but USPS and from my perspective, Amazon made the right choice. [Reply] will says: March 10, 2015 at 10:52 pm USPS leaves packages on the street here. They are too lazy to bring it to the front door. So we’ve had lots of packages disappear. Most frustrating is that we spend a huge some of money on an extra large locked delivery box, and they still are too lazy to open the door (its one way) and place it inside. Maddening.

I threw the pink slip away and waited for it to be returned to Amazon and instead got another gift at the store. The post office is open 9-5 (I’m at work 8-5, an hour away) and then open saturdays 9-1, which meant I either use my sleep-in day to get there early, or suffer the wrath of a dreadfully long and painful wait at the Brooklyn USPS office.

Troy says: March 25, 2015 at 6:15 pm I literally got off the phone with the USPS about this situation. I live in an apartment complex in a small town in the country. I ordered something from Amazon on Monday, with free 2-day Prime shipping. I was home sick today from work – perfect, I’ll be here to receive the package. About an hour ago (3PM), the tracking said “attempted delivery by USPS, notice left” at 9:30AM. What? I was here – no one attempted delivery. Plus, the notice that was left in my mailbox (not until 3:30PM) had the back crossed out – they won’t deliver even if I gave them permission to! Now, I have to wait until Saturday to get to the post office (they are open from 9AM – 5PM Monday – Friday…hmmm, right during my work hours too). To me, that’s laziness on the part of the carrier. Not the first time this has happened, and if I would have known they were using USPS to deliver, I would have spent the extra money and bought it at the store. [Reply] Al Day says: March 26, 2015 at 6:15 pm My experience is just the opposite. USPS delivers to my door while UPS will not deliver at all to my location. Packages delivered by the postal service are usually in better condition than those delivered by UPS when they used to deliver here. So I don’t agree with the synopsis of issues in this article. Amazon now has all their UPS shipments to me going back which tends to piss them off. In time they will just give us a choice or lose our business. All vendors should offer choice so whoever is best where you are can deliver for you. It should never be the vendors choice. I’m willing to pay extra to have FedEx or USPS deliver all my stuff. No more UPS for me. [Reply] Kyle says: April 3, 2015 at 7:46 pm I’ve made over 70 orders from Amazon in the past 6 months, them switching to USPS is a dream come true. I don’t live in an apartment any more, but generally only USPS carriers can easily get into most apartments, which is an enormous plus right there. UPS drivers will often just leave notices without even ringing the bell if it’s not safe for them to throw your packages all the way from the curb to your door. Tampering with legitimate mail is a serious offense, but petty theft if UPS/FedEx; consider the implications for packages that are obviously from Amazon. Finally, I feel like people complain about post offices like they do the DMV – have you ever actually been to one? Mine is huge and beautiful, and there’s rarely much of a line. I know not all of these things will apply to everyone but there’s not much to complain about with regards to the USPS unless you’re a crazy libertarian or something. [Reply] Larry says: April 4, 2015 at 12:16 am I’ve noticed this trend lately myself. I live in an apartment building in NYC and am not always home, but UPS would usually be kind enough to leave my Amazon packages with my neighbors, or at the least attempt re-delivery. USPS? Pink slip for pickup the very first day, without so much as a buzz through the intercom. I’ve missed several packages when I was actually at home because the delivery person wouldn’t take the time to notify me. Then I usually have to wait until the weekend to pick them up, only to be forced to wait in line for 45 minutes. On top of it all the employees at the local post office are rude and sarcastic, and actually raise their voices at the customers. I’ve already started shopping locally to avoid the dreadful post office, or I order items from Amazon that I know will fit inside my mail box (which they don’t always leave in there anyway). And the Amazon Dash button, you’ve got to be kidding me, who in their right mind would wait 45 minutes in line to pick up paper towels when they could spend 5 min for $1 more, or sometimes even pay less? Sure those dollars add up, but so do the 45 min. Would you rather have spent 5 hours and 40 minutes picking up paper towels over the course of a year, or $12?

There have been a few times I had to wait an extra day because I wasn’t home when the package arrived. But mostly I just have things shipped to my office – which is open 7 days a week. To be honest, I feel that Amazon’s deal with the USPS has added value to my Prime membership. Sure they might have kinks to workout, but I think it’s a good thing in the long and short run. [Reply] Vandy Reply: April 7th, 2015 at 8:15 pm I’ve noticed many fewer products are being allowed to go to Amazon Lockers, at least in my case. I order lots of business supplies, books, and clothes through Amazon, and stuff that usually goes to a Locker now must come to either my home address or my P.O. box. Fortunately, I already have a P.O. box in my city and I go once a week on Saturday mornings (if I’m in town) when the lines aren’t that long. We have a separate line in my P.O. branch for picking up packages ONLY. Doesn’t mean it’s not a long line, but it’s separate from regular window services. I don’t want to see the USPS go under. It’s an institution that should be allowed to run and I’m 100% against privatization contracts that the capitalists like Obama are proposing and now sticking us with, such as they just signed with Staples. Staples employees are not fit to run a Post Office. But then I’m a communist. Never underestimate the hypocrisy of capitalists, though. They’d sell their own mothers for a quarter.

I cancelled my prime membership and don’t use them anymore since they switched to USPS final leg delivery. USPS is a joke. They don’t deliver packages to my house because it has a long driveway. I’ve met USPS at the street and they hand me a ‘We attempted to deliver your package” notice. To top it off, the notice always says I can pick it up the next day at the post office, but 80% of the time they don’t have it ready so I usually have to wait 2 days after the ‘guaranteed’ delivery date. Also, this is a way for FedEx and UPS to offload costs onto taxpayers. As is usual with corporate-government corruption, profits go up, service goes down. Screw all these hucksters. [Reply] Terie says: April 13, 2015 at 1:36 pm For those of you complaining – I complained too. But, I took my complaints to Amazon and they put in my account to NEVER transfer any of my packages to the post office. Once they made that notation, I have not had any further issues with the 2 day shipping. Nothing is taken to the Post Office anymore. I now have to give that information to all of the companies that are doing this. I hate seeing that my package will be delivered a certain day and then discover it won’t be for another day because it was sent to USPS. Then it takes at least another 2 -3 days. Unacceptable. That is why USPS gets no business! [Reply] Sean says: April 17, 2015 at 5:12 am I would like to say that yes, the postal service has terrible customer service in my city. I worked as a carrier for all of one month after graduation from University, and the structure and idiocy of my local post office made it impossible for any educated or markedly skilled employees to remain there for any amount of time and keep their sanity. My “manager” called me every 10 minutes on my cell phone while I was out making amazon deliveries, causing me to be slower than needed to make these deliveries (yes, to the front porch.) The carriers that I was hired along with tried hard to get the mail delivered on time and correctly, but the constant berating from management to “go faster!!!” resulted in most people either cutting corners or quitting after a couple weeks. The system in place is setup for the idiots to eventually take charge, while the hard workers end up finding more lucrative work elsewhere. This all shows in the service that customers receive from their post office nowadays. I bet most of the people who are now having problems with their mail had no problems 10 years ago, and this is a result of the current system of allowing the inmates to run the asylum. The post office is a case study in what not to do as a company, how not to treat your employees, and how not to treat your customers. It is lunacy and idiocy at its finest and I don’t expect to see it around 10 years from now if they don’t make some serious changes in management. Amazon is backing the wrong horse in the name of profit, but they are only hurting themselves in the long run. The Post office is not capable of keeping it’s promises to Amazon.

They will just leave them on my doorstep, or sometimes they will deliver in the evenings when I am home, so I accept them in person. My local UPS driver is polite, friendly, and is always on time. I have received packages via USPS before, and I have to leave a note on the mail box to give them permission to leave my bigger packages on my porch. I don’t know if this is the case for any of you, but I’m not sure if they are allowed to leave packages without permission. I have ran into this before and now always leave a note when I am expecting something via USPS so that the post person knows what I want.

There are a couple of times when I thought it would be delivered to my door step but it ended up in my mail box but I have made it a part of my routine to check my mail box. My experience has been a little different, as they still left the bigger boxes outside my door step. Atleast the good part is that Amazon has joined hands with a sinking business and hope this helps USPS employees from losing their jobs. [Reply] miguel says: May 3, 2015 at 9:26 am USPS has time and time again missed my 2day delivery dead line. The tracking always says its out for delivery but never arrives that day. Then they update the tracking saying I wasn’t home but they never left the sticky note on my door which means they never even attempted. Then the post office holds my package for a day and attempts to redeliver the following day. So 2 day delivery turns into 4 day. This is the gunhill road post office in the Bronx. The employees there don’t care about their job and delivering on time. I run a business and use amazon prime as a means of getting my supplies. But without reliable delivery times I’m starting to question if i should find alternative means. When my packages get shipped via FedEx or UPS I never have an issue. But more and more they are using USPS. Bad move amazon. There’s a reason why nobody uses them. Shouldn’t your partnerships be strong ones? This is a step backwards and a bad business move. [Reply] phototristan says: May 6, 2015 at 1:28 am USPS consistently forgets to deliver Amazon packages and never even leaves a notice. I have to manually try tracking it to find out that is at the post office and I have to then go pick it up. Most of the time, the driver just doesn’t feel like delivering the box and it sits in the truck. So many times, I’ve been home only to not receive the package and track it online later only to find out they say ‘attempted delivery, notice left’ to cover their own butt. In reality, they did not attempt any delivery nor did they even leave a notice for me. I’ve also try their online redelivery service with shoddy results. Sometimes, they don’t even redeliver. Last Christmas, they even lost a package from Amazon. USPS has completely flakey service, terrible customer service and no follow through for the actual delivering of shipments!

My package was scanned to Brooklyn, NY 11214 where I leave on Friday morning, and then was sent to NY, NY 10014, then NY, NY 10199 and than to Brooklyn, NY 11256 (this all happened between Friday and Sunday), finally this morning my package was scanned at Brooklyn, NY 11214 my area code and I am still waiting for delivery. I wasted a beautiful Saturday stuck at home waiting for this package which was already late, because of course it could not possibly show up more than 24 hrs late (wrong). The last ten packages which I had delivered to work where handed off to my mail room a full 24 hours after the package was marked delivered. I will not be renewing my prime membership if they do not move back to using UPS. Amazon was great and refunded my shipment. Gave me a $5 credit toward a future purchase, and then extended my membership by one month. Highly disappointed in their decision to make a deal with USPS because they are notorious for not delivering mail timely if at all. Disgusted with the way my package was handled. [Reply] Kimberly Neal says: June 5, 2015 at 12:51 am This is an odd piece for a couple of reasons, however , as a carrier I must correct the author by saying “STOP SPREADING HYSTERIA”! Dead Letter pile if you’re not home?! Nonsense! USPS unlike UPS will decipher if it’s safe to leave your package, where we should leave it, who with, and if we are unable, we will leave a notice. We will not just cram it in to your mailbox. We will not just toss it on the porch leaving it in front of God and everybody… Say do you own stock in UPS?! [Reply] Cathee Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 6:44 pm Agree… this article is FULL of idiotic mistakes!! Was this written for the ONION? Pathetic what this guy believes, and ARROGANT to spew his ignorance as truth. [Reply] Michael Jenkins says: June 6, 2015 at 6:09 am The author is spot on. I live in a development where my USPS mail comes to a group of mailboxes. If and only if the item won’t fit in the mail box will USPS deliver to my door. Problem is the mailboxes for the development are in a room that locks at 7pm daily and isn’t open on Sunday’s. What this means for me is that I no longer get my Amazon prime items delivered to my door. And if I can’t make it to the mailroom by 7 (I work 12 hr shifts) I won’t get my prime items for days!!. I asked the postal delivery person to please deliver Amazon items to my house. I got a VERY Stern no, that is what the larger mailboxes are in the mail room. Postmaster said the same thing. No we WON’T deliver to your house. When my prime expires, I won’t be renewing. Amazon has lost my business. [Reply] Tim Scott says: June 16, 2015 at 3:39 pm USPS has entirely stopped delivering parcels to my townhouse. Instead, they place “Attempted Delivery” cards at our mail house. BS! I work from home, and know that delivery was not attempted. After a year of this, I’ve cancelled AMAZON PRIME and will only order online if it’s guaranteed UPS or FedEx. [Reply] bruce says: June 29, 2015 at 8:16 pm I am a Rural Carrier for USPS and UPS and FED_EX leave parcels at the mailbox because they are too lazy to bring them up the steeper driveways. I always bring them up and leave by front door or garage. Maybe instead of calling your carriers idiots or other names offer them a cold water and ask them to leave the parcels by your door. If you get a slip just go online and request redelivery [Reply] John Reply: September 29th, 2015 at 12:39 am Requesting redelivery does nothing. My USPS carrier is refusing to deliver packages he deems too heavy. I know this because of the last package he refused to deliver. I filed a complaint and they fessed up that he said the package was too heavy, but still refused to deliver it. Which is odd, because normal carriers like UPS or FedEx use things like hand carts to move around heavy packages. I also doubt the women at the front desk of the post office are going to move the package around any easier than the postal carrier could. Funny how the front desk staff at the post office have to move the heavy package around, but the actual carrier doesn’t. So on this latest package, Saturday(2 days ago), the carrier lied and claimed there was no secure place to deliver on the delivery slip. Of course I had two USPS packages scheduled for delivery on Saturday. The heavy one was not delivered at around 8am, just the slip was left. The lighter one was delivered around 2 and left on my porch without issue. So much for a lack of a secure location. I filed for redelivery for today and instead of getting my package the status on Amazon updated to “Sorry, your package is delayed because of an issue with the carrier.” Even when the carrier gets called out, they still feel comfortable refusing to deliver packages. Very nice job security, you can’t get fired for refusing to do your job. I know I am never going to see that package from Amazon, it was prime pantry, so maybe Amazon will do something since they want prime pantry to work. Last time they resent the heavy item and laughably it was resent with USPS when Amazon said they would put a note on the order to use a different carrier. But it got delivered on a Sunday and I think they have different people delivering on Sunday, so that time the carrier left it on my porch. With USPS it is simply up to the carrier. Some people have carriers that deliver anything and some people have carriers that refuse to deliver everything. It is hit or miss. I filed a complaint about the fact that the carrier lied by saying there was no secure location, at the very least if the carrier is refusing to deliver because the item is too heavy, they need to put that real reason the delivery slip so Amazon knows it is a carrier issue. It is annoying to have to explain this to Amazon when Amazon’s system is telling them there was no secure location, it makes the customer(me) look bad. USPS should not be lying on these delivery slips. So that is where I am. I can only get light packages from Amazon. If anything is heavy and comes via USPS, there are no guarantees I will get it. My only question is how long will Amazon let me order before they just kick me off despite the fact that they are the ones who chose the carrier? [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:49 pm Any carrier, regardless of the company they work for should be instantly terminated for refusing to deliver a package. Job description shows up to 70 lbs lifting. If carrier has some sort of disability or restrictions other qualified employee should deliver your package. If your postmaster does not take care of this problem call the Senate. You will see a difference. Shame on anyone out there who works and does not care about customers. You are customer as well and treat people way you want to be treated unless you are real JERK. Sorry but it is what it is! [Reply] jamie says: June 29, 2015 at 9:30 pm I am a letter carrier in a small town. Half of the Amazon packages we deliver are straight off the UPS truck. I asked the driver why and he said residential deliveries arent worth our time. That is the company you want delivering your packages? Also, in my town we deliver straight to your door, no matter how small or large the package. We deliver 100 percent of the Amazon packages everyday in my town. The writer of this article has no knowledge of how the post office works. Dead letter room. The dumbest thing I have ever heard. Do some research. USPS: Cheapest and most reliable. [Reply] matt Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 5:16 pm Thank you for beating me to this!!! I love how he writes the post office couldn’t survive without Amazon. People don’t realize the post office was forced to payout future employee retirements. What business wouldn’t take a hit when being forced to do that? It is also one of the most reliable companies in the world. [Reply] Nikki says: July 2, 2015 at 5:53 pm My UPS and Fed Ex deliveries are delivered right to the door always. The Post Office hangs everything in a sack swinging off my rural mailbox out on the road. It is over a city block away from my house and they leave stuff there in a plastic bag in the pouring rain or whatever. I can’t even see it’s there plus anyone driving the road can just stop and steal it. A lot of stuff has gotten wet and been ruined. I’m elderly and am unable to walk or drive to my box and have to wait for relatives to pick stuff up for me. It’s very unkind as I’ve known the mailman all his life. Guess he doesn’t care. [Reply] dave Reply: September 22nd, 2015 at 12:51 am Nikki, you can request your mail and packages be delivered to your door because of health reasons. We have folks who are disabled or aged who we will go right up the driveway and deliver to your house everyday. There is a form to be filled out from your postmaster, but when approved we do what is called a dismount, and bring mail to you so you do not have to go to mailbox. Hopefully this helps! [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:42 pm Nikki, Rural Letter Carrier should never leave box hanging on the post or your mailbox. If you are less than half mile away from the box package should be delivered to your door unless can fit in the box. If your carrier does not care, consumer affair cares. Also, like Tom said get letter from your doctor and all your mail, (not just packages) will and should be delivered to your door. It is called HARDSHIP and can not be denied. [Reply] Tom says: July 3, 2015 at 10:35 pm I am a letter carrier in Spokane, Washington with 28 years experience. In the last year and a half we have seen a huge increase in Amazon packages, and exactly a year ago we started delivering Amazon on Sunday, using temp carriers. Now that nearly every package has a tracking barcode, it has become painful for us to not give good, on-time service, because if we don’t, the supervisor may hear about it on the phone, then the carrier will hear it, and no one likes to hear customer complaints, especially from the people that we serve and interact with every day. Our scanners now upload instantly, and customers can go to the website and track their packages in real time. One of the strengths of the ol’ post office is the national forwarding system. It is not uncommon for someone who has recently moved, to order a package from Amazon or eBay, for example, and forget to give them their new address, resulting in the package going to the postal unit that delivers to their old address. (I see this happen every month.) It takes a few extra days, and there might be a forwarding charge, but it does usually get forwarded, whereas if UPS or FedEx get such a package, they will deliver it erroneously and then will probably get to go pick it up again (if the new people give it back), and return it. I have nothing against UPS or FedEx. They have their respective strengths as well. UPS rates are much higher than USPS rates for packages under ten pounds. There seems to be a large percentage of the public who don’t notice that when they ship via UPS, UPS takes its profit and then farms the package out to USPS to deliver at the lower rate. From the viewpoint of UPS, this looks like a really good deal. From the viewpoint of customers, it does not look like a good deal, or it should not, anyway. The problem with all delivery companies is that they use people to do the work. Not all people care about the customers they serve. I certainly do, and want to give the best service possible every day to everyone on my route. We just heard an inside word that Amazon is about to terminate using FedEx and UPS for the most part and use mostly USPS. This will cause some problems with people who use P.O. boxes for their mail, and it will be interesting to see how this is solved. [Reply] Stephen Walsh says: July 20, 2015 at 1:03 pm I’ve accepted the fact that I will never receive an Amazon package delivered via USPS on a Sunday. My local post office uses the tactic of saying they delivered it in the system so Amazon thinks it was delivered on Sunday, but the package isn’t placed on my doorstep until the following day. [Reply] Melinda Miller says: August 3, 2015 at 8:19 pm To the hardworking dedicated postal workers who have posted, thank-you for your excellent commitment to service. However, I believe it does matter where you live whether you get good USPS service or not. UPS and FedEx have the same issues. If the Postmaster of the local post office don’t care and follow-up issues and complaints, why should the delivery personnel care? There are lazy people in all businesses. You may think people are crazy with some of their complaints of non-delivery but they really do happen exactly the way they say they do. I ordered something for my daughter and it went “out for delivery” never to be seen again. The next thing I mailed noted out for delivery on a Monday and a tag for postage due showed up in her box on Friday, she works from home. A letter posted to her in her state took 5 business days to arrive. She can go 3 days without any mail and then get a large pile. I, on the other hand have excellent mail service. People make the difference in the service, not the organization. [Reply] Lee says: August 9, 2015 at 10:00 pm Well I just got my first taste of the awesome USPS /Amazon partnership! Three different deliveries show as “delivered” to “front porch/door” on the USPS tracking site, but not one package on my porch and I have been home all day doing work around the house, I would have either heard the door or have seen the packages (in fact I believe I was walking my dog right out front at the time!). USPS service has been poor in my area, lots of mis-delivered mail and they have lost two “priority” packages of mine in the last few year. And as others have noted, they are a unaccountable. It’s bad news for Amazon, the biggest reason of all I have been such a huge customer is the shipping. I like the fact you can see the date something will be delivered and know you can count on it. I’m willing pay extra sometimes for a product just so I can have the ease and confidence of shipping. The author is correct, they made a deal with the devil and have destroyed their core competency by teaming up with worst delivery service on earth. [Reply] Randy K says: August 20, 2015 at 11:01 am The USPS is responsible enough to ensure that your package isn’t stolen, and according to this “article” that’s bad for the customer? If the customer leaves a not for the mailman that says “Please leave all packages at back door” or a similar note, then the package will be left there. This was obviously written by a UPS employee that feels threatened. A strong Post Office is good for the American people. UPS has to make a profit to keep their shareholders happy, they don’t care about the customer only the bottom line. For the Post Office, the customer IS the shareholder so they have an incentive to make the customer happy. Does UPS deliver to every house? NO, they only want the high profit stops. How about the Post Office? YES, it’s called “universal service” and is protected by the US constitution. As far as the false statement about the “Dead Letter Office” that’s total B.S., mail only goes there if it cannot be returned to sender because there is not return address on the package. [Reply] Matt says: September 22, 2015 at 10:44 pm I found this thread because of the huge problems I’ve been having with USPS and Amazon. The packages get in a weird place where they never arrive anywhere, they leave Amazon never to be seen again. Fortunately, Amazon has been good and sent the items next-day FedEx (when I ALWAYS get them!) Can’t be cheap for Amazon! In fact, last time, they even comped the item and sent it next day. I think Amazon is starting to see the light. USPS is having problems. My magazines were always a few days late (weekly magazines). Now they are weeks late. Sometimes multiple weeks of a weekly magazine will show up at the same time. [Reply] Boss says: October 8, 2015 at 9:23 pm With respect to all of you, I have to disagree for some of the issues. In Rural America USPS is still best option to get packages whether from Amazon, Ebay, or anyone else in the world. Billions of packages are being processed trough different distribution USPS facilities. Every package dropped to local Post Offices have to be delivered same day. Also Holiday and Sundays delivery are available. Amazon premium packages are delivered by unmarked vehicles mostly rental and these guys are blowing up stop signs and traffic lights like crazy. Worst and dangerous delivery services ever. When it comes to magazines again is distribution facility. If you have problem with USPS you should not post it here; call consumer affair, Congress or Senate Offices and your problem will be solved 100%. No one likes to have bad feedback but Amazon delivery packages are bad for customers not for USPS. USPS is still most trusted federal agency. All USPS employee went to extended background check. Best wishes and better delivery to all of US. [Reply] schnauzer says: October 27, 2015 at 2:44 pm I have a one for all of you. I ordered an item that was supposed to be delivered on Sunday, 10/25/2015. Well, it never made it, but that is par for the course when the USPS is involved. So I waited to see if it would arrive late. Today the USPS truck pulls into our driveway, and the driver TELLS ME she delivered it Sunday, to the WRONG address; then she asks me, if I eventually received it ok. While Amazon isn’t the problem here, the USPS is. I went in and cancelled all my future orders with Amazon, and I will buy from whatever website, or local retailer, where I don’t have to deal with USPS. Imagine that, delivered to WRONG address, the the USPS drivers ASKS ME if I received it ok. Hey – who is the delivery person here, anyway?!

And if they aren’t home I will text the customer and ask if it’s ok to leave with a neighbor or on their back porch. I notice the new help we hired really seems to bring back a lot of packages and mark them “dog.” Umm, bro, they don’t have a dog… [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:48 pm OK So I go to the Amazon Website, Purposely pay more for an item because it says if you want it tomorrow order within the next 3 hours and pick next day delivery. Pay extra for the delivery and then the next day they show estimated arrival of By 8:00PM. At the same time and on the same page there is no tracking info and they sow it as being in process of shipping. I chat with their rep at 3:00PM and am told the item is on the way and will arrive at 8:00PM (Note: My office closes at 5:00PM) so I wait for the item to arrive. At 8:18 no delivry, no update on the website so I chat with the again and am told it is in the warehouse being prepared for shipment?? I ask when it will arrive and they do not know?? I think Amazon has gotten too big and is forgetting who their customers are and how to treat them. I asked that all of my pending orders be cancelled as I will source my items alsewhere and was told they could only cancel two of five and guess what. The one item I’m waiting for is not one of them??? [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:52 pm USPS has made every excuse in the world not to deliver. They lost a printer (obviously it was stolen). They claimed my address did not exist?? When calling the postmaster about the address issue I was told “It was the Amazon Driver” Yes, the special Amazon delivery person that works for the USPS…? I’ve been told of delivery attempts that never happened as you don’t come near my house without my dogs barking. USPS has tried to stick me with Postage Due… Bad Move, Amazon. [Reply] Me says: December 5, 2015 at 11:28 pm This year every freaking UPS package has had issue and been delayed. They got re-scanned and delayed one business day when they showed out for delivery at 6am (NW Houston) all my USPS packages have been early or on time. Every now and then they put small packages in my mailbox. Most the time they drop them at my front door ring or knock at the door. Not sure why you guys are having issues with USPS but it’s services has been better than UPS for me. [Reply] Me Reply: December 7th, 2015 at 10:57 pm UPS just delayed again out for delivery. I was home all day working, they never showed up and went back to the center again. No reason listed, just delayed. UPS is crap. [Reply] Wayne in NC says: December 11, 2015 at 7:12 pm I need to say I have never worked for USPS and neither has any member of my family or any friends. I detested SmartPost and SurePost where UPS or FedEx turned over packages to USPS for delivery because the packages were usually late. Of course, I am an Amazon Prime member and have been since it was introduced. For the last year USPS has delivered almost all of our Amazon packages (there have been over 200). Everyone has been either on time or early. The postal delivery person brings packages to our front door if hey do not fit in our mailbox. They also deliver on Saturday AND Sunday. USPS has been at least as reliable as UPS with our Amazon Prime deliveries. Even large and heavy package are delivered to our front door on time by USPS. I have not been a fan of USPS for many years and I doubt whether the service needs to exist at all. But I must give them credit for their 100% on time delivery of over 200 Amazon Prime packages during the last year. They have also delivered packages from other online store on time 100% of the time. [Reply] JW says: December 12, 2015 at 6:02 pm This situation is also very bad for me as the USPS does not deliver to my address.

[Reply] Mark says: December 25, 2015 at 10:49 pm UPS is the worst company and their employees that work in the hubs have worked Sundays for years and been away from their families for years because of the Amazon volume which UPS handles less than adequately both in delivery and the treatment of packages. The best thing for Amazon would be to leave UPS for good! [Reply] Puddy says: December 26, 2015 at 4:32 pm I have stopped using Amazon. I lived on a private road and usps does not travel on private roads. We did get one delivery to our door 2 years ago. The postal lady was complaining because she said usps signed a contract with Amazon that 2 day was 2 day, even on a private road. They must have Un-signed it because I thought it would neat to have some bulk items sent to our door 2 weeks later. I got a slip in our kiosk and had to make a 40 mile round trip to pick up my package. Also, if you notice, in rural areas, postal employees have to use their own cars. They use the smallest and most economical so half the time a big package won’t even fit in their car. And to think the post office used to be great! How the mighty have fallen. Nothing to do with Amazon, but let me say this is Saturday and a Christmas package was mailed to us this past Monday, with 2 other packages, from the same address. 2 packages made it and the 3rd, a box with an Xbox one and $100 Amazon card still shows it sitting 2 states away. It was scanned late Monday evening and seems to have disappeared. [Reply] Cliff Claven says: January 2, 2016 at 6:26 pm I’ve read this entire comment thread, largely siding with USPS workers. They, like our public schools and prisons, have to serve everyone, yet they are maligned and derided without thought given as to how difficult a task that is. However, I was promised an Amazon package today, for delivery to my PO Box. It’s Saturday, and the post office closes at 3PM. The package made it there, but according to the lady at the counter, after the cutoff for distribution to PO Boxes. So my goods will sit in a local post office all day Saturday and Sunday. I can go in and pick them up Monday (but not until after 10AM), 48 hours after I was promised them. My order arriving at the post office and my order arriving in my hands are two very different things to me, but apparently not to Amazon.

Now today tracking states “carrier delay has occurred.” I’m never paying for Prime again. [Reply] wow says: January 21, 2016 at 10:34 pm holy crap.. how unbelievably lazy does this article make you sound. unreal. [Reply] NoPrime NoMore says: January 31, 2016 at 3:10 am Like the author, I loved Prime because of rock solid reliable delivery. My stuff was always where I expected it when I expected it with accurate online tracking. This was especially important to me because I work 100 miles from my home, so I’m only home on the weekends. I could order stuff on Tuesday and be sure it would be on my porch by Friday night when I got home. Similarly, I could order on Thursday and have it be at my “work crash” on Monday or Tuesday. Now, with the weird combination of using USPS directly and allowing UPS and Fedex to drop work on USPS at the last second (“last mile handoff”) the reliability has gone to pot. Tracking will look good, say delivered, and the item was not there. Turns out it was delivered to the post office — 40 mile round trip from the home. The USPS does their best, but they won’t deliver to my doorstep, only to the mailbox out by the highway (1/4 mile away). Anything bigger than a breadbox ends up getting a “attempted” note. Even when delivered, it’s an extra day or two. That extra day often meant an extra work week before I got my stuff. Since this USPS change I feel that the two day shipping commitment was not just broken, it was utterly shattered. I’m sure things are better in the burbs, but in my rural area it’s a dismal development. It’s not because of bad USPS people, the local folks are doing their best. It’s just a bad idea. Prime became so unpredictable that I cancelled it and just used the money to help pay for a spot at a mailbox store near work. I now only order free shipping stuff from Amazon, have it delivered there, and I order a lot less from them. I’m ordering more from their competitors as well. I’m actually mostly OK with that, since more of my money is going to local small business instead of the Seattle yuppie. Still, I miss getting my stuff reliably delivered to my doorstep. All the other prime stuff doesn’t matter when your best connection is sub-1-mbit DSL. Prime was worth it because of the shipping, only the shipping, and always the shipping. Not any more. [Reply] Dean P says: February 11, 2016 at 12:31 am I rarely have problems with FedEx, UPS, or USPS, they are all good around here. Amazon is a different story though, I’m not a Prime member, never have been, never will be. Amazon’s order processing is my complaint, in my experience it slowed down very much from what it was a few years ago. The slowdown was gradual but increased until it seemed like Amazon was just sitting on almost every order for days, then for days and days before getting them processed and out their doors. Finally I just gave up and only use them for research and the very occasional order. eBay has become my go-to shop, I carefully peruse reviews on Amazon then go look up the item on eBay, after checking out seller ratings and such, I order. I usually get free shipping but with no minimum purchase required, and yes, I compare prices with and without shipping costs so I know if I’m getting a better deal or just equal to Amazon. I usually do better on eBay. Mind you, you absolutely HAVE TO check out seller ratings to buy from good people, I don’t like any seller with less than 99% positive, it seems like I have problems with lesser ones. Amazon can take a flying leap at a fast train for all I care. And eBay is starting to have buyer reviews too, not many yet, but it’s coming. [Reply] Daniel Lewis says: March 16, 2016 at 5:31 am The USPS situation is very aggravating. I sure do miss the days UPS would leave the package on my porch if I didn’t happen to be home or get the door in time. Now I, like many other Americans, am faced with the dreaded “Delivery Attempted” Pink Slip. The current mailman, who is supposed to deliver parcels in the morning now comes to our house with his Pink Slips pre-filled out and doesn’t even make an attempt to deliver any package over a certain size/weight determined by him! Well I got tired of it. So tired in fact that I took the morning off on the day that I knew there was a package to arrive. I filmed his deed and the conversation I had about it with him. The recording has been accepted by his boss who also gave me the number for the Postal Inspectors (PI) who he said would be able to handle it with a heavier hand. Apparently postal workers get away with a lot and their immediate supervisors’ chidings go on deaf ears. I’ve complained to the boss a few times and he’s fed up too, thus the PI involvement. You don’t have to put up with the poor service by lazy postal workers. Stand up to the USPS and you’ll be surprised to learn that they are nothing more than another service industry. Granted, it is a lot harder to make a complaint that actually effects change, but postal workers like their jobs, especially in our current economy. If you push hard enough they will come around. [Reply] William` says: March 21, 2016 at 3:35 pm It is no surprise when a notice is received or you look on line and track your item with Amazon displaying that your order was delivered. Anytime you are dealing with the “USPS” it is a big maybe with luck that your order will be delivered on time. Amazon should step up to the plate and let you know that though they promise it’s delivery time of your order on a specific date, once the USPS get’s a hold of it, it becomes only a possibility of being delivered on the date promised. Time and time again at our corporate office individuals come up to me commenting that their order is showing that it was delivered, and I have to go through the tedious process of explaining it is probably hovering somewhere at the US Postal Service Office, and hopefully you will receive it in a day or two. Hey Amazon! stop making promises you have no control over. [Reply] Maria says: April 7, 2016 at 12:10 pm I am considering cancelling my Amazon Prime service due to issues with USPS. I don’t want to pay the Amazon Prime fee just to have to drive to the post office in Kingston, NY to pick my packages up because the carrier who delivers mail to the house is too lazy to get out of her truck. USPS is so unreliable and in this case, incompetent. This carrier even misdelivers other people’s Amazon packages to my house; I can’t even imagine where some of mine have ended up. They scan a package as delivered when the package is not delivered, and Amazon has to pay to replace your shipment. I’d rather pay an extra fee to have my orders shipped by UPS rather than deal with the guessing game of what’s going to happen when I place an order. AMAZON you are NOT saving money if you have to constantly replace people’s orders due to USPS bumbling and fraud, and at some point, your Prime members will go elsewhere. [Reply] Ellen says: May 27, 2016 at 3:47 pm I am having the same frustration. Amazon Prime used to be UPS, and regardless, the USPS in our town used to actually deliver packages to your door. After an incident where a mailman got into a fender bender, the regional office made a policy not to drive up driveways where they would have to back up. They only deliver if you have a large, circular driveway. Never mind that my house is about 10 yards from the mailbox. Now, as others have mentioned, Amazon Prime delivers by USPS, which will only leave a slip, not even load the package on the truck, which results in an at minimum one day delay picking up the package. And you have to take time off work. [Reply] Rick says: June 13, 2016 at 4:51 pm I just discovered last week that I had been changed from UPS to U.S.P.S. for Amazon Prime deliveries. I live in Murphy, NC which is a pretty small town. We moved into our home in late February. I have had approximately 24 deliveries form either UPS or FedEx, ironically sometimes they pull up at the same time but don’t talk to each other! My problem is U.S.P.S. will not deliver any mail to my home. My mailbox is about 6 tenths of a mile from my home at the bottom of a small mountain. There rule is if your mailbox is more than 1/2 mile from your home they will not deliver any parcels to your door. So now, every order I place with Amazon is not even attempted for delivery, they just stick the notice of delivery attempt ( what a joke ) in your mailbox. If you don’t pick up the item the next day it will be returned to Amazon. I have spoken with 2 Amazon CSR’s and 1 Amazon CSR Supervisor. Not one of them claimed to know about this agreement with U.S.P.S. I would surely hate to stop using Amazon, I have been a Prime member since 2007. It looks like Amazon has gotten too big for it’s britches. [Reply] Trent says: June 21, 2016 at 9:16 am The problem I have with USPS is not that I ever have to go to the post office to pick something up (never have, never will–Amazon will refund me before I do). The problem is USPS sucks. And sucks hard. I frequently get mail that belongs to my next-door neighbor. I have to wonder how often my own mail never reaches my own mailbox. Packages? Often, they’re supposed to be delivered, but the USPS driver overlooks it. I know this to be the case because there have been a couple times I’ve been working outside, seen the USPS driver pass my house, then drop a package right before leaving the neighborhood. I’ve also seen “Out for delivery” status change to “Delivered” even when they haven’t delivered it. This means they forgot. So far, I’ve gotten it the next delivery day. And right now, a package that was supposed to be delivered today was misdirected by USPS, and is in the entirely wrong state. No idea when I’ll get it. I get that USPS is cheaper than UPS, but there’s a bloody good reason for that. I’d GLADLY pay extra for UPS, Amazon. [Reply] AROD says: August 6, 2016 at 7:44 pm Management is at fault with most of what goes on in the post office. All they are worried about is the carrier street time and that the carriers should be back by 5:00 PM…atleast in NYC. All they do is rush, rush, rush. They are not concerned about the service some carriers provide. [Reply] Vickie White says: September 5, 2016 at 9:37 pm Wow I am overwhelmed by all the negative responses to USPS sunday and holiday delivery for Amazon. First off I want to comment on the mailbox situation. If you don’t have the very large mailbox that many small and medium packages fit in quit your bitching. Your mail carrier is not responsible for rain, theft or your dog that they cannot tell is a threat by the bark and beware of dog signs that are posted. There is no reason on GOD’S earth you need anything other than a prescription delivered on a Sunday or a holiday. Not to mention that by ordering on line you support other countries economic growth but not America’s. So get off your lazy asses and go to a store and support your community and shop there. No worries then about where your purchases end up or when they arrive at your home. Disgruntled postal worker. [Reply] mark rouse says: September 8, 2016 at 4:12 am I will take USPS over UPS any day. I have never had an item lost or damaged by USPS be it shipping or receiving. Cant say the same thing about UPS. [Reply] Dan Brown says: September 15, 2016 at 9:04 pm I think people are having differing experiences is because the work ethic and morale isn’t constant across the Entire USPS. Some major mail hubs are horrible. They also have different delivery tactics in different areas. One mail carrier will concentrate on just packages, and in more rural areas they will be handled by the regular mail carrier. The USPS is also starting to hire private contractors, especially in more rural areas, not always the best trained or qualified. Also, some mail hubs are better than others. Just track a package coming from NYC through New Jersey, or anything going through Allen Park Michigan. [Reply] Ellen in NH says: September 16, 2016 at 2:49 pm My experiences with USPS is horrible when compared with other carriers who deliver very well. My daughter is in an apartment in Burlington, VT with a suite of mailboxes. There are larger boxes used for packages – when a package arrives, a note is put in the mailbox to look in the package box. Works well except on days when more packages arrive than there are boxes available. Then USPS puts a redelivery notice in the mailbox and expects my daughter to pick up at Post Office – problem is there are two PO’s serving that zip – so yesterday she had two slips for going to two different POs for packages. She fills out the slip to have it redelivered to no avail. Doesn’t happen. There is management office upstairs with locked mailroom. All other carriers drop there and the office delivers. USPS won’t because the package is in daughters name, not Mgmt company (but all other carries do it). I’ve asked for a waiver to sign to say they can be delivered to Mgmt office if boxes are full; USPS won’t do it. Instead they take the package back with them and leave the redelivery slip that starts the cycle over for 3 times and then package returns to sender. Geez – I wonder why people are using USPS less and less – could it be the lack of common sense ? Just have students sign a waiver saying the Mgmt Office is OK to leave parcels at. Heck, Fedex and other companies don’t even need that. It is, after all, a locked mail room. Also – I sent a package to my nephew at Christmas. USPS is supposed to use a security code to put package in secure gated area – if they did, he would have received. They didn’t It was DC area, he never got. But heck, I shipped it express, it was insured, so no worries, right? Wrong. They said I needed to prove they didn’t leave in gated area – they didn’t pay. Really? Is that good customer service? I wish Amazon would allow me to pick a carrier. USPS would not be it. [Reply] Bob Fricker says: September 28, 2016 at 11:18 am Misery… USPS delivers to our community mail boxes with shared parcel (larger) boxes. They put the key to Box “F” in our mail box so we can get the parcel… Key Does Not Work! Can’t seem to catch the mail carrier when she delivers and she can’t see the notes we leave in our mail box it seems. Our items are sitting that parcel box 4 or 5 days now. Neither the USPS or Amazon make it easy to remedy the problem of “Delivered” be a misrepresentation of the facts. If you deliver it to some place that I can’t get to, that is not a proper deliver. I see part of the problem as one of poor customer service. USPS is hard to get help from. Try waiting an hour or more for someone to help you on the phone, for example. Try picking your way through their web site and not being able to find any menu or information that addresses your problem, for hours. I don’t tolerate poor service for long as both entities may soon discover. [Reply] Cindy M says: October 1, 2016 at 1:07 am USPS is refusing to deliver packages to my home. They mark my boxes as Vacation Hold and I have to go to the Post Office, wait 30 minutes in line and carry the box to my car myself. Today I picked up a box that was so damaged they gave it to me inside a big black garbage bag. They refused to ship the item back to the sender. I’m currently waiting for a refund from Amazon. As for the Vacation Hold, the postal worker told my that my letter carrier does not want to carry a heavy box, so he marks it as Vac Hold. That alone is unacceptable, but one of the boxes was small enough to fit in my mail box but he still marked as Vac Hold. UPS and Fed Ex are awesome in my area, simply the best. Since Amazon is using USPS I already canceled all my Auto Shipments and will not be renewing my Prime Membership. I will not be buying anything on Amazon until they stop using USPS. If I have to wait in line and carry the box myself, I’ll just shop at the brick and mortar store, at least they have shopping carts. [Reply] sam says: October 26, 2016 at 7:16 pm Get off your but and go shopping then none of this would be a problem. [Reply] Jeff says: October 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I stopped using Amazon except for the smallest items that I know will fit into my mailbox. I’m going to get a refund on my Prime Membership too because they are not two days any longer. I’ve spent probably around 40 to $50,000 in 4 years at Amazon. That now is being cut down around 90%. The icing on the cake was, a package has been sitting at the post office since October 6 and the 3 times I went to pick it up, the line was 10+ people with one window open. So, I just notified Amazon to take it back. $150 item. Goodbye Amazon. It was great while it lasted. [Reply] Prime says: November 2, 2016 at 10:10 am I thought it was just me. No wonder why every customer service person I spoke to on Saturday wouldn’t answer my question of “why was my package sent via USPS?” They also didn’t respond to me when they’d say, “thank you for being a Prime Member” and I’d say, “I might not be after today.” I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and had to drive to 2 different post offices to get my package. The post offices were open, but didn’t answer their phones. I brought that up to Amazon and the post offices when I went there in person, and no one would talk to me about that. Glad I found this article…….bye bye Prime. [Reply] Matt says: November 12, 2016 at 11:28 am I never had an issue with FedEX, usually don’t have an issue with UPS, but always have an issue with USPS. Either the package is marked delivered and its not or most times, it gets shipped back to Amazon as Package was undeliverable. I wish Amazon would display under an item that delivery is via USPS, so that I would not order the item to start with. [Reply] Steve says: January 4, 2017 at 6:47 am I wondered who this 3rd party was that picked up from the shipper to take to USPS. My first text alerts from USPS always says the item is being waited on from this 3rd party (UPS) because it was picked up by a 3rd party… then i do NOT get many informative updates from USPS… sometimes not untill the package is out for delivery by my local mail carrier!!! USPS just appears to NOT KNOW WHICH END IS UP! Delivery has degraded a huge noticable amount since USPS was given this responsibility… but I’m starting to really really wonder if Amazon cares?? It’s ALL ABOUT THE $$$ !!! [Reply] Matt G. says: January 5, 2017 at 3:20 pm In Chicago, UPS sucks! They don’t deliver your packages. Instead they drop them off at a pick-up location with a few miles of you for you to pick up yourself. I pay for shipping or a membership for free shipping to have my items deliver to my residence not some scummy laundromat across town! The USPS or Fedex is far better where I live! UPS’s increased volume of packages to deliver because of increased online ordering is not the consumer’s problem, it’s theirs! Hire more drivers! [Reply] Kelly says: January 16, 2017 at 9:30 am Yes, because no one lives in apartments or condos or other buildings, so everyone clearly has control over what type of mailbox they use. [Reply] Kelly says: January 16, 2017 at 9:35 am Seriously, does everyone who commented on this article believe “I’ve had this specific experience, so therefore everyone else who claims their experience is different is wrong”? Congratulations on having a competent local USPS branch. That doesn’t mean everyone else’s branch operates exactly the same as yours. It’s a big world out there; one individual’s anecdote does not equal undeniable fact. [Reply] Mark says: January 30, 2017 at 2:20 pm USPS is bad where I live. Its funny, Amazon thrives on giving people a choice of competing products. Why not shipping? I now give my product reviews an automatic -2 stars for amazon’s policy. We should have the choice for shipping companies as well. Jeff is now a business idiot. I not only down rate the product, but the merchant for letting them ship their product without my choice. Tic Toc ! [Reply] Ak says: February 2, 2017 at 2:36 am I am a carrier with USPS. There is no way you have had, you said 10 packages, scanned delivered and not be. Every item we have with a barcode is scanned at your home or box at time of delivery. When the scan is made “delivered” our scanner tracks exactly where it was scanned. If the item does not fit in your box we bring it to the door. You may have had notice left/attempted scans. In that case there is some reason you have been made aware of why it could not be delivered. No carrier is going to risk their job scanning a package “delivered” when it hasn’t been. [Reply] Sergey says: February 6, 2017 at 7:58 pm Wow! Count your blessings. FedEx, UPS and USPS have always managed to deliver to my place (albeit with occasional minor issues). Whoever Amazon is using these last 6-8 months, is not. Last order got sent back after they claimed thy made two delivery attempts (I was home both days; saw nothing of the kind). I can no longer count on getting anything from Amazon. [Reply] Wesley Miller says: February 22, 2017 at 10:18 am Be friendly to your mailman. My guy is Carlos, he is hispanic and he voted trump. When I first moved in, Carlos sent a load of my business mail back. Me and Carlos had words and I made it very clear my mail was to be delivered, any mail addressed to my location was to be delivered, regardless if the box was overstuffed, etc. It was an honest mistake on his part but we came to an understanding and now all of my packages are delivered, all my mail is delivered and he has even gone back to the post office at 3 and on his way home dropped in shipments scheduled for the next day a day early. Carlos is the best mailman one could hope for. I’m sorry you guys have crappy delivery people. Complain about your mailman specifically, ask to speak with them and they will come out to you and you address your concerns with who delivers your mail, you tell them you have a carport on the side for hot days so they leave your packages in the shade, etc etc etc. It’s not rocket surgery. [Reply] Vic says: February 24, 2017 at 8:44 pm Ive been with Amazon since 2001. Have been a Prime customer since 2010. Until this week service has been flawless and have only had to contact Customer Service once. This was because I misunderstood the fees involve with using gift cards. Ive orders a little over one thousands dollars in products from Amazon over the past six months. This does not include numerous digital downloads. Last week I ordered a pair of gloves. Received a text indicating that they were delivered to my mailbox by USPS. No gloves. (Let me also state that we live in a secure gated community where mailbox theft is non-existent). My wife’s Amazon order that was shipped via UPS did arrive. Contacted Amazon support. They were outstanding and immediately shipped a replacement. I then ordered a set of screwdrivers. Here its the end of the week, I have received text messages indicating that the replacement gloves, and that screwdrivers have been delivered to my mailbox via USPS. Nothing has arrived. In frustration I drove down to Target and purchases a pair of gloves. Amazon please understand. Folks were accustomed to going to the store, touching, feeling, and being instantly gratified by their purchases. It was an adjustment to wait a few days. But people made the adjustment because Amazon was consistent and reliable. Once that is lost People are either going to go somewhere else that is reliable and consistent or they’ll turn back to stores. The United States Postal Service (USPS) has been operating at a loss for many years. I suspect that Amazon has tied its rope to a sinking ship. Maybe Amazon should consider cutting that rope before they drag Amazon under with them. [Reply] Mike kensley says: March 1, 2017 at 8:57 pm The only reason I used Amazon was because they delivered in two days to my house, now USPS I have to go stand in line, I still use Amazon but much less, Amazon go back to ups and FDX, PLEASE [Reply] Carson says: March 6, 2017 at 10:42 am Just wanted to throw in my 2-cents, in case just one more post on this topic will get Amazon to fix the issue. (Not holding my breath.) I needed a package on Monday. I ordered it on Saturday and requested 1-day shipping. The package was shipped via USPS. How can USPS do a 1-day delivery when it doesn’t deliver on Sunday?! On Monday morning, I had to track it down at my Post Office, and tell them to hold it, lest it be stuck on a delivery truck. Then make plans to go to the PO and get it myself. [Reply] Chris says: March 8, 2017 at 7:58 pm USPS is the worst thing for AMZN. I know this because I’ve been a loyal, almost exclusively a shopper at AMZN for the past ten years. In late 2016 when AMZN apparently shifted most of their packages to USPS, I haven’t received at least 40% of the packages. They claim to have tried to deliver – and I work at home, so I’m home virtually all night and all day. I placed 354 orders with AMZN in 2016, so I’m a decent personal account for them, I guess. But apparently they don’t care. The Post Office called me and said “We have a room full of packages for you from before Christmas (this was in February).” I said “Yes?” And they said you have to come pick them up and I told them I wasn’t able to take off from work. So they had to send the packages back. Perhaps if more people who do that, AMZN would cut their losses and drop USPS. I’m done with AMZN.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links and the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1). The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2). the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now.

Even everyone new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income may go much very high over time... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they?

Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market.

Did they make it lighter or does it still suck as always? TouchWiz is the only big thank in Samsung phone that makes me look the other way. Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability?

Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release.

Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat.

Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus?

Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using.

X In search of the American experience Michael Collins introduces three stories by two writers he has mentored, army veteran Steve Carlsen and SJ Dunning about 17 hours ago Updated: about 16 hours ago Michael Collins, Steve Carlsen and SJ Dunning SJ Dunning and Steve Carlsen         A central part of a writer’s life these days, with the proliferation of writing programmes and festivals offering master classes, is teaching. Since I retired from Microsoft, I’ve led a transient life, living from the west to the east coasts, and like a travelling salesman hawking cures, I’ve advertised my arrival in the local newspaper, offering free weekend writing classes. It’s a way to establish a sense of place, to find friends and to give back. I do it less now, with four adolescent children, but this transience defined our life for a time. Given the advent of online home schooling, it wasn’t difficult to circumvent so-called normalcy and the anchor of place. I’d unhitch the family from normal life, and we’d hit the road. We roamed America in an RV (a 14-metre bus) which I bought on the cheap from an elderly couple whose retirement was truncated by the husband’s terminal illness. We met the couple along the Oregon coast in the misery of a windswept winter storm, along miles of Pacific beach. I was then training for the 2010 World Championships. The couple was enamoured by our transience and courage, by the fact that we had four kids at the time, and were sharing the isolation of a beach with them, in what we then owned – a small caravan. It was one of their last trips together. The interior of the RV’s bedroom was set up like a mobile infirmary. The couple were in the last year of goodbyes, a deeply personal road trip of memories that would be carried into eternity. In so observing them, my wife and I took measure of our own strength, our own endurance and what matters – family. We agreed to financial terms on what was an extravagant RV, really, a rock-star affair with appointed track-lit mahogany cabinetry, granite countertops, satellite TV and a tow package to drag a car. It was the couple’s gift bestowed upon us for simply being there with them in our collective aloneness that solitary weekend. The old man played solitaire with an attenuated feebleness, in the lick of his thumb and the unfolding of each card. He smelled of liniment and was dead less than six weeks later. We picked up the RV after the disbursement of assets at a giant hanger where so many of these dreams are auctioned off in the failing health or death of those who had envisioned a longer run of years. Encounters like this inform a life. I’ve found that the act of dislocation reunites people, that in the off-chance of meeting someone, someplace remote, a bond is thus formed. You are at once commiserates on the same journey, mutually paused along the way station toward some indistinct endpoint. I believe there are appointed moments of revelation. You just have to go find them. It’s how I’ve managed life as an immigrant and ultra-runner in the second act of my post-Microsoft days. Much of it is wanderlust, but there are the pragmatics, too, of preserving my legs and joints. As a family, we’ve ventured to remote locations along coastal waters, then turned inland for the mountainous Northwestern, ventured further west, down along the Rockies. I’ll leave at some appointed trail and then disappear for the better part of a day for one of those solo 75-mile training trail runs that provide the foundation for 24 hour ultra-running races. Out around Montana and the Dakotas, it’s different. I go there for the scorch of summer, for the punishment of miles and the reach of my own limits. The terrain is less steep, but more remote. It’s Big Sky country, Unabomber Ted Kaczynski territory, I call it – a land occupied by outcast characters, pilgrims of a modern displacement who end up embracing a Thoreau-like solitude. I’ll come upon them encamped on outcrop vistas, ever vigilant. You run enough like this into the wild and eventually you feel the trained eye of a sniper tracking you. I’ve come to accept the terms of the terrain and the potential cost. Many are ex-military, taciturn and equipped for solitary survival with their rucksacks and bibles. Yet, if encountered under the right circumstances, at a trail head, or a mountain pass at 9,000ft, you can find a point of commonality, probing eventually what is almost always a psychological wound of some distant war. In between these runs, we park at a campground or a Walmart parking lot and I start answering emails from prospective parties interested in my weekend writing sessions. Most will have vetted me as the genuine article, as runner and writer, offering this once in a lifetime encounter to begin mapping out their life story. I could describe countless such encounters and characters, but in the waning days of this month-long extravaganza of posted articles by myself and various associate writer friends and academics, I thought I might simply introduce two of the most enduring characters I met during these encounters, because I feel that the full reach of the American experience rises from the lived experience of those unselfconscious characters who sometimes emerge and begin a story. Sometimes, the greatest asset a teacher possesses is the simple act of listening. I’ll not take from the stories which The Irish Times has so generously agreed to publish, but to say that the voices which find their way into my own work are informed by a realism and backdrop of the characters I’ve met throughout my American travels. I met Steve in a bleak Rust Belt mid-American town. An imposing military figure, he showed up under the utilitarian glare of a community college night class in a winter of deep snow The first writer is Army Specialist Steve Carlsen, who, as a member of the 1st Battalion 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, served on a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo from 2001-02, then redeployed in the wake of 9/11 to Afghanistan between 2002-03. I met Steve in a bleak Rust Belt mid-American town. An imposing military figure, he showed up under the utilitarian glare of a community college night class in a winter of deep snow. I was asking people to tell their stories. He was a high-school graduate and army veteran. That was his bio. There was no small talk. Steve came with a horrific story. Early into his deployment in Afghanistan, he witnessed a father bring a burned five-year-old girl to the edge of a US military base. Defiant, the father demanded compensation for an alleged missile attack by US forces. The girl, burned almost beyond recognition, yet still alive, was simply set before the barracks as a grim effigy of America’s overreach in its indiscriminate capacity to maim and kill. Steve had a poem memorised which he had written about the child. He cried when he read it. The actual story proved more complicated. After extensive investigation, an assessment of military operations, and an interrogation of the girl’s mother, it turned out that the daughter had been doused in gasoline and set ablaze by her father. He had been anticipating a $2,500 compensatory allowance the US military was authorised to distribute under the unfortunate and regrettable circumstances of civilian casualties. For Steve, the young girl defined his time in Afghanistan. Her eventual death revealed the stark underlying truth of what a people or a father might do to survive. There was no rebuke of the man’s religion or ethnicity. Steve Carlsen, prototypical warrior, career-hardened soldier, would see and endure the loss of three comrades, and yet back home, in the aftermath of his service, he used to drink and have nightmares about that little girl. What Steve produced in my time with him, and what appear here in the selected stories published by The Irish Times, are instances of compassionate insight that were forged in the firmament of battle, where a young man, wrest from a winter’s bone existence in the dead-end of the Midwest, assumed the valorous role of soldier in his deployment into the atrocities of Kosovo and then the mire of Afghanistan. Steve Carlsen bears the burden of America’s greatness. When called to serve, he did so. In the fallout of a post-military life, he returned home and sustained himself by his wits, providing for his family as a mechanic and hunter. He flies the American flag proudly and voted for Trump. There is nothing braggadocious in his person, or in how he speaks of his military past. Nor is he incendiary in his politics, save that he believes each man should provide for his own, that a sense of independence is lost in a welfare state of big government. For this abiding belief, he votes a conservative ticket, not out of ill-compassion, but because it’s the American way. SJ Dunning was delivered to me in a trip into the Northwest. She will forever remind me of one of those provocative – dare I say feral – waifs who inhabit the Pacific Northwest SJ Dunning was delivered to me in a trip into the Northwest. She will forever remind me of one of those provocative – dare I say feral – waifs who inhabit the Pacific Northwest, the sort of mysterious, brooding individual made famous under the glare of grunge music. Then the world looked away. She remained. I say feral in the sense that she knew everything and yet had a shyness about her, a containment. Her instincts were toward a rural homestead self-reliance. She wore workmanlike jeans low on her hips and a plaid shirt, or she did when I knew her. She was young then, still finding her voice, and though our encounter was brief – a transient series of classes offered at the University of Western Washington, and some mentoring over drinks at shabby bars – I understood she was in search of the sort of story that eventually arrives if one is patiently attentive and willing to endure long suffering. She was. We kept in touch over the years. A writing teacher, if honest, will be brief, advance quiet direction, and be guarded in the absolute praise of a writer still on a journey. What we developed was a truthfulness, an ability to simply correspond from time to time, Sonya emerging from the chrysalis of deep hurts, edging ever closer to that defining story – first, her parents’ divorce, and later, in the emergence of her own fate as writer, amidst the seismic shift of what can happen when devoid of family and friends, the American economy tanked, leaving her bereft of home and money. What she did was pick up her pen. The piece published here by The Irish Times reckons with the fallout of the House Crash, a calamity familiar to Irish society, but in this memoir-in-progress, Notes from the Field of Foreclosure, it’s a story of physical and social integration, peculiar in its American telling. To describe the style – it is mercilessly objective, mercenary in its details, in what a daughter and father signed up to do in the foreclosure aftermath – trashout properties, removing the belongings of people whose homes had been repossessed. There’s an abrupt matter-of-factness, a daughter and father measuring the “lives of others in cubic yardage: the washing machine in the garage is one cubic yard, and the projection television anchoring the living room is probably one and a half. The more trash we remove, the more we get paid.” And yet in the dissolution of other lives, there’s an absolute honesty, a self-reckoning with what one must do to survive. There is no artifice, no apology. All is documented in the aperture of a camera lens, per the bank’s demand, in shots a daughter takes to pictorially document the loss. We learn eventually that the father is dying of cancer. It’s a stated fact. Little sentimentality is allowed. Time is money and money is what is needed, so nights are spent in rundown motels in the advance of a new day and a new trashout, in the scavenge of others’ lives. Perhaps it is why I chose to share these two writers with an Irish audience – for the moral agency and immediacy of what each conveys, how each situates their stories within a stark, unsettling realism. At times, I believe America asks more of its citizens, or challenges them with the simple act of trying to survive. In the best American writing I’ve come upon, the stories register a moral accountability, and a self-awareness that doesn’t necessarily end in righteousness, though, in their telling the stories are always direct and so well observed, so well witnessed, that the least I can do is listen! SJ Dunning on the road For(e)closure By SJ Dunning I want to say I am an expert on foreclosure – I feel an onus to provide a sturdy framework for what follows, to be more well-read on the subject than most – but even reviewing titles of books chronicling the mortgage crisis and foreclosure proves painstaking. The Rise and Fall of the US Mortgage and Credit Markets: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Market Meltdown. The Foreclosure of America: The Inside Story of the Rise and Fall of Countrywide Home Loans, the Mortgage Crisis, and the Default of the American Dream. For the past couple of years, I‘ve been maintaining foreclosed homes throughout the northwest with my father for a property management vendor contracted by mortgage lenders like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. My expertise is hands-on. But all I’m certain of is that foreclosure is damned laborious. *** Entering a foreclosed home is usually straightforward enough – my father retrieves a key from the lockbox, opens the door – but sometimes we must “break and enter”. It‘s 2010 – a mild day in June, and my father is wielding a giant screwdriver in one hand, a wrecking bar in the other, breaking into a split-level home through a basement window (we couldn’t get in through the door). “This damned window!” my father says, his whole body in a lunge. To lighten his mood – this window is more stubborn than most – I regale him with my imaginary soap opera version of foreclosure, an absurd spin-off of soaps my mother watched when I was a child. In These are the Days of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Fannie and Freddie are unwed lovers sharing a mansion with marble floors, ornate chandeliers, gold-plated trim and baseboards. Fannie collects Fabergé eggs, gestures dramatically when she speaks. Freddie smells of scotch, likes to gamble. In each episode, the couple hosts a party for Wall Street bigwigs “in their ballroom the size of this split-level,” I tell my father. When discussions of foreclosure arise, Fannie and Freddie are nonchalant. “Let them stay at the Hilton,” they say, seemingly oblivious to the personal hardships of those whose homes they’ve repossessed. “Commercial breaks are for home loans…” my father adds. The camouflage-print bandana he has tied around his bald head is saturated with sweat. “Realize your dreams through home ownership,” I say. But reality ensues in homes like this one, and it rarely matches those dreams. Upon notice of eviction, men and women wander through bedrooms, and living rooms, and kitchens, hurriedly packing up what they can of their belongings. “Lights flicker, televisions turn to static,” I explain. “Power service disconnect,” my father says. I‘m peering over my shoulder now, hoping nosy neighbors won’t mistake my father for a burglar, and me for his accomplice. Or what if the former residents of this home happen to return for something they forgot? The latch snaps. My father crawls through the window, and I prepare the camera, waiting for him to open the front door. *** What we do is called Initial Services: securing the property, completing the “trashout” (removing what remains in the home) and performing the maid service, miscellaneous seasonal maintenance, and an inspection for damages (sometimes homeowners flood or burn their homes in an act of defiance). For three days, we’ll become surrogate-residents of the split-level. The photographs we’ll take before we begin our labor, as well as during and after, will prove to the lenders its transformation. “The photographs have to tell a story,” my father reminds me. “Shoot the address outside. … then the entry way from the front door … the living room … every room … from different angles.” He demonstrates, and I follow him, snapping the photographs in stride. “And get LOTS of the trash!” I photograph the messes we‘ve been wading through, and I open drawers, cupboards, and closets, photographing what’s inside them. The “before” photographs document the story of a homeowner’s departure. Some take with them as much as they can; I’ve photographed ceilings with wires hanging down like frayed nerves from holes where light fixtures were, and walls with gouges the size of a man’s chest where bathtubs once concealed a network of pipes. We decide a family of four or more lived in the split-level, and they took only what could be hauled in armloads – the suitcases are gone, but we find clothes hanging to dry from the shower rod, a couch, bookshelves lined with books and photo albums, children’s drawings taped to the fridge, the shelves inside the freezer filled with moldy TV dinners. In this line of work, most everything becomes trash. We measure the amount in cubic yardage: the washing machine in the garage is one cubic yard, and the projection television anchoring the living room is probably one and a half. The more trash we remove, the more we get paid. But our pay isn’t anything to brag about once we’ve subtracted the costs: fuel, U-Haul rentals, dump fees, our nights at Motel 6, general wear and tear on the pickup – not to mention upon us. Sometimes I’m not entirely sure why we keep doing what we do. We’ll remove two 17ft U-Hauls’ worth of trash from the split-level: we’ll photograph ourselves lifting 68 cubic yards – approximately 3.75 tons – into the truck by hand, and then we’ll take photographs again as we unload it, some of it at local charities, the rest at the dump, where we’ll turn heads, tossing contractor bag after contractor bag over the edge as fast as we can grab hold and let go, and heaving the furniture the charities turned away. It’s probably frowned upon to keep things for ourselves, but I’ll stuff a letter a mother wrote to her daughter into my pocket, anyway, and a child’s drawing of a bird, imagining my creation of a website called Foreclosure’s Lost & Found. We‘ll return to the split-level to photograph our performance of the maid service and to check for any trash we might have neglected to remove before. Every property must be as empty and as spotless – inside and outside – as humanly possible before we take the after photographs. The real Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are picky: no footprints across the floor, not a hair in the sink, not a streak on a windowpane or mirror, not a trace of ash on the sidewalk from where one of us might have stamped out a cigarette. *** “We’ve got to get this damned thing out the door!” my father says. He‘s hunched against the upper half of the split-level’s staircase, bracing the projection television against his back – a Levi’s-clad Atlas holding up the world. I’m squatting above him, gripping the bottom corners of the monstrosity, hoping the slip-grip on my gloves won’t give. Together, we weigh less than the television – it’s at least 300 pounds. If gravity wins, if we let go, it will crash down the stairs, taking us along. Two days ago, when we unloaded furniture at The Salvation Army, the delivery driver said he’d pick up the television but that his insurance “doesn’t cover stairs.” So for two days, we have pretended the television wasn’t here. You’d think that after lifting 3.75 tons (twice) moving a television would be child’s play, but the thing’s sheer magnitude – its potential to project life-sized cinema upon its screen, to frame our reflections in full – lends it substantial animus, as though it were purposefully resisting our efforts to bring this trashout to closure. “Don’t try this at home,” I joke. I support the television with a knee. I grip it with all my strength. *** SJ Dunning as a child Memories of my own childhood home, of my once-whole family, are framed by a flashing television screen. In a video labeled Christmas Eve at Home 1987, my older sister Tyrah and I tear open presents in the living room as my mother spins the knob on the stereo, searching for a station without static. When my father hands her the camcorder, she films Tyrah holding up a boxed Barbie’s Dream House, its cross-section glossy, its walls colorful, every room filled with furniture. “Daddy will have to put that together,” my mother says and then turns her attention to me and the china doll I’m unwrapping. “She’ll get broken,” she warns. “Don’t take her out of the box.” How am I supposed to play with a doll I can’t touch? My parents hand off the camcorder again and my father films my mother as she slides tiny earring-backs onto earrings he bought her, diamonds surrounded by deep red gems. He zooms in on her ear, and she tucks her soft blonde hair out of the way. “They do something in the light,” he says. My mother films my father in his new summer blazer, and he insists it fits him just right. “Everyone gather around Mommy,” my father says. Tyrah and I cozy up to her as our father rests the camcorder on the coffee table and enters the portrait he’s staged. “Smile,” he says, and we do. *** The footage is suspect. I can guide that VHS tape into my VCR, push play, and I’m inside that home, inside that portrait again, but not long after that Christmas, off-screen, my father told me it was over – that he and my mother were getting divorced, that all I once thought to be wound so tightly had come undone. He sat on the steps of the front porch in a T-shirt and cut-off Levi shorts, with his bare feet planted on the bottom step, our two-storey country home rising behind him, its windows placed like eyes. A cigarette dangled from one hand as he gestured with the other, trying to explain what had happened. I sat beside him, wondering what it would mean to hold fire in my hands as he did, what would become of the little girl I knew myself to be within the home behind me (a home I wouldn’t be able to call my own much longer) when the flame he was holding burned out. *** The corners of the television pinch my palms. “Screw Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac!” I say. “Let‘s just leave the damned thing here: ‘Spacious split-level with complimentary television’.” “We‘ve gotten it this far,” my father says through a half-laugh. I ease down a step, letting the television slide toward him. I ease down another step, fearing how this all might end-the television slipping, its screen fracturing, mechanisms of projection spilling across the floor. By a haphazard method involving a nearly empty five-gallon bucket of paint and a block of wood – items we forgot to haul to the dump – and our own sheer will, we manage to get the television down the stairs. We alternate resting it on the bucket, and then on the block of wood, moving it stair by stair until it lands on the floor of the entryway with a thud. “Will it fit through the door?” I ask as if I’ve forgotten what we’ve already maneuvered through this door and so many others. “I’ll unhinge the damned door if I have to!” But we’re able to tilt the television, turn it, and guide it at last over the doormat my father put down over the threshold. If my father isn’t Atlas, he’s MacGyver, I decide: we’re making do. “That’s that,” he says. *** My childhood home stood in the mouth of a canyon in the outskirts of Ellensburg, Washington, a small town in the center of the state – “the Heart of Washington,” according to the local newspaper. The quarter-section of land where it stood can be traced in title transfers back to the 1800s, to the popularity of manifest destiny, to the roots of home ownership as a coveted characteristic of the American Dream. The earliest available record indicates that the US Transcontinental Railroad sold the land to Byron and Stella Chisholm in 1894. Three years later, the Chisholms sold the land to a mortgage company. Information on the heads of the mortgage company is scarce. According to newspaper archives, there was a lawsuit (decided in their favor) about a race track near the river, and one of the two heads of the company was noted for hosting a Euchre party at his home – I imagine poker instead, cigars and scotch. Maybe I am just a cynic, but other records seem to indicate that the pair’s business practices weren’t entirely scrupulous. At one point, for example, they attempted to use their mortgage company to pay off unrelated debts in the Sandwich Islands. Does this behavior suggest a 19th-century prelude to 21st-century predatory lending as I’ve interpreted it? The scenario seems fitting, if not entirely accurate. The mortgage company eventually sold the land in 1911 – fair and square, as far as I can tell – to Francis M Standley. According to a penciled note on one of the home’s original boards, and from what I’ve been able to learn, dizzying myself reading microfiche, the home must have been built by Standley in 1912 – back when homes didn’t have foundations, when insulation was made of newspaper scraps, if there was any insulation at all. My father says Standley might have ordered the home from a Sears catalogue. Sears’s model no. 115 (1908-1914), a 6-room Modern Cottage “with wood foundation, not excavated” bears a close resemblance. My family enters the scene in 1928 – specifically, my grandfather’s second cousin, Lily (Dunning) Pope, and her husband, Gil Pope. The Popes owned the home and raised sheep on the surrounding acreage for the following forty-five years – until Gil died of cancer. My grandfather had been close to the Popes for much of his life; having no children of their own, they considered him a son. Lily sold the property to him and my grandmother after Gil’s death in 1971, and they rented it to friends and family until my parents bought it in 1980, the year Tyrah was born and two years before I entered the scene. *** Lily’s estate sale drew hundreds of buyers. The headline for the article published in the local newspaper described the sale this way: “It was a Great Day for an Auction – Bargains Galore and You Name the Price.” Lily described the event in her journal differently: “This is a day I will never forget, and I never want to go through another like it again.” She stares out from a small photograph in the article, her lips slightly pursed, a cap covering her short white hair, wrinkles running deep around her eyes. Lily relocated to a mobile home set in a field bordering the home where my grandparents lived, a few miles down the road from “the home place”. She recorded the coordinates of her “tin can,“ as she called the mobile home, in the same journal where she recorded the serial numbers of her pistols and rifles and the births and deaths of her animals. According to the newspaper article, the mobile home “had less than enough room for all her possessions”; she took her horses and dogs “and every fine piece of furniture she could fit”. Tyrah and I slept in beds Lily left behind. *** During the first few years of my childhood, the home still had no insulation, no foundation – it couldn‘t hold the heat. My father woke up late one winter night, tiptoed past our bedrooms, and checked the indoor thermometer downstairs, which read 39 degrees, even with the woodstove loaded and hot. The next morning, he cut a pillow-sized hole in the floor beside the chimney so heat would drift directly upstairs where everyone slept. I remember lying near the metal grate he set there, staring through to the floor below, being told I’d fall through if I wasn’t careful, and I remember the makeshift steps that led up to the front door when the house was lifted so the foundation could be poured. By the time of “Christmas Eve at Home 1987”, the house had been set back down and the interior remodels were in progress. It‘s possible to see a large piece of plywood masking a hole in the wall where my father removed the original fireplace – the plywood decorated by pages torn from a coloring book. Insulation is exposed where other sections of wall have yet to be replaced. The doors and windows are new, and plastic covers the lampshades of shiny brass lamps atop matching oak end tables on either side of our new blue shell-backed couch. The living room of my home today is a partial replica of that one-those end tables and that couch have followed me into the present. But, here, on this side of the television screen, I am a spectator; I can no longer believe there is a foundation beneath me that holds everything in place. *** The deed to my childhood home went back to my grandparents after my parents divorced. Friends of the family rented the home until my cousin and his wife bought it recently. But its floors had sloped, and its ceilings were bowed. “I guess you can’t lift a whole home up and expect things not shift when it’s set back down,” my father said. It wasn’t long before my cousin and his wife and two young children moved into a new home they’d had built not twenty feet behind the old house, which still stood there like a grand addition missing only a connective hallway. My cousin’s decision to demolish my childhood home shouldn’t have come as a shock, but it did. Part of me resented him, though I understood he was doing what he believed was best for his family. He said he’d thought about moving it to the nearest field instead: “But I don‘t think it would survive.” “You’d have to tie it up to keep it from falling apart,” was my father’s take. I wanted to believe my father could do it if anyone could, that opening up the walls of that home all those years ago – and seeing how they fit together – had been practice for just such a feat. I pictured it wrapped and ribboned, like Barbie’s Dream House, or like Sears’s model no. 115, sliding heavy into the field. *** Almost 100 years after that home was first assembled it was torn down – January 16th, 2010. I rented a camcorder to document the event. When I entered the living room early that morning, camcorder in hand, I half-heartedly hoped I’d encounter traces of Christmas Eve at Home 1987: Barbie’s Dream House on the floor, perhaps, its rooms filled with furniture, scraps of wrapping paper insulating its cardboard walls. But the light was too low to register anything other than the beam of my flashlight, clouded by breath. Tyrah and I stood in the snow catching windows our father pried loose, my cousin’s oldest son peering curiously through the front window of his home behind us. Throughout the day, we loaded the back of my car with bricks, boards, banister rails – all of which weighted it in the months of snow to follow. I filmed Tyrah removing a layer of wood paneling on the bathroom wall that covered the wallpaper which, she reminded me, had mesmerized us as children. As we’d bathed, as we’d brushed our teeth, as our mother had combed and braided our hair, we‘d projected our family onto the figures framed in its black & white antique newsprint advertisements for remedies and hygiene products. “The bald man in the ad for Dr. Scott’s Electric Hair Brush – $1.00 – was our bald father,” Tyrah said, pointing to him. Our mother was the beauty in profile for Procter & Gamble’s Vegetable Glycerin who wore a floppy-looking hat that resembled the one our mother wore when she gardened. Lily was the woman in the rocker reading a book in the advertisement for The Electropoise Company. “She was reading us a story,” I remembered. Gil was the man with a mustache in profile for Cuticura, a remedy for “humors of the blood and skin”. Tyrah and I were the young girl standing on a rock at the water’s edge in John Collier’s “Water Baby” painting (appropriated by Pears Soap). I studied that figure closely as I tried to peel her off the wall. “I always thought the light shining on the rock behind her was a pair of wings,” I said. When she tore in half, I told my father to take the whole wall. He started his chainsaw. My mother had called at 3:00 a.m., sleepless, asking us to save a door for her – with the hinges. We didn’t ask why she wanted a door, where she might display it. We figured she just wanted closure and believed a door might suffice. We took every door. *** I’d wanted this event to make the local newspaper like Lily’s estate sale had – “Historic Home Demolished” – but it was to be strictly a family affair. My father performed half the demolition. I stood inside the living room and filmed him through a jagged frame of splintered boards where a wall used to be, and Tyrah snapped photographs from a variety of angles. Without a mask to protect him from the insulation spilling from the walls and filling the air like static on a television, our father worked the excavator with both hands, both feet, pulling at the layers of our home, shaking the floor beneath us, reaching further, not yet telling us to get out. I remembered “Christmas Eve at Home 1987” and my mother’s warnings: “Leave the doll in her box,” she’d said. She’d kept the plastic on the lampshades, too – as if she’d somehow sensed this was coming. “Not many people get to stand inside a home while it’s demolished,” Tyrah shouted over the clamor of the excavator. “It feels like an earthquake.” I zoomed in and out on the scene, imagining the footage as a continuation of the scene my parents had filmed, the cinematic equivalent of double exposure-two disparate scenes framed as one by a fluke of light. *** The debris from the demolition didn’t fit into the hole my cousin had dug the day before for its burial. He drenched the mangled heap with gasoline and lit it with a torch. My father carefully nudged the trail of debris into the hole as it burned-the excavator’s arm an extension of his own. In the photograph my father took of Tyrah and me later that evening, we stand four feet apart, facing each other. We are hinged at our hips, our arms forming a roof above our heads, our hands palm to palm-an apex. We are a silhouette the shape of our own once-home ablaze behind us. Tyrah took a photograph of our father standing ten feet from the fire, his back to the camera, his arms straight above his head. He is a beam, a candle-the flames live and leaping high above his fingertips. What shape would my mother have made if she‘d been there, beside him? Rocks exploded in the embers like gunfire. I told Tyrah that Lily was shooting all her pistols and rifles from beyond the grave – whether in commemoration or defense of her property I refused to decide. My father spoke eloquently when I asked how it felt to tear down what he and my mother had worked so hard all those years to prevent from falling apart: “I could see the old and what we once considered was the new…the layers blended together as time rushed through it once more.” And I wonder, as I study the remains of the bathroom wall hanging above my television today, if what has become of my childhood home had been written there all along as we bathed, as we brushed our teeth, as all that water rushed from unseen places in the walls and swirled down drains behind the figures whose faces Tyrah and I pretended were ours, and we just didn’t know how to read it yet. There is no remedy for the passage of time – no magical hair brushes, no jars of Vegetable Glycerin, no bars of soap, no turns of the faucet. Not unlike the pages of the newspaper my father nightly crumpled, whatever we didn’t one day cut out of this home was destined to be reduced to ash. There we had stood, warmed by the flames, their reflections, like our own, flashing upon wet mud. *** The Salvation Army truck arrives as my father and I roll the giant television down the sidewalk. The truck is a hefty white steed branded with a large red badge I initially see as a heart. The driver backs the truck in front of the garage. He nods hello to us as he walks to open the trailer, his jeans baggy, cuffs frayed from dragging upon the ground. My father helps him strap the television to a dolly. Once the television is inside, my father releases his grip. The driver straps it to a bar lining the trailer’s wall, steps down, nods goodbye. I pull a cigarette from my pack, hand it to my father, and pull out another for myself. If only the loss of home really could be measured this way, I think – in washing machines and televisions. If only there was a message of condolence that could do that loss justice, and a fleet of baggy-jeaned angels who could haul it away on a big white steed branded with a heart. I wish foreclosure was just an absurd soap opera – that one could change the channel – and if there is a dream to be realized through home ownership, I wish that such a dream‘s realization could prove to be as good as the dream itself had been. I know my father is thinking this too as he watches The Salvation Army truck merge onto the street and takes off his gloves. *** From foreclosed homes, we‘ve removed books like So, You Want a Divorce? Do it Yourself and Understanding Human Behavior and Practical Problem Solver. Perhaps the abandonment of these books tells the same story as books chronicling the mortgage crisis and foreclosure have told: the loss of a home, as I’ve come to know it, is, indeed, a default, a meltdown, a fall. But is there a way to analyze comprehensively the so-called trash my father and I have hauled away from foreclosures, or the human behaviors and foibles that might instigate the loss of a home – no matter the circumstances of that loss? As a child, I believed my home was braced and battened, strong enough to shield me from all calamities. What book could have soothed me when that belief was shaken? What book might my father have read from all those years ago to explain what would happen once we left? And what words might bring me solace now? That place is gone. Who am I without it? We couldn’t endure this labor if we weren’t once-removed from the heartbreak. I don’t think we could even feign the strength required to overhear some other father tell his daughter that he isn’t really Atlas or MacGyver, that he can‘t hold her home, her world-his dream for her-together anymore, that he can’t save the day with the tools beneath the canopy of his pickup. I take the photographs of our labor with artistic intent. I zoom in as my father muscles appliances and televisions into U-Hauls. I zoom in upon his calloused hands gripping contractor bags, wiping windowpanes and mirrors, placing new keys into lockboxes – evidence of a supposed transformation. I suspect the people reviewing these photographs for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, hundreds of miles away from where we labor, won‘t think twice about their quality, let alone about the deeper story I want the photographs to tell – the story of a dream’s inadequacies, so often taken out with the trash. *** Once we’ve taken the “after” photographs, secured the split-level, and loaded our equipment beneath the canopy, we climb into my father’s pickup, and he types the address of the Motel 6 near tomorrow‘s foreclosure into his GPS with an un-clicked pen. “I hope our friend Tom Bodett forgot to turn off the light again,” he jokes. “Proceed to the nearest road,” the GPS says. My father shifts the pickup into gear, and I realize this must be why we keep doing what we do: we could be at any address on any road, and these homes we drive away from-and the stories of those who once lived in them-both are and are not our own. This business of foreclosure has become a business for closure. But into how many homes must I watch my father break and enter? Onto how many of foreclosure’s forgotten television screens must I project my own memories of loss, before I am able to stop the loop, push eject? No matter how I frame them, won’t all renderings of that place I once called home eventually turn to static? Hotel California, a makeshift holding cell where US soldiers in Afghanistan kept enemy combatants that they had captured. The Hotel California By Steve Carlsen I put my fleece watch cap on under my helmet as I walked over to the Hotel California. It was two in the morning and freezing cold. I wanted desperately to go back to sleep. The Hotel California was a make shift holding cell where we kept enemy combatants that we had captured. The prisoners were usually held for a couple of days while they were being interrogated by U.S. Government Spooks. When the prisoners were no longer full of useful information, a helicopter would fly out to our remote mountain outpost and pick up the prisoners, and fly them to a bigger base in Afghanistan and eventually on to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Hotel California got its name from the Eagles song. A hand painted sign hanging above the door that said “Welcome to the Hotel California. You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.“ It was my shift to pull guard. I looked at the two men that stood in front of me shivering from fear and from the cold. They both had sandbags over their heads. Their hands were zip tied behind their backs and their feet were zip tied together to prevent them from running away. It was December and cold in the mountains. I could see my breath when I exhaled. The two men shook uncontrollably. They were completely naked. One of them had shit himself. He had shit on the back of his legs and there was shit on the ground. He was standing in it, and he was crying. *** The Spooks oversaw the combat outpost. There were just a few of them, high ranking members of a secret US Government alphabet agency. But we did the grunt work. We kicked in the doors, went into the compounds, captured the militants. We died and got wounded in the process, and those of us who survived, we guarded the prisoners. They gave the orders, they got the credit. My orders were to splash the prisoners with water every few minutes and make sure they never got dry. I was told to intimidate them by yelling and to hit them with the barrel or the butt stock of my machine gun. “Scare the hell out of ‘em,“ the Spook said as he put his cigarette out on the chest of one of the prisoners. I stood there and watched the two prisoners of war. The Spooks believed that these two prisoners were part of the Christmas day assault on the outpost that I had survived several days prior. They wanted us to break these men. Break their spirit and their will to live. The one that had shit himself stood there shaking. He would let out an occasional sob like a child that had cried himself to sleep. I could tell by his actions that he was either young or not as hardened as his partner in crime. I refused to follow the orders. I refused to splash them with water, it was too f--king cold. I refused to hit a man who was completely naked, zip tied with a sandbag over his head and suffering from hypothermia. I was not opposed to knocking someone‘s teeth out with the butt stock of my machine gun. I had done it in the past, but these men were tied up and helpless. I sat there in silence trying to stay warm, wondering what thoughts might be running through their heads. Fear of the unknown. They probably thought they would be executed. If the situation was reversed I knew they would execute me by slowly cutting my head off with a big knife. They must have thought they were alone. The quiet hajji said something to the one that had shit himself. I ran the few feet to him and grabbed the sandbag that was covering his head and shook it violently. “Shut the f--k up,“ I screamed as I threw him to the ground. “Shut the f--k up or I‘ll kill you.“ I put the barrel of my machinegun to his head. “Do not mistake my kindness for weakness.“ The Haji repeated a prayer over and over as I dragged him to his feet. The hajji that had shit himself began to cry out loud. I grabbed the sandbag on his head and shook it once and said. “Shut the f--k up now!“ I sat back down. I looked at my watch. The two-hour shift was only half over. The sky was clear and there were more stars in the sky than I had ever seen in my life. I lit a cigarette and took a long drag and inhaled deep. I exhaled and watched hajjis. The one was still crying and it was beginning to get on my nerves. The other one held his composure. He was trying to be strong. He wasn‘t shaking. I figured the adrenalin rush he had from me getting in his face must have made him oblivious to the cold. I smoked the cigarette down to the filter, then rolled the butt between my fingers to get rid of the ash and what little tobacco was left and put it in my pocket. I saw the bottle of water out of the corner of my eye and thought about throwing water on them, but I couldn‘t justify it. It was so f--king cold and they were probably at the lowest point in their lives and I didn‘t see how it would help the situation. I heard footsteps behind me and turned and saw the sergeant of the guard walking up. He asked me if I had a cigarette. I lied and told him I just smoked my last one. I never liked the sergeant. He was in another platoon and he was a d--k from the time he woke up till the time he went to sleep. He was a sadistic f--k. I saw him throw a zip tied hajji out the back of a speeding Humvee. When they took hajji to the medic for a fractured skull, he told the medic that hajji had jumped out of the truck. He walked over to the prisoners and slapped them both in the face. The one that shit himself started to cry again. “How come they‘re dry,“ he shouted. “Have you been throwing water on them?“ “No Sergeant,“ I said. “No one told me to.“ He started to get pissed because the prisoners were dry. “You gotta‘ keep them wet,“ he said, throwing water on them. The hajji that shit himself began to cry louder and that pissed the sergeant off more. “Shut the f--k up,“ the Sergeant said, first hitting the hajji in the side of the head with his fist, then kicking him in the nuts with the toe of his boot. Hajji screamed, lurched forward and fell flat on his face. The sergeant of the guard jumped on top of him and punched him repeatedly in the head and body. Haji screamed at the top of his lungs during the attack. Finely tired, the sergeant got up off the ground and kicked hajji once more. “F--king faggot pussy,“ the sergeant said as he pulled out a cigarette and lit it and walked away as if nothing had happened. The Hajji that had shit himself laid on the ground. He was cradled in pain, moaning, rolling back and forth. His dick was bleeding. The Hajji‘s wails attracted attention and a medic came over to see what was wrong. I told the medic what the sergeant of the guard had done while he worked on the prisoner. The medic took the sandbag off hajji‘s head and I saw his face for the first time. The Hajji that had shit himself was obviously retarded. His eyes looked out of opposite corners of his eyelids, like a reverse of cross eyed. His nose was pushed up his face and his cleft lip exposed his nostrils and what few teeth he had in his mouth. He moaned and cried out in pain as the medic examined him. “He has a severed urethra,“ the medic said. “The tube that piss comes out of is severed inside his penis.“ With bare hands, I held a white gauze bandage on the haji‘s penis trying to stop the bleeding. The medic gave him a shot of something to help the pain. The white gauze turned dark red and his blood felt warm in my bare hand. Time passed. The Spooks came and another medic gave the retarded hajji more medical attention. They cut the zip ties off both the hajjis and took the sandbags off their heads. They gave them their clothes back and let them get dressed. The spooks apologized for arresting the wrong people. They said that America was grateful for their cooperation and understanding. They gave the hajjis several hundred dollars apiece to help smooth things over. They walked the father and his retarded son to the front gate and released them. I watched the father help his son hobble away. *** The Spooks came over and started asking me questions. They took me into a room with a desk and two chairs. There was a single glairing light bulb hanging from a bare wire. It reminded me of a spy movie. The Spooks told me that the sergeant of the guard had told them that I was abusing the prisoners. I told them my side of the story. They acted like they believed me. “Do you really believe that, that retarded hajji had something to do with the Christmas day attack.“ I said it sarcastically. “He can‘t even f--king talk.“ This was nothing I had ever signed up for. The spook handed me a piece of paper. “Sign it,“ he said, staring directly at me. I defiantly met his stare, then looked away. I read the paper. It said I was not allowed to talk to anyone or write anything about what I had seen, or the name and location of the firebase, or the names of any person or Government affiliation involved. By signing my name, I would be agreeing that none of this happened and if I talked I would go to prison. They made me write my name, and my social security number on the piece paper, and they wanted my parent‘s home address in case they ever needed to find me. I didn‘t have a choice so I signed my name, and just like that six months of my life no longer existed. I never saw a retarded hajji with a sandbag over his head, his hands tied behind his back, lying on the ground bleeding from his dick. Steve Carlsen in his US army days The Zatenge Church By Steve Carlsen The old church stood grey as the sky from which the rain fell. All that remained of what it once stood for was a tall steeple reaching heavenward. Built by the hands of man, every stone had been reverently placed to pay homage and glory to God. Now bricks and mortar fill the void that once held colorful stain glass windows. The large wooden doors chained shut, are locked with a heavy bolt, a spray of bullet holes is testament to the violent history of this old house of worship. Surrounding the church on three sides is the cemetery. A limestone statue of the Blessed Mother stands amongst the headstones. Weathered by the elements and time, her once delicately carved features are as worn as the headstones she watches over. A tall tree line around the cemetery creates a natural barrier. On the outside perimeter, two rows of triple stacked concertina wire prevent any unwanted visitors. Thirty feet inside the perimeter, facing the trees, is a daisy chain of claymore mines waiting to welcome anyone that makes it through the razor wire. *** The ethnic cleansing that went on in Kosovo, the former republic of Yugoslavia, during the 1990s was largely based on religion. Christian Serbians living in Kosovo, with help from the Serbian government, attacked Muslim Albanians also living in Kosovo. The Christian Serbians were the minority in Kosovo at the time, and quickly found the tables turned when the majority, Muslim Albanians retaliated against their attacks. They killed each other, blowing up schools, churches, mosques and entire neighborhoods. Neither group was by any means innocent. Digging mass graves, they would execute an entire town by slitting the inhabitants’ throats or shooting them in the head. Women and young girls were brutally gang raped. When the soldiers were done rapping their victim they would usually kill them, but it became common to allow young girls to live. After the rape, soldiers would stomp on the girl’s stomach, and pelvis, crushing their pubic bone and hips, preventing them from ever having children and causing them to walk with a limp for the rest of their life. *** All churches, schools, and mosques in Kosovo had to be guarded twenty-four hours a day. Our sector had two churches. The more dangerous church was The Zatenge Church. Seven miles from base camp, instead of rotating guard shifts and risking the daily journey, we lived on the small OP for a month at a time. In late February, our platoon drew the short straw and we were assigned The Zatenge Church. We sullenly packed up our gear and drove seven miles into the country side, past bombed out houses that stood as sullen reminders to the recent war, arriving eventually at the small outpost that we would call home for the next four weeks. “You don’t know how glad we are to see you,” the soldier guarding the gate said. A group of men gathered around our trucks. Their faces looked tired and disheveled. They reminded me of castaways on a deserted island. “There are ghosts here, this place is haunted. I ain’t shit’in you.” They shook their heads in unison and started talking all at once, each man telling his own story of ghosts and supernatural happenings. They told stories of bodies and skeletons in the grave yard. Three of them swore that they saw the statue of Mary walking around after dark. “I shot her with my M4, swear to God.” “After he shot her, she ran back and climbed on her stone base.” “We’re not f--king with you. All three of us saw it.” Fear was written on their faces. Their stories were hard to believe, but it was evident that they were convinced they had seen something. The men helped us unload our gear and gave us a tour of the small compound. Two olive drab GP medium tents would be our sleeping quarters. They were crammed with cots lining the walls. Each soldier was assigned foot locker. Centerfolds from Hustler and Penthouse hung inside the tent. This was a man’s environment, harsh and dirty - the only women that could thrive here were the ones on our walls. *** A GP large tent served as our chow hall and recreation area. Neatly tucked into one corner of the tent was a white plastic picnic table, a refrigerator filled with soda, a freezer filled with frozen pizzas, and a microwave that had never been cleaned. Four bag chairs sat next to the picnic table, arranged in a row facing a TV tuned to the Armed Forces Network. The other three quarters of the tent was set up like a gym. There was a treadmill and a weight bench and ten thousand pounds of weights. The Lieutenant giving the tour stopped and pointed to the weight bench. “This is where I saw the thing.” “What thing?” “I don’t know. It sat there with its back to me, hunched over sitting on the weight bench. I watched it for a few seconds and then it vanished.” “Good thing you guys are being replace by the ghost busters,” I said. We all laughed. He led us back outside into the drizzle and showed us the guard towers, motor pool, and fuel point. There were hundreds of black crows cawing in the trees surrounding the cemetery. He showed us, too, the perimeter and the placement of the claymores. We had to yell over the noise of the birds. “The crows show up when it rains. The water erodes the graves. Sometimes old bones or a body gets washed out. The crows will pick pieces of flesh off whatever washes up and eat it.” “This place is a f--king Edgar Allen Poe story.” The Lieutenant reached into his pocket and pulled out a large key with a parachute cord. He unlocked the oversized lock, pulling free the chain holding the large wooden doors. The church was empty, no pews, no organ, nothing, nothing but mold and bullet holes on one wall. “Story goes… the Albanians lined everyone up on the wall one Sunday, men, women and children. F--kin killed em’ all. Retaliation because the Serbs blew up a school or something.” We stared at each other in amazement. Soldiers trained to kill without a second thought were terrified of this place. We left the church. Outside, I walked over to the statue of the Virgin Mary. I watched the ground to make sure I didn’t step on a body. Headstones were strewed about. I stared at the statue of the Virgin. Her hands were folded in prayer. In the center of her chest was a bullet hole, the white pock mark contrasted against the grey, weathered stone. *** I sat in the guard tower over the front gate. The rain had stopped, briefly, the air cold and heavy with moisture. Through the fog, I saw the labored gate of a lone figure, slowly trudging its way up the hill towards the church. I watched the silhouette grow the closer it got to me. I climbed out of the guard tower and walked over to the gate. A woman in her mid-twenties greets me in Serbian. “Zdravo.” Even a beautiful woman couldn’t make this language sexy. When she talked, it sounded like she was hawking loogies. Dirty fucking language, I thought to myself. “Hi. Are you the cleaning lady?” She had been through the drill before. She saw a new face on this gate every four weeks. She smiled. It was a kind gentle smile. She was missing some teeth. She reached into a pocket of her sweater with her left hand and pulled out a yellow and white KFOR ID card. I look at the picture, then at her. She was holding a brown paper bag in her right arm. She set the bag on a bench and removed the shawl covering it. Self-conscious, she tried to hide her right arm from me. Her hand was missing just above the wrist. She had scars on her arm, a hack job. The missing hand and limp were courtesy of an Albanian gang rape. The brown paper bag had ten fresh baked loaves of bread in it. She smiled and handed me a warm loaf. I smiled and thanked her - this girl, not much older than me, butchered and damned, her life completely devastated by war and hate. I grabbed the radio hand mike and pressed the button. It beeped. “The cleaning lady is here. I’m letting her in.” The radio beeped again. “Is she hot, does she have big tits?” I looked at her again – the grimace on her face every time she took a step - the teeth that were busted out of her head, the brutal rape she had endured, her shattered hips and pelvis, her missing hand. She smiled again showing me her missing teeth. I pressed the button on the hand mike and said, “She’s miss congeniality.” *** Soy Sauce was born in Japan and immigrated to Hawaii with his family when he was young. We used to f--k with him about being Japanese and living in Hawaii, and Pearl Harbor. He was very superstitious. He said it was an Asian thing. It was how he was raised. He was the first person in our platoon to see a ghost. Screaming into the radio, he said there was a ghost in the tower with him. He was hysterical, walking around in circles, chain smoking cigarettes. He refused to get back in the guard tower. They told him he would be court marshaled for disobeying an order, but his fear would not allow him to follow the order. His slanted eyes were round with fear, he couldn’t stop shaking and mumbling. We laughed at him. None of us had ever seen anyone so scared. “F--k you, you don’t believe me. F--k you.” It was the middle of the night. They told him to go get something to drink and eat a pizza. They told him when he calmed down they would put him in a different tower. He refused to be alone. He was the first, but not the last to succumb to the fear of the Zatenge Church. Our twelve-hour guard shifts passed slowly, each hour felt like a day. Every man did his time is solitary confinement different. Some chain-smoked cigarettes, inhaling smoke every time they took a breath, going hours without breathing fresh air. Boredom and complacency constantly tugged at our eye lids, beckoning us to give up the fight and go to sleep. Some men read books and magazines to make the time pass. Others did pushups or masturbated. All of us stared blankly out the windows of the guard tower for hours. Eyes bloodshot and clothes smelling like smoke, we climbed out of our cells, and tired we stumbled toward the chow tent or towards our cots. *** Miss Congeniality plunged a rag into a bucket of soap and water, rung it out with her left hand, and tossed the rag on the white picnic table. She used her nub, what was left of her right arm to scrub at a spot of dried pizza sauce. Her hair, black as the crows in the trees over the graveyard, was hidden under a bonnet. She wore a faded blue, simple homemade dress and an apron that was grey from being washed in the river. She cleaned the entire kitchen, everything except the microwave. She probably didn’t know what it was. She helped herself to a can of soda in the fridge, the one fringe benefit of her job. Putting it in her pocket, she didn’t open it. She took it home to drink later. She cleaned our bathroom and showers, taking any bars of soap that were left behind. She was not a thief. She knew that if she left them, they would go in the trash. She was poor and supported her entire family with this job. She would use the left-over soap. She came twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, limping up to the front gate, always with fresh baked loaves of bread. No one ever gave her money for the bread. She never asked for any. She had a motherly way about her, even though she was just a few years older than us. We gave her things, things we were going to throw away, worn out running shoes, half empty bottles of shampoo, socks with holes. She always smiled her toothless smile. I think that was why she brought the bread. I took a picture of her once. She was outside the chow tent empting a bucket of water. She had on the faded blue dress and apron she wore every day, her hair under a bonnet. She saw the camera in my hand, put the bucket down, stood up straight and looked at me without smiling. I got the film developed in Vitina a few days later. When she came to work that day, I gave her the picture I had taken. She cried. I felt like shit. A few hours after, she left for home. She returned toward the end of my shift. I saw her limping back up the hill towards the church. There was a man and three children with her. I walked over to the gate. She was wearing a green homemade dress without an apron, and a white knitted shawl. I asked, “Is this your family?” I knew she wanted me to take their picture. They were all dressed in their best cloths. Her husband wore faded corduroy pants and a brown sweater. She had two boys and a girl. I positioned them where the old church and the barbed wire wouldn’t be in the picture. I used up an entire roll of film and gave her all thirty-two pictures I had taken. She sat at the white picnic table and looked at them. Holding the photos to her breasts, she sobbed. *** The rain fell in torrents and I was glad I was in the guard tower. The church was blurred by the precipitation. I read a book trying stave off boredom. It was no use. I was going stir crazy in an eight by eight prison cell. When the rain finely stopped, the big black crows flew out of the trees and picked at something near the fence. I called it up on the radio, and they told me to go check it out. I lit a cigarette and walked down the hill toward the birds. They were cawing and making a ruckus, tearing at pieces of flesh and fighting over what was on the ground. When I got close, I threw a rock and the crows scattered. Caught in the barbed wire was a rotted human torso and most of an arm. Rib bones were visible through holes in the flesh. The arm was held on by rotten bits of skin and decomposing muscle. I yelled up to the nearest guard tower. “It’s a f--king body.” I looked back at the torso. Most of the organs were gone, eaten by the birds. Soy Sauce walked down the hill carrying a shovel. He said, “Sarge says to put it back in its grave.” I thought I was going to puke. I stuck the shovel under the torso and picked it up. It fell off the shovel. When it hit the ground, the arm ripped off. Soy Sauce threw up. “Fuck you,” I screamed at the top of my lungs, to no one and everyone. “Fuck you for making me pick up a body like its dog shit.” *** Lost in thought, I watched the rain through the windows of the guard tower. Most of us don’t give a f--k about this place. We don’t care about Kosovo, the people or this f--king church. We are doing our time, until our parole is granted and we are sent home. Only later in our lives will we look back and allow our thoughts dwell on this place. This place the rest of the world forgot. We are young men, in our late teens and early twenties, cutting our teeth on life. Old age is a long way off, but old age comes quickly even for young men. Regret makes the heart ache. All the good you have done never seems good enough. The violence is still something we don’t fully understand. It is impossible for us to wrap our minds around. The hundreds of thousands of people tortured and murdered, all civilians because they call their God by a different name. No wonder there are ghosts and demons here. Each has a story to tell, each as tragic as the next. This church, this empty house of worship was built as a sanctuary where God and man came together. God is all but forgotten, no longer trusted to protect and watch over His people. The only time the church is used is when someone dies. Superstition compels them to bury their dead. None of the nameless dead buried here will be nominated as a saint. Each corpse is piled one on top of another as prayers are said, and the heavy chain goes back on the heavy doors, and the church is locked. The body lies in the ground, but never rests in peace. There is no peace here. The body lies in limbo, between heaven and hell, waiting for the next heavy rain, when it will be regurgitated by the ground. Only then will it fly with the birds. scarlsen2@hotmail.com        Subscribe.   Click here to sign up to the Irish Times Book Club More from The Irish Times Books Hennessy Literary Awards 2017 Emerging Poetry winner: Crouched Burial by Una Mannion Music Melanie C: A Spice Girls reunion?

Photo: ZaldyImg (Flickr) Police say it appears the 17-year-old overdosed. The Bartholomew County Sheriff’s Department says an officer discovered a 17-year-old girl who appeared to have overdosed in a Walmart parking lot Tuesday. Police say the teen’s vehicle was still running with the lights on when an officer responded. He found the girl unconscious in the front seat and administered two doses of the overdose-antidote Narcan before an ambulance arrived. The teen was taken to a Columbus hospital. Police say her status is unknown. “We must create a strong foundation of communication with our children,” Bartholomew County Sheriff Matthew Myers said in a statement. “Talk with them about drugs and alcohol and let them know the consequences for bad choices.” Share  E-mail Print Read Next Reward In Killings Of 2 Teen Girls Nears $100,000 Bodies Found Amid Search For 2 Missing Northern IN Teens Bloomington Police Respond To Nine Overdoses In Three Days Want to contact your legislators about an issue that matters to you?

(Source: WKMG/CNN) DELTONA, FL (WKMG/CNN) - A man is accused of stealing a cellphone from a four-year-old girl. When confronted, deputies say the man laughed it off. Nelson Quiles had just left Walmart, when his 4-year old daughter told him her phone was missing. "I took the phone out of my pocket, I still had it in my hand, then I put it down and then someone took it,” his daughter Angelina said. "I don't care about the phone, you know what I mean, it's just the fact that somebody stole from a 4 year old,” Nelson Quiles said. Quiles went inside to buy his son a cake for his birthday, while Angelina went to return movies with her uncle at the Red Box. She put the phone down while she was putting the movies back in the machine. "She put the phone down for a quick second to put the movies into the red box and somebody snatched it up," Quiles said. Quiles said he went back to look for the phone but it wasn't there. He texted the phone, asking it to be returned because it belonged to a 4-year-old. Deputies said Mykhal Henderson texted back "LMAO" which is text slang for laughter. Henderson told Quiles that he found the phone on the floor and was going to keep it. "She was crying, she was devastated. What would you do if someone stole from your child? I mean how would you take it?" Quiles asked. Henderson was seen on surveillance camera, walking into the store, and then out with an online purchase.  Detectives were able to identify him from that order and arrest him during a traffic stop, where they say he confessed. His criminal history shows he has six prior convictions for theft. Deputies said they will return the cell phone soon. Copyright 2017 WKMG via CNN. All rights reserved.

Here’s how to save $100. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is arriving soon everywhere; Samsung says pre-orders begin March 30 and phones ship April 21, though that timetable will likely depend on your carrier. The phone will be available from AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless, as well as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. There are a bewildering array of plan options. You can buy it up front, on fast-upgrade plans, or on payment plans. Your best deals, almost certainly, will come from third-party retailers such as Best Buy. Samsung says all pre-orders should include a free Gear VR headset with a controller. If you want to add a 256GB MicroSD card and AKG Bluetooth headphones, that will be $99 more. That’s a good deal, as a high-quality (not trash) 256GB MicroSD card alone costs around $129 right now. There won’t be a non-carrier-branded model of the phone in the US to start, but Samsung told us that an officially unlocked, all carrier-compatible unit will follow “within a few months.” Verizon models are always unlocked, but it’ll initially be difficult to buy a Verizon model without a Verizon account. So far, we’ve gotten prices from the four major carriers and two retailers. AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile are all charging $750 for the S8 and $850 for the S8+. On AT&T, if you go for the AT&T Next payment plan, have two lines of service, and you’re also a DirecTV customer, you can get credits towards a second Galaxy S8 to the tune of $25 a month for 30 months. Or, if you choose a two-year contract, you can get a Gear S3 watch for $49, or a Samsung Tab E or a Gear S2 for 99 cents. All of those would be on contract. Sprint has a deal where if you lease the Galaxy S8, you’ll be able to upgrade to a Galaxy S9 after 12 months, having paid only $375 for your phone (but you’ll have to give it back to Sprint.) Verizon is charging slightly less than the other carriers: $720 for the S8 and $840 for the S8+. We haven’t seen prices from U.S. Cellular or the prepaid carriers yet. Remember, if you have another phone that’s paid off, you can sell it or trade it in to help finance your Galaxy S8 purchase. The carriers have their own trade-in programs, and we also have a guide to some third-party options here. Better Buy at Best Buy Best Buy and Target are undercutting the carriers’ direct prices, hoping you’ll also spend money on accessories or other home electronics. Best Buy’s discount looks cleaner; it’s just a discount. Target gives you a gift card. Best Buy: “Up to $100 off,” if you use payment plans from AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. On the AT&T Next plan, Best Buy says that lowers the overall price of an S8 from $724.99 to $674.99, and an S8+ drops from $824.99 to $724.99. Target: A flier leaked last week shows a deal for a $100 gift card on AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. —Courtesy Yahoo Tagged big Samsung deal S8+ Samsung Galaxy S8 Post navigation Previous Previous post: Tillerson visits as Turkey says its Syria campaign over Tweet Related Posts Stargazers in awe as total eclipse arcs across Pacific Cellphones may spread superbugs in hospitals: study Blood sugar loss may trigger Alzheimer’s: study Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links and the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1). The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2). the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too.

Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies.

I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market.

Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now).

Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year.

Bonedatt It's just you 😉 Wildcard Funny, if this were a HTC phone, you guys would have been killing them over the pricing Bonedatt Yea but htc screwed themselves. Always one step forward two steps backwards. They just started listening again to their customers. A little too late if you ask me, but I wish them well. I'm a fan of their designs. dblock Really on the fence about getting one of these. They appear to be quite nice, but I don't know if I want to lock myself into Verizon or not. Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus.

By Alexandra Steigrad on March 30, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Kim Kardashian promoting a product on her Instagram. Sponsored content: It has become the lifeblood of media companies looking to bolster anemic print and digital revenue streams. But just as bloggers came under federal government regulations to ensure that consumers knew when these e-correspondents were being paid to write about a brand or product, now WWD has learned that the concept of sponsored content has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission. And there are two words that might sum up media companies’ reaction to that: Uh-oh. After all, sponsored content — otherwise called native advertising — is expected to be a $59 billion global industry by 2018, according to Adyoulike. While there is no indication that media companies or brands are doing anything wrong per se in their attempts to develop online and print content, the FTC will soon begin holding media companies accountable for deceptive practices. Part of the change is linked to how media companies have adapted to the difficult times. There are few of them around today that do not have some kind of in-house sponsored content unit that produces advertising for its partners. That transformation to hybrid publisher/creative agency has grabbed the attention of the FTC as part of its ongoing effort to ensure that consumers can differentiate between advertising and editorial content. Although the FTC works with publishers, it has never penalized a media company with a fine. “If they are creating the sponsored content, then yes, we will begin looking at them,” said Mary Engle, head of the FTC’s Advertising Practices Division. Engle cited a key case last year that changed the agency’s stance, namely the complaint against Lord & Taylor, in which the retailer tapped Nylon Media for a native campaign. Nylon produced the content for L&T about a collection from L&T’S apparel line, Design Lab. The Instagram campaign focused on a paisley asymmetric dress, which was featured in an article on must-have items. Nylon did not disclose that the dress was part of the campaign. Lord & Taylor’s Design Lab Instagram campaign.  Additionally, L&T contracted Nylon to post a photo of the dress on its Instagram page, but that wasn’t disclosed as an ad, either. Central to the social campaign was the inclusion of a team of 50 fashion influencers, who were gifted and paid between $1,000 and $4,000 to post photos wearing the dress. Those posts weren’t labeled as ads, either. “The Lord & Taylor case gave notice to the fashion industry, which maybe wasn’t paying too much attention before,”Engle said. “It’s important to everyone to understand their legal obligations.” An L&T spokeswoman said: “Lord & Taylor is deeply committed to our customers and we never sought to deceive them in any way, nor would we ever. When it came to our attention that there were potential issues with the April 2015 campaign, we took immediate action with the social media agencies that were supporting us on it to ensure that clear disclosures were made. We cooperated fully with the FTC’s inquiry and have, of course, agreed to uphold the current version of the guidelines. “It is worth noting that the FTC issued new guidelines after the campaign launched. We applaud the new guidelines that clarify the rules. We have educated our teams about them and require that any outside agencies or partners we work with understand and adhere to them as well. Further, we encourage the FTC to continue to update and communicate their guidelines clearly and swiftly as the digital and social media landscape rapidly evolves. We remain dedicated to our core values of transparency and honesty in everything that we do for our customers.”  Engle declined to comment on why the FTC did not pursue Nylon and just L&T, but noted broadly that the agency has begun looking at influencers, their relationships with publishers and the role of social media. “Generally, it comes back to if they [influencers and publishers] are promoting a particular brand or product and if they have a financial or material connection to the brand, that should be disclosed,” she said, pointing to the fallout from the lack of transparency from the Kardashians. It came to light last year that the Kardashians were not disclosing what products they were endorsing via social media on behalf of brands. A letter was sent by the nonprofit group Truth in Advertising outlining the issue, and since then, the family members who are paid to endorse products designate a sponsored post with “#ad” or “#sp.” Now most media companies spend more time working with lawyers to vet influencers or the agencies that represent them. And influencer agencies spend time laying out the rules to their clients. But according to Karen Robinovitz, cofounder and chief operating officer of Digital Brand Architects, part of the problem is a lack of clarity of the rules themselves since the landscape is changing so quickly. Robinovitz’s firm represents influencers, and some of her clients even worked on the Nylon/L&T partnership. She claimed that they abided by what they understood the guidelines to be, and once they learned of a violation, they corrected it. Nylon’s Design Lab article.  “There almost needs to be a gathering of thought leaders across media, digital, influencers,” she said. “Does there become a symbol like there is with copyright [for sponsored content] that starts standardizing the labeling?” Chris Hercik, senior vice president of creative and content at Time Inc.’s native studio The Foundry, explained why the space is so important today: “If you start looking where content marketing is going, two-thirds of digital dollars will move to social distribution,” he said. As a result, Time Inc., like its competitors, has been focusing on video and social media influencers. In order to tap into a broader social reach beyond that of its ad partners and titles, Time Inc. is creating its own influencer network. Social media stars benefit from the publisher’s access and in exchange, the firm gets greater social reach. Hercik would not comment on whether influencers are being paid. But influencers can be tricky to monitor, as they have multiple relationships with brands and publishers that they may not always disclose. This may spell trouble for media firms now that the FTC will hold them accountable for influencers. At the same time, Robinovitz claimed that the influencer isn’t always at fault; sometimes brands — especially luxury brands — ask her clients not to label their social media posts as ads. In those cases, she advises her clients to not accept the job in that case. She also noted that while influencers are on the FTC’s radar, editors and celebrities — Kardashians notwithstanding — are not to the same extent. Robinovitz cited a few double standards, namely instances in which editors accept press trips and do not mention in their social media posts that those trips have been paid for by brands. She also pointed to clothing and accessories given by brands to celebrities and editors alike — and the lack of transparency about those relationships. Influencers typically are made to tag those posts, but editors have more leeway, she said. “Our point of view is this is what it is, let’s just make sure everyone is abiding by the same publishing rules,” she said. A silver lining here is that a financial penalty from the FTC comes only when a company violates a prior order, and the agency generally doesn’t go out of its way to pursue a case unless the parties make no attempt at correcting the problem. This is due to the fact that the agency has limited resources, Engle offered, but she also explained that with the rise of third-party platforms, the importance of full disclosure is heightened. For advertising, it can sometimes be tricky for sponsored posts to be labeled as such when they hit third-party platforms. “We don’t have complete control over the way our content is projected across different platforms,” said senior vice president and chief revenue officer of Hearst’s Digital Media division, Todd Haskell. “It needs to be transparent to the reader at the point of promotion, not just the point of consumption. That’s a moving target. The platforms are evolving.” What Haskell was referring to is the way sponsored content is labeled on platforms like Facebook and Google once it migrates from Hearst’s sites to third-party platforms. Sometimes the label of “ad” isn’t extended on platforms, and thus is not labeled. Automated technology, which allows brands to disseminate their content on multiple web sites, is central to the issue. Although it was not a sponsored content issue, Google recently felt the impact of automation gone wrong when The Guardian realized its advertisements were appearing on YouTube videos from extremists. The news organization pulled its marketing from Google, which owns YouTube, and other brands, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., AT&T, Verizon and Johnson & Johnson, followed suit, after they learned their ads were displayed next to YouTubes videos promoting hate speech, terrorism and racism. About 250 advertisers pulled their spend from YouTube, which could cost Google $750 million, according to an analyst at Nomura Instinet. The issue has brought to light the need for more control of ad placements by brands and ad buyers on Google and other dominant third-party platforms. In order to be less ensnared by the domination of such platforms, Vox Media has developed “Concert,” a video player that has an ad server, which allows publishers to control the advertising and labeling around their content. “This is an alternative,” said Lindsay Nelson, Vox Media’s chief marketing officer. “We put so much emphasis on Concert because you lose control when you distribute content on Facebook and Google. You lose the premium environment.” Labeling aside, a central reason for the FTC’s caution is to make sure that consumers are not confused when they see a native ad, which can be slightly at odds with the mission of advertisers and publishers. After all, the whole point of native advertising is to produce sponsored content that fits seamlessly into editorial workflow in print and digital. Even though the FTC requires that such content is labeled — although they don’t agree on a universal word used for the label, which could contribute to the confusion — publishers often push the envelope for their marketing partners. According to a study by content and marketing firm Contently, with the Tow-Knight Center at CUNY and Radius Global Market Research Firm, 44 percent of the 1,212 people surveyed who were shown a native ad could not decipher the company that had paid for it. Fifty-four percent surveyed said they felt deceived by native advertising before, and 77 percent surveyed did not even identify native ads as “advertising,” with 34 percent describing it as “editorial content” or a hybrid (43 percent). Chief experience officer Josh Stinchcomb, who oversees Condé Nast’s sponsored content shop 23 Stories, said misleading the consumer not only carries a legal risk, but also a “reputational” one. “We take to heart the FTC guidelines. We look at everything through that lens in terms of how we tag things,” he said. But 23 Stories is in the business of producing sponsored content that is camouflaged to blend in with editorial. An example of blurring the lines is Condé’s Teen Vogue magazine, which put Grimes on its cover last April as part of an editorial spread. The cover story included a spread and interview by Stella McCartney, who tapped the singer for her fragrance, “Pop.” (Grimes and other Teen Vogue cover faces would appear in a TV music video for Pop over the summer). The editorial spread in Teen Vogue managed to find its way into the October issue of sister publication Glamour as a sponsored content package on hair color for L’Oréal. WWD reached out to Grimes’ agent, who indicated the singer was made aware of such usage of her image for a competitor’s brand. Nonetheless, the package has the same layout and design concept as the rest of the magazine — the only difference is the pages to the ad unit are not numbered. The use of celebrities makes the section all the more confusing and the utter dearth of designation that L’Oréal paid for the creation of the ad unit is an indication of the complexity of the problem — and the difficulty of policing it. Grimes’ Teen Vogue shoot used in Glamour.  “The line we’re trying to walk is that we want it to look native to the environment…to have a certain design aesthetic,” said Stinchcomb, who admitted that “we’re seeing that these things are looking more like the regular magazine than they used to.” He argued that the unit was tagged in some way — which, in the case of the Grimes photos in Glamour, if you consider L’Oréal’s Twitter handle next to Snapchat and Instagram logos as labeled, then, sure — and offered that the reason the advertising is so “endemic” in the pages of the glossy is because editors at the magazines work with 23 Stories. Although the executive wasn’t boasting, he agreed, and stressed that it should be labeled. Another blurry trend in native advertising is to feature multiple brands in a sponsored package. In Town & Country’s issue in May, the Hearst-owned glossy ran a front-of-book section titled: “Jewels of Mystery: An A to Z User’s Companion.” The package featured historical figures and stars through the ages wearing gems that spanned the alphabet. For instance, for “C,” Paloma Picasso is pictured adorning a citrine pendant to the 1990 Frankfurt Opera. Here’s the catch: the unit was ad-backed by Tiffany & Co. but wasn’t labeled as “sponsored,” even though only Tiffany’s gems were used as present-day examples. The only way a consumer would be able to tell that the unit wasn’t editorial was by noticing a thin gray trim on the spine of the package and the lack of page numeration. Town & Country’s “Jewels of Mystery” feature is denoted as sponsored by a gray border (left).  “Magazines have always been really brilliant at contextualization,” said president, marketing and publishing director of Hearst Magazines Michael Clinton, who brushed off the question of whether it was a violation of FTC rules. “Magazine readers know they are going to get a full endemic experience. For our kind of business, this works.” In fact, Hearst has been a trailblazer in the print native advertising space, trotting out similar campaigns with Bulgari in T&C, a Wal-Mart package for Good Housekeeping and cover wraps and peelback covers galore in its various titles, including Marie Claire, O, The Oprah Magazine and others. It also worked with Cotton Inc. for a companywide digital advertising play that featured Joanna Coles, who was at the time editor in chief of Cosmopolitan, cheekily testifying that she wears cotton pajamas when working late in the office. In defense of the new landscape, media sources said the fashion media world has always had a kind of murky relationship with brands, calling in for editorial shoots products of key advertisers to ensure they got their credits in the magazine. It isn’t directly “pay-pay-for-play,” but often veers very close to that. One insider called it a “thin Chinese wall.” However, those shoots — editorial credits or not — were clearly editorial and often included products from nonadvertisers. Plus the magazine paid for the stylist, model, photographer and all the other hangers-on. The FTC said it is concerned with violations of mislabeling content, not on whether something may be ethically off. Perhaps a bigger question is: why are media companies trading in what remains of their editorial integrity with such alacrity? “When you start compromising, it’s often because you haven’t figured out a business model to be a successful business and a successful entity,” said Vox Media’s Nelson. “As print magazines’ revenue declines, these are the companies that are trying to figure out ways to reinvent their advertising businesses and sometime they swing too far.” But digital companies are also guilty of blurring the lines — especially the larger firms like Vice Media and Buzzfeed, which have really defined the digital sponsored content space. Both Vice and Buzzfeed declined to take part in this story. Vice has reportedly pulled stories because sponsors were not pleased, and a few years ago it was criticized for not clearly stating that The Creators Project, one of its channels, was funded by Intel. And Buzzfeed has almost too cleverly disguised its sponsored content as editorial. Last year, Buzzfeed’s U.K. team was taken to task by the British Advertising Standards Authority when it ran a listicle, “14 laundry fails,” without labeling it as paid content by Dylon. Buzzfeed’s “14 Laundry Fails” listicle sponsored by Dylon.  Last summer, Buzzfeed separated its entertainment and news units, a move that to some indicated that the company realized it needed to draw a line, and to others it signaled the ability to focus on growing the entertainment business. At Refinery 29, where about 80 percent of revenue is tied to sponsorship or custom advertising it creates for brands, there’s little debate regarding any kind of separation between news and entertainment. “First and foremost, we’re a media and entertainment company,” said Refinery cofounder and co-chief executive officer Philippe von Borries. “We’ve built one of the most valued — and from a revenue perspective — largest businesses in the space, digitally, by being focused on one audience, and by being able to work with brands in a way to leverage our expertise about knowing everything we do about that audience and creating great entertainment. That’s the business.” The ceo said anecdotally that in recent years, the company has seen an uptick in luxury, fashion and beauty advertising as brands in the space have begun shifting their budgets to digital. Insiders told WWD that many of those larger brands prefer to see their ads in print at legacy magazine titles, but spend less on their web sites. “They go to the magazine companies for magazines,” said Refinery 29 cofounder and co-ceo Justin Stefano. “If they want digital, they are going to go to people who really know how to do it because that’s all they do all day long. We wouldn’t go to a luxury brand and try to sell a print ad. It’s just not what we’re the best at.” The company declined to break out financials, but Von Borries offered that its business “really took off” in 2008 with native advertising and that it essentially launched with a newsletter that it monetized. “You can’t really split [the business]. Our business is about branded entertainment,” he said. “We’re not in the business of running pre-roll advertising.” When asked how a branded content business can be objective while being sponsored by brands with messaging goals, the ceo’s seemed somewhat confused and annoyed by the question. “We’re not an agency, if that’s the question,” Stefano said, giving his definition of a media company today, which is indeed central to the FTC’s change of thinking. “There are things that we do, there are ad products that we have where we’re making stuff for the brands, but we don’t think of ourselves as an agency,” he continued. “We’re a media company. That’s what makes us different, and why brands want to work with us because we’re using tens of thousands of pieces of content across our channels every month for ourselves. Because we’re doing it for ourselves, it gives us a lot of data and insights that we can use when we’re doing it for other brands.” You're missing something!

Executives from General Mills, Mondelez and other packaged goods makers will attend the three-day gathering in May, Bloomberg News has learned. Attendees will tour an Amazon fulfillment center and hear a presentation from Worldwide Consumer chief Jeff Wilke, who reports directly to Jeff Bezos. Amazon is looking to upend relationships between brands and brick-and-mortar stores that for decades have determined how popular products are designed, packaged and shipped. If Amazon succeeds, big brands will think less about creating products that stand out in a Wal-Mart Stores Inc. aisle. Instead, they’ll focus on designing products that can be shipped quickly to customers’ doorsteps. Brands have been experimenting with such changes, so the Seattle event may well resonate. "Times are changing," Amazon says in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. "Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking." Manufacturers would have to re-imagine everything from the way products are made to how they're packaged. Laundry detergent could come in sturdier, leak-proof containers. Instead of flimsy packages designed to pop on store shelves, cookies, crackers and cereal could be packed in durable, unadorned boxes. Plants could spit out products for individuals rather than trucks-full of inventory. It's unclear who would handle the shipping, though Amazon offers a range of fulfillment services. The company declined to comment. Amazon has been struggling to crack the food and packaged goods market — an $800 billion category still dominated by Wal-Mart and other traditional chains. Persuading brands to design their packaging and operations for the online world would make it easier for Amazon to ship common household goods to urban dwellers in less than an hour, potentially making last-minute dashes to the store obsolete. Amazon must convince brands that even though online purchases represent a small part of their sales, e-commerce is the future. 1 2 Next >> By Bloomberg News Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2017, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

The company previously unveiled its AmazonGo and AmazonFresh Pickup ventures and Thursday, it has invited brands such as Mondelez and General Mills, which produce popular foods such as Oreos and Cheerios for a three-day gathering at its Seattle headquarters in May, according a Bloomberg report published Thursday. "Times are changing. Amazon strongly believes that supply chains designed to serve the direct-to-consumer business have the power to bring improved customer experiences and global efficiency. To achieve this requires a major shift in thinking," Amazon said in an invitation obtained by Bloomberg. Read: Amazon Planning To Open 2,000 AmazonGo Stores The aim of the gathering is to persuade FMCG brands to sell online directly to customers and bypass retail chains such as Wal-Mart, Target and Costco, the report added. The gathering will include a tour of the Amazon fulfillment center and a presentation from the company’s worldwide consumer chief, Jeff Wilke. The company wants to change the existing FMCG sale model as retail chains currently determine how food stuffs are designed, packaged and shipped. It wants the products to be designed in such a way that they can be easily and quickly shipped to customers, once they order them online. For example, laundry detergent could come in sturdier containers and cereal could be packed in more durable boxes. Read: AmazonFresh Pickup: Drive-In Grocery Store Concept Unveiled The FMCG industry is currently worth $800 million and currently dominated by retail giants such as Wal-Mart. Amazon wants this to change — it wants FMCG brands to produce for online retail by promising them increased sales, something chains such as Wal-Mart did 20 years ago while convincing the same brands for bulk production. Amazon’s pitch is not unique as many retail chains are moving toward the online model, but their way of doing things is that the customer orders online but picks up products from the store, while Amazon wants to provide customers doorstep deliveries for products. According to Ken Cassar, an analyst at Slice Intelligence, in case Amazon’s pitch is unsuccessful, it can also make its own products to cater to its 300 million shoppers globally.

By Sarmistha Acharya March 30, 2017 14:23 BST Amazon had acquired Quidsi in November 2010 for £437mReuters/Pascal Rossignol Amazon is planning to slash as many as 263 jobs at its unprofitable Quidsi unit that operates Diapers.com, Soap.com, BeautyBar.com and other online websites. The Seattle-based tech major acquired Quidsi in November 2010 for $545m (£437m). However, the company continued to operate independently under its leadership team. Amazon, in a notice filed with New Jersey Department of Labor on Wednesday (29 March), said the job cuts would take place this summer as part of its business restructuring. The affected employees are those at Quidsi's Jersey City, New Jersey, headquarters and customer service operation. "We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable and unfortunately we have not been able to do so," an Amazon spokeswoman told Reuters. The software development team at Quidsi would now focus on building technology for the grocery delivery service AmazonFresh, the spokeswoman added. Quidsi, one of the largest online retailers for baby products, was co-founded by Marc Lore in 2005. Lore sold the company to Amazon as it faced competition from the latter's service Mom, which is a subscription programme wherein members can save 20% on diapers. Lore then found e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired by Walmart Stores last year. Lore is now the chief executive officer of Walmart's US e-commerce division. "It is likely that Prime has grown to the point where members no longer separately shop on Diapers.com or Soap.com so maintenance of separate product-specific sites makes less sense," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter was quoted as saying by Reuters. "It is possible that they are taking a shot at Mark Lore for competition at Wal-Mart." Amazon is quite keen on attracting shoppers who order goods very often. It has more than 50 million US members in its Prime service.

WKMG reported that Nelson Quiles, the father of the girl, says he went into the store to purchase a birthday cake for his son. While they were in the store, Angelina and an uncle went to the Red Box. When Nelson went back to look for the phone, he discovered that it was gone, he says that he texted the phone, and the suspected thief responded. Quiles explained that the phone belonged to a “4-year-old” and received a response reportedly saying “The Wal-Mart floor said I can have it.” Henderson left the store with an order that he’d purchased online, and authorities used that transaction to identify him.

A total of 263 people will lose their jobs at Quidsi's headquarters and customer service operation in Jersey City, N.J., according to a New Jersey state filing Wednesday. But some can apply for new positions with Amazon, Bloomberg reported. "We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable, and unfortunately we have not been able to do so," an Amazon spokeswoman told CNBC in a statement. "Quidsi has great brand expertise and they will continue to offer selection on Amazon.com; the software development team will focus on building technology for AmazonFresh." AmazonFresh is a delivery service available for groceries and other everyday items in more than 20 markets. Earlier this week, Amazon announced it will open two stores in Seattle, where the company is based. Customers can order products online and pick them up at the stores. Quidsi's goods will still be sold on Amazon.com, a spokeswoman told CNBC. Other sites that were part of Quidsi were Wag.com (pets), BeautyBar.com (luxury beauty), Yoyo.com (toys) and Casa.com (home goods). "Consumables like soap and pet food are often priced very competitively by retailers in order to drive price perception and ultimately drive online and in-store traffic," Guru Hariharan, chief executive of retail technology company Boomerang Commerce, said to Fortune. "While unfortunate, the shutting down of the Quidsi sites isn't completely surprising." Quidsi was founded in 2015 by Marc Lore, who then started Jet.com as a competitor to Walmart. Jet.com was recently acquired by Walmart for approximately $3 billion in cash and Lore is now CEO of Walmart's e-commerce division. "I'm not sure which is more unpleasant -- changing diapers, paying too much for them, or running out of them," Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in 2010 after his company acquired Quidsi. "This [acquisition] brings together two companies who are committed to providing great prices and fast delivery to parents, making one of the chores of being a parent a little easier and less expensive." On Tuesday, Amazon announced plans to acquire Souq.com, the largest online retail platform in Arab countries for an undisclosed amount.

Commentary: I hate Shaq’s statue News Features Campus Events Critic’s Corner Sports Opinion Letters to the Editor Editorials Commentaries Español Archives About Us Contact Us Commentaries, Opinion Commentary: I hate Shaq’s statue 3 days ago by Ashley Day 0 0 0 0 1 By John Mitchell, Sports Editor– My parents were the type of parents that only bought me a new pair of shoes when the ones I had were completely unwearable. During my first week of middle school, I made the mistake of choosing kicks from Wal-Mart for my one pair. I remember turning into the aisle and seeing this boldly black shoe that felt like I was petting my cat when I rubbed my hand against it. The shoe turned out to be the signature shoe of arguably the most dominating basketball player in the history of the world: Shaquille O’Neal. I found that out by the emblem on the side –a platinum, quarter-sized Shaq doing a chin up on a rim he dunked on. Long story short, I wore the shoes to school and got clowned everyday for it. By boys and girls. I couldn’t get a female to return my calls for months. This traumatic memory was plunged up from my subconscious last week when Shaq received his own statue in front of the Lakers’ home arena in Los Angeles. Now, every man woman and child who crosses the threshold into the Staples Center will be greeted by a gigantic bronze replica of seven-foot-one freak of nature hovering above them. Initial reviews suggest Shaq’s statue to be the greatest artistic rendering of a professional athlete of all time, but, for obvious reasons, I can’t bring myself to believe it. To me, immortalizing humans with statues seems to be a little outdated. Like 16th century outdated; and to resurrect a statue of someone that’s still alive is just too eerie for me. Did nobody learn from the Joe Paterno situation? It’s 2017 everybody. We’re already falling behind the Jetson’s prediction of having floating cars and interconnected tubes that get us to work, so erecting holograms of people seems like a good start to bridge us into the future. Imagine walking around the Staples Center to see iconic statues of Magic Johnson and Jerry West and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, then, you embark upon a long, shoulder-length cloth hanging from the top of the arena that’s used to project a constant vine loop of Shaq’s 10 best dunks in his career. Who wouldn’t sign up to build that? Maybe they’ll do it for Kobe in a few years. Lord knows if there’s anybody who’s going to break a social norm, it’d be him.

Plenty of places still build statues of their sporting heros, Los Angeles especially with the numerous statues out in front of Staples Center. Many other stadiums and parks have statues of the team legends as well, not the least of which in Manchester, England, with the holy trinity, as they’re referred to. If you hate the statute, okay, that’s your preference, but if you’re going to write and make your opinion know, have a little more reason than being “too eerie”.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links and the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1). The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2). the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now. These days only, I generated close to $36k so far with nothing but my computer and some free time, however i have a full-time nine to 5 job. Even everyone new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income may go much very high over time... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they? Adil Tajgeer Looks like a 256gb card and some on ear akg bt headphones Scott Looks like AT&T's BOGO deal requires a TV package :( TechGuy22 sounds good really expensive but if i can sell my s7 edge for around 300 then i'd be good Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ WITH an additional line mind you. looks like a great device....but has battery improvements been made?? seems this will have the same lackluster battery the S7's had. Not that they were horrible, in my eyes, they couldve/shouldve been better. TechGuy22 also bootloader better not locked PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It is, if you want that don't bother with Samsung TechGuy22 the exynos will be unlocked. the s7 edge is unlocked running remix rom Corey W. Man that $50 Gear S3 is a killer deal even with the $5/m for 24months, that's only a $170bucks headpiece747 Too bad Verizon is not offering that I would get the S8 and S3 in a heartbeat if they did. Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market. Marty The back looks like my Note 5. Nothing different. kapilmachi S8 is all about the front side. Marty ...except for the fingerprint scanner. Analyst_NYC So if i am already an AT&T customer, I can get buy 1 get 1 free (bill credits)? ArrTooDeeToo Meh Margaritas Ante Porcos Still no word on TouchWiz? Did they make it lighter or does it still suck as always? TouchWiz is the only big thank in Samsung phone that makes me look the other way. Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability? Good_Ole_Pinocchio #Unlocked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f4745c019aae7e3c05746af0e61186e5fb91f093c06fdbaea6e834c1cf1ea30a.png Barron Roth Any downside to getting this version? Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean it's fully unlocked and has the bands for all carriers...... But the unlocked S7 still doesn't have nougat....So theres that. Leonardo Baez You will get updates faster on an unlocked device than a carrier one Good_Ole_Pinocchio No. The US Unlocked models still don't have nougat. All the carrier variants do. Leonardo Baez I bet you that will be an upgrade OTA on the first week after unboxing it Good_Ole_Pinocchio Bro I'm taking about the unlocked S7 from last year lol. Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release. Eddy Nelson Lopez Look at the model number, if it ends with the letter U do not buy it if you care about software updates, if the variant ends with the F then do buy it, that's the best variant to receive Software updates and rhe Fastest thanks to the exynos processor. Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat. (He works closely with samsung and got a preview sample unit) https://youtu.be/n0makpckS8c Maybe is the unfinished firmware or something else.... but the image quality of video and pictures looks better in the iPhone. Maybe something that can be corrected with an update? Jay Quir Not going to lie I have recently thought about going from cricket to att because of their direct tv cell phone plan bundle. Yet still trying to see if it will save me money in the long run. Anyone have that plan and dont mind saying how much they pay a month for it? Ailín Ó’S Irish pricing (probably same in the rest of the EU.) S8: €799.99 S8+ €899.99 Interestingly there's a network here (3) which will sell the phone 8 days before general release if someone preorders. Must be preordered by 12/4 however which means the phone will be available on 20/4 instead of 28/April. Richard Markert 95xU news? Mr. Robot "Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173" I strongly doubt there's much interest in the S8 by 20173 ;-) brgulker Is it just me, or is that fingerprint sensor in just about the worst possible spot imaginable? Who likes fingerprints all over their camera lenses!?!?! Bonedatt It's just you 😉 Wildcard Funny, if this were a HTC phone, you guys would have been killing them over the pricing Bonedatt Yea but htc screwed themselves. Always one step forward two steps backwards. They just started listening again to their customers. A little too late if you ask me, but I wish them well. I'm a fan of their designs. dblock Really on the fence about getting one of these. They appear to be quite nice, but I don't know if I want to lock myself into Verizon or not. Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus. Dllemm It would help their credibility if (A) they were upfront about pricing and (B) acknowledge that most people use phone cases in their marketing and build the back of their phones more rigid. Daniel Tiberius Anyone know if I can still use Jump On Demand on T-Mobile for this? Flo R. S8 € 799.- S8+ € 899.- In Austria http://www.saturn.at/de/shop/samsung-s8.html?utm_medium=affilate&utm_campaign=SE%5F%5Fsparhamster%2Dpost&utm_source=sparhamster&etcc_var=textlink&etcc_grp=sparhamster&dclid=CNaO16DU_NICFYyPGwodyNEOnA Fiorta I gotta get rid of this Nexus 6. It's terrible... G6 or S8?! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Ju kidding me mon? S8 or S8 Plus. G6 is nice, but not worth $750. iluvthesoftsoft One Plus 3T, and save $300-$400. Bonedatt OP3T... That's the equivalent (processor wise) to the G6. Eddy Nelson Lopez I can't believe people still buy phones from US carriers, that's the stupidest idea you can have, just buy the european variant at full price and forget about US carriers controlling your software updates and Just use a pre-paid company like Simple Mobile. lomsha You do that and let others make purchases as they wish. It's a free world. krazy $1199 and $1349 in Australia... Insane!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars ENTREPRENEUR Voxy raises $12 million to roll out its e-learning English app in emerging markets Bérénice Magistretti@bmagistretti March 30, 2017 4:00 AM Tags: funding daily, Voxy Above: Voxy website and mobile app Image Credit: Voxy Learning a new language can feel very academic, which is why Voxy is making the experience more practical by drawing on content from real world news, events, and locations. The edtech startup today announced new funding of $12 million to further develop its e-learning app. “Rather than teaching phrases that are not relevant to our learners’ needs, like ‘Janie kicks the ball’, we deliver real English content that is updated daily,” wrote Voxy CEO Paul Gollash, in an email to VentureBeat. Voxy’s users study with videos of people accomplishing daily tasks, audio recordings of real-life situations, karaoke-style music lessons, and current news stories. Available as a subscription service, Voxy targets schools, corporations, and individuals through its website and mobile apps (available on both Android and iOS). And 116 institutional customers have signed up, including AT&T, Walmart, Reuters, Bosch, and the U.S. Department of State. In its statement, Voxy specifically points to one customer, Grundfos, a water pump manufacturer that wants to facilitate English communication between its 18,000 employees based in 80 different countries. Gollash considers traditional publishing companies and brick-and-mortar language schools as competitors. Although he did not name any specific players, companies like Kaplan and Pearson are some of the bigger names in this sector. Pearson actually led Voxy’s last funding round of $8.5 million and has a minority stake in the startup. Even though there are no current talks of acquisition for Voxy, Pearson has already acquired several education-related startups, such as Learning Catalytics, Examdesign, and Schoolnet. SJF Ventures led today’s round, with new investor Inherent Group joining in. Existing investors Rethink Education, Contour Venture Partners, Weld North, and GSV Acceleration also participated. This brings Voxy’s total raised to $39 million. The startup will use the new injection of capital to hire more people and increase sales and marketing. It will also expand its reach in emerging markets across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Launched in 2010, Voxy has 50 employees working in its New York City headquarters and São Paulo, Brazil office. Sign up for Funding Daily: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.

As the global economic growth is transforming the world into a global marketplace, online merchants, card processors, and payment solution providers are learning how to collaborate with each other and overcome technical and business hurdles. Canada accounts for the highest share of online cross-border shoppers across the globe. Also, French cross-border shoppers purchase products from online retailers in Canada. Over three-fourths of the overall German online retailers in German-speaking countries such as Austria and Switzerland engage in cross-border e-commerce. France also accounts for the same percentage where shoppers and merchants engage in cross-border e-commerce with economies such as Belgium and Switzerland. The listed pricing for this Online Electronics Retailing Market report starts at $ 3500. Request Discount for Online Electronics Retailing Market Research Report @ https://marketsizeforecasters.com/enquire-for-discount/18327 According to the report, one driver in market is operational cost benefits for e-retailers. E-commerce vendors have least operational costs in terms of deploying human resources. Customers have 24-hour unlimited access to online stores, and hence vendors need not hire sales staff for assisting customers. Also, they need not pay for any storefront space. In contrary, offline retail vendors need to maintain huge inventory stores and warehouses, which requires them to incur significant storage costs. The real estate cost has also been on the rise, and it would further lead to an increase in the inventory storage cost of retailers that operate brick-and-mortar stores. Further, the report states that one challenge in market is concerns regarding product quality. In online retailing, the product quality has always been a cause for concern, especially for technical products such as electronic devices, where functionality is a key factor that influences purchase decisions. Since it is very difficult to estimate the product quality through online channels, the sales of bulky white goods are lesser in comparison to handheld devices across the globe.

(The Canadian Press/Graham Hughes) VANCOUVER—While millions of dollars worth of unsold fresh food ends up in landfills across Canada, food banks and supermarkets are teaming up to get more perishable food into the hands of those who need it most, avoiding harmful waste. In Quebec, a supermarket food recovery program was launched in 2013 to tackle the rise in demand at food banks in the province and the massive amounts of food rotting in local landfills. Officials in the province said last year that the project, dubbed the first of its kind in Canada, had 177 supermarkets on board donating 2.5 million kilograms of food. It is set to expand further this year. “The fascinating thing about what’s happening in Montreal and Quebec, and even in all of Canada, is there is enough surplus food to feed everybody,” said Sam Watts, the chief executive officer of Welcome Hall Mission, a large food bank in Montreal. “There’s no problem with food—the challenge is building the partnerships, managing the supply chain, and getting distribution together in a way that is both dignified and safe.” The province of Quebec, which chipped in with a $400,000 grant to help with transportation costs, said the ultimate goal is to reduce food waste by 8 million kilograms. The challenge is building the partnerships, managing the supply chain, and getting distribution together in a way that is both dignified and safe. — Sam Watts, Welcome Hall Mission Watts and other food bank leaders are optimistic the success of the recovery program in Quebec could be duplicated across the country if more key players work together to increase the infrastructure needed to accommodate the regular intake of fresh food, such as meat, dairy, produce, and baked goods, from grocery stores. But Food Banks Canada said a one-size-fits-all approach likely wouldn’t work, as geography plays a role in the ability to collect and redistribute the food. Many provinces have smaller organizations whereas in Quebec food banks are more centralized. “Every province has a different structure of networks with their food banks, so every province has to figure out the best way that they can [to increase food recovery],” said Marzena Gersho, Food Banks Canada’s communication director. “But certainly there have been existing long-term relationships between local food banks and supermarkets over a number of years.” Gersho said other provinces have seen a recent increase in the ability to collect more perfectly edible food from supermarkets. She noted that last week, the Walmart Foundation announced a $2 million grant to pay for more refrigeration trucks for transport purposes and additional refrigerator and storage space to help redistribute the food in a multitude of communities in Canada. She added that Walmart and Loblaws have also been donating more fresh food to food banks throughout Canada, and she sees this only increasing as awareness grows with the surge in food bank usage across the country. Currently, around 900,000 people, a third of whom are children, rely on food banks each month, a 28 percent increase from 2008. The province of B.C. has also stepped up to the plate, announcing on March 22 a $10 million grant to increase food bank infrastructure to help collect more food in the province. A man receives food from volunteers at the Welcome Hall Mission in Montreal on March 14, 2017. (The Canadian Press/Graham Hughes) “Right now, food banks in B.C. turn down thousands of pounds of perfectly good donated meats, vegetables, fruits, and fresh milk because their facilities simply don’t have enough—or any—refrigeration capacity,” Minister of Social Development Michelle Stilwell said in an email to Epoch Times. “Our government’s investment to support refrigeration capacity for food banks across the province now means perfectly fresh, nutritious food will go to families in need.” Food Banks BC said the $10 million boost will be distributed throughout the 100 food banks in the province and it expects the capacity to collect and redistribute food could look something similar to what is being done in Quebec. “That’s the absolute key for this to work,” said Laura Lansink, executive director of Food Banks BC. “If our food banks can have the freezers, the fridges, and the transportation that’s refrigerated to get the food back and forth and redistribute it, that’s addressing 99 percent of the problem.” For Lansink and Watts, a working partnership with supermarkets has always been a key part of reducing the amount of fresh food getting trashed and increasing the number of people in need getting fed. The grocery division of the Retail Council of Canada (RCC), which represents 97 percent of Canadian supermarkets, said that as long as the food products are managed in a safe way, there’s no reason why donations across Canada could not increase. “There is a goal for grocery stores to ensure the product stays out of the waste stream,” said David Wilkes, senior vice-president of the grocery division at RCC. “And if there’s opportunity to broaden our relationship [with food banks] we would be willing to look at that.” Jared Gnam is a freelance reporter based in Vancouver. He broke into the world of journalism by covering the Stanley Cup riot in 2011. Food bank use in Canada 1 in 8 Canadian families struggle to put food on the table. 32% of the people requiring food assistance are children. 25% of food bank users are immigrants. 16% of people in need of food assistance have income from recent or current employment. 79,000 people each month access a food bank for the first time. Almost 40% of food bank clients have a diploma, degree, or higher. On average, people in the city core who use food assistance programs do so for two years.

Video coordinator Chad Harmon drove Vucetic to Chicago to catch a flight. The Hamzics and Vucetic’s girlfriend, UE volleyball player Jelena Merseli, met them there to make sure Vucetic had the necessary paperwork to return to the U.S. whenever he was ready. “They were there for me, supporting me basically every day on the phone with them talking about what’s happening,” Vucetic said of Hamzic and his wife, Jasna. “It was just unbelievable support from people you don’t expect you’re ever going to meet and then they become a part of your life. I’m sometimes closer with them than with some of my other cousins back home.” The Hamzics came to America 19 years ago as refugees from the Bosnian War. They received initial help from Central Christian Church in Washington, Indiana, and within a few months moved to Evansville for better career opportunities. Both Maid and Jasna have worked at the Toyota plant in Gibson County for the last 15 years. In the past few years, they’ve become close to a handful of UE student-athletes from former Yugoslavian countries. It started with Serbian tennis player Aleksandra Dzakula, who completed her career in 2012. One day, she followed Jasna and Maid through the aisles of a Walmart before working up the nerve to approach them. “What language are you speaking?” she asked. “I said, ‘Bosnian,'” Maid Hamzic recalled. “She said, ‘Do you speak Serbian?’ And I was like ‘Of course.’ That’s like asking someone from Indiana if they can understand American English from Kentucky.” The Hamzics began following the Evansville men’s basketball program after befriending Croatian swingman Mislav Brzoja, who graduated a year early in 2016 and is now playing professionally in his native country. Brzoja introduced Vucetic to the Hamzics in the summer of 2014, and they’ve grown close. The Hamzics have attended nearly every home game for the last three years, and some of the road games within a short drive. “When you go somewhere far away from home and you meet somebody from your hometown, you have so much things to talk about,” Vucetic said. “You can talk about back home, what happened on TV, why that happened. “Then you find out that you’re maybe cousins because it’s not a huge country and everybody is connected in some way. You find out that you know the same people or we were at the same places maybe a couple months apart. It helps so much having somebody to talk to in your home language and remember the stuff that was happening back home. It means the world.” It also meant a lot to Vucetic to be embraced by the Evansville community after he returned to the team after a three-week absence. He never questioned whether he would come back once he had a plan in place for his mother, Marika, who broke her leg in the car wreck that killed her husband. Vucetic’s local support system included the Hamzics, his Aces coaches and teammates and even the fans who cheered him upon returning for Evansville’s 87-70 win over Drake on Feb. 14. “Coach (Marty Simmons) put me in for 20 seconds and I got an ovation, everyone was cheering,” Vucetic said. “That kind of support from the whole Evansville fan base is amazing and they were all telling me they’re glad I’m back and stuff like that. That might be a small thing for somebody else but it means a great deal for me.” Vucetic said his professors were understanding about his absence from classes and have helped him remain on track to graduate with a global business degree in May. He is still mulling his options: using his degree back in Serbia, pursuing a professional basketball career in Europe or sticking around Evansville a while longer. Whatever Vucetic decides, he knows he’ll have support.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links and the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1). The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2). the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now.

This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they?

Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market.

Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability?

Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year.

Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus?

But the council encouraged administrators Tuesday, March 28, to pursue agreements with Rio Ranch Market in Banning and the Walmart Supercenter in Beaumont where customers could pay bills, especially when city hall is closed. The vote was 4-0 with Councilman Don Peterson absent. Peterson had been a critic of the proposal when it was brought up last month. Deputy City Manager Rochelle Clayton said the staff was looking for ways to provide "better customer service" and consulted other cities, including Colton, which has a kiosk accessible outside its city hall. City officials have estimated about 80 percent of customers who stand in line to pay their bills are paying in cash. The city, which provides water and has its own municipal electrical utility, also has online bill pay. Council members said they have seen lines for customer service inside city hall, but the waits did not appear long. "I came in here on Friday and it's absolutely dead" without a wait, said Councilwoman Daniele Andrade, who called the plan a waste of taxpayer dollars. "We are too small of a city to put in a kiosk." Andrade suggested that money should be put toward a forensic audit that utility customers have asked for. As had happened at recent meetings, customers showed up to complain about utility bills. City officials had told the public they were making changes in staffing and procedures this month to work toward billing periods closer to 31 days. Many March bills were for up to 42 days, but city officials did not address why that is happening. Andrade and Mayor George Moyer asked City Manager Michael Rock for a report back at the next council meeting. Administrators had proposed a lease and maintenance agreement with Michigan-based Diversified Data Processing & Consulting Inc. initially to provide two kiosks -- one at city hall and one at a downtown Banning business. The council balked at that last month and the revised proposal was for one kiosk for $33,540 a year lease and a one-time setup cost of $9,800, according to a city staff report. The lease would be subject to cancellation after a year. Mayor Pro Tem Debbie Franklin suggested the city test out the bill pay options at businesses and return a staff report back in six months. Resident Anne Price who surveyed some of her neighbors using social media, said the kiosk idea is "not a service we are concerned about. We get good service. We want lower rates."

The nonprofit has been awarded a $2,100 Giving Tree grant from the Faulkner County affiliate of the Arkansas Community Foundation to buy a new commercial refrigerator for the shelter. Comments aAFont Size CONWAY  Gloria Cheshier, executive director of the Faulkner County affiliate, said the grants range from $750 to $2,100. “Funding for our Giving Tree grants comes from local individuals and families. We invest their donations in the endowment, and it provides a permanent source of funding for charitable causes in our county.” For example, Bethlehem House, a transitional homeless shelter in Conway, is using its $2,100 grant to purchase a new commercial refrigerator to be used for its food-service program. Aimee Prince, development director for Bethlehem House, said the old refrigerators came from the former shelter to the new 72,000-square-foot, two-story facility at 1115 Parkway St., which opened more than three years ago. “Right now, they’re costing us more in repairs than they’re worth,” she said of the refrigerators. One of the larger, commercial refrigerators “is the one on the blink.” “We have to replace it anyway, and it’s really nice to know that we have money, that we don’t have to dip into operating funds to pay for it,” Prince said. Judi Lively, executive director of Bethlehem House, said refrigerators are essential not only for the residents, but for outreach programs, including the weekly meals and food boxes given out. “To me, the Giving Tree grants are exactly what they say — it’s not money we count on every year, but it really is — ‘Oh, we have a need, and here are some funds available; let’s apply for it.’ “It makes me feel like that book [The Giving Tree] — that feeling of happiness.” Bethlehem House has room for 44 residents, including eight emergency beds. In addition to housing, showers are available for homeless people from 4:30-7 p.m. daily, and a food pantry and a free meal for the public are provided at 6 each evening. Another grant recipient, the Women’s Shelter of Central Arkansas in Conway, received a $1,500 grant to go toward the purchase of mattresses and bed frames for clients’ rooms. Carrie Curtis, executive director of the shelter, said it combined a grant from Walmart with the Giving Tree grant to replace 17 mattresses and frames and make them bed-bug proof, she said. “We’ve had some of the same mattresses since I started working there 17 years ago.” Although the shelter has never had a bed-bug problem, other shelters have. “It’s a pre-emptive action,” she said. “Between those two grants, I will be able to replace every one of those mattresses. “We’ll be rid of any type of fabric that will allow for that, and we should be able to purchase some new, nicer, durable wood bunk beds with full on bottom, twin on top,” she said. The 12 other grant recipients and their projects are as follows: • The Conway Police Department to support the Book Center, a new component of the Conway Police Department’s fifth annual Child Safety Fair; • The Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund to provide financial-support scholarships to single-parent students to help them stay in school, complete their program and get a good-paying job; • The Blackbird Academy of Arts in Conway to support the Arts Access Program for areas of the community that would otherwise not have access to arts-education classes and arts performances; • The Boys & Girls Club of Faulkner County to support opportunities for youth to expand their knowledge of art through the funding of art-room equipment and supplies; • The city of Greenbrier to provide site furniture, compost bins and a butterfly/pollinator garden and fund gardening supplies for demonstrations at events for the city community garden, located behind the Senior Center; • Conway Cradle Care to expand its services to serve at-risk Faulkner County community members under age 25 who are pursuing higher education or employment to improve their lives, as well as the lives of their children; • The Faulkner County Council on Aging Inc. to fund a vehicle to be used in the Meals on Wheels program; • The Faulkner County Museum to serve as matching funds for a grant from the Arkansas Historic Preservation Program to paint and restore windows on the historic Faulkner County Jail building; • Independent Living Services in Conway to purchase exercise equipment for the therapy department; • The Ministry Center in Conway to outfit the warming station with cots and blankets; • Renewal Ranch to provide a computer and printer for a new class to teach job-search skills and strategies to clients; and • The Soul Food Cafe Mission to install a ventilation hood in its new facility at 1717 S. Donaghey Ave. to allow food services to be offered. All nonprofit agencies in Faulkner County are encouraged to apply for Giving Tree grants from Jan. 10 through Feb. 15 each year. More information about Community Foundation grants is available at www.arcf.org. Since 1976, the nonprofit Community Foundation has provided more than $156 million in grants, Cheshier said. The leadership of the nonprofits will be honored at the annual Celebration of Giving Luncheon from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. May 10.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 35 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares87 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links and the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1). The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2). the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too. Mike Marshall President of MSN!, is giving advice individuals to start "Work at home" method, that Loads of marketers have been doing more than a year now.

This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they?

Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market.

Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability?

Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year.

Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus?

I’m just wondering. If you auditioned out here in Rabbit Valley, you had some stiff competition. I mean, after all, our army of seasoned bunnies with chain-saw teeth, able to destroy lawns faster than Cal American Water, don’t dress for work. Not like you do, carrying a basket with pink satin ribbons or wearing a vest embroidered with petunias. At least, I haven’t ever seen one like that gnawing on my marigolds. Seems you outdid yourself in the audition. What do you do in the off-season? Mascot perhaps? Walmart greeter? In anticipation of your arrival, Mr. Fixit (the husband) and I have already downed a few thousand jelly beans and dozens of those crunchy chocolate eggs. What does it feel like, Mr. Bunny, to know that your customers are getting a little round around the edges, soon to be anchored like the USS Bismarck into our easy chairs? We certainly won’t be hopping down any old bunny trail. Turns out, even the frequently pregnant daughter who lives on carrot juice and chardonnay, has also polished off a few dozen bags of peanut butter eggs. Your holiday confections show no mercy. Mr. Bunny, here’s my concern: This is a tough time for us humans, and your pre-Easter temptations are not helping. I mean nobody agrees on anything anymore, and Mr. Fixit thinks kale should be landfill. I thought you rabbits were about carrots? Adding insult to injury, it’s baseball season, which means a steady diet of soft pretzels at Fiore field, followed by hot dogs at Dover-Hendrix, and don’t forget the chili dog with jalapeños after a trek to Oxnard-El Rio. Due to my three rotten grandkids, now all in the game, I’ve become a Little League ballfield cuisine aficionado. And I’ve got the beef-jerky skin to prove it. If you wanna know which field never runs out of Cheetos, you’re in the right place. “We understand plump,” Mr. Fixit announces as he’s dicing his havarti to go with pretzel chips and olives as pregame warmup for the madness of March. “We?” I ask as I sneak the last piece of banana walnut bread out of the fridge and devour it before he busts me, trying to scoop the last bits of goo out of my receding gums before I say anything. I guess he’s noticed I’m beginning to resemble Miss Piggy. Seems the 20 pounds I lost found me again. And again. “I guess you’re getting ready for the Easter Bunny,” I tell my roommate as I spy a new bag of Easter egg peanut M&M’s, purchased by Mr. Fixit. “Yes,” he admits, “but I get that one confused with the Playboy Bunny.” “Oh really?” “Yes,” he continues. “It always happens this time of year. Must be those little white tails.” He thinks he’s hilarious. So, Mr. Bunny, or is it Ms.? Anyway, Madame Easter Bunny, thanks to you, my goofy husband and your Easter treats, I can only muse about when I used to remotely resemble the Playboy version of your species. Next year, only carrots and kale. Please. But can you make them taste like those crunchy little chocolate eggs? Thanks.

(Photo: Detroit Free Press file photo, William Archie)Buy Photo 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE When it comes to car shopping, one of the weird tips out there is don't forget your ZIP code. The reason? Rebates aren't a one-size-fits-all proposition. While we see big national ads on TV, the reality is that dealers need to move cars and trucks off local lots. ZIP codes can unlock many incentives that may be offered at a given time on a specific vehicle in a metro area, said Brad Korner, general manager for Cox Automotive Rates & Incentives in Ann Arbor. As annoying as it might seem to take an extra step, consumers should plug in that ZIP code when researching car prices and deals online to determine local or regional incentives. Picture these examples, taken from AIS Rebates, a Cox Automotive company that offers rebate and incentive research and analysis: In late March, a 2017 Chevrolet Impala LT had $3,750 in incentives in Detroit versus $2,750 in Charlotte, N.C. A 2017 Buick Envision had $2,000 in incentives in Detroit versus $4,000 in Tampa, Fla. A 2017 Malibu LT had $3,000 in incentives in Detroit versus $4,000 in Chicago and other select markets. March incentives can change as early as April 1.  Can you simply head to another state to get a better discount? Probably not. Most often, carmakers will require that you use the rebates that would be available where you're going to be registering the car, Korner said. But the better equipped you are with information about the latest incentives before walking onto a car lot, the more likely you'll be able to negotiate the best deal possible for yourself. If you spot a special rebate online, make sure the car salesperson adds in that discount, too. When you know the right questions to ask, experts say, it's amazing how often a car salesperson can find another $1,000 or $2,000 in incentives. Many consumers would never imagine that dealers in different states could have different rebates on the same car — or incentives that go beyond what's advertised on TV.  But maybe an automaker wants to hold onto its competitive edge and market share in an area, so the carmaker has more reason to push pick-up trucks in Texas than, say, Rhode Island. And some incentives are applied to individual vehicle identification numbers to help sell specific, slow-to-move vehicles in a given area, Korner said. What are some clues for getting a better discount on a car? • Pay attention to special offers or conditional rebates.  If you're a recent college grad, look for things like College Cash. Automakers can have special rebates for college students and active military. Take time to understand what's required to be an eligible participant, said Alicia Rudowyj, import rebate manager and trainer at Cox Automotive Rates & Incentives. Nissan is offering $500 in Grad Cash, for example, on a 2017 Nissan 370Z Coupe. Among other requirements, Nissan wants proof of college graduation within the past 24 months or proof of current enrollment in a U.S. graduate school or written confirmation of an upcoming graduation within the next six months. When it comes to the military discount of $500, Nissan defines the military as U.S. active and reserve military, U.S. military veterans within 12 months of separation from active or reserve duty, and U.S. military retirees who have completed at least 20 years of active or reserve duty. Or there can be loyalty bonuses if an automaker wants to encourage drivers to stay with the same brand or even the same model. Some conquest bonuses are available if an automaker has a smaller market share but wants to lure consumers over to a new car brand. Sometimes you can find rebates on new 2016 cars that remain on the lot, as well as new 2017 models. Many times, automakers will peg special rebates to holidays or events, such as a local auto show. "This time of year is really big for auto shows. So you're going to see a lot of incentives there," Korner said. • Remember, incentives change over time.  For many car manufacturers, incentives can change on the first or the second of the month. But some incentives can be added during the month, too. Incentives tied to leasing will vary, too. To find out about rebates, check the manufacturer's website and other research spots, such as Kelley Blue Book at KBB.com or Edmunds.com. Ronald Montoya, senior consumer advice editor for Edmunds.com, said you want to find out what incentives you can stack — or use together. Think of it like using $10 in Kohl's cash or rewards on top of a 30%-off coupon when you're buying an item that's already on sale. In some cases, Montoya noted that an automaker's bonus cash cannot be combined with a low annual percentage rate offer at the dealership. Some recommend getting pre-approved for a car loan elsewhere before shopping in order to compare offers. In some cases, it may be better to take the rebate and find low-cost financing elsewhere. Montoya suggests double-checking with a salesperson to see whether there are other incentives, maybe local promotions that are not advertised nationally.

Jumping into a bad car loan could be easy Record number of car buyers 'upside down' on trade-ins • Think inside the big box. Big retailers, such as Costco and now Wal-Mart, to a limited degree, are offering auto-buying programs. No, they're not stocking SUVs next to the socks or salad fixings. Instead, it's often a way to connect car buyers with select dealerships that are offering low prices. Wal-Mart is working with a partner called CarSaver — an online auto retail platform — to provide the service. Wal-Mart has one pilot program through a store in Stuart, Fla. Automotive News reported in January that Wal-Mart will lease space in some additional stores this year. CarSaver, for example, will set up kiosks inside four stores in Arizona in April, according to Wal-Mart. Car dealer Earl Stewart, who writes a blog called Earloncars.com, said consumers can find a transparent pricing model via the Costco auto-buying program. Stewart, a Fla.-based auto dealer who loves to talk about the car buying process, said the Costco program can protect consumers from efforts by some car dealers to add dealer fees and dealer-installed options to a car or truck to boost the price. Stewart, who is the owner of Earl Stewart Toyota in North Palm Beach, Fla., said he is part of the Costco dealer network and must provide pricing that is a good value. Select dealers would have a Costco member-only price sheet to show the exclusive prearranged savings. Costco has 47 franchised dealers in Michigan. More than 3,000 dealerships participate nationwide. Costco's program can apply to new vehicles and pre-owned vehicles with a manufacturer's warranty. Only certain trained personnel at the select dealership are able to sell vehicles under the Costco program. Information is at CostcoAuto.com. Stewart said consumers would be entitled to applicable manufacturer rebates or special financing. He suggests that auto buyers ask to see the manufacturer’s invoice and the manufacturer's suggested retail price for the vehicle they select to see how much they saved as a Costco member. Another option is to review information on TrueCar.com — a digital automotive marketplace that provides pricing data about what other people paid for their cars and also powers some car-buying programs. You also might want to shop a dealer early in the month to compare prices and return at the end of the month to see whether a deal has improved. Not rushing to drive a car off a lot remains a good way to save money. Contact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

Related News/Archive Starbucks to open a cafe inside a Publix store in Tampa 6 Months Ago Instacart expands into Tampa Bay to deliver Publix groceries and more 5 Months Ago 1,200 Brandon-area customers lose power, Tampa Electric says 7 Months Ago The farm workers, students and church members marched the mile from the Publix GreenWise Market in Hyde Park to the Wendy's restaurant on Kennedy Boulevard Wednesday afternoon. They held banners calling for boycotts of the two brands unless they join the Fair Food Program. It's an effort that began in 2011, when Florida farm workers with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers created the partnership with Florida tomato growers and major food retailers to prevent produce purchases from companies that exploit their employees. Since then the group has recruited 14 corporations, including McDonald's, Walmart and Trader Joe's, to pay one penny more per pound of tomatoes to help increase workers' wages. The member organizations also promised to only purchase products from growers who adhere to a strict code of conduct that prohibits sexual harassment and forced labor. Still, not all major food retailers agree with the program. For seven years, Lakeland-based Publix has resisted increasing pressure to join the FFP, and has no plans to relent anytime soon. "It's very simple for us: They're asking us to pay a penny more per pound of tomatoes for the workers and we're asking them to put it in the price of their product," said Publix spokesman Brian West as he watched protestors march along the perimeter of the Hyde Park store Wednesday. "If you're not satisfied with your pay you don't go to the customer and talk about it, you talk to your boss, the people who pay your wage," West said. Wendy's got on the coalition's radar last year, when the company began purchasing tomatoes from Mexico instead of it's traditional vendors in Florida after the FFP began seeking reforms in the industry. A brief protest and candle-light vigil outside the Kennedy Boulevard fast-food restaurant during rush hour Wednesday marked the final stop in the coalition's 2,000-mile, 12-city "Return to Human Rights Tour." One after another, potential Wendy's customers chatted with police officers and took photos with their cell phones before making a U-turn in the parking lot and heading to the nearby Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell or McDonald's. "For me it means a lot because I see the changes where I work," said Cruz Salucio, as he marched across Kennedy Boulevard while scores of Tampa police officers on bicycles held back traffic. "Before the bosses felt like they could get away with anything and you were in an environment where you weren't respected," said Salucio, a 32-year-old who has worked in Immokalee's tomato fields for about 10 years. "Now we're starting to get the things that other workers take for granted, like being able to punch in and punch out so there's a record of how many hours you work, or having access to shade and clean drinking water." Other extreme abuses in the fields, such as sexual harassment and wage theft, have also declined dramatically since the FFP's inception, said the Rev. Noelle Damico, an organizer with the National Economic and Social Rights Initiative. Students such 21-year-old Alex Schelle, a social services major at New College of Florida in Sarasota, have spread the movement to campuses across the country. Next week, students at New College will fast to draw attention to the coalition's efforts, Schelle said. "It's really awesome how communities of faith and students can be drawn together to use their consumer powers to let these corporations know that this is already a successful program and all they have to do is join," Schelle said. Despite resistance from Publix and others, the group remains optimistic, she said. "I know we'll change their minds, we have before and we will now," said the Rev. Robert Murphy, 69, who marched with members of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Tarpon Springs. "We're asking for so little, just basic human decency," he said.

Dubai-listed Emaar Malls confirmed Monday that it had submitted an $800-M bid to acquire Souq.com. The bid has not been accepted. yet The move is “in line with our strategy to align e-commerce with physical shopping,” Emaar Malls said. Last week, it was reported that online shopping giant Amazon had agreed to fully acquire Souq.com after previously backing away from a deal. The news has not yet been confirmed. “Emaar Malls’ bid for Souq.com makes sense,” said Paul Cuatrecasas, CEO of Aquaa Partners. “Souq is already an e-Commerce giant in the region, and as a commercial property developer, Emaar Malls has seen the destructive effect e-Commerce players have had on traditional retail profitability in the developing world. “In the US, established retailers, like Walmart and Kroger, are fighting for their lives against competition from Amazon, who not only offers a wider range of products, but a better customer experience and faster delivery too. Walmart and Kroger have been caught on the backfoot, and they are now trying to catch up by investing in technology. “Emaar Malls can’t afford to find itself in the same position in a few years’ time – it needs to limit Amazon’s growth at all costs. The best way to do this is to make sure that Amazon can’t get a significant foothold in the market in the first place,” he said. Souq was valued at $1-B in its last funding round in which it raised $275-M from investors including Standard Chartered. Amazon is reported to be offering less than that valuation, the amount is around $650-M. “The competitive bid for Souq is a sensible way to keep Amazon out of the market, and if it means that Emaar Malls can help stave off potential competition that would lead to its death in 5, 10, or even 20 years, as well as enhance the customer experience going forward, then $800-M is a relatively cheap price to pay,” said Mr. Cuatrecasas. “But the real genius of this bid is that it is not only defensive – it’s offensive too. By putting itself in a powerful position to drive growth through e-Commerce, Emaar Malls is ramping up competition with other established commercial developers in the market. “It believes that the future of retail is online, or online combined with an enhanced offline shopping ‘experience’, and that Souq could also drive a new generation of growth for the company in the region.” The GCC’s e-commerce market is expected to grow to $20-B by Y 2020 from $5.3-B in Y 2015, according to a report by consultancy AT Kearney.

Here's how to save $100. Editor's Note: This story was updated on March 30 with more details. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is arriving soon everywhere; Samsung says pre-orders begin March 30 and phones ship April 21, though that timetable will likely depend on your carrier. The phone will be available from AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless, as well as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. There are a bewildering array of plan options. You can buy it upfront, on fast-upgrade plans, or on payment plans. Your best deals, almost certainly, will come from third-party retailers such as Walmart. Samsung says all pre-orders should include a free Gear VR headset with a controller. If you want to add a 256GB MicroSD card and AKG Bluetooth headphones, that will be $99 more. That's a good deal, as a high-quality (not trash) 256GB MicroSD card alone costs around $129 right now. There won't be a non-carrier-branded model of the phone in the US to start, but Samsung told us that an officially unlocked, all carrier-compatible unit will follow "within a few months." Verizon models are always unlocked, but it'll initially be difficult to buy a Verizon model without a Verizon account. So far, we have prices from all the listed carriers and retailers except Cricket Wireless. AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile are all charging $750 for the S8 and $850 for the S8+. U.S. Cellular is charging $674.99 for the S8 and $784.99 for the S8+. At Walmart.com, its Total Wireless and Straight Talk brands are charging $659 for the S8 and $759 for the S8+. However, those phones will be locked to those services for a year. On AT&T, if you go for the AT&T Next payment plan, have two lines of service, and you're also a DirecTV customer, you can get credits towards a second Galaxy S8 to the tune of $25 a month for 30 months. Or, if you choose a two-year contract, you can get a Gear S3 watch for $49, or a Samsung Tab E or a Gear S2 for 99 cents. All of those would be on contract. Sprint has a deal where if you lease the Galaxy S8, you'll be able to upgrade to a Galaxy S9 after 12 months, having paid only $375 for your phone (but you'll have to give it back to Sprint.) U.S. Cellular will give you a "free" Galaxy S8 over a 30-month period, but you have to pay $25 upfront, $8.99/month for insurance, and trade in one of the following used phones: iPhone 5s, SE, 6, 6 Plus, 6s, 6s Plus, 7, 7 Plus, Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge Plus, S6 Active, S7, S7 Edge, S7 Active, Note 5, or Note Edge. This is the best trade-in deal we've seen, provided you're willing to hang on to that GS8 for at least two years. Verizon is charging slightly less than the other carriers: $720 for the S8 and $840 for the S8+. Remember, if you have another phone that's paid off, you can sell it or trade it in to help finance your Galaxy S8 purchase. The carriers have their own trade-in programs, and we also have a guide to some third-party options here. Better Buy at Best Buy Best Buy and Target are undercutting the carriers' direct prices, hoping you'll also spend money on accessories or other home electronics. Best Buy's discount looks cleaner; it's just a discount. Target gives you a gift card. Best Buy: "Up to $100 off," if you use two-year payment plans from AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. On the AT&T Next plan, the S8 costs $699.99, and the S8+ costs $750. For Verizon, that makes the S8 $670.08, and the S8+ $715.68. For Sprint, that makes the S8 $699.84, and the S8+ $750. Target: A flier leaked last week shows a deal for a $100 gift card on AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. Walmart: You can "save $150" on an AT&T, Sprint, or Verizon Galaxy S8 or S8+ at physical stores only, if you buy it on an installment plan. Microsoft will also be selling a special "Microsoft Edition" Galaxy S8 and S8+ at physical Microsoft Stores for $749.99 and $849.99. The phones will be pre-populated with Microsoft apps. We don't have more details on this yet. For more, check out my Galaxy S8 Q&A from today's launch event below. Hands on with the Galaxy S8, live at Samsung Unpacked!

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo By Jeffrey Dastin Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) plans to cut 263 jobs at its money-losing parenting products unit Quidsi this summer as part of a business restructuring, it said in a notice filed with New Jersey on Wednesday. The New Jersey-based subsidiary operates Diapers.com, Soap.com and other websites. "We have worked extremely hard for the past seven years to get Quidsi to be profitable and unfortunately we have not been able to do so," an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. Quidsi's software development team will focus on building technology for the grocery delivery service AmazonFresh, the statement said. The move underscores a shift in Amazon's focus to groceries and other areas since it closed its $500 million cash acquisition of Quidsi in 2011. Fresh food represents a large and fledgling market for online retailers, in contrast to goods such diapers that have been the subject of price wars in recent years. "Consumables like soap and pet food are often priced very competitively by retailers in order to drive price perception and ultimately drive online and in-store traffic," said Guru Hariharan, chief executive of retail technology company Boomerang Commerce. "While unfortunate, the shutting down of the Quidsi sites isn't completely surprising." The market appeared to welcome Amazon's attention to losses at the subsidiary, unusual for a company that has prioritized long-term investments over profit. Amazon's stock briefly hit a record high of $876.44 before closing at $874.32. Its chief executive and largest shareholder, Jeff Bezos, gained nearly $1.5 billion from the 2.1 percent stock rise. SHOT AT RIVAL? Quidsi was co-founded by Marc Lore, who sold the company during heated competition from Amazon "Mom" subscriptions that offered free shipping and perks on baby items. Amazon has been keen to attract subscribers, who order more goods more often, and now is estimated to have more than 50 million U.S. members in its fast-shipping club Prime. Lore went on to found e-commerce startup Jet.com, which was acquired by Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) last year in an attempt to rival Amazon online. Lore now is CEO of Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce division. "It is likely that Prime has grown to the point where members no longer separately shop on Diapers.com or Soap.com so maintenance of separate product-specific sites makes less sense," Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. "It is possible that they are taking a shot at Mark Lore for competition at Wal-Mart." Amazon on Tuesday announced a test phase of AmazonFresh Pickup, similar to a program offered by Wal-Mart and other grocers. Customers order online and schedule a pickup at stores. The news about Quidsi was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
