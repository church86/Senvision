Published on September 27, 2016. Reprints Reprints Andrew Bruce, CEO of Publicis Communications North America Credit: David Hall Most Popular Partnerships between agencies and clients in which both entities are working toward shared objectives are key for the industry's future, said Andrew Bruce, CEO of Publicis Communications North America, during a panel at Advertising Week. Mr. Bruce added that a "partnership feels so much more open" and allows the agency to become part of a client's world and ambitions. "It's a sign that we are more than an advertising agency and we are bringing more to [the relationship]," he said. For example, he said Publicis Groupe has an opportunity to align itself with Walmart, which is "daunting, but exciting." This summer, Publicis announced that it will create a new entity to house Walmart's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, along with other pieces of business that do not involve advertising. DDB Chicago CEO Paul Gunning spoke on the panel about new Omnicom Group agency dedicated exclusively to McDonald's, saying the review process involved four main themes: the consolidation of marketing services across Omnicom agencies, access to data, breaking down silos within Omnicom and McDonald's and transparency on both the agency and client sides of the business. One of the reasons the relationship with McDonald's is unique, according to Mr. Gunner, is because "the client is willing to transform and is transforming as much as the holding company." He said the agency is looking to make a massive impact on McDonald's and its sales, and in order for that to happen, the fast-feeder, Omnicom and outside partners, like Google and Facebook, "need to all work together to even have a shot at making a big pivot in this brand's history." Vik Kathuria, head of global agency partnerships at Oracle Marketing Cloud, said agencies have to bring the client and consumer into the center of their thinking and emphasize nimble, efficient strategies. "It's not about the past, present or future; it comes down to structuring the organization in a way that benefits the consumer," he said, adding that Publicis' new operating model could be headed in the right direction. Last week, Publicis announced that the North America region will operate under a single P&L for all of its creative agencies as part of its continuing effort to breakdown silos. Mr. Bruce said on the panel that the new model helps with collaboration because it makes the group put the right people in the room to solve specific problems or take advantage of opportunities for clients. The future of agencies may also rely on an "Uber-type model," where people come together from all different agencies or offices, said John Gerzema, CEO of BAV Consulting. He said small and big agencies may eventually all work together and people may not wind up working in the same office everyday.

LUCIE, Fla. A woman was dragged the length of a football field by a car after she fought with a man over a Walmart gift card Monday, city police said. Police were called to the Walmart in Port St. Lucie, Florida, where they found a 48-year-old woman who was in the parking lot with several cuts, bruises and a head injury. Security footage revealed she had tried to get inside the vehicle, but that it left before she could. The driver was later identified as 27-year-old David Squitieri. Investigators say the woman returned several items for Squitieri to the Walmart to get a gift card for him. When she brought him the card back, police said the two fought over the amount of the money she would receive for returning the items. As he ran to his car, she followed, attempting to get in the car, according to police. On the video, the woman is seen grabbing on to the door of the car as it drives away. Police said she was dragged for 100 yards. The 27-year-old later told police he paid the woman $20 to return the items for him in the store, and then she was supposed to give the gift card to him. But when she returned, they fought over the card and she hit him several times, according to the report. He said he was able to snatch the card and leave. The relationship between the two is unknown. Squitieri was arrested and faces charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

(Screengrab of Fox News video) By Jen Krausz   |   Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 02:40 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A request for a "Blue Lives Matter" cake for a woman who wanted to celebrate her dad’s retirement from being a police officer was reportedly refused by three workers at a Georgia Wal-Mart. According to Fox News Columnist Todd Starnes, the woman was told by the Wal-Mart workers that the cake was racist and nobody felt comfortable decorating it. She wanted the cake for her father’s retirement party after 25 years on the force. The woman, who didn’t want Starnes to mention her name, said she would find another bakery. A Wal-Mart manager later gave her a gift card and made the cake free of charge, stating that Wal-Mart supports law enforcement. He had to make the cake himself because his decorators continued to refuse to make it, however, Starnes said. A picture showed a hand-decorated cake with badly printed block letters spelling out "Blue Lives Matter." Starnes called for the decorators to be fired, but there are no reports that anything has happened to them so far. "'I work in retail,' the officer's daughter told me," Starnes stated in his Fox News Column. "'If I didn’t want to deal with a customer — and said "No" — I would get fired.'" Starnes ended his column by saying, "Just because Wal-Mart is the home of low prices, doesn’t mean they have to hire a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots." Friend of the family Taylor Wilkes said she will not shop at Wal-Mart even though they tried to make the situation right. "If you ask me, I think he just did that because, thanks to you all, this got so much attention, and he didn’t want it to go farther than it did," Wilkes said, according to WGCL-TV. She also described the meeting as "scripted and insincere," according to the station.

A news report on Tuesday said Walmart was in early talks to pick up a minority stake in Flipkart, which claims to be bigger than Amazon in India. While neither Bentonville-headquartered Walmart nor Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal-founded Flipkart commented on the issue, a source said it may not make much sense for the American brick-and-mortar giant, with significant online ambition, to pick a minority stake in Flipkart at the valuation it commands. The Bengaluru-based company had past estimated its own value at over $15 billion last year, but many of its investors have marked down the worth since then. Even after the markdowns, which are theoretical, Flipkart is valued at $10-$11 billion. “A minority stake in Flipkart will not give Walmart any substantial play in the online space, while paying a big price for it,” the source said, explaining why such a deal was unlikely. The talks between the two could be for other strategic tie-ups, rather than a stake deal, another source said. Walmart has been in negotiations with several e-commerce companies, including Shopclues and Snapdeal, for presence across online platforms. However, many analysts have pointed out that there’s a reason for Walmart to gain traction in the online market in India. The biggest trigger is Chinese online major Alibaba finalising its direct India foray. In fact, in China, Walmart invested $1.5 billion to pick up a 5 per cent stake in JD.com, or Jingdong Mall, formerly 360buy, to compete with Alibaba. Amazon, which has been investing heavily in India - $5 billion committed in the last three years - is a natural rival since Walmart has been trying hard to take on Bezos’ company in the home market. When it comes to partnership, Walmart has not had a happy past in India. It had entered in a partnership with Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises for a wholesale business. The JV’s plan was to subsequently open retail stores, where 51 per cent foreign direct investment was permitted in 2012 under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. But the partnership broke in 2013 as the multi-brand retail policy was not going anywhere and the two partners developed differences. Currently, Walmart operates a wholesale business in the country, which allows 100 per cent FDI. Besides, at 21-odd wholesale stores that it runs in India, Walmart offers online services in the business to business space. The American retailer is also exploring the possibility of entering the food retail business, where 100 per cent FDI has been allowed.

Close Latest Minutes Politics Culture Magazine Climate Books Podcasts Subscribe About Advertise Contact FAQ Jobs RSS Masthead Privacy Subscriber Services Menu Bloomberg/Getty Images What’s Driving Corporate Activism? By Jerry Davis September 27, 2016 Target recently staked out a position in the culture wars by announcing that it will build private bathrooms in all its locations, after earlier allowing transgender customers to use whichever room corresponds with their gender identity—both actions sparking anger from many conservatives. While big business hasn’t always been on the vanguard of social justice, in recent years companies like Target, Apple and even Wal-Mart have increasingly taken positions that put them squarely on the side of socially progressive activists. So how did Che Guevera—the face of the Cuban Revolution—become CEO of corporate America? When I first began studying the interactions between social movements and corporations 25 years ago, it was rare to see business take a public stand on social issues. Yet today we see organizations ranging from General Electric to the NCAA weighing in on transgender issues, something that would have been hard to imagine even a decade ago. From custom abiders to bullies Traditionally, corporations aimed to be scrupulously neutral on social issues. No one doubted that corporations exercised power, but it was over bread-and-butter economic issues like trade and taxes, not social issues. There seemed little to be gained by activism on potentially divisive issues, particularly for consumer brands. A watershed of the civil rights movement, for example, was the 1960 sit-in protest by students that began at a segregated lunch counter in a Woolworth store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and spread across the South. Woolworth’s corporate policy had been to “abide by local custom” and keep black and white patrons separated. By supporting the status quo, Woolworth and others like it stood in the way of progress. But negative publicity led to substantial lost business, and Woolworth eventually relented. In July, four months after the protest started—and after the students had gone home for the summer—the manager of the Greensboro store quietly integrated his lunch counter. In general, companies were more worried about the costs of taking a more liberal stand on such issues, a point basketball legend and Nike pitchman Michael Jordan made succinctly in 1990. Asked to support Democrat Harvey Gantt’s campaign to replace segregationist incumbent Jesse Helms as a North Carolina senator, Jordan declined, reportedly saying “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” And companies presumed that taking controversial positions would lead to boycotts by those on the other side. That’s what happened to Walt Disney in 1996 as a result of its early support for gay rights, such as “gay day” at its theme parks. Its stand prompted groups including America’s largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptists, to launch a boycott, calling Disney’s support for gay rights an “anti-Christian and anti-family direction.” The eight-year boycott, however, was notably ineffective at changing Disney policy. It turns out that too few parents had the heart to deny their children Disney products to make a boycott effective. Since then, some of the biggest U.S. companies have taken similar stands, in spite of the reaction from conservatives. For example, when the Arkansas legislature passed a bill in March 2015 that would have enabled LGBT discrimination on the grounds of “religious freedom,” the CEO of Wal-Mart urged the governor to veto the bill. Not surprisingly, given Wal-Mart’s status in the state and the corporate backlash that accompanied a similar law in Indiana, the governor obliged and eventually signed a modified bill. That din’t sit well with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, however, who argued in The New York Times that companies in those states were joining “left-wing activists to bully elected officials into backing away from strong protections for religious liberty.” He warned companies against “bullying” Louisiana. Why have corporations shifted from “abiding local custom” around segregation and other divisive social issues to “bullying elected officials” to support LGBT rights? Changing environment In my view, there are two broad changes responsible for this increased corporate social activism. First, social media and the web have changed the environment for business by making it cheaper and easier for activists to join together to voice their opinions and by making corporate activities more transparent. The rapid spread of the Occupy movement in the fall of 2011, from Zuccotti Park in New York to encampments across the country, illustrates how social media can enable groups with a compelling message to scale up quickly. Sometimes even online-only movements can be highly effective. When the Susan G. Komen Foundation cut off funds to Planned Parenthood that were aimed at supporting breast cancer screenings for low-income women, a pop-up social movement arose: Facebook and Twitter exploded with millions of posts and tweets voicing opposition. Within days the policy was walked back. Mozilla’s appointment of a new CEO who had supported a California ballot proposal banning same-sex marriage also generated outrage online, both inside and outside the organization. He was gone within two weeks. More recently, Mylan’s exorbitant price hikes on its EpiPen took place over several years, but an online petition fueled by social media this summer turned it into a scandal and a talking point for presidential candidates. In each case, social media allowed like-minded “clicktivists” to draw attention to an issue and demonstrate their support for change, quickly and at very little cost. It’s never been cheaper to assemble a virtual protest group, and sometimes (as in the Arab Spring) online tools enable real-world protest. As such, activism is likely to be a constant for corporations in the future. Millennials don’t like puffery Second, as consumers and workers, millennials are highly attuned to a company’s “social value proposition.” Companies targeting the sensibilities of the young often tout their social missions. Tom’s Shoes and Warby Parker both have “buy a pair, give a pair” programs. Chipotle highlights its sustainability efforts. And Starbucks has promoted fair trade coffee, marriage equality and racial justice more or less successfully. In each case, transparency about corporate practices serves as a check on puffery. Social mission is even more important when it comes to recruiting. At business school recruiting events, it is almost obligatory that companies describe their LEED-certified workplaces, LGBT-friendly human resource practices and community outreach efforts. Moreover, our employer signals something about our identity. Value alignment is part of why people stay at their job, and among many millennials, socially progressive values—particularly around LGBT issues—are almost a given. In this situation, corporate activism may be the sensible course of action, at least when it comes to LGBT issues. According to the Pew Research Center, for example, support for same-sex marriage has increased from 31 percent in 2004 to 55 percent today, and there is little reason to expect a reversal. Risks remain Even as trends lead to more corporate activism, the reaction hasn’t always been as the businesses expected. Businesses on the vanguard of social issues themselves can become targets if and when they slip up. When Starbucks attempted to promote a dialogue about race after the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police in 2014, its method—asking baristas to write “race together” on cups to encourage conversations—was widely ridiculed. Some even regarded the effort as a misguided marketing ploy rather than a sincere effort to promote understanding. In 1998, William Clay Ford Jr. became chairman of Ford Motor and aimed to turn the company green by improving fuel economy and “greening” its production processes. The company even put an energy-efficient “living” roof on a truck assembly plant. Its continued reliance on its profitable line of gas-guzzling SUVs, however, prompted some to accuse Ford of hypocrisy. Red and blue companies? While prominent companies like Starbucks and Target have taken stances associated with liberal causes, some businesses have gone the other direction. Chick-fil-A aimed to implement “biblical values” and supported anti-gay groups in the 2000s. Those groups returned the favor by encouraging like-minded people to dine there on “Chick-fil-A appreciation day.” Hobby Lobby famously sought to abstain from providing funding for birth control for employees on religious grounds. Koch Industries, overseen by the famous Koch Brothers, has long been a lightning rod for boycotts due to the right-wing proclivities of its dominant owners. And small businesses across the country are not always shy in advertising their conservative political orientations. As states have seemingly divided into red (for conservative) and blue (for liberal), might we expect the same thing from corporations, as consumers and employees drift toward the brands that best represent their views—red companies and blue companies? It is already easy to look up political contributions by companies and their employees. For example, Bloomberg, Alphabet and the Pritzker Group lean Democratic; Oracle, Chevron and AT&T tend Republican. In the current electoral climate, it is not hard to imagine this continuing.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close Daniel Acker Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2015. (Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) Eight-cent eggs: Consumers gobble cheap food as grocers squirm By Craig Giammona • Bloomberg Sep 27, 2016 (…) Daniel Acker Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2015. (Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don't normally see on your finer cuts of meat: "buy 1 get 1 free" specials on "USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak." And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, N.J., you could pick up a dozen eggs at Walmart. (OK, the price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck — 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It's the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 — with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn't only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 — a little more than the price of a pint of beer. "The severity of what we're seeing is completely unprecedented," said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. "We've never seen deflation this sharp." Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Walmart in Secaucus, N.J., to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of "Angus steak burgers" fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Walmarts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. "Wherever I find the good deals — that's where I'm at," Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart Stores, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. "It starts to border on irrational pricing," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins." Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi's German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market — famously derided as "Whole Paycheck" — is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis Public pay: Government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives In recent years, Kroger — the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores — cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company's stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don't even notice. "The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out, because it's fascinating — in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money," McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen's lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer's budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin' Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, 63, a retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, N.J. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 — one of the great food deals of recent memory. "That's a good price," she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

Flipkart, so far, led the e-commerce market in India beating rivals that included another homegrown player Snapdeal as well as the world’s largest e-commerce company Amazon. Its biggest strength was the first mover advantage it had over the rivals. Maintaining the leadership, however, was turning out to be challenging, of late. With the blessings of its deep-pocket parent ($2 billion already invested and $3 billion more committed), Amazon India has been making fast inroads into the market and Flipkart’s inability to raise fresh funds and continued high cash burn was increasingly making its position as the market leader untenable. So much so that most observers in the industry were predicting that the pecking order might change post the festive season with Amazon emerging the eventual winner in India. This, however, might not become a reality if Walmart, indeed, picks a stake in Flipkart. Both Walmart India spokesperson and Flipkart did not respond to email queries sent by TechCircle saying as a policy they don’t comment on rumours or speculations. What is in it for Flipkart? On the face of it, it makes eminent sense for Flipkart to shake hands with Walmart. The world’s largest company’s strengths as an offline retailer alongside its access to smart technology and ‘real time pricing algorithm’ it now owns post the acquisition of Jet.com, can help Flipkart strengthen its game in India. The technology helps in reducing prices of products in real time based on various factors including the number of products and the distribution centres. This has the potential to revolutionize the prevailing customer experience and pricing patterns in the Indian e-commerce industry where deep discounting has become the bane for most companies. But all this is in the long run. The immediate reprieve that Flipkart is likely to get out of the proposed tie-up with Walmart is access to much-needed funds. According to media reports, Flipkart has not been able to raise funds since last year because of difference of opinion with regards to its valuation with prospective investors. Fresh funds will help the company sail through for some more time after the much-awaited festive season, which is likely to leave most e-commerce players bruised given that deep discounting is still the route they are taking to woo customers. Indeed, the new FDI rules do not allow e-commerce marketplaces to directly offer discounts to customers, but the incumbents in the market are offering financial incentives to help sellers on their platforms to offer deep discounts to customers. For Flipkart, partnering with Walmart has many positives to it. “But the question is – will the investors, who see Flipkart as the Amazon of India, agree to it,” asks Sahni, adding: “No one wants to let go. If that was the case, Flipkart would have given in to Amazon a year ago. Snapdeal is not giving up. Alibaba is gearing up.” Flipkart’s current valuation may be another reason for investors to hesitate in parting with the equity in the company. The company suffered seven successive markdowns with some of its investors placing the e-commerce company’s valuation at less than $10 billion in comparison to $15.2 billion valuation it commanded till September last year, which was based on its last funding round in mid-2015. For Walmart, however, it makes eminent sense to pick up a stake in Flikpart now. What is in it for Walmart? Besides picking a stake in Flipkart at a reasonable valuation, the tie-up will have other advantages for Walmart. To begin with, it will get a toe-hold in the world’s most attractive e-commerce market. Walmart, for whom online retailing is a clearly a missing link in its larger business plans, the partnership will help it hoist its flag in the Indian e-commerce space. If it were to do that alone, it might take the company years to do so. To be sure, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. It had entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises but in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. The e-commerce market is expected to double to Rs 2,11,005 crore by December this year, according to the estimates of IAMAI (Internet & Mobile Association of India) and IMRB International. The e-commerce market grew 30% between December 2011 and December 2015, making it very attractive for those wanting to set foot here. Besides Walmart, there are other players queuing to get a share of this pie. China’s Alibaba, which has a market cap of $258.01 billion, is likely to make some big moves here sooner than later. “We are planning to enter the e-commerce business in India in 2016. We have been exploring very carefully the e-commerce opportunity in this country, which we think is very exciting on the backdrop of Digital India,” Alibaba Group president J. Michael Evans had said earlier this year. Then there is Japan’s Rakuten, which is said to be evaluating the Indian market. In this backdrop, this might be the right time for Walmart to enter India and partner with the country’s largest e-commerce company. Like this report?

Gurgaon-based Amplus plans to fund the investment through the money it raised from a global infrastructure investment fund, I Squared Capital. It raised USD 150 million last year from the fund, the company said in a statement. The company has already commissioned a 297-kWp (kilowatt peak) rooftop solar plant for Walmart's Best Price store at Agra, it added. It plans to commission 11 more plants for Walmart in the next 4-5 weeks in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, it said. Walmart India has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Amplus to solarise their 15 Best Price outlets. Once completed, these plants over their lifetime will help in saving 1,72,000 MT CO2, which is equivalent to planting 2.15 lakh trees. "We have pledged to meet 50 per cent of our energy needs through renewable energy and this partnership is testimony to the commitment. We are pleased that the rooftop solar plant has been commissioned at Agra and we will be monitoring the power generation through Amplus' cloud based software," Walmart India President & CEO Krish Iyer said.

Home Economy Economic Activity Retail retail Eight-cent eggs: Consumers gobble cheap food as grocers squirm Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Tuesday, September 27, 2016 10:25 am By Craig Giammona Bloomberg News retail Dave’s announces 1st Cranston location, 10th overall (Sept. 26, 2016) Fastest-growing & innovative companies Blount feeds its future (Sept. 23, 2016) philanthropy Edesia and Russell Morin Catering announce philanthropic initiative (Sept. 16, 2016) Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Not long ago, Albertsons advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat: “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, N.J., you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. OK, the price was actually $1.14. A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck -- 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago, you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 -- a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston, had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, N.J., to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals -- that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. ‘Irrational pricing’ “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com Inc. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market Inc. -- famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” -- is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger Co. -- the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores -- cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. CEO Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. CEO’s lament “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out, because it’s fascinating – in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, a 63-year-old retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, N.J. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 -- one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

A news report on Tuesday said Walmart was in early talks to pick up a minority stake in Flipkart, which claims to be bigger than Amazon in India. While neither Bentonville-headquartered Walmart nor Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal-founded Flipkart commented on the issue, a source said it may not make much sense for the American brick-and-mortar giant, with significant online ambition, to pick a minority stake in Flipkart at the valuation it commands. The Bengaluru-based company had past estimated its own value at over $15 billion last year, but many of its investors have marked down the worth since then. Even after the markdowns, which are theoretical, Flipkart is valued at $10-$11 billion. “A minority stake in Flipkart will not give Walmart any substantial play in the online space, while paying a big price for it,” the source said, explaining why such a deal was unlikely. The talks between the two could be for other strategic tie-ups, rather than a stake deal, another source said. Walmart has been in negotiations with several e-commerce companies, including Shopclues and Snapdeal, for presence across online platforms. However, many analysts have pointed out that there’s a reason for Walmart to gain traction in the online market in India. The biggest trigger is Chinese online major Alibaba finalising its direct India foray. In fact, in China, Walmart invested $1.5 billion to pick up a 5 per cent stake in JD.com, or Jingdong Mall, formerly 360buy, to compete with Alibaba. Amazon, which has been investing heavily in India - $5 billion committed in the last three years - is a natural rival since Walmart has been trying hard to take on Bezos’ company in the home market. When it comes to partnership, Walmart has not had a happy past in India. It had entered in a partnership with Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises for a wholesale business. The JV’s plan was to subsequently open retail stores, where 51 per cent foreign direct investment was permitted in 2012 under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. But the partnership broke in 2013 as the multi-brand retail policy was not going anywhere and the two partners developed differences. Currently, Walmart operates a wholesale business in the country, which allows 100 per cent FDI. Besides, at 21-odd wholesale stores that it runs in India, Walmart offers online services in the business to business space. The American retailer is also exploring the possibility of entering the food retail business, where 100 per cent FDI has been allowed.

Flipkart, so far, led the e-commerce market in India beating rivals that included another homegrown player Snapdeal as well as the world’s largest e-commerce company Amazon. Its biggest strength was the first mover advantage it had over the rivals. Maintaining the leadership, however, was turning out to be challenging, of late. With the blessings of its deep-pocket parent ($2 billion already invested and $3 billion more committed), Amazon India has been making fast inroads into the market and Flipkart’s inability to raise fresh funds and continued high cash burn was increasingly making its position as the market leader untenable. So much so that most observers in the industry were predicting that the pecking order might change post the festive season with Amazon emerging the eventual winner in India. This, however, might not become a reality if Walmart, indeed, picks a stake in Flipkart. Both Walmart India spokesperson and Flipkart did not respond to email queries sent by TechCircle saying as a policy they don’t comment on rumours or speculations. What is in it for Flipkart? On the face of it, it makes eminent sense for Flipkart to shake hands with Walmart. The world’s largest company’s strengths as an offline retailer alongside its access to smart technology and ‘real time pricing algorithm’ it now owns post the acquisition of Jet.com, can help Flipkart strengthen its game in India. The technology helps in reducing prices of products in real time based on various factors including the number of products and the distribution centres. This has the potential to revolutionize the prevailing customer experience and pricing patterns in the Indian e-commerce industry where deep discounting has become the bane for most companies. But all this is in the long run. The immediate reprieve that Flipkart is likely to get out of the proposed tie-up with Walmart is access to much-needed funds. According to media reports, Flipkart has not been able to raise funds since last year because of difference of opinion with regards to its valuation with prospective investors. Fresh funds will help the company sail through for some more time after the much-awaited festive season, which is likely to leave most e-commerce players bruised given that deep discounting is still the route they are taking to woo customers. Indeed, the new FDI rules do not allow e-commerce marketplaces to directly offer discounts to customers, but the incumbents in the market are offering financial incentives to help sellers on their platforms to offer deep discounts to customers. For Flipkart, partnering with Walmart has many positives to it. “But the question is – will the investors, who see Flipkart as the Amazon of India, agree to it,” asks Sahni, adding: “No one wants to let go. If that was the case, Flipkart would have given in to Amazon a year ago. Snapdeal is not giving up. Alibaba is gearing up.” Flipkart’s current valuation may be another reason for investors to hesitate in parting with the equity in the company. The company suffered seven successive markdowns with some of its investors placing the e-commerce company’s valuation at less than $10 billion in comparison to $15.2 billion valuation it commanded till September last year, which was based on its last funding round in mid-2015. For Walmart, however, it makes eminent sense to pick up a stake in Flikpart now. What is in it for Walmart? Besides picking a stake in Flipkart at a reasonable valuation, the tie-up will have other advantages for Walmart. To begin with, it will get a toe-hold in the world’s most attractive e-commerce market. Walmart, for whom online retailing is a clearly a missing link in its larger business plans, the partnership will help it hoist its flag in the Indian e-commerce space. If it were to do that alone, it might take the company years to do so. To be sure, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. It had entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises but in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. The e-commerce market is expected to double to Rs 2,11,005 crore by December this year, according to the estimates of IAMAI (Internet & Mobile Association of India) and IMRB International. The e-commerce market grew 30% between December 2011 and December 2015, making it very attractive for those wanting to set foot here. Besides Walmart, there are other players queuing to get a share of this pie. China’s Alibaba, which has a market cap of $258.01 billion, is likely to make some big moves here sooner than later. “We are planning to enter the e-commerce business in India in 2016. We have been exploring very carefully the e-commerce opportunity in this country, which we think is very exciting on the backdrop of Digital India,” Alibaba Group president J. Michael Evans had said earlier this year. Then there is Japan’s Rakuten, which is said to be evaluating the Indian market. In this backdrop, this might be the right time for Walmart to enter India and partner with the country’s largest e-commerce company. Like this report?

That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. “Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers,” said Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach. “Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices.” The survey results are bad news for Wal-Mart and other retailers trying to make headway against Amazon in online shopping. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 13 percent to $385 billion this year, according to eMarketer. Wal-Mart last month agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion, its biggest attempt yet to catch up. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company’s $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership. “Amazon keeps adding layers and is innovating at a faster pace than everyone, especially with Prime,” Blackledge said. “Prime members have the Amazon app on the front screen of their smartphones. That definitely hurts Wal-Mart.” Alphabet Inc., owner of the Google search engine, can withstand the pressure from Amazon because its advertising revenue is diversified, including video ads on streaming site YouTube, said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service. “This trend has been taking place for the past four or five years and it has still not hurt Google search,” he said.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Home Industry Companies Amplus to invest Rs 90 crore in Walmart’s rooftop solar plants Amplus to invest Rs 90 crore in Walmart’s rooftop solar plants Amplus Energy Solutions has committed an investment of Rs 90 crore to install and commission 15 rooftop solar power plants for world's leading retailer Walmart in India. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: September 27, 2016 6:09 PM The company has already commissioned a 297-kWp (kilowatt peak) rooftop solar plant for Walmart’s Best Price store at Agra, it added. (Source: Reuters) Amplus Energy Solutions has committed an investment of Rs 90 crore to install and commission 15 rooftop solar power plants for world’s leading retailer Walmart in India. Gurgaon-based Amplus plans to fund the investment through the money it raised from a global infrastructure investment fund, I Squared Capital. It raised $150 million last year from the fund, the company said in a statement. The company has already commissioned a 297-kWp (kilowatt peak) rooftop solar plant for Walmart’s Best Price store at Agra, it added. It plans to commission 11 more plants for Walmart in the next 4-5 weeks in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, it said. Walmart India has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Amplus to solarise their 15 Best Price outlets. Once completed, these plants over their lifetime will help in saving 1,72,000 MT CO2, which is equivalent to planting 2.15 lakh trees. “We have pledged to meet 50 per cent of our energy needs through renewable energy and this partnership is testimony to the commitment. We are pleased that the rooftop solar plant has been commissioned at Agra and we will be monitoring the power generation through Amplus’ cloud based software,” Walmart India President & CEO Krish Iyer said.

A number of my Georgia readers alerted me to the story and on Saturday night I spoke directly with the police officer’s daughter. She asked that I not divulge her name and I’ve agreed to honor her request. “I was so shocked,” she told me. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” For the record, Walmart has confessed that most of her allegations are true. I’ll have more on that a bit later in this column. The police officer’s daughter went to the Walmart on Willow Drive on Sept. 22 to order a flag for her father’s retirement party. He was leaving the force after 25 years on the job. She showed the bakers a photograph of the police officer’s flag — the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter told me. As an alternative, she suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. But that design was also rejected by Walmart’s cake decorator. “She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter told me. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?’” After being rejected for a third time, the 21-year-old told the bakers, “I’ll find another bakery, thank you.” She was much more polite than I would’ve been, folks. “I was disappointed,” she told me. “I go to Walmart all the time — at least once a week, spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.” A friend of the family posted an item about the incident on Facebook and it wasn’t long before the Walmart store manager called the police officer’s wife and daughter and apologized. “He said he was so sorry,” the daughter told me. “He offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card.” A Walmart corporate spokesperson confirmed most of the story. “Our goal is to always take care of customers,” the spokesperson told me. “But, sometimes we misstep. We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.” Walmart did not say if one of their associates called the cake racist. “I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer,” the spokesperson told me. So how did Walmart right their wrong? The answer to that question is going to curdle your Fruit Loops, folks. The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “It doesn’t look professional.” I’ve attached photographs of Walmart’s handiwork — it’s absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. “I work in retail,” the officer’s daughter told me. “If I didn’t want to deal with a customer and said ‘No,’ I would get fired.” Unfortunately, her father’s retirement party [was] Sunday night, so [there was] no time to go elsewhere. “It irritates me that in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them,” she said. “And you can’t make a cake for the people who are protecting you?” Walmart needs to make this right and they can start by delivering a professionally decorated cake to the police officer’s family. The three cake decorators need to be told: either decorate the cake or be fired. Just because Walmart is the home of low prices doesn’t mean they have to hire a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots.

Ltd for an equity partnership, according to a report. The Economic Times reported, citing two sources it didn’t name, that “the companies are engaged in early talks and a meeting is scheduled this week”. These discussions, reportedly, include the world’s largest retailer picking up a minority stake in Flipkart. A Walmart India spokesperson told TechCircle in an email statement that “as a policy we don’t comment on speculative reports”. Flipkart said in a statement that “it is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” TechCircle had written in August about speculation of a possible deal when Walmart bought US web retailer Jet.com. Walmart had bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion in the largest ever buyout of a US e-commerce startup. In June, Walmart had announced acquiring a 5% stake in Chinese ecommerce giant JD.com for about $1.5 billion. According to the report in The Economic Times, the ongoing discussions may lead to a similar deal with India’s Flipkart. Krish Iyer, CEO, Walmart India Earlier this month, Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer had said at an event that the company was evaluating the policy guidelines of 100% foreign direct investment in food retail. Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had entered into an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India. E-commerce sales in the US in 2015 totalled $340 billion, a 14.6% increase over 2014’s $298.3 billion, according to non-adjusted estimates released by the US Department of Commerce.  India, according to industry body Assocham, is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world and is likely to touch $38-billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year, a 67% jump over the $23 billion it clocked last year. Still, it is tiny in comparison with the US. The Indian market is attractive for Walmart for a couple of reasons. Most e-tailers with global ambitions cannot ignore this fast-growing market. Also, its arch rival Amazon is quite bullish on India. Amazon India VP Amit Agarwal in May had announced that India is the second-largest market for Amazon in terms of new customers. “The partnership is a win-win for both the players. Flipkart gets access to Walmart funds and Walmart gets to put the first strong footstep in the Indian market,” says Anil Kumar, founder of RedSeer Consulting. “Overall, it is still pretty early to comment where the next turn in the tide will come from.” In India, Amazon is competing with the country’s largest e-commerce company Flipkart and Snapdeal even as other global companies such as China’s Alibaba and Japan’s Rakuten are readying to stake a claim in the market. This is why Flipkart can be a possible partner or an eventual buyout prospect for Walmart. Heavily funded by global investors such as Tiger Global, Naspers, Iconiq and Accel Partners, Flipkart, according to media reports, has been struggling to raise fresh funds to keep its growth momentum going. There have been media reports in the past to suggest that Flipkart has held talks with Amazon for a buyout but the latter walked away from the table owing to high valuation sought by the company. Walmart employs around 2.3 million people in its 11,527 stores across 28 countries and recorded $482 billion in total revenue last year. But the world’s largest retailer may be worried about its declining online sales in the US while Amazon continues to grow impressively, both in the US and India. Also, Walmart’s online sales were a mere $13.6 billion in 2015 against Amazon’s $107 billion. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Vegan. Think. Eat. Thrive.™ News Food Planet Travel Buzz Investors Demand Food Giants Address Factory Farming By Anna Starostinetskaya | September 27, 2016 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Kraft, Heinz, Walmart, and 13 others put under pressure to mitigate meat risk with plant-based protein. Last week, the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative (FAIRR) sent a demand letter to 16 major food companies—including Walmart, Unilever, Kraft, Heinz, Nestle, Costco, and Whole Foods Market—to inquire about their plans to address the growing crisis of the material impact of factory farming. In the letter, investor coalition FAIRR pointed out the risks of industrial animal production based on their findings from a recent Oxford University study revealing that a global reduction in meat consumption would result in $1.5 trillion in healthcare related savings by 2050. “The world’s overreliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis,” FAIRR Founder Jeremy Coller says. “Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low.” Coller calls upon corporations to provide a strategy to combat the effects of factory farming because he says the planet “simply can’t cope with the projected increase in global protein demand.” The coalition, comprised of influential investors such as Robeco, Aviva Investors, and Boston Common, amongst others—and with a combined fund of over $1 trillion—put out the call to action because, according to Coller, “Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble, and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4% annually over the next five years.” Tweet Email Too Faced Acquired by Estée Lauder for $1.45 Billion Vegan-friendly makeup brand vows to never test on animals despite acquisition.

How about a nice deal on a wagyu steak? Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Not long ago, Albertsons advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat: “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, New Jersey, you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. OK, the price was actually $1.14. A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck -- 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago, you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 -- a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston, had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, New Jersey, to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Patient Shoppers Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals -- that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. ‘Irrational Pricing’ “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com Inc. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market Inc. -- famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” -- is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger Co. -- the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores -- cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. CEO’s Lament “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out, because it’s fascinating – in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, a 63-year-old retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, New Jersey. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 -- one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

A win-win deal may be in making Sep 27, 2016 13:52 IST #Alibaba   #Amazon   #Ecommerce   #Etailers   #Flipkart   #JD.com   #Jet.com   #Retailer   #Walmart Stores   By FP Staff Faced with rising competition from the online retail giant Amazon at home and other global markets, US-based multi-billion dollar retail czar Walmart Stores Inc has been steadily ramping up its presence in the online retail business through minority stake buys in etail companies of late. While having a presence in India for quite some time through its Wholesale Best Price stores, Walmart is evaluating its strategy to team up with the country's largest ecommerce company Flipkart to counter Amazon's growing influence here. AFP According to a report in The Economic Times, Walmart is looking at buying a small equity stake in Flipkart for which both the companies are likely to hold talks later this week. However, both Walmart and Flipkart have termed the news as speculative. The likely talk comes close on the heels of the US retailer entering into a deal with China's second-largest ecommerce firm JD.com in June amid growing competition from Alibaba Group Holding. As per the terms of the deal, Walmart will get a 5 percent stake in JD.com worth $1.5 billion in exchange for selling its online grocery store to the Chinese ecommerce firm. Two months later the US retail major announced up a deal to acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion to spruce up its ecommerce business. Although Walmart remains undisputed leader in the US retail market, its ecommerce business has been facing challenging times in recent years. In 2015, Walmart's ecommerce sales stood at $15 billion as against a whopping $99 billion revenue posted by Amazon from its online sales, the ET report said. Back home, there is no clarity on the percentage holding and total value Walmart could negotiate with Flipkart. But the deal could be win-win situation for both. For Flipkart, a minority stake sale could bring in fresh funds into the company and help further compete with Amazon. Also, Flipkart can leverage Walmart's global supply chain and use the latter's wholesale stores in Jammu, Chandigarh etc. among other locations for pickup and delivery points. In case of Walmart, holding a minority stake in Flipkart will help it to have a presence in the country's growing ecommerce market besides allowing it to sell goods through multiple channels, the ET report added. The US-based retailer can also eye the home-grown etailer's rising user base. Last week, Flipkart said it has crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. The Bengaluru-based company has also doubled its user base over the last year and added 25 million users in the past six months alone. The company is engaged in a battle for supremacy with Amazon and another domestic challenger Snapdeal, where all three are slugging it out to notch up robust volumes in the forthcoming festival sales offer starting later this week. also see Rs 500, Rs 1000 crackdown impact: Amazon, Flipkart, Shopclues stop Cash-on-Delivery Demonetisation: Both Flipkart, Snapdeal now allow cash on delivery to improve sales Rs 500, Rs 1,000 note ban: Amazon's cash on delivery orders back on track The Jeff Bezos-controlled Amazon has already announced big plans for India. The Seattle-based online giant had last year announced a plan infuse $3 billion in Indian operations, taking its total investment commitment for the country to $5 billion. Expanding into other verticals of the online segment, Amazon is on the verge of launching Prime Video in India, and has partnered with Karan Johar's Dharma Productions and Vishesh Films, which will give the company access to about 80 blockbustres. The teaming up with the Dharma and Vishesh is also aimed at gaining more customers and fighting Flipkart. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report had said Amazon is improving its foothold in India and it could be the second biggest player after Flipkart in the online retail market by 2019. The country could also become Amazon's second largest market (after the US) as it plans to invest $5 billion here. "For last couple of months, Amazon India gross sales are higher than that of Flipkart standalone (excluding Myntra)... We now expect Amazon's GMV (gross merchandise value) market share to improve to 37 per cent by 2019 from 21 per cent in 2015 and expect it to be close No 2 behind Flipkart," the report said. While revenues are relatively small to Amazon's global scale, Amazon India could generate $81 billion in GMV and $2.2 billion in operating profit by 2025. Most of Amazon's gains have come at the expense of Snapdeal and other sellers, not Flipkart, according to the report. Flipkart still remains the market leader in India and "even in terms of customer satisfaction, reports indicate that it remains the leader, ahead of both Amazon and Snapdeal", according to the report. Whoever wins the battle in the end, one thing is for sure there are interesting times ahead for e-commerce customers in India.

Calvin S. Cunningham, 25, appeared on suspicion of being a fugitive from justice, two counts of attempting to elude, possession of a stolen vehicle, hit-and-run injury and first-degree assault. On Saturday, Cunningham entered the Wal-Mart at 221 N.E. 104th Ave. and allegedly stole a BB gun, according to court documents. He was contacted by store employees at the front door, and they attempted to detain him, but he threw the gun at one of the employees, according to a probable cause affidavit. Another employee followed him outside, and Cunningham took out a hatchet and started swinging it at him, the affidavit states. At about 3:30 a.m. Sunday, a Vancouver police officer saw Cunningham driving a blue Subaru Impreza in the 13600 block of Southeast 19th Street. He recognized Cunningham from a bulletin from the prior day’s incident, a separate probable cause affidavit states. The officer attempted to stop the vehicle near Southeast 136th Avenue and 19th Street. Cunningham made a U-turn and sped in the officer’s direction, colliding with his patrol car, court records said. The officer said he experienced pain in his neck and left knee. Cunningham did not stop and eluded the officer on Southeast McGillivray Boulevard at speeds in excess of 80 mph, according to court documents. Another officer saw the Subaru about 20 minutes later near Southeast Chkalov Drive and McGillivray. That officer attempted to stop Cunningham, whose vehicle was traveling more than 90 mph, the affidavit said. Cunningham later ditched the car near North Garrison Road and East Mill Plain Boulevard and ran, according to court records. Police later caught up with him. The car he was driving was reported stolen, court documents said. During his court appearance, Judge Gregory Gonzales appointed Cunningham an attorney and set his bail at $125,000, court records show. He will be arraigned Oct. 7.   Jessica Prokop Columbian Courts Reporter  360-735-4551  @jprokop16  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Walmart Refuses to Produce a 'Thin Blue Line' Retirement Cake? A viral Facebook repost reported Walmart's bakery employees refused to sell a 'thin blue line' retirement cake to a policeman's daughter because they deemed it racist. Kim LaCapria Sep 26, 2016 Share - - On 23 September 2016 Facebook user Taylor Wilkes published a post reporting that her "buddy's sister" went to a WalMart store in Georgia to order a "thin blue line" cake for her police officer father's retirement party, but workers there refused her order on the grounds that it was "racist": #BOYCOTTWALMART: So my buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party. He's retiring from being a police officer. She asked Walmart to make a "thin blue line" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer. Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being "racist." Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason. To me, this is appalling. There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the "thin blue line," yet people CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now. It's only ignorant people who continue to spread this negativity. People need to educate themselves. Bottom line. I'm just waiting for the day that our American flag is deemed "racist" by ignorant instigators who are just looking for attention and for something to be upset about. It's really getting ridiculous. But a few days later, Fox News opinion columnist Todd Starnes published an article on the subject, reporting what the (unnamed) officer's daughter told him: She showed the bakers a photograph of the police officer’s flag — the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter told me. As an alternative, she suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. But that design was also rejected by Walmart’s cake decorator. “She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter told me. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?’” After being rejected for a third time, the 21-year-old told the bakers, “I’ll find another bakery, thank you.” This is where the story gets confusing. Reportedly a Walmart manager stepped in and produced the cake requested himself, and although his efforts were less than satisfactory, they had to do because there was no time to obtain a replacement cake: The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “It doesn’t look professional.” I’ve attached photographs of Walmart’s handiwork — it’s absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. Unfortunately, her father’s retirement party is Sunday night — so there’s no time to go elsewhere. The cake depicted in an attendant photograph was a simple black cake divided in half by a blue horizontal stripe, with the words "Blue Lives Matter" rendered in frosting above and below the stripe. The cake did not include any inscription or decoration featuring the name of the retiring officer, or any reference to retirement: On 24 September 2016 (the date of the putative party) Tyler Wilkes published an update about Walmart's response to the controversy, confusingly reporting that the Walmart manager's offer to step in and make the cake had been turned down because a cake had already been obtained from Kroger, which contradicted the Fox News account stating that the manager had already produced a cake that looked "terrible" but had to be used because "there’s no time to go elsewhere" [for a replacement cake]: Update on the Walmart situation: The manager at Walmart met with my friend's sister and offered to make the cake (which had already been taken care of by Kroger) and apologized for the mistake. He stated that Walmart fully supports law enforcement and donated some extra stuff for the retirement party along with a gift card in lieu of the cake. If you ask me, I think he just did that because, thanks to you all, this got so much attention, and he didn't want it to go farther than it did. The way the meeting was described to me was that it was very scripted and not very sincere. So, although the mistake was "made right," I will still not be shopping at Walmart due to the "quality" of employees they hire. But that's just me. Please share this post just like you shared the other one so that people may get the update and form their own opinion ... Myself as well as my friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, thank you for your continued support in this matter, as well as your unwavering support for law enforcement! #ThinBlueLine #BoycottWalmart Starnes' account claimed that "Walmart has confessed that most of [the daughter's] allegations are true" but merely quoted the same Walmart statement we received, which confirmed only that the customer had been contacted and offered an apology but not any of the details of the issue: Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep ... We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores. We're glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right. Even more confusingly, a Walmart spokesperson told us that the woman had originally ordered a cake with a blue line alone, not a cake bearing the words "Blue Lives Matter" or any other inscribed phrase, and added that the cake seen above was "not the cake" that left the store — as requested, Walmart said, the customer received a cake that simply featured a "thin blue line" and bore no inscription.  In the aftermath of the controversy, the McDonough, Georgia, Walmart's Facebook page was inundated with one-star reviews and angry comments, similar to outrage expressed during a similar controversy over an "ISIS cake."

It happened at a store in McDonough, Georgia just south of Atlanta. A family requested the police-themed cake for an officer's retirement party. The Walmart workers apparently thought the request was racist and refused to make it. A friend of the officer's family posted the story online and it caused quite a stir; even the city's police chief had something to say about it. Franklin Allen, Chief of the Jonesboro Police Department Franklin Allen explains, "Officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin.  It doesn't matter to us."   Walmart has since issued this statement: "Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We've reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies." The manager of the store reached out to the officer's family and offered to make the cake, but another store had already taken care of it. Walmart then donated some things for the retirement party along with a gift card.

More National Headlines High school student shot while walking in Pontiac Parents killed in crash during first-ever vacation, daughters injured Put preschool bedtime problems to rest Racist fliers removed from University of Michigan campus A community is in uproar after one man claims a Georgia Walmart refused to make a cake with the words "Blue Lives Matter" written across the top. According to Taylor Wilkes of Locust-Grove, the family of a police officer wanted to have a cake made for his retirement party. She specifically requested the cake have a "thin blue line" across the top in icing, as an homage to his work in law enforcement. "Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being 'racist.' Three separate people in management denied her request," Wilkes wrote. "There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the 'thin blue line,' yet people choose to make everything about race." She instead took her order to another supermarket, but strangers were up in arms after reading the recollection on Facebook, and even voicing their complaints on the McDonough Walmart's Yelp page. After increased pressure, Wilkes posted on Facebook that Walmart has since reached out, and sent gift cards and a cake with the words "Blue Lives Matter" to the party. "We've addressed any issues to everyone involved, and taken steps to ensure that no other customers will have any obstacles," Walmart's McDonough location told InsideEdition.com. "We were able to connect with the family and make it right. She picked up the cake she wanted, and they had their event [Sunday]." The store even sent gift cards, decorations and the original cake with the words, "Blue Lives Matter," to the party. "[The cake] looked terrible," the woman who originally ordered the cake told Todd Starnes. "It doesn't look professional." Copyright (c) 2016 CBS Studios Inc. All Rights Reserved.

A bakery employee at the Walmart on Willow Lane in McDonough refused the woman's request. "One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake," the woman told Fox News' Todd Starnes, who broke the story. She then asked for a black cake with a blue line through it. A bakery employee again refused. "I asked her, 'Is there something wrong with cops?'" the woman said. The manager of the Walmart, after hearing of her story, offered the woman a free cake and a $50 gift card. When bakery employees refused to comply with his orders, the store manager decorated the cake himself. The woman said the results were "unprofessional" and she had no time to get another cake. While Rare and Starnes did not identify the woman, Walmart spokeswoman Leslee Wright acknowledged the "misstep" in a statement to The AJC. "We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores," Wright said. "We're glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right."

The companies are engaged in early talks and a meeting is scheduled this week that will include discussions on Walmart picking up a minority stake in India's largest ecommerce company, the persons said. One of the persons said Walmart is likely to discuss a "strategic deal" with Flipkart similar to the one the US retail titan forged with JD.com in China. In June, Walmart acquired a 5% stake in the second-largest Chinese ecommerce marketplace for about $1.5 billion. It's unclear what stake Walmart would acquire in Flipkart and at what price. A deal would help bolster Flipkart as it seeks to fight a generously funded Amazon. For its part, Walmart would get a firm foothold in India's ecommerce market. "As a policy, we don't comment on speculative reports," a Walmart spokesperson said in an email. A Flipkart spokesperson said, "It is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations." An alliance will allow Flipkart to leverage Walmart's famed global supply chain and increase efficiency in procurement, product assortment and further improve its technology platform. Walmart's Best Price wholesale stores that are present in Jammu, Chandigarh, Guntur, Lucknow and Agra among other locations could conceivably be used as pickup and delivery points. The company could gain a foothold into India's largest ecommerce company, a presence that would have taken Walmart years to build. This will also fulfil the US company's omni-channel strategy of selling goods through various channels. Amazon growing at faster clip Amazon is challenging Flipkart's leadership position in India and threatening Walmart's supremacy in the US. Walmart posted about $14 billion in ecommerce sales in 2015, behind Amazon's $99 billion revenue from online sales. In the first quarter of this year, Walmart registered 7% online growth, slower than its average growth rate of about 12.75% for the previous four quarters in a row. Amazon and Walmart are bitter competitors in the US with the former growing faster over the past few years. In 2015, Amazon's revenue grew by 20% to $107 billion ($99 billion from online sales, the rest from Amazon Web Services) while Walmart's sales declined by 0.7% to $482 billion. In the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Walmart's revenues rose 0.5% to $120.9 billion while Amazon reported sales of $30.40 billion, up 31.1% from the year-ago quarter. Looking to shore up its online presence, Walmart in August acquired Jet.com in the US, a startup gaining popularity among young urban shoppers, for about $3.3 billion in the largest-ever purchase of an ecommerce company. Expansion in India Walmart's expansion in India got stalled a few years ago as the US company focussed on ensuring that its businesses across the world complied with US rules that outlaw bribes paid overseas, following a scandal in Mexico. This among other things led to the breakup of a joint venture with Bharti Enterprises and Walmart's retreat to the wholesale business-to-business segment. India's retail policy is such that neither Walmart nor Amazon are allowed to sell directly to consumers. However, foreign companies can inject 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) into ecommerce marketplaces, the model that both Flipkart and Amazon operate under. The wholesale cash-and-carry channel is the only multi-brand retailing segment in which India allows fully-owned overseas ownership. Walmart's wholesale Best Price stores sell everything from fast-moving consumer goods to furniture to other retailers and institutions. India recently announced 100% FDI in brick-and-mortar and online ventures that sell only Indianproduced and packaged food items but that has failed to enthuse investors. They say such shops won't be viable unless they can expand beyond low-margin food items to other consumer products. If the deal between Walmart and Flipkart materialises, the war between Amazon and Walmart would spill over into India, the fastestgrowing market for the Jeff Bezosfounded company. Amazon is expected to clock $10 billion in gross merchandise sales in the next few years, faster than it did so in markets like Germany, Japan and the UK. Having entered India seven years ago, Walmart now operates 21Best Price wholesale stores. It has 500 stores in China. Its joint venture ended when Walmart declined to purchase a stake in Bharti's Easy Day stores even after the last government allowed 51% FDI in supermarkets. The tough conditions and corruption enquiry into its Mexico operations prompted the US retailer to launch an in-depth probe into its India operations, stalling all plans. Big bucks Flipkart, founded by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal as an online book retailer in 2007, has evolved into a full-fledged online retailer with more than 100 million registered users. The company was valued at $11.55 billion in August, down from the peak of $15.2 billion when it last raised capital in July 2015. Flipkart's investors include Tiger Global, Qatar Investment Authority, DST Global, GIC, Naspers, Accel Partners, Morgan Stanley and T Rowe Price. It owns two of India's largest online fashion retailers Myntra and Jabong, both of which it acquired. As a group, Flipkart has a 70% share of the online fashion business in India. In June, Bezos announced the Seattle-based online giant's plans to invest an additional $3 billion in India, taking the overall investment pledge to $5 billion in the last two years.

The supermarket in McDonough, Georgia was accused of turning away a young woman after she asked them to decorate a cake in black and blue police colours, with the motto ‘Blue Lives Matter’. This Morning viewers outraged over David Beckham wannabe’s £20k benefits spend on surgery Furious by Walmart’s alleged refusal, a police officer and friend of the woman’s father, shared the incident on Facebook, calling it ‘appalling’. He wrote: ‘Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ‘racist’. To me, this is appalling. ‘People CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I’m so tired of it. It’s literally exhausting for me to think about now.’ Fox News host, Todd Starnes, picked up the story and interviewed the daughter. Wishing to remain anonymous, she said: ‘I was so shocked… One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake. Why did it take Alton Towers so long to dial 999 after Smiler crash? ‘I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.’ Starnes claimed that after further complaints to Walmart, staff continued to refuse to make the cake, so the manager offered to take on the task. But the Fox News host said the result was ‘absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable’, demanding the staff redo the cake or be fired. Walmart manger of communications, Leslee Wright, told Henry Daily Herald that it has since apologised to the family.

But, sometimes we misstep. ‘We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.’ It is not clear if staff redecorated the cake.

As the Macon Telegraph reports, late last week, an unnamed Georgia woman went to a Walmart location in McDonough, Georgia, to order a cake for a party for her father’s retirement from the police force. The woman has asked for a cake with an American flag with black and white stripes and with a blue line through it. A Walmart customer wanted a cake with this symbol for her dad’s retirement party. [Image by pashabo/Shutterstock] The symbol, says the Telegraph, is a “common police emblem,” the thin blue line representing the brotherhood of the men & women in blue; that is, police. The baker on duty that day refused to bake the cake, saying that he or she considered it racist. The woman anonymously went on the Todd Starnes Radio Show to explain what happened. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake.” The woman was outraged. “I was so shocked. I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” Family friend Taylor Wilkes, who is herself a Georgia police officer, took to Facebook to encourage others to boycott Walmart. Once the story hit social media, it quickly went viral, generating over 4,000 shares and eventually being picked up by news agencies, including the Inquisitr. Franklin Allen, Chief of the Jonesboro, Arkansas Police Department told WTVM (Columbus, Georgia), that the baker’s decision was “heartbreaking.” “It’s really heartbreaking, because officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin. It doesn’t matter to us.” The police officer’s daughter, meanwhile, took her business to a nearby Kroger and got her cake made. Now that the story has gone viral, Walmart has tried to make things right. Wilkes said that store manager approached her friend and apologized, offered her a gift card, offered some items for the party on the house, and offered to make the cake that the baker originally refused. Not one to turn down a free cake, the police officer’s daughter accepted the offer; the results were less than spectacular. WALMART refuses to make cop’s ‘racist’ retirement cake… https://t.co/1yS1srUb7I — DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) September 26, 2016 Taylor says that she believes that Walmart only tried to make things right because of public pressure, not because it was the right thing to do. “I think he just did that because, t hanks to you all, this got so much attention, and he didn’t want it to go farther than it did. The way the meeting was described to me was that it was very scripted and not very sincere. So, although the mistake was ‘made right,’ I will still not be shopping at Walmart due to the ‘quality’ of employees they hire.” Walmart’s corporate headquarters, meanwhile, has also entered the fray. In a statement, the Arkansas-based company said that they have “reached out” to the family to try to make things right. “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” WTVM also contacted Walmart to see if any employees connected to the situation have been fired or otherwise disciplined; Walmart has not yet responded. Do you think the Walmart bakers were in the wrong to refuse to bake a cake with a police symbol?

(Courtesy/Todd Starnes) Three Walmart workers in McDonough, Georgia refused to decorate a "thin blue line" cake for a police officer's retirement party because they said it was racist. A number of my Georgia readers alerted me to the story and on Saturday night I spoke directly with the police officer's daughter. She asked that I not divulge her name and I've agreed to honor her request. "I was so shocked," she told me. "I didn't know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene." For the record, Walmart has confessed that most of her allegations are true. I'll have more on that a bit later in this column. The police officer's daughter went to the Walmart on Willow Drive on Sept. 22 to order a flag for her father's retirement party. He was leaving the force after 25-years on the job.  She showed the bakers a photograph of the police officer's flag—the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line.  "One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake," the police officer's daughter told me.  As an alternative, she suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line.  But that design was also rejected by Walmart's cake decorator. "She said, 'I don't feel comfortable doing this,'" the cop's daughter told me. "I asked her, 'Is there something wrong with cops?'" After being rejected for a third time, the 21-year-old told the bakers, "I'll find another bakery, thank you." She was much more polite than I would've been, folks. "I was disappointed," she told me. "I go to Walmart all the time—at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much I appreciated him." A friend of the family posted an item about the incident on Facebook and it wasn't long before the Walmart store manager called the police officer's wife and daughter—and apologized.  "He said he was so sorry," the daughter told me. "He offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card." <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=269169953" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=269169953" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement A Walmart corporate spokesperson confirmed most of the story. "Our goal is to always take care of customers," the spokesperson told me. "But, sometimes we misstep. We're glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right." Walmart did not say if one of their associates called the cake racist. "I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer," the spokesperson told me. So how did Walmart right their wrong? The answer to that question is going to curdle your Fruit Loops, folks. The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem—the cake decorators refused to comply. "So the manager told me that he would decorate it—but it looked terrible," the police officer's daughter said. "It doesn't look professional." I've attached photographs of Walmart's handiwork—it's absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. "I work in retail," the officer's daughter told me. "If I didn't want to deal with a customer—and said 'No'—I would get fired." Unfortunately, her father's retirement party is Sunday night, so there's no time to go elsewhere.  "It irritates me that in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them," she said. "And you can't make a cake for the people who are protecting you?" Walmart needs to make this right and they can start by delivering a professionally decorated cake to the police officer's family. The three cake decorators need to be told: Either decorate the cake or be fired.  Just because Walmart is the home of low prices, doesn't mean they have to hire a bunch of low-class, anti-cop bigots.

The deal became official last week and in celebration of the ink drying on the billion dollar transaction Walmart CEO and president Doug McMillon penned a blog on Walmart’s website outlining the benefits of the deal and why the Walmart leadership team decided to acquire the still unproven Jet. The entire blog post can be read here. Below are five key reason’s Walmart acquired Jet in McMillon’s own words. “1) Jet.com brings more ways to serve our customers and reach new customers online. Jet.com created a unique, transparent way for customers to shop, helping them make choices that lower their prices as they shop — from building smarter baskets to opting out of free returns and using debit cards. This has helped Jet.com win fans among savvy shoppers and will help us put the power to save in more shoppers’ hands. Look for that on Walmart.com.   2) The deal will build on our e-commerce foundation and accelerate growth. We’ve grown Walmart.com to the second largest online retailer by traffic in the U.S. and in just the past six months we’ve expanded from 7 million items to more than 15 million on the site. We’re adding about a million more each month. We’ve built an impressive fulfillment network that uses mega-sized fulfillment centers and our stores to get orders to customers faster. Within a year, we’ve created one of the largest online grocery businesses in the country.   3) Jet.com’s and Walmart.com’s customer bases are complementary. Jet.com is a hit among urban millennials, and it will continue to focus on delivering premium brands and experiences. Walmart.com is winning value-conscious shoppers with everyday low prices by keeping costs low. And that’s enhanced by a wide assortment and convenient store pickup options. Together, both Jet.com and Walmart.com will be able to leverage each other’s assets to grow the ways we serve customers.   4) Jet.com boasts incredible talent. Marc **** is both a visionary e-commerce leader and a merchant. He brings with him a smart and talented team that, when combined with ours, will be the best in retail.   5) Together, Jet.com and Walmart can win the future of retail. We’re in the business of “saving people money so that they can live better.” But the value of our customers’ time cannot be overstated. To win the future of retail, we must save customers both money and time. By combining with Jet.com’s technology, shopping experience, customers and talent, we will do exactly that. We will exceed their expectations!” RELATED LINKS 24th Annual Retail Technology Study: New Direction for Retail EKN: 2nd Annual Future of Stores Best of NRF 2016: Top 10 Takeaways Top 10 Department Stores: Who Made the Cut?

(Pexels) The SpiritLed Woman podcast is empowering women weekly to follow their purpose in Christ and boldly walk in faith. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com. I feel incredibly worn out...already. I'm exhausted. The thought of getting the kids going on school work is overwhelming and daunting. And the school year hasn't even started for us yet! Isn't that nuts? And I am the professional teacher—yeah, the one with the university degree. And...I've been doing this for 11 years already! Then I was hit with a revelation as I was flipping through the recent Wal-Mart flyer. Although I may be feeling wilted and weary, I am still so thankful that my kids are home with me. This is the truth I need to hold on to—the truth I want to share with you and encourage you with. 3 Important Truths to Remember When You Are Ready to Quit Thanks, Wal-Mart Yeah, so I was looking through the Wal-Mart flyer while enjoying my morning cup of coffee. My husband was sitting beside me—we both work from home, which is such a wonderful blessing. A huge box of Play-Doh caught my eye and I told my husband that I wanted to get it for our youngest daughter. His first response was "Really?" I had to explain to him that our daughter loves to play with Play-Doh and this massive box of various colors would make her day. What a wonderful 'Back-To-Homeschool' gift, right? This explanation caused a good discussion between my husband and me. And I realized that the fact that I am tired and weary doesn't even matter compared to the truth we comprehended in that moment. Remaining Child-like You see, our youngest daughter is 10-years old. And she still loves to create with Play-Doh. Most kids her age have very little interest in something like Play-Doh. It would be 'too babyish' in their eyes. And, yet, our daughter either doesn't know this or she just doesn't care if she does. My husband and I discussed how she has been able to keep so much of her childhood innocence. And in this day and age, that is quite a feat! Seriously, the worst bad word she knows at 10-years old is 'stupid'. If you asked a public-schooled kid what the worst bad word that they knew was, I am sure we'd be embarrassed at hearing it. The Truth: At home, she can just be a kid and enjoy her childhood. She doesn't know any different, even with older siblings. She is having a delightful childhood – the way it should be. This truth brings me confidence and joy in our family's decision to home educate. Displaying Christ My oldest daughter, Sarah, went to teen camp this summer. Her friend had not been able to make it this year, so she was going 'on her own.' She would not know anyone in her cabin. At first, she was somewhat unsure about this arrangement. However, a week before she was scheduled to leave, she came to me with the most amazing idea. She told me how she remembered a girl at camp last year who had scars on her arms from cutting. The thought that this girl was in so much emotional pain bothered Sarah so much that she hasn't forgotten her. This prompted Sarah to begin asking God to show her the opportunities to show His love to the hurting girls at camp while she was there. When Sarah told me about her prayer, I was in awe of her heart and her request. She was not going to camp for herself. It wasn't about her. She was going so that she could minister to someone else. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=58cba0f8c5&cb=1669703459" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873538&cs=58cba0f8c5&cb=1669703459" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement The Truth: When I am drained and worn-out just by the idea of starting school again, I think about this occasion and I know that my chief purpose in home educating my kids is so they can share the love of Christ with those who desperately need it. And the fruit is abundant. Caring for the Heart ... and Body I was done with seeing my son wear jeans that were a couple of inches above his ankles. I forced him to head to the mall with me to find new jeans that didn't make him look like he was waiting for a flood. This kid is 5 feet 11 inches tall at 12 years old! We found a couple of pairs at one store and were heading off to another when I started chatting with an acquaintance I ran into. About 10 minutes passed by and I heard my son stumbling around behind me and people gasping and asking if he was OK. I turned around to see him on the floor. He had passed out. I helped him up and when he felt better, we went home. I booked a doctor appointment right away. We had blood work done and were called back in only to get more blood work done. I really don't think it is anything serious. My son has grown so much in the last few months and I think it is just taking time for his entire body to adjust. He is tired and needs a lot of sleep right now. The Truth: In the moments I am pondering my own fatigue and exhaustion, I can reflect on the needs of my son and know that I can give him the rest and care he needs right now and not worry about missing assignments or skipped lessons. We have the opportunity to go at our own pace and pick up where we left off if necessary. This not only cares for my son's physical and health needs, but also for his heart. Reflection I hope these three truths encourage your weary heart. I pray that you will be able to find your own truths to hold on to and remember during those moments when you are ready to quit. Write those truths down and place them where you will see them. They will serve as a good reminder for those tough days. Share your own moments of truth below.

HHW Facebook HHW Twitter HHW YouTube HHW Instagram     Features Video News Wired Tracks Politics Bangin Candy Certified Fresh Maurice Garland Music Sports Politics ALL Walmart Workers Face Termination After Refusing To Make “Blue Lives Matter” Cake News   » by Maurice Garland Sep 26 2016, 12:11pm Share This Tweet This Email This “Ain’t no cake, bih.” Three Walmart employees are in trouble after refusing to make a “Blue Lives Matter” cake for a woman celebrating her father’s retirement from the police force. The three individuals work at a Walmart in McDonough, Ga. which sits about 30 miles south of Atlanta. Fox News reports that a woman came to the store to get the obviously offensive “Blue Lives Matter” cake made for a retirement party for her cop dad. The three employees reportedly refused to make the cake and called the gesture “racist.” According to the woman ordering the cake, she says the employees said that they did not feel comfortable making the cake and asked her to go to another bakery. A manager then got involved and offered to not only make the cake for her anyway, but also gave her a $50 gift certificate.  This was the result and woman and her ugly cake left the store. “I was so shocked,” the unidentified woman tells Fox News columnist Todd Starnes. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” The woman, who called the cake design “unprofessional” also left with an apology from the store to her and her family. Walmart issued a statement saying: “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.” Fox News reports there have been calls for the employees to be fired. Is the customer always right? What would you have done if you worked a bakery and a paying customer asked you to create such foolishness?

White Teacher Calls Students a Bunch of Broke ‘N—rs’ Who Will Get Shot Walmart Apologizes After Refusing ‘Racist’ Order for a ‘Blue Lives Matter’ Cake by Ken Meyer | 12:14 pm, September 26th, 2016   A Walmart store in Georgia is walking things back after employees denied a request for a “Blue Lives Matter” cake for a police officer’s retirement party. Taylor Wilkes‘s Facebook page has drawn significant attention recently, ever since he described what happened last week when the family of his friend went to place an order for the cake. “She asked Walmart to make a ‘thin blue line’ cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer,” Wilkes said. “Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being ‘racist.’ Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason.” CBS46 News The cop’s daughter, who has not been named publicly, told her story to Fox host Todd Starnes, who ripped the commotion in a column and said the cake decorators should be ordered to “either decorate the cake or be fired.” Local police chief Franklin Allen was also asked for his thoughts, and he said that Walmart’s decision demonstrated increasing feeling of hostility towards law enforcement across America. As the story gained online traction, Walmart released an apologetic statement regarding the incident. “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep,” Walmart said. “We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” Watch above, via CBS 46.

Doing business here is a privilege and not a right. Walmart wants to expand by building a superstore in Pittsfield. That is because the company knows that it can make more money for their company. And that is good. Of course, such a project would have both positive and negative effects on the surrounding neighborhoods and businesses. I attended a presentation last Tuesday night by the builder and Walmart supporting their proposal and trying to create good-will. There were many questions and comments showing that Walmart has a negative image and that this is well-deserved. There were a few comments about the benefit of having Walmart. The gentlemen who made the presentation seemed sincerely over-optimistic, but the presenters did convince me that a new store on the proposed location would do more good than harm. Allowing Walmart to build a new store has the benefit that it will clean up 16 acres of contaminated land in the business park. It will provide new jobs and convenience for some shoppers. It will pay about $500,000 per year in property taxes. The project does have value and should not be killed. Crane & Company is an example of a good local business that gives back to the community. On top of paying property taxes, it has developed and devoted land for the public benefit. Pittsfield citizens also work for the community by volunteering, keeping our neighborhoods beautiful with plants and flowers, and showing up at Third Thursday and other events. Walmart's history here shows no interest in doing anything extra for the community. There is room for Walmart to do more. The proposed site has abundant possibilities for development. Walmart would use only 16 of the more than 50 available acres. A small park, a playground and an area for dogs are within Walmart's ability to build, and would be an investment in the community. The Berkshire Mall supplied, and maintains, a police car for Lanesborough because the police patrol there and are called out for shoplifting incidents and emergencies. We know from hard experience that nothing lasts forever. Now is the time for the public and our elected representatives to require that Walmart do something more for the community. Walmart has the privilege, not the right, to make profits. We have the right to demand that it contribute to Pittsfield. It is naïve to think that the Walmart corporation cannot afford such an investment in our community.

Jessica Trufant The Patriot Ledger @JTrufant_Ledger WEYMOUTH - Police plan to charge an 83-year-old Norwood woman with operating to endanger after the car she was driving plowed into several parked vehicles before ending up underneath one in the Walmart parking lot on Middle Street. Police have issued a citation to Barbara A. Lavita for operating to endanger, according to Capt. Richard Fuller. Officers responded to the Walmart at 740 Middle St. at 3:43 p.m. Saturday for reports of a crash involving several vehicles. In one of the parking spots, police found a car on top of a Ford Taurus with a driver, later identified as Lavita, and a female passenger inside. The car on top was not occupied at the time. Weymouth Fire Department secured the top car and Fallon Ambulance paramedics evaluated Lavita and her passenger, who both declined any further medical treatment, according to police. A witness told police the Ford Taurus “backed out of a parking spot at a high rate of speed and turned itself 180 degrees before backing into a vehicle in the same row and three spaces away,” according to the police report. Lavita then put her car in drive and again accelerated at a high rate of speed through the parking lot, barreling into vehicles along the way, police said. Police said she also struck shopping carts and a cart holder, which hit other vehicles in the parking lot. Walmart provided surveillance video, which backed up the witness accounts. Police said at least two pedestrians jumped out of the way to avoid being hit in the crash. “At the time of the event there were numerous people walking around the parking lot and going in and out of the store. There are also numerous vehicles being operated in the parking lot,” the police report reads. Seven vehicles were damaged during the crash, police said. Lavita told police “she was attempting to back out of the parking space, but the vehicle didn't move when she hit the gas,” according to the police report. She said she stepped on the accelerator a second time, which caused the vehicle to quickly accelerate backwards, according to the report. Lavita allegedly told police that the same thing happened when she put the car in drive. Police asked the Massachusetts Registry of Motor Vehicles to revoke Lavita’s license.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 26, 2016 at 10:16AM Image source: The Motley Fool. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the undisputed leader in online retail, one of the strongest segments in the consumer sector. This competitive strength in a booming industry has allowed Amazon to deliver impressive revenue growth and market-beating returns for shareholders over time: The stock was trading at less than $40 per share 10 years ago, and it's now making new historical highs in the neighborhood of $805 per share. Market leadership in online retail is a crucial return driver for investors in Amazon, so let's look at how the company is leaving the competition in the dust in its main industry. Crushing the competition The following chart compares Amazon versus competitors such as eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) in terms of stock price performance and revenue growth over the past decade. The image is quite clear: Amazon has obliterated both eBay and Wal-Mart over this period. AMZN data by YCharts Online commerce is a dynamic industry, and underperforming players are trying to close the gap. eBay is investing in new technologies to provide better information to both buyers and sellers on the platform, as well as optimizing product search capabilities, among other initiatives. As for Wal-Mart, the discount retailer has increased its investments in e-commerce over the past couple of years, having recently acquired online retailer Jet.com for $3.3 billion.  Still, both eBay and Wal-Mart have a long way to go if they want to recover some ground versus Amazon, since the most recent financial reports from the three companies confirm that eBay and Wal-Mart are no match for Amazon at this stage. According to reports for the second quarter of 2016, Amazon produced $30.4 billion in sales during the period, a 31% increase versus the second quarter in 2015. As comparison, revenue at eBay was $2.23 billion during the quarter, increasing 6% year over year. Wal-Mart generated $120.9 billion in total sales during the second quarter, a modest 0.5% year-over-year increase. In the e-commerce segment, Wal-Mart's gross merchandise value grew 11.8% versus the same quarter one year ago.  It's all about the customer Amazon's secret for success is deceivingly simple: The company is deeply focused on the customer, always looking for ways to provide a growing variety of products for aggressively low prices, while improving the service in key areas such as delivery time. Unlike the way most other companies operate, management is willing to forego current profits to deliver the best possible customer experience, and most customers consider Amazon far superior to competitors such as eBay or Wal-Mart in online retail. According to a survey from RBC Capital among 2,024 people, Amazon is downright crushing eBay and Wal-Mart in terms of popularity and customer satisfaction in online retail. Based on this data, 90% of the respondents consider Amazon one of the most commonly used platforms when buying online, while eBay comes in a distant second position with 38%, and only 30% of customers consider Wal-Mart a top destination for online shopping. Considering three of the most important decision drivers in the industry -- price, selection, and convenience -- Amazon comes well ahead of eBay and Wal-Mart. In terms of pricing, 62% of customers choose Amazon, versus 12% for eBay and 11% for Wal-Mart. Regarding the best selection in the industry, 79% choose Amazon, while eBay is the preferred choice for 9% of respondents, and Wal-Mart gets 4%. Amazon also leads the survey in terms of convenience, with 75% of customers choosing the online retail juggernaut, versus 6% for eBay and another 6% for Wal-Mart. Other sources confirm that Amazon is the undisputed industry king when it comes to customer satisfaction. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Amazon has been the top-rated company in the sector in every year since 2000. For 2015, Amazon has a customer satisfaction score of 83, while the average company in the sector has a score of 80, and eBay gets a 75. Customers over profits Back in 2013, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in an interview with 60 Minutes, explained that the company regularly does price elasticity studies, which consistently indicate that Amazon could make more money by raising prices. That means the positive impact from higher prices would more than compensate the decline in sales volume from price increases.  However, Amazon chooses not to implement such strategy, even if doing so means leaving some money on the table in the short term. The main reason to do so is that the company prefers to keep customers as happy as possible, earning and consolidating their trust and loyalty for the long term. By taking care of customers, Amazon is also taking care of shareholders. The company's commitment to providing the best possible service for a conveniently low cost has produced booming revenue growth over the years, and Amazon investors have been generously rewarded in the process.

The retailer is challenging the TABC law that bans publicly traded corporations from selling hard liquor. Sec. 22.16 of the Texas state law restricts public companies from selling anything stronger than bee or wine. In their lawsuit filed last year, Walmart says the law is anti-competitive and unfair to consumers. Read the full judge order Local businesses told KXAN after the lawsuit was filed, they are worried Walmart selling liquor would put them out of business. Others argue it would be more convenient if Walmart was allowed to sell spirits. Currently, Walmart sells liquor in other states and would like to expand sales to Texas. It became illegal for public corporations to sell liquor in Texas in 1995. A new trial date has not been set yet.

His daughter, who has declined to be publicly identified to protect her family’s privacy, says that she went to the McDonough, Georgia Walmart to order her dad’s retirement cop cake on September 22. That’s when what she thought would be a smooth, easy, and everyday transaction turned into something political, divisive, and even (allegedly) racist. [Image by Ken Wolter/Shutterstock] As Todd Starnes reports, the woman in question claims that she took her Walmart cop cake order directly to the bakery, where she intended to specify the details she wanted incorporated into the cake’s decorations. She planned to come pick up the cop cake within the next few days. Reportedly, nothing about the Walmart cop cake order went according to plan. The woman originally left the Walmart irate and cake-less. According to the retiring officer’s daughter, the cop cake she had envisioned for her dad’s hard-earned retirement was a “thin blue line” cake. She reportedly told conservative activist Todd Starnes that she went to the Walmart with a photograph of the design she wanted to be recreated on her father’s cop cake. The photo was reportedly that of “the police officer’s flag,” which is the traditional American flag in black and white, featuring one thin blue line to represent police work. [Image by Shutterstock] It was then that the Walmart employee working in the store’s bakery reportedly refused to honor her wishes. “The baker told me the blue line cake was racist.” According to the Walmart customer, she was angry and shocked at the baker’s reaction to her cop cake request. Even so, given the current divisive and politically explosive nature of law enforcement in America, she tried to reach a compromise with the Walmart bakery staff over the cop cake she wanted for her dad’s retirement. “I was so shocked. I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” As an alternative to the police officer’s flag design she’d originally requested for the cop cake, the officer’s daughter said that she suggested that the bakery create a more simple, somehow “less offensive” cop cake. For her second choice, the customer says she asked the baker to simply frost a cake with chocolate icing and add a line of blue icing to represent the “thin blue line” created by police. Once again, however, her request was turned down by the Walmart employee. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake. She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,'” the cop’s daughter told me. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?'” @Hdngttrn @Acoatain that cop dodged a bullet again. No one should be subjected to eating Walmart cake. — mrmcdaniel (@mrmcdaniel) September 25, 2016 @FoxNews @toddstarnes Ah, so where is the ACLU on this one? They go after Christians on cakes? — Marsha Marsha (@MarshaMarshaKy) September 25, 2016 @RealJamesWoods @tayfan2 @FoxNews but I would never eat the cake made by someone who hates me. Like those @Walmart employees apparently do — Karen D (캐렌 디) (@KaeKaed) September 25, 2016 @RealJamesWoods @FoxNews take ur business someone else then ya big babies — ooh mama (@Realtop24) September 25, 2016 After the Walmart bakery employees repeatedly rejected her requests for a cop cake as being “racist,” the police officer’s daughter decided to take her business elsewhere. To her credit, she reportedly didn’t make a scene at the Walmart, nor did she even publicly complain about the bakery’s refusal to fulfill her order. Her friends and family members, however, were reportedly less discreet. One or more of the woman’s relations/friends reportedly began telling the story of the failed Walmart cop cake on social media. When the news of the situation began to spread, the management of the Georgia Walmart got in touch with their disgruntled customer, a customer that has claimed to regularly drop hundreds of dollars at the store on a weekly basis. According to the woman, she and her mom (the wife of the retiring police officer), soon got a phone call and an apology from the Walmart manager. The manager even tried to make reparations for the incident, an incident that the customer believes was disrespectful to law enforcement and insulting, by offering to make the cop cake for free. He even reportedly offered the police officer’s disgruntled daughter a $50 gift card for her trouble. Reportedly, the Walmart management team refused to confirm or deny whether their bakery employees called the cop cake “racist.” “I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer.” In the end, the officer’s daughter opted to take the Walmart manager up on his offer to make the cop cake she’d requested; not the police officer’s flag version, but the thin blue line on chocolate icing version. However, that wasn’t the end of the woman’s unbelievable cop cake Walmart drama. That’s because all three of the three professional cake decorators working at the Walmart bakery absolutely refused to make and/or decorate the cop cake. Ultimately, the store manager reportedly undertook the project himself. The results were subpar, as evidenced in a photo supplied by the customer in question. Cop's Daughter Asks Walmart To Make "Thin Blue Line" Cake… Their Response Is SICK https://t.co/GcE765tAnU pic.twitter.com/1Kve8RVTuy — King Robbo ???? (@realkingrobbo) September 25, 2016 As you can see, the Walmart manager’s cake decorating skills were less than stellar, leaving the cop’s daughter with a final product she was not happy with at all. Insult to injury, if you will. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible. It doesn’t look professional.” Reportedly, the police officer’s retirement party was scheduled for Sunday, therefore his daughter didn’t have the time to seek out an alternative or replacement cop cake. What do you think? Did Walmart handle the situation appropriately? Is the phrase “Blue Lives Matter” racist? Should employees have the right to refuse to make a cake that they deem personally or politically offensive? What are your thoughts regarding the Walmart cop cake situation?

Woman falls from moving car at Wal-Mart; Port St. Lucie man arrested Jan Lindsey, Special to Treasure Coast Newspapers 5:09 p.m. EDT September 27, 2016 David Alexander Squitieri (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY ST. LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINEMAILMORE PORT ST. LUCIE — A Port St. Lucie man was arrested Monday after an altercation during which he drove through a Wal-Mart parking lot with a woman hanging from his car, according to Port St. Lucie Police. David Alexander Squitieri, 27, of the 400 block of Southeast Thornhill Drive, was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, records show. He was being held Tuesday at the St. Lucie County Jail in lieu of a $15,000 bond. The 48-year-old Port St. Lucie woman sustained a head injury, cuts and scrapes when she fell from the moving car about 4:15 p.m. in the parking lot of the store in the 1800 block of Southwest Gatlin Boulevard, according to a Port St. Lucie Police arrest affidavit. She was treated at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center in Fort Pierce. The woman had agreed to return items to Wal-Mart for Squitieri in exchange for $20, according to an arrest affidavit. An argument erupted after she received a $150 gift card for the returned items, the affidavit states. Squitieri grabbed the card and ran to his car with the woman following. He started driving before the woman could get fully inside the vehicle, drove about 100 yards before she hit the pavement, and then left, the affidavit states.

(Pennsville Police Department) Print Email Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com By Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com Today's Sunbeam Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 27, 2016 at 2:29 PM, updated September 27, 2016 at 4:12 PM comments PENNSVILLE TWP. — Police are seeking the public's help in a finding a woman they say is preying on the elderly and stealing their credit cards. Pennsville authorities have released several images of the suspect taken by surveillance cameras at the Pennsville Walmart, Pennsville Acme and Penns Grove Rite-Aid— all places she is using the stolen credit cards to make purchases. Store surveillance camera images from businesses in Salem County show two vehicles used by a woman Pennsville police want to question in the theft and use of credit cards belonging to the elderly. (Pennsville Police Department)   The woman was captured on a Walmart surveillance camera reaching into a woman's purse and removing a credit card, police said. The woman has been using numerous stolen credit cards — all believed to have been taken from elderly females — to buy goods. Authorities believe she follows her victims around a store, makes small talk with them and, when she gets the chance, removes their credit cards/wallets without the victims' knowledge. The suspect is also wanted by New Castle County, Delaware, police for using a credit card stolen from there to make purchases in Salem County, Pennsville authorities say. The wanted woman has apparently been using two different vehicles — one a four-door white Pontiac G6 and the other a dark colored, possibly dark gray, Ford Expedition that may be registered in New Jersey. Authorities also released photo of those vehicles. Anyone with any information or who can identify this person is asked to contact Det. Michael Gibison of the Pennsville Police Department at 856-678-3089 Ext. 504. Bill Gallo Jr. may be reached at bgallo@njadvancemedia.com. Follow Bill Gallo Jr. on Twitter @bgallojr.

(WXIA) – A McDonough, Georgia Walmart is facing a backlash after employees there refused to make a “Blue Lives Matter” cake for a retiring police officer, and the story is going viral. The officer’s daughter said it was a cake for the officer’s retirement party, after serving for 25 years. She said the store’s refusal left her puzzled and devastated. Jordan Harkins said employees initially declined her request. After a friend posted about the incident on Facebook, a manager called her to apologize and make the cake. Walmart’s corporate communications department also issued an apology. Here is the following statement: “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores.” “It doesn’t make up for the fact that it should have never happened in the first place,” Harkins said.   Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Google Tumblr More Send to Kindle LinkedIn Pocket Like this: Like Loading...

Rase  BAY CITY, MI — Police are alleging a 17-year-old stole a handgun from a car, then was lured into an arrest with the prospect of meeting up with a prostitute. At about 9:15 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 25, a Bay County sheriff's deputy responded to a motor vehicle break-in complaint in the 3700 block of Wheeler Road in Bangor Township. The complainant said a brick had been thrown through the front passenger window of his Jeep Sahara and his 9mm Glock stolen, court records show. The man went on to tell the deputy the gun had been between the driver seat and the emergency brake, though its butt would have been visible from outside, court records show. The deputy found two bricks in the Sahara and what appeared to be blood. The complainant's girlfriend also told the deputy her purse was stolen from the Sahara. She added someone had attempted to use two of her stolen credit cards at the Bangor Township Walmart at about 7 a.m., court records show. The deputy also seized a camouflage cooler at the scene, which the complainants said was not theirs. The cooler contained keys, shoes, chargers, and pill bottles, one of which bore the name Brady J. Rase, court records show. A neighbor at the scene also told the deputy his GMC Sierra had also been rifled and a bag of change was missing from its glovebox, court records show. The deputy went to Walmart and viewed surveillance camera footage. The footage depicted what appeared to be Rase using the stolen credit cards in an attempt to buy a holster. When the cards were declined, he paid for the holster in cash, court records show. Police went to Rase's house. His mother told them he came home at about 5:30 a.m. with what appeared to be a woman's bag. At about 7 a.m., his stepfather dropped him off at Walmart, the mother told police. Police searched Rase's bedroom and found shards of glass, bloody tissues, the woman's stolen purse containing her wallet and passport, and car keys belonging to another resident in the 3700 block of Wheeler Road, court records show. Bay County Central Dispatch pinged Rase's cellphone, the results of which indicated he was in Bay City. A Bay City police officer then messaged Rase via Facebook, posed as a prostitute, and asked him to meet up at a local hotel, court records show. Police went to the hotel and encountered Rase, the stolen gun holstered on his right hip, court records show. Also in his possession were the woman's credit cards, court records show. Rase on Monday, Sept. 26, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on three counts of felony firearm and single counts of larceny of a firearm, breaking and entering a vehicle causing damage, and carrying a concealed weapon. Rase is to appear for a preliminary examination before District Judge Timothy J. Kelly at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 12.

The $99 device will go on sale in late October at various retailers, including Walmart. The hub works with many smart home protocols and devices to control a variety of smart locks, lights, and other products. With that $30 price increase comes some new upgrades. In addition to the Bluetooth Low Energy, Kidde, Lutron Clear Connect, Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and ZigBee support, the new hub has a more powerful Wi-Fi radio and Ethernet port. It also has a Thread radio, so it will one day work with Google-backed protocol. Related: Control4 debuts Alexa integration, making your smart home a whole lot smarter The hub is also designed to be very user-friendly. Nathan Smith, Wink founder and chief technology officer, told Digital Trends it’s one of the reasons the company wanted to partner with Walmart:He says just about anyone can set it up and get it working, even those who don’t consider themselves gadget-lovers. For one thing, the redesigned app automatically detects the hub when you plug it in. If the hub is having problems connecting a device you’re setting up, it will still be communicating with your phone. “Everyone’s had that experience where they’re setting up one of these products and they’re looking at the little spinner and wondering, will this work, will this not work?” says Smith. Instead of giving you a generic message saying setup failed, the app will let you know exactly what’s wrong and point you to the troubleshooting guide. For those current Wink users who want to update to the new hub, there’s also a new backup system that allows you to port over all your existing devices and scenes. “It’s a lot easier than walking around your house and trying to find every device you’ve connected,” says Smith. While the hub itself doesn’t have voice-recognition technology, it does work with Amazon’s Alexa. “In order to get full advantage out of these products and maintaining a  connected home, you need sort of a mesh of different types interfaces,” says Smith. “We don’t really think pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and going into an app is always the right way to operate something.” Voice is great for command and control, he says, while wearables are great for seeing status updates, and phones work well for setup and configuration. In April 2015, Wink replaced affected hubs when an update bricked some devices. Smith says the new hub is better and more secure but admits it may take time to win back trust. “At the end of the day, all you can do is try to move forward after there’s any setback and try to learn from it,” said Smith. “It’s a tricky industr,y the same way it was tricky at the advent of the web. It’s just constant refinement and user research.”

Cahalan was recently honored with a $490 gift card and iPad from Walmart as part of its Commander in Teach(ers) program. Walmart estimates that teachers spend about that much out of their own pocket during a school year. Cahalan has been with the district for 19 years.

 Consumer confidence surges to post-recession high Elena Holodny Sep. 27, 2016, 9:38 AM 1,397 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shoppers look at merchandise at a Walmart store in Secaucus, New Jersey Thomson Reuters Consumer confidence just surged to its highest level since the recession. The latest reading on consumer confidence from the Conference Board came in at 104.1 for September, up from the prior month's 101.8. The index touched 105.6 in August 2007, according Joe LaVorgna, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. Meanwhile, economists had forecast that the index dropped to 99.0 this month, according to the Bloomberg consensus. “Consumers’ assessment of present-day conditions improved, primarily the result of a more positive view of the labor market," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. The report noted that consumers are  feeling better about jobs: the proportion of those expecting more jobs in the upcoming months rose to 15.1% from 14.4%, and the proportion of those expecting less jobs dropped to 17.0% from 17.5%. Moreover, those expecting a drop in incomes to decreased to 10.3% from 11.0%. However, those expecting incomes to increase dropped to 17.1% from 18.5%. "Consumers are not buying into 'doom and gloom' right now. It is amazing that the election is as close as it is ... " wrote Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta in a note after the report.

EST September 27, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST MCDONOUGH, GA -- A Georgia Walmart is facing a backlash after employees there refused to make a "Blue Lives Matter" cake for a retiring police officer. The officer's daughter says it was a cake for the officer's retirement party, after serving for 25 years. She says the store's refusal left her puzzled and devastated. A viral social media post has put the store in the spotlight. Taylor Wilkes, a police officer, created the Facebook post, which has received 4,700 shares. She created the post after hearing after hearing what happened to her friend, Jordan Harkins, who wanted a Blue Lives Matter cake made for her father, a retiring police officer. "I don't see how a thin blue line on a cake can be perceived as racist," Wilkes said. Our sister station WXIA 11Alive News reached out to Harkins via Facetime and asked what the store's employees told her. "She said she didn't feel comfortable making that cake," Harkins said. Harkins said employees initially declined her request, saying the cake might offend some people. After the social media post spread, Harkins said a manager called her to apologize and make the cake. 11Alive News talked with the Walmart manager, who said they fixed the problem. A representative from Walmart's Corporate Communications Department sent the following statement: "Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores." "It doesn't make up for the fact that it should have never happened in the first place," Harkins said. She says she was able to take the cake they finally made to her dad's retirement party. A Walmart spokesperson says they're glad they were able to get in touch with the family to apologize for what happened.

Jordan Harkins said she requested the cake have the words "Blue Lives Matter" pasted on it, and was met with resistance and finally refusal from three Walmart workers. According to Harkins, the employees told her the cake's message could be taken as racist. The company has since apologized for the incident, issuing a statement: "Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We've reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies." Harkins said she was in disbelief when she was first turned away. "I didn't know how to react, because I didn't think that was the response I would have gotten," said Harkins. "Just insulted, for the most part, because that's my family." "(Police) protect us, and they're serving, and giving their lives everyday for us. So, I think the support needs to come from everyone, including WalMart, where everyone shops all the time." Harkins ultimately turned away the "Blue Lives Matter" cake because she said she wasn't happy with how it looked, instead accepting a cake with a blue stripe across a black background. A Walmart spokeswoman would not comment on whether or not the employees involved in the incident were disciplined. Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

The officer's daughter told radio host Todd Starnes that she wanted the cake to feature a black and white American flag with a blue stripe added in to symbolize the police force, and that when an employee said no one felt comfortable decorating the cake that way because it "could be perceived as racist," the daughter suggested a simple blue line on a background of chocolate frosting—which the employee said she also didn't "feel comfortable" with. (However, a photo provided to Starnes of the cake that was ultimately completed shows the blue line on black frosting surrounded by the words, "Blue Lives Matter.") A family friend and fellow police officer posted about the incident on Facebook Thursday, and then on Saturday posted that the manager of the Walmart had reached out, apologized, and offered to make the cake himself, free of charge, after the post went viral, the Macon Telegraph reports. That's the cake pictured in a photo provided to Starnes; the cop's daughter notes that since no employees would agree to decorate it, the manager decorated it himself and it looks "terrible. It doesn’t look professional." A Walmart spokesperson confirmed a "misstep" to Starnes, though he wouldn't say whether an employee had called the cake racist: "I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer," he said. The family friend says the daughter eventually had a cake made at Kroger for the party.

Posted: Monday, September 26, 2016 California couple overcomes homeless situation in Michigan By Meghan Nelson • Last Updated 9:15 am on Monday, September 26, 2016 Tweet Amy and Joe Hanson (pseudonyms used for the couple’s protection) wanted their photograph to be taken next to a cross to “thank the man above” for helping them get out of homelessness. The couple was homeless for years before finding stable housing in Greenville through Montcalm and Ionia county services. — Daily News/Meghan Koglin GREENVILLE —  When Joe and Amy Hanson (not their real names) moved from California to Michigan, they didn’t have jobs lined up or a place to live. In fact, they were homeless. Amy had applied for a transfer to Walmart in Ionia, which she accepted, and they made the move to Michigan. “I made a promise to his mom before she died and I told him I would get him over here,” Amy said. “But we were late coming in, and they ended up giving my job away. That’s how we ended up in our situation.” While the situation was frustrating, it wasn’t new to the Hansons. Joe had been dealing with off and on homelessness since he was about 13 years old. Joe and Amy moved to Michigan in 2014. They brought a moving truck with them, but they had to return it and were left outside in the middle of a snowstorm. “It was just us and our luggage sitting at a Pilot gas station in the snow,” Amy said. “We got into Midway Hotel because the night before spent it on the back of an abandoned restaurant.” Joe walked from the hotel to his sister’s house, an eight-mile trek, only to get the door shut in his face. On the way back to his family, a Michigan State Police trooper pulled him over for walking on the wrong side of the road. “The state trooper said he would let me go because I was new,” Joe said. “Then, I told him where my wife was, and he told me to keep walking. Three hours later, I get to the truck stop and (Amy) is sitting there. She gives me a look, and I turn around and see the state trooper behind me.” Joe and Amy ended up calling 911 and were transferred to 211 (the information service was still available). They were eventually put in contact with Have Mercy and its Executive Director Kim Cain. Have Mercy in Greenville is an organization that seeks to meet temporary needs of homeless people while working toward a permanent solution, and it played a big part in Joe and Amy’s life in Michigan. The Hansons are thankful for all the work the agency have done for them. While agencies were there to help with adjustments, Joe and Amy still dealt with many differences. “Out there in California, it is a gold mine to a homeless person,” Joe said. “There are umpteen spots I can go to. I can go to one dumpster and pull out $300 to $400 worth of stuff. I’d pull out dresses to give my wife, or what we would do was take those dresses in to a consignment shop and make money.” Joe also was able to find radios, televisions and food in those dumpsters. One day, he even found a bike, which helped him get around more. “It was an old man’s bike. But hey, I’m not going to complain if it can get me from point A to point B to point Z, I’m going to ride it,” Joe said. During his years of living in homelessness, Joe has learned how to survive as a homeless person. For four years before Joe met Amy, he built a shack out of palettes and nails and lived in it. He had electricity and water. He also started wearing dark clothing to camouflage himself at night when he would go out to bring home food, clothes and other things he could find. “The safest time for me is at night because I can get around without being harassed,” Joe said Joe is adamant about his wife staying safe especially when they were homeless. He noted life as a homeless woman is different and more dangerous than life as a homeless man. “I ended up working with our son and was making close to $500 a week,” Joe said. “My wife and I decided to buy an RV, but we ended up being scammed of $1,000. So we faced jail time. Instead of letting my wife do time, I did.” Joe admits he struggled with drug use and abuse in the past, truing everything except heroin. Since coming to Michigan, he says he has been clean. “I was sick of dealing with homelessness and wanted to be in my own little world,” Joe said. “I went and smoked some crystal away from my wife. When I came back, I had blood in my eyes and would cough up blood.” Amy asked if he needed to go to the hospital, but he resisted. She ended up putting him through multiple baths with epsom salt to detoxify his body. Joe decided that was the last time he would do drugs. Not much longer, the couple moved to Michigan. “I left out the drug scene. I don’t need that,” Joe said. “I have a whole lot better. I have better friends.” Another difference between Joe’s and Amy’s lives in California and Michigan is that, with the help of Have Mercy and other agencies in Montcalm and Ionia counties, after nine months they are now successfully housed. “Since he was 13 or 14, he has been dealing with off and on homelessness,” Cain said of Joe. “And to have that person be stably housed, to have that household have stable income, to have them have a happy life, that’s victory. And it doesn’t happen very often.” Cain credited agencies in Montcalm and Ionia counties for writing that success story. But she emphasized that Joe and Amy played an important role in getting themselves out of homelessness. “The reason they came out of homelessness is because they wanted,” Cain said. “We are so limited in what we can do. I have people who are still homeless and it’s because they aren’t willing to do what they have to do.” “You have to want it,” Joe added. “When Kim first met me and (Amy) we wanted it, we wanted help.” Despite stable housing, Joe and Amy are still facing struggles. Right now, Joe is dealing with a stolen identity problem, which prevents him from working. “Since Homeland Security stepped in, they check you,” Amy said. “You can’t bring a relative in to vouch for you. It’s a hard situation for a regular person to go in and get their ID. You have to go through the census. It’s a frustrating process.” Joe warned no one can guarantee he or she won’t end up homeless one day because it can happen to everyone. “I didn’t make that choice. It was forced on me (when he lost his job in his 20s) because my job was taken from me, everything I had; when you run out of money that puts you on the streets even though you can be the best worker in the world. I was making $1,200 to $1,300 every two weeks in California,” Joe said. “People don’t think how people become homeless. If you don’t have money, you’re going to be homeless. I didn’t have a choice, and my wife didn’t have a choice. We don’t want to be homeless.” Joe also talked extensively about the difference between homelessness and “street life.” “Homeless is when you don’t have a choice. When things happen, you lose your job, you lose everything,” he said. “But, street life is when you make that choice. Some people who live on the street think it’s cool. That’s street life, not homelessness.” Another difference Joe pointed out is homeless people are typically focused on survival. “Street people want to do drugs, have sex and don’t care about the world,” he said. Joe and Amy are thankful to all the agencies and to each other for overcoming homelessness, but Joe admitted the fear hasn’t quite gone away. Amy said they are permanently housed, but it is dependent on their rental rates and her hours. “It’s an everyday thing,” Joe said. “It’s a prayer if we’re going to keep strong and keep things together. If she comes home and says she has bad news, I start praying. When her hours get cut, I get scared. I don’t want to be out there anymore than I have to. “I thank God everyday that I’m not homeless anymore,” he said. Local Homeless statistics According to statistics from the Ionia-Montcalm Continuum of Care, the homeless population in the two counties was 570 people last year, including: • 397 in Montcalm County, 332 of whom were literally homeless (didn’t have a place to sleep at night). • 229 in Ionia County, 164 of whom were literally homeless (didn’t have a place to sleep at night). • 158 children in Montcalm County. • 107 children in Ionia County. • 41.81 percent of the homeless population are younger than 18 years old. • 328 of them are females. • 244 of them are males. • 1 is transgender (male to female). • 543 of them are white. • 21 are black or African American. • 5 are American Indian or Alaska Native. • 2 are Asian. • 1 is Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.  • 1 is unknown. • 33.33 percent of them have a high school diploma. • 20 percent of them have some college education. • 13 percent of them have a GED.

Perhaps it is a man sitting next to a shopping cart, huddled beneath a wore-torn blanket while grasping a bottle of spirits wrapped within a brown paper bag. Or maybe it’s a veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, standing on the corner of a street wearing holding a crude cardboard sign asking for help of any kind.

(Mark Tower | MLive.com) Print Email Mark Tower | mtower@mlive.com By Mark Tower | mtower@mlive.com The Saginaw News Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 26, 2016 at 4:04 PM, updated September 26, 2016 at 4:14 PM comments SAGINAW, MI — Starting this weekend, residents hopping onto buses in Saginaw will need to dig a little deeper into their pockets for bus fare. The Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) Board of Directors has resolved to increase the fare schedule — with single ride fares now at $1.50 instead of $1.25 — as part of an earlier decision to bring back Saturday service. Site Manager Glenn Steffens explained that both decisions are important to help built a sustainable future for the public transit system in Saginaw. Tying the increase to a high-profile increase to bus service will hopefully communicate that message clearly to riders and the community in general, Steffens said. "It's not just a matter of asking for another quarter," he said. "It's a matter of giving them something for that quarter." Saginaw bus system bringing back Saturday services, routes to Walmart There was no opposition to the fare increase among members of the STARS Board of Directors, which approved Steffens' recommendation in a 7-0 vote at its Monday, Sept. 26, meeting. Steffens called it a "harsh truth" that a fare increase is necessary to help move the bus system forward. "You can't cut your way out of a hole," he said. The increase itself, expected to generate an additional $75,000 annually, does not make it possible to bring back Saturday service, Steffens said. "We're not just looking to our riders for additional revenue," he said. "We're looking to businesses, we're looking to schools." Steffens on Monday discussed various other potential agreements to provide transportation services, all of which he said might someday become part of the funding puzzle for STARS. A public hearing was held on the proposed fare increases on Aug. 31. That hearing came a month after STARS restored its Route 1 service to Walmart at State and Brockway in Saginaw Township and its Route 69 service in afternoons to Big Lots and surrounding businesses and hotels in the Bay and Tittabawassee corridor. All in all, Stephens said, the public response to the fare increase has been largely positive, particularly because it will coincide with the reinstatement of Saturday service. "The public has been clamoring for this," he said. "Spread the word; Saturday buses are running again." In addition to the fare increase, Oct. 1 is also the date that buses will begin running on Saturdays. It will be the first Saturday with STARS service since 2012. Starting Saturday, Oct. 1, standard buses will run along STARS routes from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. each Saturday. In addition, the system's LIFT services will be offered from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. each Saturday. Steffens admits that it won't meet the needs of everyone in the community, but called it a good first step toward expanding the authority's offerings. "It's a start," he said. "And I think that this is the best compromise given what we have here and what we have to work with." But the site manager, who has been functioning in the role since July, does not plan to stop there. Steffens said a rider and community survey will ask residents "what they want next" now that some Saturday service has been restored. Potentially, he said, that could mean an extension of weekday hours or full-day service on Saturdays, all within the context of the authority's limited financial resources. "This is just the beginning," Steffens said. "Hopefully, this starts a little bit of a health process and restores some faith in STARS." Here are all the changes to the STARS fare schedule, in greater detail: Fixed Route Fares   Current fare New fare Adults $1.25 $1.50 Seniors (Age 62) 0.60 0.75 Person with Disabilities 0.60 0.75 Children:     42", or taller than Farebox 1.25 1.50 Under 42", or shorter than Farebox 0.60 0.75 Transfer Free Free Lift Service   Current fare New fare Adults $5.00 $5.25 Seniors (Age 62) 2.50 2.75 Person with Disabilities 2.50 2.75 Children:     42", or taller than Farebox 5.00 5.25 Under 42", or shorter than Farebox 2.50 2.75 STARS  Card Fixed Route System (Monthly)    Current fare New fare All Passengers $50.00 $60.00 Seniors/Person with Disabilities 25.00 30.00  Round Trip Pass 2.50  3.00  Most Read Find Local Homes for Sale Apartments Car Dealers Used Cars Jobs Businesses Find a job Buy or sell a car Find a place to live See what's for sale Find a business View obituaries Active Discussions Get the latest updates Subscribe to our newsletters Like MLive on Facebook Follow MLive on Twitter About Us MLive Media Group Our Team Advertise Frequently Asked Questions Contact Us Jobs at MLive Subscriptions Newspaper | Digital Editions | eNewsletters The Ann Arbor News The Bay City Times The Flint Journal The Grand Rapids Press Jackson Citizen Patriot Kalamazoo Gazette Muskegon Chronicle The Saginaw News MLive Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Living Opinion Obituaries Jobs Autos Real Estate Apartment Rentals Classifieds Local Deals Local Businesses Business Resource Center Your Regional News Pages Ann Arbor Bay City Detroit Flint Grand Rapids Jackson Kalamazoo Lansing Muskegon Saginaw Mobile Mobile apps | Tablet apps More on MLive Photos Video Weather Post a job Post a free classified ad Sell your car Sell/Rent your home Apartments and Rentals Site Map Sponsor Content Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | YouTube Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2016 MLive Media Group.

Obituary Karidat receives donation from BOG, Walmart By Press Release | Posted on Sep 27 2016 Tag: CNMI, food, Guam, Typhoon Soudelor Bank of Guam and Karidat staff pose for a group photo after the BOG donated $20,028.52 to the charitable institution last Sept. 16, 2016. (Contributed Photo) The Bank of Guam donated $20,028.52 to Karidat last Sept. 16, 2016. The Bank of Guam donation along with a recent $30,000 grant award from the Walmart Foundation through Catholic Charities USA will be used for the development and implementation of sustainable food bank. The Corporation for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps VISTA also granted Karidat a “Volunteer In Service To America” (VISTA) volunteer to assist with the development, implementation, and evaluation of a food bank that addresses food security and climate change mitigation. Karidat has maintained a food pantry since it opened in May 1980, which has been supplying people in need with donated food from local businesses and canned food drives from schools and civic organizations. Typhoon Soudelor, which hit Saipan on Aug. 2, 2015, exposed the need for a more robust food security program with the ability for remote community outreach. Many months after Saipan’s initial recovery from Soudelor, Karidat is still being inundated with requests for food assistance and realizes just how difficult it is for some to get around the island to ask for help. Therefore, a viable food security program is important especially with the risk of more frequent extreme weather events in the future likely due to climate change. With its grant from the Walmart Foundation through Catholic Charities USA, Karidat was able to purchase a pick-up truck that will assist us with the pick-up and delivery of food to the more remote villages on Saipan. With the help of the VISTA Volunteer, Karidat is working to develop a sustainable food bank which that will include satellite food storage facilities in select villages on Saipan, as well as Rota, and Tinian. Karidat is grateful for the recent donation from the Bank of Guam. Karidat will utilize Bank of Guam’s donation to purchase the equipment it needs to achieve its goal of a sustainable food bank that will not only address food security in the CNMI but be disaster ready too.

Hopefully we're all around. Hired as a race for the play the pro is it time and at what trying to trying to scare rather at least a couple of a sudden want to play. Mentally dropped the ball with the wind blew in. Christian look at its banks I don't care who plays or vaginal radiate as I don't care who plays quarterback Steve grove of clay court if Belichick's fine quarterback were coming after. They have promised that. Now on Sports Radio WEEI. Shop you have an actor again. When she odd. Hello Reggie and I at week when I suspect he wins one game and suddenly he's back to be Wal-Mart I that you're hiding. Yes yes dropped his head right calls for the rest on the job in this late game. I have to bring him back to back Espionage Act gaps to set over the last couple weeks old they're gonna fire rubber roared got to get rid of the offensive coordinator at the rent is about leading the league and and win we each got one. Did any got once Zoellick said he has so much help and they tried giving away believing they just watch it. They bought because there's so much all Rex he's talking a lot of big giant peacock right now pop but it just felt like he'd like he did something. Coughlin Carson Palmer target Carson Palmer Rex Ryan and they and the bubble will try to get back. Took that as a big right to. You remember. Tonight they'll fewer than even. Agnico throw him out if you got a huge win them. And it just not to believe in them what does that do to your perception of new England and errors on huge winning. Do anything to. This well I think it's a good team so at first road game. Tuesday. Second quarter like crap out of quarterback and apparently it's suddenly. Carson and strippers aren't there is Carson now first arsenal at. Can we just throw this out at a for the top news. At Connecticut the soft like two. People this week. And in you can hear and feel. Brady suddenly dropped about re not. In the in the eyes of a fancy way it's done anything wrong. It's at these games and probably you know. And I saw that he ate pasta you know she ate salad and ego. And a lot of special it really. Given out ticket event. Well the best thing happened and easily get rest relax have some fun. You know you'll see how the other half lives like that money far equipment tomatoes and they get paid or tomatoes in his diet strawberries were not know that tomatoes may ask us to which has like India all its laboratory and laboratory opposite view let's say tomatoes and all of wood I could not eliminating just almost all of its power no water to be a sauce tomatoes to write this all of are everywhere the plates every used in a month that would do for you are simply let's talk respect doctor about it. But it got him. Am sorry that's. Actually yeah I like to. Follow you. Sure though bill wrapped up around eight gimme now you can zealot like a voting Europe I its own British nobles. I heard them and I heard a. These guys had portable. With these guys this won't get an I'm missing something here's a on this side might it could possibly be that I don't have the my understanding. And have a double check this this morning and I think it's correct. That of the New England Patriots were to trade away Tom Brady at the end of this. Football season which some people in because the delegate to first round tropics which by the way it'll. They would after taking the happy it. 27 million dollars is hit. Fortuitous to take 827. Million dollar kept him in a year in which you need to sign Jamie Collins. Donta hightower. To wait lesser degree because he's restricted. Malcolm Butler does this make any sense to anybody out. There's other guys on the team that need to be paid off so. Yeah doll now. Event of uprising I think there's there's some confusion and even you know called up this morning it to. Sacramento but it does after like everybody feels that to me grapples contract is up at the end of this year. And things need to be done at the end of this year and it's not the case right he has he has one more this year the rest of this year and then one more. So I I think there's a large audience a habit still believes that Jimmy grapples with free in a year I agree because of that they starts at all. Now what could keep both the army opted to Fred check what's their right. But the discussion we're having is the one about 2018 that young doesn't OK so let's stick with the guys at this point because I think they understand that I talked to a few people this weekend. Who were very willing to say good bye to operate I'd out. You know people have short memories. Have long and we Garros on Thursday they all I used in Italy I think people got about we're gonna forget about it. I have one guy really great patriots fan who really understands and watches to game and he's really into it. He's like oh you know whatever for the wall. Right inaudible whatever you do we go all talked and it's a Walter tonight organ intimately but he says they're going. At all. Brady outlook aren't that. Different tossed a credit. But the but they they throughout this the this morning. And it talking about. Even though they realize. The drop low was sheer and they realize some of them realize she's here for cheap dollar one point one million U. Jimmy. To be seen with pre every single week and I get up to like the east and we depend scrambled. That's what you're saying you can't force. Jimmy. Apple too slick as the first guy. Pulls ever speak now. What you're church and that's part of the game. I don't know opens different of the mentality of football or in the locker room. But there is like in his few exceptions that might be with in the two years so but it's always believed the you have arrives in county in arbitration. Meaning three years of Major League service though for your feel expected European and what you feel like you deserve. Have a good year by the league makes adjustment. Joseph you can make the adjustment and instant continue to be good high level an idiot three proved that you are you think you'll. It's not about 56 quarters for Jimmy drop in he's going to be offended pursuit behind Tom Grady. I don't I. And I don't Felix and that's when he left suddenly there's this feeling partisan mood out event six ethics rigged it but it do you what you're it would it would be accomplished. And it's not and I loved hole I'd love major leagues arbitration rules they should or should apply it to whomever hackable what are fun. Ethiopia he'll turn its forests okay who else is out there a particular team looking for quarterbacking you look at the landscape look who's coming out right now. The quarterbacks that are coming out. Tia Goff who hasn't played at all yeah of course of Wentz who looks like. The second coming which pretty cute. Amazing but it did a really nice last year quarterbacks I've played well through the first three occupant but you got out of Dallas pretty good looks like one right. Looks exactly like you got that stands straight up row of livery. On can't do it this guy is a young warm and it didn't go to Canada simian in Denver another guy winning what are they are what we're never gonna do with excellence which Sidney goes up post four cents. Media is great defense and the cornerback who played northwestern. Was good it was great but now I UN draft is upon. My thing is like. So you have all these young core coming house and we we talked orderly Lamar Jackson Lewis we actually watched quantum of watchable always unbelievable to watch out he's a flooding college quarterback. Think she could be Michael that's what he'll he'll bail in the NFL miserable. You'll do terrible and a two run first Eric that's in that topic is. Is very sensitive touchdowns this weekend and did not sized car Washington and it was again it was republic the first corner and like enough. But if you're able to see what these guys given Michael as a lead three games. OK after entire summer I wanna see that your which are made up of sorts he could figure out not received that we've all seen that it's completely different ways you handle. But he's solid you can drop ball deep view and in a two and a half games. You'll prize you know I'll take him over Mark Jackson I'll take him more to Shawn Watson Altec Kimmel cornerback anyone. Off. Okay when it's night if it was ball of salt if it does that they're TL lot and you actually see these I don't think it was a seven of these young guys. It was the second first round draft pick coming for if you clean the Yuri of these teams you have your choice. LaBarge action report that bullish there. Of guys coming out of college for one. First round draft pick which you already have on the board which you are secure version sucks open. Or getting to rubble for 20 typical from more Jackson am I don't think Google wish the second. Well first round draft pick coming from I think commencement tucked but this morning Erica mailed to cents I still think that would sum up the pay the price it. Do you look at some of the young quarterbacks in the league that have been built successful so far has brought costs Weiler. Kurt Jimmie Europe. You know I mean it's like a back up quarterback who shined in a few games to take a shot out of and he's been pathetic and he's awful it is a bad year it's a disabled on now. We wanna do the same thing. Forgot Jimmy grapple won in New England with coach Belichick and maybe that's the reason why it looks really good we wanna pull a couple of Houston Texan and get a guy I didn't hear that may be his. Isn't as good as we think we're lied in his defense and yet the Carolina's coach. We take a shot at somebody like at that press got you know to be ignored another rookie come out of calls that we watch and receipt but this guy can help us out let's not make the same mistake used it. He enters figures so think about this so did you start talking about the system and what's more important to coach cornerback. That's a depiction of that so when he backup quarterbacks they drafted that the development never got a shot to play in this system. The play with bill as a coach. With the supporting cast of the deepens with the skill position players who were called in to this system. Is that as a system with Joshua Jana to start by Charlie Weis it's still there. It's changed a little bit over the years but it's the mentality still legitimate NFL starting quarterback today. So if Ryan Mel's able to play three games he popped but it would heat what would he have the success would they would they tailor make a system for him just like that it percent. Well Brian Hoyer we see we see we did what he did it in in Chicago playing OK guy but he ended up but they spoke publicly look he wrote on Davey. Are you go down the line and look at all if they had an opportunity Matt Cassel he was that was it. Hasselbeck brought that point up as well. And that was he said it journal the team marching to look at it and say that's what he's like with the patriots and Cassel may be a great example of that. Scott Pioli was in Kansas City he knew more about castle than any other GM out here he elected to take him with some of that knowledge. Well guess what Cassel turned out to be just some of the guys. Just another. Our thoughts are mean and it costs while NC will he want NFL level is what acorda. We chaos and then you know maybe record setting defense like it that's Reese might want. That there's a chance that could actually. Her Jimmy drop public us whether this is a performance in Houston Davis it is the exact same scenario is that the defense. But it's the coach don't just McGinest yup it's it's just a Petri culture the gonna win that Denise need looks a lot better than that he's gonna let us. People keep bringing up kibo the team not only made two playoff but one play after it first of all it's a total brain fart by the secondary expert for winning it but more importantly. To get. A big part of that was that defense was starting to become really good. And they kept him in games so they made it better that what he really wants. Just a lot of people out that most is that who thought was legitimate NFL quarterback you'll get the siege by a lot of stuff. And can't tell if bill really believe stick Iraq. Can be the replacement for Britain as we've been saying here now for weeks that you week this thing out until you get through 2017. Season. Worst case scenario if you wanna deal apple you can franchise. And maybe get a top of the second and bottom of the first round pick formal knows what. What's wrong with. What we keep this thing out you look at the actual reinsurance starts and you say yes now Brady might have another year maybe he doesn't. Give yourself some kind of feel out. Why is it would have to make any move right now from Jamaica foolish hope we get 27 million to get money each rate Brady it's. It's not gonna happen as it is too early is a little premature to sit there and look at this situation. Socks which would ease our wished it was a wish. This was percent amber set weeded by about how good so it was until his third year. And then atomic below and then Brady would be 843. Instead of forty it would be easy for us because you could wait out I think he's got three more years. I think he's got he has three years of top five quarterback in him. So is this the season how they handle this and other manipulated to matured I think that this decision how they have to drop below decision. It makes is going to prove whether they have a good ten years in the future yes but it all debate bit but is it open it. As you saw you saw the divorce with her set which. I can't limited amount of plays very careful everything worked out a believable at the entire game if you get those special teams plays if you don't get those. Those turnovers. It it'll get those extra possessions. Then maybe it's a little bit different maybe like birth set plays OK only one of the world and it's maybe they sniff out the little quarterback keeper and it went for ten cent a touchdown. They just everything was her thing. These two years are behind that drop below as well usually the way a look at. Because you're right. Dear teams out here in the National Football League and you've seen them you saw in them this week. Dying to find that franchise quarterback OK Buffalo's been trying to for decades NM and able find it. So it's the most important thing to putting together a winning football. So if you happen. And tell what you actually believed to grapple is that guy going full. But I don't care for his feelings are hurt yes this that there with a freaking put what all next season all the rest of this year and all lick season you keep them around could you don't want. No checks also learned you can lose first round graphics they can take first round draft picks away from you if you can still exist you take away franchise quarterback. Good luck try to win seven games in the national football. A block. Are you know exactly did you feel actually looks. That's all I'm hearing. It from. About oh what about Jimmy. Killings. Killings. Artery then they've never shown they've had that chip in them it's all about. The business of winning and so you can get ahead of it and get ahead of it ultimately I think at what it's gonna happen. I think Brady will end up playing for another team not because of any other he's just not gonna wanna be done playing football. So his skills will diminish him maybe won't be Jimmy Jean David look leverage MG vehicles to play many won't Bieber sect. Merely some other kid who's coming out another three years who knows but it's not gonna stop just because I I figured Don we wanted to crumble now he's a wanna keep plane. I'll think about Peyton Manny he won a suitable with another team. You what to another team I know I was injury related but it puts instead of simply can't happen with Brady well we don't like it probably will he'll get some injury. Able appealed to recover from. Like like years not 22 year old available like it'll be recovered from an injury like a 42 year old. Do you think that they went you know when Bill Belichick talked well drafting crop alone start but a quarterback's agent contract situation. Of an extended Tom Brady. When you actually what you look at the structure of his contract that that was done for reason yeah you think that it's manageable salary cap. And that money and everything else and all of a sudden in 2018. This the cap pickles wake up again. All of a sudden you can trade or release him to save some money in the cap wrecked the whole contract changes. That 2018 season. Just a coincidence that that's when Jimmy go up blows up just in K state felt like drop below the got to move on with fewer remember they read I don't think that was a coincidence I think it did that for that reason. In the region that need to keep in three million relative to take away. The clause and there are of Alan energetic yet I basically say go get three years in a concert at renegotiate but you know it just so happens he's a senior at this kid. Is available or is a free agent. So you know what will leave the door open that we wanna make a change in mobile on we will. I can worry about the sort of coincidental that worry about feelings are we all Michael Jacoby. Played so well listen to get an opportunity so we're dumb and you know what will happen. This year we're gonna hearing during games have to get a nice lead comfortable lead. All Lipsky of Jimmy G and opportunity but Jacoby. Sean John is just sit there and I want. Yeah up already the guys he's so sad. Open up public guys all may go to the man. No. Known though it's no. It has nothing to do it there is not gonna happen but I do think he'll and a player with another team. It's crazy as it sounds he's not gonna go there he's not as a parent. And go that Troy Brown row which is not a problem that the guy played a long time to lock for the team. Did you want them leaving the one his presence there was OK with it. Tedy Bruschi not gonna happen battle situations gonna happen. Actually it's funny and I know Tom Brady is Tom Brady and any as the organization he's a franchise threes way to pick replacing your name. But we all know and we always talk about Belichick. Who gets rid of the guy a year early season rather a year too late. This has been going on now since the minute he walked in the war. We all know that when you stop and you're not worth it anymore you move on now and his name isn't deal for Ebola or or we will four or mail or. He's obviously it's Tom Brady but what makes you think it's gonna be any different with him. Well but but that's what people are saying though they think. That is what's going to Ghana was at the end of this year on an illness itself I have mixed for the people let's say in this year I think are aware of Acropolis in a year deal. But he was as that's over what I'll and that it will shift to the point seven years that money on exhibited that. You can't you can't but but you know what they can easily do. They could franchise. Grapple with the end of 2007 team and they deal more you think there would be team and a National Football League that would do you brought this up lest we can you probably correct. Could get more for him. If he had one year left at one point one million sure you come on the other hand. He's still probably going to get quite a bit. If you for which some and teams such desperate for corporate guys watched the play this weekend watching quarterbacks that are. That was Eli Manning doing in that game against it. Eli that the catcher Mike Fitzpatrick threw the cell line. Not like Obafemi about LeBron James not one. Not two not three not or not or land though not five yeah. Now things. I. Costello. I don't know that it isn't just seemed that you got just a magic geno Smith and a silent known of this is the guy. Ha ha everybody was text and and texted him back in which he's got to be a savior for us and and and if this is the guy. But this the guided it has to play because on that I'm worse than that every time you pay them this is what the march that knows I don't Marshall politic for this dude yeah deputy U want it this note how bad it might. Edgar Sosa still that it's practical it's it's a bad game we've seen it before. No interest he brought up a conference call nobody looked worse and patriots dude throughout the Kansas correct so our inequity Arizona comic that wanted to right now. And I still think that. It is not talent attesting to make the post season the keys. I think that's Patrick can do enough to get in there I also felt like at the Kiki is the reason by the problems once again there right alas that was like Beckham again. Six brick and X six Carson Palmer for. Hope that it's okay you're right Lou we've learned absolutely nothing we're three weeks into the season you're not gonna really know what these teams are you get two week in week nine week ten. Even more so I think now because of the luster. Lesson schedule that you have with with practices and stuff like some of these young quarterback to meet. And their success they're having a little bit startling you know have the same practice sessions and I'd go around the league that was doing the same thing. That you guys were the Panthers are one and two. Lost at all yesterday to the vikings widow last laughed at the same breath for trade that we not why L now. In order right now. And the Panthers are one and two this the team that went to the Super Bowl. A year ago it's the stuff you watching or around the lake apparently can't Newton 58%. Yet. Five picked and sacked twelve times. Rick brings that you share but it does James which that you football. Fifth eight times. If they created demand decreased need. Warning against stop for seventy hours like. The five is like five minutes left in the arts. My computer was stopgap because I am up upright nick Ehrlich maybe sneak if you want to book carries that. You know I was doing it that what is going on right hander like. Under. The colts colts. Won they pulled it out early against the chargers they look like crap. Agile supposed to be the next race. In the next record in Mexico it's not like you. Out of ten days ago. Never go to court ever you have to worry about Denver's downward they deal with the same defense. And and in its early on size dom and saw that run in the post season com but it still there all the pieces are there. And you start to think you get better quarterback played election. Watch out for them. I mean they're still at the meat is still to be addictive biggest question mark is don't pay guitar and it's it's it's a race to get home field. With Denver. That's what this season has become. You get home field advantage over them. I think that's in New York with three weeks and that's all that really matters for the next. Week thirteen games questions with Ximian over sixteen games and I think if you're apple where the guy here will be seen sex thing. Optimal playing great. Eagles over the steelers' thirty forward that spent work. That was. For a from the fill up my place yes it would kill them. It is a guy that likes to one with the football exit sometimes. He couldn't even get out of his way.

The Bank of Guam donation along with a recent $30,000 grant award from the Walmart Foundation through Catholic Charities USA will be used for the development and implementation of sustainable food bank. The Corporation for National and Community Service, AmeriCorps VISTA as also granted Karidat a “Volunteer In Service To America” or VISTA Volunteer to assist with the development, implementation and evaluation of a food bank that addresses food security and climate change mitigation. Karidat has maintained a food pantry since it opened in May 1980, which has been supplying people in need with donated food from local businesses and canned food drives from schools and civic organizations. Typhoon Soudelor, which hit Saipan on August 2, 2015, exposed the need for a more robust food security program with the ability for remote community outreach. Many months after our initial recovery from Soudelor, Karidat is still being inundated with requests for food assistance and realizes just how difficult it is for some to get around the island to ask for help. Therefore, a viable food security program is important especially with the risk of more frequent extreme weather events in the future likely due to climate change. With our grant from the Walmart Foundation through Catholic Charities USA, Karidat was able to purchase a pick-up truck that will assist us with the pick-up and delivery of food to the more remote villages on Saipan. With the help of our VISTA Volunteer we are working to develop a sustainable food bank which that will include satellite food storage facilities in select villages on Saipan, as well as Rota, and Tinian. Karidat is grateful for the recent donation from the Bank of Guam. We will utilize Bank of Guam’s donation to purchase the equipment we need to achieve our goal of a sustainable food bank that will not only address food security in the CNMI but be disaster ready too.

The young woman who ordered the cake for her police officer father’s retirement party, who asked to remain anonymous, initially asked for a cake with the “thin blue line symbol,” which is a black and white American flag with a thin blue stripe added in. The workers at the Walmart refused to decorate the cake, telling the woman that “the design could be perceived as racist” and that “nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” according to FoxNews host Todd Starnes. The woman then asked instead for a cake that simply had a blue line across the middle and the words “Blue Lives Matter,” which was again rejected by the workers. Eventually, a manager stepped in to call the woman and apologize. The manager then made the cake for the woman, but she said that it “looked terrible,” telling Starnes, “It doesn’t look professional.” “I was disappointed,” she admitted. “I go to Walmart all the time — at least once a week spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much I appreciated him.” Related Posts Trump offers controversial Jeff Sessions attorney general job White man to black Starbucks employee: ‘You’re garbage…I voted for Trump!’ Detroit reporter resigns after allegedly using N-word Grandma texts wrong teen about Thanksgiving, invites him anyway White teacher calls students ‘broke a** ni**ers who’ll get shot’ ​Trump’s proposed Muslim registry likened to internment camps Post navigation Previous Previous post: Hollywood finally embraces what it means to be black and awkward Next Next post: Google makes major tech move with National Museum of African American History Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America The best and worst NBA number 1 draft picks of all time The 30 greatest black movie soundtracks of all time Michelle Obama's birthday!: 52 memorable moments to celebrate the first lady's 52nd year 15 gifts we don't want for Christmas Recent Health Stories Breast cancer kills more black women than white women Fentanyl pills found at Prince's estate are 50 times stronger than heroin Woman goes to emergency room after trying new lipstick Study: Some medical students think black people feel less pain than whites Kanye West represents the victimhood, paranoia plaguing black men Gov.

Palm oil continues to leave behind a long record of environmental destruction and human rights abuses. The list includes widely-documented deforestation practices, along with the endemic air pollution across Southeast Asia that led to accusations of companies in Indonesia hiring mercenaries to take smog inspectors hostage. To that end, a recent WWF scorecard that evaluates companies’ performance offers some hope and surprise to consumers. But the report also shows the industry has much work to do in proving it can be more sustainable and responsible. The study evaluates 137 of the world’s largest and most recognizable companies. Scores are based on several factors, including membership in the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the level of transparency in operations and supply chains, and commitment to sourcing what WWF defines as sustainable palm oil. WWF researchers also looked at whether companies actually purchased palm oil from reliable and sustainable sources, or if they relied on purchasing sustainable palm oil certificates from organizations such as GreenPalm. For consumers here in the U.S., the results are encouraging. Companies that received high marks from WWF include Walmart, McDonald’s, Colgate-Palmolive and Estée Lauder. Walmart, for example, has come far in the eyes of WWF since the first such survey in 2009. But while the world’s largest retailer is “leading the way,” there is still some room for improvement. The company largely relies on certificates and says it will not commit to buying only physical certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) until 2025. Other food producers and retailers, however, have a long way to go. And WWF asked customers and stakeholders to push these firms into action. The list includes Campbell Soup and Dunkin’ Brands, as well as the chain stores Kroger, Target, Costco and Safeway. Then there are the companies that earned a huge thumb’s down for not bothering to report at all, as in Hillshire Brands, Yum! Brands and one silent grocer that will surprise many: Whole Foods. And worldwide, if words are met by deeds, then only three companies can really say they are change-makers within the global palm oil supply chain. The Australian snack manufacturer Arnott’s, the French multinational Danone and Italy’s confectionery Ferrero are lauded by WWF for using 100 percent segregated palm oil supplies for their portfolio of products. Yet across Europe, which activists often blame for deforestation due to the region’s aggressive biofuels mandate, there are still too many companies, including large retailers, that either have tepid palm oil sourcing policies or did not respond to WWF’s survey at all. The WWF report is a sobering reminder that despite the growing outcry against the global palm oil sector, the chances are high that abuses will increase rather than decline. Last week media reports revealed that the price of palm oil on commodities markets are at a five-month high as supplies cannot meet global demand. Hence palm oil producers are looking beyond the world’s two largest producers of this ingredient, Indonesia and Malaysia, to new markets in Africa and Latin America. With half of the world’s processed food and personal care products containing palm oil, expect its impact on people and the planet to only become worse unless companies, civil society and governments can agree on a path to mitigate its widespread damage.

Aargh! From our Readers I visited Sam’s Club recently. As I walked in the front door, the first thing I saw was a fully lighted, decorated Christmas tree. To Sam’s Club, Walmart, Macy’s and other retailers, I submit the following: ’Tis not the season to be jolly, ’tis much too early for bells and holly. Let us have Thanksgiving first, then feel free to do your worst. Tempt us with your festive displays, empty our wallets with your winning ways. Bombard our senses with music and lights, until we pray for silent nights. But please, please wait until December, not October and not November — and never, never in September. Carole D. Martin Las Vegas Too much mud After watching all the political hate ads, I’ve reached the conclusion that none of these candidates is fit to hold office. How sad. Carolyn Boyle Las Vegas Silly scare In his Sept. 21 letter to the Review-Journal, Pat Sharp criticized the handling of the mercury contamination at Johnson Middle School. As someone who has had a lot of experience handling elemental mercury — and who was in charge of environmental safety programs, first at Caltech and later at UCLA — I would like to expand on Mr. Sharp’s points. It is appalling how this incident was handled — it must have been under the control of a governmental agency. I wonder if any non-governmental industrial hygienist was ever consulted. I doubt it. The people at the Environmental Protection Agency frequently blow up environmental contaminations to make themselves look important and essential. Holding school kids under quarantine until 5 a.m. was absolutely unnecessary. Elemental mercury is basically non-toxic unless large quantities are ingested or spread over large areas of skin for an extended period. Note, the toxicity of mercury in fish is because it is methyl mercury, which is a very toxic, organic form of mercury. Inhalation of mercury vapor does represent a serious long term hazard, but the vapor pressure of mercury at room temperature is very low. That means that very little mercury vapor is in the air above a spill of elemental mercury. The careful monitoring of everybody’s clothing was unnecessary, as any mercury contamination on clothing is easily removed by washing the clothing. Considering the amount of spilled mercury ultimately found (a quarter cup), ripping up a large amount of the gym flooring was totally unnecessary and I suspect was done mostly for show. An industrial vacuum cleaner equipped with a HEPA filter could have been used to clean up any spills, even those too small to be readily observed. In my professional opinion, this entire incident is a perfect example of governmental overkill and incompetence, and unnecessarily frightened many parents and kids. Walter F. Wegst Las Vegas Large fan base With regard to the recent letter to the Review-Journal from John Dillon of San Bruno, Calif., lamenting the Oakland Raiders’ proposed move to Las Vegas: Mr. Dillon must not have an economics degree. The jobs the new stadium will create — from construction to souvenirs to food services — will be tremendous. If Mr. Dillon doesn’t want to come to Las Vegas, that’s his loss, not ours. Mark Davis does what’s best for the team and a brand new stadium with a large fan base is best.

John Bean, principal of Highcrest Elementary School, was arrested over the weekend at the Walmart plaza on Flatbush Avenue in Hartford. Police said Bean resisted arrest, and was charged with breach of peace. The arrest came as a shock to many, like the Tolland superintendent of schools, who said Bean always went above and beyond and spent hours of his own time working for the better of the children. Bean was an assistant principal of Tolland Intermediate School. He was named principal in Wethersfield two-and-a-half years ago. "I have nothing but positive things to say about Mr. Bean. The information regarding his arrest does not make sense to me,” said Tolland Superintendent Walt Willett. Before Tolland, Bean was a teacher in South Windsor, winning teacher of the year in 2014. Many people took to social media not believing the arrest. “I personally know this man, he taught my children - I can honestly say - John is probably one of the most honest, humble and stand up guys I've ever had the pleasure in knowing,” said John Pereira. “He's a really nice guy who does a good job. I hope he doesn't lose his job over this,” Jon Michael Reynolds said. Bean was placed on leave from the elementary school. He is expected to appear in court on Wednesday.

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 2:21 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Clinton debate showing lifts stocks but oil weighsBy John Biers | AFP – Tue, Sep 27, 2016 10:55 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Financial markets cheered Hillary Clinton's performance in the first US presidential debate, with stocks and high-risk currencies staging a 'relief rally' as investors hailed her as the victor over Republican rival Donald Trump Global stocks got a boost Tuesday from Democrat Hillary Clinton's strong performance in the first US presidential debate. Equity markets in Asia finished solidly higher, along with US stocks, which were also buoyed by a surge in consumer confidence. But gains were partly offset by weakness in petroleum-linked shares due to lower oil prices. Democrat Clinton is viewed as less of a economic and political wildcard for Wall Street than Republican Donald Trump, and so her success buoyed hopes that she can win in the November election. "Clinton appeared to edge the first debate which has provided a lift for investors, albeit only a slight one as the polls remain extremely close and the campaign has a long way to go," said Craig Erlam at traders Oanda. US investors were also cheered by American consumer confidence rising in September to the highest level since the Great Recession, according to the Conference Board. Shares of retailers Wal-Mart Stores, Macy's and Best Buy all gained 1.0 percent or more. But European stocks posted modest declines, weighed down in part by a sharp drop in oil that hit big petroleum producers such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP and France's Total. The decline in oil prices was sparked by comments from Saudi Arabian and Iranian officials signaling low odds for an agreement in Algeria by major oil producers to limit production. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, while the Nikkei in Japan climbed 0.8 percent. The London stock market ended the day 0.2 percent lower, Frankfurt was down 0.3 percent and Paris slid 0.2 percent. One of the biggest movers in the foreign exchange market was the Mexican peso, which rallied against the dollar following the US presidential debate. Trump has vowed a get-tough approach on the US' neighbor to the south, including the building of a massive wall between the two countries that Trump says Mexico will pay for. The dollar fell to as low as 19.369 pesos, more than 2.3 percent. Near 2200 GMT, the dollar was at 19.380 pesos. "The Mexican peso is particularly sensitive to the election and will likely remain very volatile over the next month or so," said Erlam of Oanda. - Key figures at 2100 GMT - New York - DOW: UP 0.7 percent at 18,228.30 (close) New York - S&P 500: UP 0.6 percent at 2,159.93 (close) New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.9 percent at 5,305.71 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 6,807.67 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.3 percent at 10,361.48 (close) Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.2 percent at 4,398.68 (close) EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.5 percent at 2,970.84 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.8 percent at 16,683.93 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 1.1 percent at 23,571.90 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.6 percent to 2,998.17 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1217 from $1.1254 late Monday Dollar/yen: UP at 100.36 yen from 100.30 yen Pound/dollar: UP at $1.3011 from $1.2976 @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Crean enlisted to help Latrobe ValleyAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7363 -0.0052 -0.70% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5967 -0.0002 -0.03% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6945 -0.0032 -0.46% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

The mother quickly looked and realized that the other vehicle had also struck her stroller knocking it over and damaging it. Thankfully her child was still in the vehicle and there was no injuries to the mother or the child. The mother made eye contact with the driver and made motions for her to speak to her about the damage to the vehicle and stroller but the other driver quickly left.

In the 10 races that Earnhardt has missed thus far, Gordon and Bowman have combined to earn one top-10 and six top-15 finishes in the Hendrick Motorsports No. 88 Chevy. JG AT DOVER: While Johnson has earned the most wins at the “Monster Mile,” Gordon leads active drivers in almost every other category – most top-five finishes (18), most top-10 finishes (26), most lead-lap finishes (32), most laps completed (18,389) and most poles (four, tied with Ryan Newman). Gordon also holds the record for being the youngest pole winner at Dover, earning the top spot in qualifying on June 4, 1995, when he was just 23 years and 10 months old. Gordon is tied for fourth on the all-time winners list with David Pearson at five wins apiece, which puts Gordon second among active drivers, behind only Johnson. He’s also second behind Johnson in the laps led category among active drivers with 2,389, putting him third on the all-time list behind Johnson and Bobby Allison. BOWMAN EARNS TOP-15: Last weekend at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Bowman earned his second straight top-15 finish in the No. 88 Chevrolet SS. He will be competing in another No. 88 this weekend, driving for the Earnhardt-owned JR Motorsports team in the NASCAR XFINITY Series. EARNHARDT IN DOVER: As Earnhardt mentioned on his podcast, “The Dale Jr. Download,” he will be returning to the track this weekend to support the No. 88 Nationwide team. He also explains on the podcast that he is continuing to make progress in his recovery. The full podcast can be found here and the Hendrick Motorsports story summarizing his comments can be found by clicking here. VISITING WITH AIRMEN: Members of the No. 88 Nationwide team will be joining airmen at the Air Force Base in Dover to ride along on a C-17 refueling flight on Thursday evening. In return, two members of the Air Force will be joining the No. 88 team at the racetrack on Sunday as honorary pit crew members. NASCAR FOUNDATION GALA IN NYC: Bowman will be on hand for The NASCAR Foundation’s inaugural Honors Gala at the Marriott Marquis in New York City on Tuesday, Sept. 27. Nationwide is the presenting sponsor of The NASCAR Foundation’s Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award, which honors volunteers who dedicate themselves to children’s causes in their communities throughout the United States. The award winner will be determined from an online vote from among four finalists, which Bowman will be on hand to meet: Jim Giaccone, representing Tuesday’s Children; Andy Hoffman, founder of the Team Jack Foundation; Logan Houptley, a founding member of Mikayla’s Voice; and Parker White, founder of BackPack Beginnings. The winner will receive a $100,000 donation to the charity they represent and the three other finalists will receive $25,000 for their respective charitable organizations. Hendrick Motorsports HENDRICK MOTORSPORTS AT DOVER: At Dover International Speedway, Hendrick Motorsports has 18 wins, nine pole positions, 59 top-five finishes and 95 top-10s. Johnson most recently visited Victory Lane for the organization at the track in May 2015. FINDING VICTORY LANE: Hendrick Motorsports’ 18 wins at Dover are tied with Charlotte Motor Speedway for the organization’s second-most at a track. The Dover victories have come via five different drivers — Johnson (10), Gordon (5), Geoff Bodine, Ricky Rudd and Ken Schrader. ORGANIZATION STATS: To date, Hendrick Motorsports has totals of 242 victories, 209 pole positions, 1,002 top-five finishes and 1,679 top-10 finishes in Sprint Cup competition. Its teams have led 65,699 laps since 1984. QUOTABLE / “Dover is a tough track. It’s probably one of the toughest tracks we go to, physically. My team has been bringing me fast cars to the track. I’m really enjoying driving this car again. It has been a lot of fun. Everyone has been doing a great job and putting a huge effort in.” Kasey Kahne on racing at Dover “I’ve always thought that Miles is a really cool trophy to win. As a fan watching I always thought that it was really unique. It also puts a good explanation of that racetrack into a trophy because that’s a really good description of what we fight and what you deal with at Dover. I think that’s a very fitting trophy and it would be great to have one.” Chase Elliott on racing at Dover “There is no doubt Dover is my favorite track. I wish we raced there every single weekend. It suits my driving style. I anticipate it to be a tough race since it’s a cutoff race and there will be guys driving their hearts out to stay in the Chase. This Lowe’s team is due for a win. I would love to get number 11 at Dover this weekend.” Jimmie Johnson on racing at Dover “Alex (Bowman) has been doing a great job, and I’m just happy to do whatever I can to help the (No. 88) team. I’ve always loved Dover. It’s one of the tracks that I feel confident going to, so I’m looking forward to getting back in the car and working with (crew chief) Greg (Ives) and the No. 88 team again this weekend.” Jeff Gordon on racing at Dover ** The opinions expressed on this site are not necessarily those of the publisher.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Sep 27th 2016 3:59PM An unlikely company has suddenly catapulted to the top of the fashion world: Amazon. Amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the US, with its apparel sales totalling $16.3 billion last year, Bloomberg reports. That's more than the combined online sales of Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Gap, and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands in the same period, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Facebook/Amazon Fashion The company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. Amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of clothing website ShopBop. Three years later, Amazon bought online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million. 11 PHOTOS Unbelievable finds from Amazon Fashion See Gallery Unbelievable finds from Amazon Fashion MI IM Slip On V-Cut Out Stacked Heel Bootie, more colors available (Amazon) BUY NOW French Connection Mozart Mix Knits (Amazon) BUY NOW 3x1 Women's WM3 Crop Selvedge Jeans (Amazon) BUY NOW Steve Madden Women's Edit Bootie Casual, more colors available (Amazon) BUY NOW BB Dakota Women's Zalika Faux Suede Coat (Amazon) BUY NOW Wildfox Academy Stripes Dreams Sweater (Amazon) BUY NOW Stuart Weitzman Highland Over-the-Knee Boot, more colors available (Amazon) BUY NOW Jack by BB Dakota Pradera Cotton Twill Army Jacket (Amazon) BUY NOW J Brand Women's Maria Velvet Flare Pants (Amazon) BUY NOW Guess Women's Kielo Faux Fur Vest (Amazon) BUY NOW Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – Over the past couple years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first ever New York Men's Fashion Week. The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Barneys New York fashion director Julie Gilhartogue — whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant — and vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Also in the last few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated — not things that Amazon is necessarily known for. Facebook/Amazon Fashion But Amazon's strategy appears to be working. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Department store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing. The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the last 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley. Facebook/Amazon Fashion But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. "We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion," the analysts wrote in a recent note In a 2012 interview with the New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason for why Amazon was investing in fashion: "Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item," than with cheaper products, he said.

That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company's $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership.

More analysts now think Amazon stock is going to $1,000 InvestorPlace 9/27/2016 Tom Taulli Click to expand Replay Video Trump rode $5 billion in free media to the White House Donald Trump didn't spend nearly as much on advertising as typical presidential candidates, and he didn't have to -- he relied on billions of dollars of free mentions in media ranging from major TV news networks to Buzzfeed and Twitter instead. The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

But Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 763.18 +6.78 +0.90% Global Yellow Pages Ltd AWS ▼ 0.1610 -0.0090 -5.29% Tesla Motors Inc TSLA ▼ 187.00 -1.66 -0.88% Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000 on Tuesday. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. Earlier this month, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney also predicted Amazon shares would hit $1,000. I’m completely on board with this bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. 2. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. 3. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.

Forbes 9/27/2016 Micheline Maynard, Contributor © Provided by Forbes Media LLC Grocery delivery trucks are a common sight on the streets of New York, Boston, San Francisco and Washington. Companies like Peapod have saved countless hours for busy professionals who just can’t squeeze in a trip to the store to pick up milk and eggs. But a bold prediction from a food industry analyst is raising questions about the future of online grocery sales. Kurt Jetta, chief executive of TABS Analytics, says the sector’s moment is over. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.14 +0.19 +0.17% SolarCity Corp SCTY ▲ 20.57 +0.17 +0.83% Abercrombie & Fitch Co ANF ▼ 14.72 -2.21 -13.05% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN ▲ 405.92 +1.36 +0.33% “TABS Analytics is making the call: online grocery is failing,” Jetta declared at a recent webinar.  He based the declaration on a survey of 1,000 consumers in the company’s fourth annual food and beverage study. Of that group, only 4.5 percent purchased groceries regularly online, and TABS says it has yet to break 5 percent in the four years of its study. Moreover, 69 percent of those surveyed have never bought groceries online, and just 15 percent become repeat online grocery buyers once they’ve given it a try. That loyalty rate should be five times higher, Jetta said during his presentation, given that 70 percent of consumers have a favorite grocery store. He told food companies and grocers, “Stop investing in online grocery until you can figure out why there is such a high level of dissatisfaction with the format.” The company says Amazon.com, which is expanding its Amazon Fresh delivery service in major markets, was the only top retailer to see an increase in online grocery delivery during the past year. To be sure, TABS Analytics is going against conventional wisdom and market activity. Online grocery seems to be drawing new entrants almost every week. In Detroit, the app called Shipt is arranging grocery deliveries from Meijer grocery stores in the area. Participants pay an annual $99 fee, including $25 in groceries, or $14 a month to try it out. The Detroit Free Press says the company is looking to hire 200 more drivers. Shipt already delivers for grocery stores in 26 other markets. Minneapolis consumers can now order groceries online from four Wal-Mart stores, and pick them up in the stores’ parking lots. Wal-Mart offers the service at more than 60 stores around the country. I’ve sampled online delivery in the Boston area from the Roche Bros. grocery chain (it’s also available from rival Stop and Shop, through the delivery company Peapod, which has markets across the United States). The online delivery service was a godsend when I was home sick with bronchitis earlier this year, and I’ve noticed that many of my neighbors also get their groceries dropped off. But, I’m also picky about the quality of food I buy, and I mix up my deliveries with trips to brick and mortar stores. The TABS analysis has already come in for some criticism within the grocery industry, prompting the company to defend some of its points. It says online grocery purchases have been around as long as other types of online buying, such as baby products, vitamins and premium cosmetics. Those sectors are doing fine, while consumers seem to try online purchases and then lose interest. “It’s not an inevitability that online grocery will fail,” TABS said in a news release. “But if nothing changes with the current dynamics, the declining penetration (31% in 2016 vs. 34% in 2015) and the extremely low repeat rates make the demise of online grocery a mathematical certainty.” The firm goes on, “It’s not like we want online grocery to fail. But as it stands, there are no facts to suggest that a massive boom from this channel can be expected any time soon, or ever, really.” Meanwhile, if you rely on that truck that pulls up to drop off a box to your doorman, you might want to keep placing orders so that it will keep arriving.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices More From Forbes Jamie Dimon's Decision Not To Be Treasury Secretary Could Cost Him Forbes Is There Another 'You' Out There In A Parallel Universe?

IGA has named two preferred partners to bring IGA GO to its more than 1,100 IGA licensed retailers across the U.S. The partners, Digital Foodie and Freshop, will begin providing their optional online grocery services to IGA retailers immediately. “IGA retailers are in a unique position to offer an online grocery solution when you consider online shoppers migrate towards a trusted brick and mortar store, prefer online shopping as a service rather than a premium offering, and expect a full grocery experience with access to fresh departments like IGA’s meat, produce, bakery and deli,” said IGA CEO Mark Batenic. “Now our shoppers will have two ways to experience IGA’s personalized level of Hometown Proud customer service: within the walls of the IGA stores they know and trust, and online whenever and wherever is most convenient for them. With the industry’s top two providers behind us, we look forward to the immediate benefit our retailers and shoppers will see from this new IGA offering.” Award-winning grocery platform creator Digital Foodie is providing an IGA program option that includes retailer-branded web service, linked to IGA branded native mobile applications for placing orders and shopping planning, as well as state-of-the-art in-store picking and fulfillment tools for optimized store pick-up and home delivery. IGA and Digital Foodie also established a marketing partnership for digital experiences that draws upon Digital Foodie’s marketing and consumer adoption best practices, leveraging its successes in more advanced European grocery markets. Digital Foodie will work closely with IGA and its retailers to develop marketing offers and training programs for converged groceries proven to achieve a high level of consumer adoption with profitable results for grocers. “The retail grocery industry is undergoing a digital transformation that requires grocers to provide converged services including on-demand and in-store solutions to extend and enhance their current bricks and mortar business and to fend off digital inroads by competitors such as Walmart, Amazon and other large grocery chains,“ said Kalle Koutajoki, CEO of Digital Foodie. “We have nearly a decade of experience in deploying online grocery in the most competitive on-demand grocery markets in the world, while simultaneously ‘cracking the code’ to achieving retailer profitability. I am very excited about this partnership, and with our platform and secret sauce to profitability, IGA retailers can jumpstart their on-demand business instantly while keeping the control of the store brand.” Freshop’s program option will provide full digital personalized engagement and online shopping for IGA’s independent retailers. The company’s full-service offering powers mobile, web and app-clickable circulars, full product catalogs, recipes to shopping lists, list building, and the personalized offers critical to IGA’s independent grocers. Freshop, known throughout the industry for its efficient processing, also offers integration with loyalty platforms, PCI compliant payments, ADA compliant websites, and walkpaths for order fulfillment and outstanding support, all for one simple charge per store. "Online Grocery is not just for big metro areas—grocers are successfully using Freshop in more than 25 states in communities of all types and sizes,” said Freshop's CEO Brian Moyer. “IGA's partnership with Freshop allows IGA stores to not only compete in online grocery but to go beyond what the 'big guys' are offering. Freshop's powerful, easy to use platform enhances each local IGA, highlighting products and personalized services tailored to the community."

    Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            Online Grocery Is Failing, Except For Amazon, Finds TABS Analytics Study by TABS Analytics Posted: Tuesday, September 27, 2016 at 3:34PM EDT The TABS Analytics Fourth Annual Food and Beverage Study found once again that online grocery shopping continues to be weak, with just 4.5 percent of consumers regularly purchasing food and beverages online compared to 78 percent of consumers regularly purchasing food and beverages from brick and mortar grocery outlets. Although regular online grocery purchasing increased by half a percentage point since the 2015 study (from 3.9 percent in 2015 to 4.5 percent in 2016), it has yet to break five percent in the four years TABS has conducted this study. Amazon was the one bright spot in online grocery shopping, with the ecommerce giant realizing a two percent increase in shopper penetration from 14 percent in 2015 to 16 percent in 2016, the TABS study found. Amazon was the only online shopping domain to increase shopper penetration in 2016. Walmart.com remained flat in penetration at 12 percent in both 2015 and 2016, while the grocery banners, overall, dropped from 16 percent in 2015 to just 11 percent in 2016. Target.com saw a two percent grocery penetration decline from seven percent in 2015 to five percent in 2016. The decline in Target.com penetration mirrors their exit from the curbside pickup service. “This study underscores that online grocery is failing,” said Kurt Jetta, CEO and founder of TABS Analytics. “For the fourth year in a row, consumers have turned their backs on buying groceries online no matter how much online grocery retailers try to entice them. Sixty-nine percent of consumers never buy groceries online. With only 15 percent of consumers stating loyalty to shopping for groceries online, this is not a sustainable business model, especially when you consider the industry loyalty rate benchmark is 70 percent. Food companies and grocers need to figure out why there is such a high level of dissatisfaction with the online channel before they continue to invest any further in it.” TABS Analytics Fourth Annual Food and Beverage Study, conducted in August 2016, was developed to uncover detailed information about the U.S. CPG consumables categories and how consumer buying patterns of these categories are shaped by the promotions offered. The survey panel consisted of 1,000 geographically and demographically dispersed consumers between the ages of 18 to 75. The 15 consumables categories analyzed were carbonated beverages, salty snacks, cereal, yogurt, water, ice cream, cookies, fruit juice, refrigerated juices, crackers, frozen pizza, frozen novelties, candy, popcorn, and isotonics (sports drinks). Brick and Mortar Grocery Remains Favorite Channel For the fourth year in a row, the grocery brick and mortar channel continued to dominate all other shopping channels with 78 percent of U.S. consumers regularly preferring to shop in brick and mortar grocery stores. The grocery shopping channel remained stable compared to 2015, Target had a four percent decrease in regular shopping trips from 29 percent in 2015 to 25 percent. Costco, Rite Aid, and BJS all registered a two percent decrease in regular shopping trips compared to 2016. Grocery continues to lead food and beverage purchases, with a 26 percent share for consumers regularly purchasing at a specific outlet (defined as 6 or more times per year). Grocery share was nine points higher than its nearest rival, Walmart. Only Target, Dollar, Costco, and Walgreens broke the five percent share mark. Online’s share of regular purchases was up slightly but was just 1.6 percent. The online share gain was driven by an increase in the expansion of curbside pickup services (called click and collect) across the country. Even with a significant investment in that ecommerce platform, though, only 1.0 percent of Americans say they use the format regularly for grocery shopping. Concentrate on Households with Children, Not Millennials Unlike the cosmetics industry that thrives on millennials buyers, just over a quarter of millennials are heavy buyers of food and beverage consumables, compared to 35 percent of households with children who are heavy buyers of food and beverages. Just 20 percent of households with no children are heavy buyers. Millennials are also harder to target with deals than other demographic groups since their participation in deals is well below the national average, particularly circulars and free standing inserts. Despite an uptick in participation in 2016, millennials use of circulars remains a full 12 percentage points below the study average of 42 percent. The gap for free standing inserts is even larger at 14 percentage points below the study average of 34 percent. Weak Promotions Equal Weak Sales The 2016 TABS Food and Beverage Study corroborated industry trends of declining transactions in consumables. The vast majority of the directional changes in category trends are due to the decrease of heavy buyers. “TABS Analytics Fourth Annual Food and Beverage Study backs up that CPG manufacturers and retailers need to make a significant investment in promotional activity to sustain and grow their businesses. Weaker promotions is directly correlated to weaker sales trends,” said Jetta. “Sustained promotional levels of 15 percent to 20 percent of sales are needed to kick-start declining sales trends and bring heavy buyers back.” About TABS Analytics Operating since 1998, TABS Analytics, formerly TABS Group, based in Shelton, Conn., is a technology-enabled analytics firm.

My Review 3 Stars (out of 5) "You're killin' it, Smalls" This was an anticlimactic shoot-em up with zero message and even fewer "give-a-shits." I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. I didn't fully understand the point of it. "But Alec, Drew Lock's mesmerizing performance was Heisman worthy. I mean, bro, he had 402 yards and 5 touchdowns… at the half!" Yea, I don't think that means what you think it means, bro. "Mizzou put up a team-record 79 points! 79, brah. 79!" Again, I don't think that means what you think it means. "Dude, 79, am I right? Uh huh huh. Nice." That definitely does not mean what you think it means. Wait, what the hell do you think "79" means? (Please don't @ me) Anyway, I can't for the life of me scrounge up enough effort to over-analyze what amounts to nothing more than a bargain bin find at your local Walmart. Any statistic birthed from this game comes with one mighty big asterisk: *FCS. But, I'm here to do a "job", so… here you go. Why This Game Was Worth Watching 1) A much needed palette cleanse 2) Points are nice 3) 79 points are nicer 4) Clay Travis 5) Doubles as the rare Anti Anti-Bullying campaign video 6) SEVENTY-NINE, BRAH! Why It Wasn't 1) It was Delaware State (see Roger Sherman) Delaware State went 1-10 last year with a 1-point win over another team that went 1-10. Here's what happens when they play an SEC team pic.twitter.com/ZD8NAzNe4g — Rodger Sherman (@rodger_sherman) September 24, 2016 Summary: Unnecessary, yet fun… up to a point. Like, point 58. But I don't want to judge. If you enjoy sitting down for 3 hours while your buddy defeats Mario Bros. on invincible STAR mode then this was the game for you. 5 stars, am I right? Though, if you find that particular act of "recreation" repulsive after no more than five minutes, you probably won't care much for what Saturday's exhibition had to offer. I fall somewhere in between. Hence, my 3 star rating. Visual Summary: (Third-string tight end punishes defender in 2nd quarter following first-career reception) What do you think?

Courtroom video shows Brice Rhodes repeatedly vowing to track down Louisville Judge Amber Wolf and her family. Rhodes was in court on charges of attacking and injuring one inmate in August, and spitting on another in September. Brice Rhodes is accused of killing three people. (Louisville Metro Corrections) "I'm gonna keep talking because I don't want to have to see you back here for this," Judge Wolf said during the tense exchange, which was captured on video obtained by WDRBand the Courier-Journal. "I don't care! I don't care!" Rhodes replies, according to the station. "Don't you think I'm gonna [expletive] find out where you live at? ... [expletive] I don't give a [expletive] about none of that! I didn't do [expletive]! I'll be out!" Armed Kentucky man preparing for doomsday at Walmart questioned "So you're saying you're going to find out where I live at?" the judge replied. "I don't give a [expletive] about none of that!" exclaimed Rhodes, who was strapped into a chair and wearing a faceguard. "You got family! I'll be out!" Rhodes threatened Judge Amber Wolf on Friday. (WHAS) "Okay," Wolf said. Rhodes will face charges of terroristic threatening and intimidating a participant in the legal process. Kentucky man stabs father during Sunday service at Baptist church He was already charged with killing 16-year-old Maurice Gordon and 14-year-old Larry Ordway in Shawnee in May. Their burned bodies were dumped behind an abandoned house, according to authorities. Judge Wolf kept her composure as she was being threatened. (WHAS) Detectives say Rhodes killed the teens so they wouldn't speak about his involvement in a prior shooting death. Judge Wolf, who stood firm against Rhodes, showed her compassionate side last month when she allowed an inmate to meet his 1-month-old baby for the first time in her courtroom. Earlier this year, Judge Wolf expressed outrage when a woman was brought into her courtroom without proper clothing. With News Wire Services Kentucky man tries to rob Chuck E.

(AMZN) Is Going to $1,000 Amazon stock is powered by the triumvirate of business: a legacy baseline, growthy projects and an all-time great leader By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Sep 27, 2016, 2:35 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Why Mobileye NV (MBLY) Stock Is a Buyout Lock 3 Absolutely Frightening Trends for Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Recent Posts: Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Is the Trump Boost Over? Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screeching to a Halt The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World View All Posts Since the dawn of the Internet Age in the mid-1990s, hundreds of dot-coms have come and gone. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. I’m completely on board with JPMorgan’s bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.

Wink -- the brand initially launched as an app for GE + Quirky products -- unveiled the second edition of its hub today. With a slimmer design and a faster processor, the Wink Hub 2 also has more memory and locally stored automations for quicker smart home reactions. Available starting in late October at Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon and on Wink's site, the Wink Hub 2 will sell for $100 (£75 or AU$130 converted). If you'd rather, you can still buy the original Wink Hub for $70 (or about £120 in the UK), and I'm glad to hear the company isn't phasing it out. Second-gen home hubs don't have a good track record. The Lowe's Iris smart home system ran into glitches -- and angry customers -- when it pushed everyone from its first-gen system to its second. Wink will let customers make the transition when they're ready, though the updated app that coincides with the new hub will have a tool to help you make the shift if you're already invested in the Wink system. The second SmartThings hub also disappointed with its confusing app and performance issues. With its primary competitors faltering, Wink could seize control of the hub market if its second hub avoids similar issues -- if there's any hub market remaining. The idea of controlling a smart home from a single platform is still enticing, but Apple, Google and Amazon are all making plays to do just that without a hub. Still, the Wink Hub 2 is checking the right boxes. It includes antennas to respond to just about any smart home device. Features Wi-Fi radio that supports 2.4 and 5GHz networks Ethernet port Bluetooth Low Energy radio Thread radio Support for Kidde Support for Lutron Clear Connect Z-Wave antenna Zigbee antenna The Hub will also store schedules and product-to-product triggers you create on its hard drive, which will hopefully make your smart home more responsive. We'll see if that's enough to help Wink stand with tech giants like Google, Amazon and Apple as the race for smart home control heats up.

TERRY AHNER/TIMES NEWS ‹ Prev 1 of 4 Next › Family store ends long run of serving customers By Terry Ahner tahner@tnonline.com For many Lehighton residents, it was a quick stop to pick up keys, screws and other household items. But, come 5 p.m. Friday, Lehighton Hardware will shut its doors for good after more than 90 years in business. Store co-owner Scott Griffith cited increased operating expenses, along with lower profit margins, rising taxes and increased competition as the primary reasons why the decision was made to close the store. Griffith, who lives in Chicago, co-owns the store with his two sisters, Jane, of Villanova, and Georgene, of Schnecksville. He said the fact that buyers purchase items online, along with the presence of Walmart and Lowe’s, were other factors that resulted in the decision. The store was once a mecca of business from the railroad workers and neighbors. Coal was delivered from the store. In the early days, the store held deeds for people, according to paperwork Griffith found in the store. Window repairs have given way to vacuum-sealed triple pane windows. House locks are becoming keyless entries. The store was basically breaking even over the last five years, said Griffith. “Is it disappointing? Absolutely. But you can’t justify breaking even every year,” Griffith said. “We feel sorry. We thank all the patronage over the years.” Griffith said his family is looking for someone to buy the building, which has been for sale for about a year, and added, “We do have some feelers out there.” Customers, such as John Muffley Sr. of Lehighton, wasted no time taking advantage of the store’s going-out-of-business sale. Muffley said he stopped by the store to pick up some paint, and added that he’ll miss “the store, the people.” So, too, will Carol Roth of Lehighton, who said she and her husband regularly frequented the store for various needs. “I was surprised,” Roth said. “My husband shops here for household items, and I shop for holiday items like lights and flags.” Clarence Getz of Franklin Township said he’s been a customer for years. “I had no idea,” Getz said. “You just keep hoping they will find a buyer.” Getz didn’t have to give it much thought as to what he’ll miss most about the store. “The people,” he said. “It’s personal, knowing the people.” The store has three employees, including manager Linda Guy, who will be retiring after 47 years. Getz said he feels for the employees who will have to look for work elsewhere. “It’s sad,” he said. “I know they were good people; it’s a shame to have it come to this.” The business was founded in 1923 as Lehighton Hardware, and was originally located on First Street (the site of the current Rite Aid store), owned by Mahlon Kistler. A fire destroyed that building in 1964, and the business was moved to its current location, at 116 S. Second St. Scott Griffith’s father, George, and his wife, Betty, purchased the store in 1972 after Mahlon Kistler died. Kistler was George Griffith’s stepfather. The store was then taken over by Scott Griffith and his two sisters in 1998. When Griffith was trying to decide if he should help with the store or go to college, his father pushed him toward college. He never came back. “I am so grateful and blessed that Dad worked hard to give us all an education.” Login or register to post comments PrintThis ShareThis American Flags Home News Classifieds Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries Sports Customer Service About Us Advertise Digital Guidelines Privacy Policy Photos Reproduction is prohibited without the express written consent of the Times News, LLC. © 2016

Bragg area to a growing number of communities across the country (NY, PA, NC, SC, VA, WA). Vietnam vet, Ex-POW, and activist, Ray Schrump sees potential to save many lives. Fayetteville, NC (PRWEB) September 27, 2016 The largest military base in the world will now be part of the regional NCServes Networ,k bringing together Raleigh, Durham and Fayetteville areas’ human service providers across the state to more effectively manage medical, financial, employment, housing and other resource requests from veterans and their families. This new network affiliate, known locally as NCServes RDU/Fayetteville, is the second of four launching statewide. It is part of the Institute for Veteran and Military Families (IVMF) at Syracuse University’s national portfolio of America Serves programs that has connected thousands of veterans, service members, and military families to more than 6,300 types of comprehensive services in less than two years. NCServes RDU/Fayetteville will enable local service members, veterans, and their families easy access—online or in person—to a comprehensive array of services, resources, and care organized specifically around their needs. By linking local providers, it is designed to ensure that positive and quality referrals are made throughout the “Triangle” region spanning Durham to Cumberland. The initiative is driven by a shared software platform that connects all participating federal, state, and non-profit veteran service providers allowing them to make, quick, smart referrals and track outcomes. NCServes RDU/Fayetteville then follows-up on the progress of requests, greatly reducing denial of services experienced by service members and veterans due to capacity or eligibility restrictions. “This would have saved lives, if we had something like this when I came back from Vietnam,” said retired Army Lt.Col. Ray Schrump. Now a leading veterans' advocate in Fayetteville, NC, then-Maj. Schrump was a Green Beret serving in the Vietnam War when he was captured in 1968. Released in 1973 after serving many grueling years as a POW, Lt.Col. Schrump has been a fierce advocate for veterans and has been active in the Fayetteville-area effort to launch the NCServes Network. The NCServes RDU/Fayetteville network is locally coordinated by the United Service Organizations of North Carolina (USO-NC) in partnership with IVMF. All software, trainings, and licenses are all provided at no cost to the North Carolina community thanks to generous support locally by the Walmart Foundation, the Leon Levine Foundation and The Foundation for the Carolinas. “For 75 years, the USO of NC has accomplished its mission of keeping America’s service members connected to family, home, and country, throughout their service to the nation by delivering innovative programs, morale-boosting services and leveraging key partnerships in the community,” said retired Army Lt.Col. John Falkenbury, President, USO of North Carolina.  “Serving as the Coordination Center for Fayetteville, the largest defense community in the world, and tying it into to our efforts in Raleigh, Durham and around the state will create a seamless provider network with “no wrong door.”” Individuals looking for services can engage the NCServes RDU/Fayetteville network four different ways: 1. By phone at the network’s toll-free number 1-800-459-8387 where they can speak with a qualified professional to secure a referral for services and the commitment for follow up. 2. Online via the NCServes website at NCServes.org. 3. In-person at the NCServes RDU/Fayetteville participating NCServes regional providers. 4. Via North Carolina’s State resource line: NC4Vets.com and (844) NC4-VETS “After 26 years in the Army, I’m proud to bring an effort like this home to Ft. Bragg, where it belongs,” said retired Army Colonel Jim McDonough, Managing Director of IVMF and a former Director of the New York State Division of Veterans’ Affairs. “After years of ground work with really dedicated partners, and working closely with NCDMVA Secretary Wilson, the Governor and the State of North Carolina, we are proud to see this initiative grow from Charlotte, to Raleigh/Durham, and now Fayetteville.” In November, NCServes Coastal will launch the network to the US Marine Corps and Air Force installations of the Carolina Coast, tying in to adjacent networks in South Carolina and Virginia.

Roosevelt during World War II for six key community organizations to come together and lift the morale of service members both on the Homefront and downrange.  This heritage of community networks has demonstrated a lasting impact on service members, veterans and their families.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Krystal Steinmetz Sep 27th 2016 12:08PM It's likely you're shelling out less money to pay for groceries than you have in the past. According to Business Insider, many of America's big supermarket chains are reducing their prices amid "ongoing food-price deflation and growing pressure" from the proliferation of discount grocery chains like German-owned discount chain Aldi. Although slashed prices at the grocer typically offer shoppers a reason to celebrate, it's not surprising that the grocery stores themselves don't seem as thrilled. The continued price cuts continue to squeeze profits and tug down company shares. RELATED: 10 supermarket traps you should always avoid: 11 PHOTOS 10 supermarket traps See Gallery 10 supermarket traps Large shopping carts According to Martin Lindstrom, the larger the shopping cart, the more likely you are to spend. The marketing consultant told The Consumerist, "We doubled their size as a test, and customers bought 19% more." Pleasing aromas and colorful sights Walking into a grocery store and smelling freshly baked goods and flowers, especially if you're in a good mood, is a surefire way to get you to throw a few unnecessary items into your cart as your begin shopping experience. Fresh produce first​ After you've already been tricked into picking up a loaf of bread or some flowers, supermarkets also get you by placing the produce in the front of the store. By doing this, they fool you into believing you're being healthier by shopping for fruits and veggies first so you won't feel bad if you decide to stock up on a few unhealthier snacks along the way to checkout, too. Mist on produce You may think the mist on fresh fruits and veggies is helping the produce, but in all actuality, it makes them rot faster. Also, be sure to shake off the access water before purchasing your produce -- the mist tends to add additional weight, making the price go up. Slow, boring music Have you ever wondered why most grocery stores play some sort of elevator music? It's because they want you to take your time while shopping. Many stores play music slower than the average heartbeat, so pop your headphones in and play upbeat music to combat this trick. 10-for-$10 promotions It's common to believe you're getting a great deal during a 10-for-$10 promotion, but say, if a can of beans was originally 87 cents, you're actually paying more versus buying 10 of the same cans when they aren't on "sale." Dairy being in the back of the store The reasoning behind the age-old trick of placing milk and other dairy products in the back of the store may surprise you. Although it forces you to walk through various aisles, the true reason is because trucks unload their shipments in the back of store, and since milk needs to be refrigerated immediately, the easiest place to keep it is in the back. More expensive items at eye level If you've ever wondered why all of the expensive items seem to be the most accessible, there's a reason behind that, too. Supermarkets place cheaper items on the lower and higher shelves and reserve the middle, or eyesight level, shelves for their most expensive products. Buying premium deli products Just because you are buying a seemingly fresh cut of meat or fish from the deli and paying a higher price, doesn't necessarily mean the product is of better quality. Often times, the meat was previously frozen meaning you may have to use it sooner than meat you would buy from the frozen section. Changing the layout of the store... often Don't get too comfortable with your local supermarket's layout. Markets believe that when a person remembers where there items they plan on buying are, they'll spend less time in the store and will ultimately spend less money.

In a price check last year, Business Insider found Aldi's prices were about 30 percent lower than Walmart's. To help prevent stores like Aldi from wooing their customers away with low prices, Business Insider says Kroger has decreased the cost of 1,000 popular grocery items in many of its stores. Dollar General, Trader Joe's and Walmart have also worked to slash prices this year. Aldi has 1,500 stores in the U.S. now, with plans to construct 500 more stores over the next two years. Lidl, another German-based discount supermarket chain, also plans to open up shop in the U.S. The company told Business Insider that it has plans to open stores in "dozens of cities" in the U.S. Where do you shop for groceries?

Available starting in late October at Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon and on Wink's site, the Wink Hub 2 will sell for $100 (£75 or AU$130 converted). If you'd rather, you can still buy the original Wink Hub for $70 (or about £120 in the UK), and I'm glad to hear the company isn't phasing it out. Second-gen home hubs don't have a good track record. The Lowe's Iris smart home system ran into glitches -- and angry customers -- when it pushed everyone from its first-gen system to its second. Wink will let customers make the transition when they're ready, though the updated app that coincides with the new hub will have a tool to help you make the shift if you're already invested in the Wink system. The second SmartThings hub also disappointed with its confusing app and performance issues. With its primary competitors faltering, Wink could seize control of the hub market if its second hub avoids similar issues -- if there's any hub market remaining. The idea of controlling a smart home from a single platform is still enticing, but Apple, Google and Amazon are all making plays to do just that without a hub. Still, the Wink Hub 2 is checking the right boxes. It includes antennas to respond to just about any smart home device. Features Wi-Fi radio that supports 2.4 and 5GHz networks Ethernet port Bluetooth Low Energy radio Thread radio Support for Kidde Support for Lutron Clear Connect Z-Wave antenna Zigbee antenna The Hub will also store schedules and product-to-product triggers you create on its hard drive, which will hopefully make your smart home more responsive. We'll see if that's enough to help Wink stand with tech giants like Google, Amazon and Apple as the race for smart home control heats up.

Starting September 27th, the first person to refer the most investors who join StartEngine by December 31st, 2016 will win a grand prize of $20,000 from StartEngine along with a free Elio Motors vehicle. Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) September 27, 2016 StartEngine, the leader in Online Public Offerings, today announced the launch of its innovative investor referral competition. Starting September 27th, the first person to refer the most investors who join StartEngine by December 31st, 2016 will win a grand prize of $20,000 from StartEngine along with a free Elio Motors vehicle. If the winner gets over 50,000 sign ups, StartEngine will double the cash and will give away $40,000. The launch of this competition follows on the heels of the recent Jet.com announcement. Their own contest winner, Eric Martin, received 100,000 Jet shares and is now set to be a millionaire after that company was acquired by WalMart in a $3.3 billion deal. “We are thrilled about launching the first referral competition in our industry as this will excite and engage all types of investors,” Howard Marks, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of StartEngine said. “Eric Martin is an investor. He made an investment as an ordinary person before the JOBS Act permitted people like him to invest. Today, everyone can too. With OPOs you can go on StartEngine and invest in emerging companies, although everyone may not have Eric’s luck. We need people like Eric to help us spread this message to the world.” This announcement comes after the new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) rules went into effect on May 16th, allowing companies on StartEngine to raise up to $1M. Companies on StartEngine were already raising up to $50M through Regulation A+. Both regulations allow accredited and non-accredited investors – the rest of the general population from middle class families, to hard working dads, to minorities – to invest easily in privately held companies for the first time in 80 years. Last February, StartEngine helped Elio Motors raise nearly $17M from 6,345 investor, 94% of which were non-accredited investors. “People can spread the word and invite their communities to join our momentum through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media channels” Co-Founder and CEO Ron Miller said. “Now that the world of finance has gone online, we are committed to providing solutions that will drive engagement from those looking to capitalize on meaningful investment opportunities, while driving funding to startups and emerging businesses. Our goal is to help entrepreneurs achieve their dreams, while also providing investment opportunities to everyone and through referrals, and, we feel we can accomplish this goal.”     StartEngine also recently announced the StartEngine Marketing Fund, which advances companies that list on StartEngine up to $50,000 to help them market and promote their crowdfunding campaigns. Another incentive program recently announced was StartEngine’s fee-free Small OPO program (under Reg CF). To learn more about the programs designed to help businesses reduce the cost of raising capital visit the StartEngine Blog. About StartEngine StartEngine is the leader in OPOs (Online Public Offerings), connecting Millennials and aspiring investors with tomorrow’s progressive companies. Based in Los Angeles, the company was created in 2013 by Howard Marks, co-founder of Activision, and Ron Miller.

Events Close Provided Coney Additional charge filed against man who exposed self to shoppers in Wal-Mart IAN RICHARDSON irichardson@siouxcityjournal.com Sep 27, 2016 (…) Coney Provided SIOUX CITY | A Sioux City man charged in August for exposing himself to female shoppers at Wal-Mart is facing an additional charge after police say he exposed himself to passengers on a city bus earlier that day.  According to court documents, 50-year-old Douglas John Coney boarded the Southern Hills bus around 5 p.m. Aug. 2. At the time, passengers observed that his pants were undone.  Documents say as he walked to his seat, Coney's pants were caught on a witnesses' stroller and fell down, exposing his genitals. Documents say Coney sat near three witnesses, who were accompanied by a 2-year-old child, for the 30-minute bus ride to the downtown MLK station. During the ride, documents say the witnesses observed Coney exposing his genitals and touching them three to five times during the trip. Witnesses told the bus driver, and Coney was kicked off the bus, according to documents.  Coney then proceeded to the Wal-Mart on Floyd Boulevard, where he was arrested around 5:30 p.m. for exposing himself to multiple female customers while riding around the store on an electric scooter. Coney pleaded not guilty last week to that charge.  Coney was charged Monday with an additional indecent exposure charge and is being held in the Woodbury County Jail on $5,000 bond.  Coney Provided More information Milford man charged with sexual abuse MILFORD, Iowa | A Milford man is facing a sexual abuse charge after authorities say he performed a sex act with an underage female earlier this year.

Majority Of Shoppers Using Amazon To Search For Products, Even If They Buy Elsewhere Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Majority Of Shoppers Using Amazon To Search For Products, Even If They Buy Elsewhere Image courtesy of Alan Rappa September 27, 2016 9:32 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's your shopping start? amazon shopping window shopping retail walmart survey For years we’ve talked about “showrooming” — the practice of going to a bricks-and-mortar retailer just to look at a product you intend to buy online, and now Amazon has apparently supplanted traditional search engines as the place for most Americans to begin their product hunt. Bloomberg reports on a recent survey from BloomReach, which found that 55% of 2,000 people surveyed visit Amazon first when searching for products, while 28% of shoppers turn to search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, as a starting point. The number of people window-shopping, if you will, on Amazon represents an 11% increase over the same survey results in 2015. “Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers,” Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach, tells Bloomberg. “Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices.” Last year, 44% of consumers began product searches with Amazon, while 34% started with search engines. Trips to physical retailers for browsing and comparison shopping continues to decline, the survey found, with just 16% of shoppers making trips to big box stores or mall, down from 21% last year. Those rates aren’t exactly welcome news for retailers like Walmart and Target, which have struggled in recent years to compete with Amazon. Still, Walmart’s recent $3 billion purchase of Jet.com could propel the company toward a more even playing field. The retailer also this year launched a $50/year free-shipping option called ShippingPass, to compete with Amazon’s $99/year (or $10/month) Prime membership that includes free two-day shipping on thousands of products. But ShippingPass and the addition of Jet.com to its portfolio might not be enough to help Walmart move past Amazon’s appeal, analysts says, noting that the e-commerce giant continues to add “layers” to its services. “Prime members have the Amazon app on the front screen of their smartphones. That definitely hurts Walmart,” John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge, told Bloomberg.

Unfortunately for pet parents, each tail wag, tug-of-war and cuddle session has a side effect, especially during fall shedding season. Fortunately, Eureka has the "pawfect" solution: The Ultimate Clean Pet Upright Vacuum (AS3451A). The Ultimate Clean Pet combines Eureka's popular deep-cleaning AirSpeed® Technology with a No-Tangle Brushroll™, Arm & Hammer Fresh Home Allergen Filter, a full suite of pet-hair-removing accessories and an extra-large dust cup so pet owners can clean longer -- and pick up more in a single pass -- all while worrying less about vacuum maintenance. "Maintaining a clean home with pets can be a challenge. Busy pet owners need an approachable, reliable solution that makes what once was a daunting task easy to accomplish," said Jillian Hillard, director of product marketing for Eureka. "With the new Ultimate Clean Pet, pet owners can feel confident that they have a dependable vacuum to whisk hair away quickly, and get them back to spending time with the people and pets they love." The Eureka Ultimate Clean Pet provides all the top features pet owners need at a great value, including: Superior suction: AirSpeed® Technology removes hair and debris from floors and furniture thanks to a more direct air path from the floor into the dust cup -- meaning less distance for dirt to travel. Self-cleaning brushroll: the No-Tangle Brushroll™ removes tangles with the press of a pedal to make maintenance easy and keep your vacuum running at peak performance. Simply press the patented Brushroll Clean™ pedal for about 10 seconds, and tangled hair and dirt are cut away from the brushroll and whisked into the dust cup. For deep cleaning on all floors, the brushroll also turns on for carpets and off to safely clean all hard floor surfaces. Effective hard floor pick-up: the Scatterproof Crumb Cleaner™ picks up debris without scattering it around the floor, guaranteeing a deep, confident clean. Cleaner, fresher air: the Arm & Hammer Fresh Home Allergen Filter reduces dust and allergens. Multisurface hair removal: the Pet Pal™ Cleaning Tools Plus removes pet hair from stairs, furniture and wherever pets might play using the on-board Pet Power Paw®, crevice tool and a dusting brush with plastic teeth to grab pet hair from hard-to-clean areas. "Whether cleaning carpets, bare floors or hard-to-reach areas, pet owners can trust that the Ultimate Clean Pet will provide the powerful, high-quality performance that makes cleaning and life easier," said Hillard. The Eureka Ultimate Clean Pet is available exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com for a suggested retail price of $178. For more information, consumers can visit eureka.com.

It's gimmicky, to be sure, but there's logic to it. Shirazi is CEO of a 140-person start-up called Radius and, at Salesforce.com's annual customer conference, he's promoting a brand new product designed to — wait for it — drive revenue. Radius' software collects and catalogs data on 18 million U.S. businesses to help companies focus their marketing campaigns. On Tuesday, the San Francisco-based company unveiled the Radius Customer Exchange (RCX), which enables corporations to get even more efficient and targeted with their promotions by going after customers of other brands. For example, as part of the launch, Sam's Club, the wholesale chain owned by Wal-Mart, has teamed with payment systems provider First Data, allowing the two companies to co-market products or create campaigns to reach clients of the other company. It's easy to imagine other collaborations. Car rental companies could partner with hotel chains to offer discounts to each other's customers. Insurers looking to expand in a particular region could join with a prominent telephone carrier or bank in the area. American Express is also one of Radius's launch partners. The accuracy of the data is one big differentiator between Radius and traditional corporate databases like Dun & Bradstreet. Because Radius is sitting on top of Salesforce's customer management systems, it's updated in real time, so doesn't suffer from the deficiencies of static corporate catalogs. "You're getting very warm leads from another brand," said Shirazi, who started Radius in 2009 and last year raised a $50 million financing round with funding from Salesforce Ventures. "Companies can work together to drive business for each other." The system works like a social network of sorts. A business can send a friend request to another company and if a match is agreed upon, they get a certain amount of time to analyze customer overlap before deciding if they want to move forward with a deal. Names and contact information of customers aren't shared, just general details about the number and types of matches. Radius is playing into a broader trend of software-based predictive marketing. Over $200 billion is spent annually on advertising in the U.S., according to eMarketer, often with companies hiring agencies for creative campaigns. But with improved tools available for companies to understand their own data, they can spend some of that money on software and cut down on their marketing and advertising costs. Source: Copyright© 2014 by Jakub Mosur Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, speaking at Dreamforce 2014. "These new platforms are really allowing companies to take customer engagement capabilities back in-house," said Ian Kahn, a partner at PwC Consulting and expert on the Salesforce platform. "These are business tools that are highly intuitive for our clients to adopt quickly and don't require huge levels of software development support to implement and maintain." At Oracle's OpenWorld conference earlier this month, Radius announced a partnership with the software giant to help customers of its marketing suite utilize more predictive outreach tools. But Dreamforce is a bigger deal for Radius. The company is a platinum sponsor, a distinction that comes with a $1 million price tag. Shirazi said all of his employees are likely to attend part of the event. Radius will be conducting several tutorials and take part in a session with PwC's Kahn and a Sam's Club representative discussing the new product. "We go all-in on Dreamforce," Shirazi said. For Radius, the conference climaxes with an invite-only party next Tuesday night, featuring a live musical performance by Daughtry. The event is being billed as the Radius VIP Grand Prix Party. Look for Shirazi in his racing gear.

And all wearing the warmest smiles on their faces and brightest twinkles in their eyes.  There was magic in the air of the old tin shack that night and it infected everyone there, even us stiff-upper-lipped Brits who had no idea what the Texan two-step was and were absolutely convinced we were far too reserved and dignified to even have a go. But as more magic drifted in with the late evening breeze, and the country music from the singer and guitarist duo infected every fibre of our beings, we were eager to accept when local after local stretched out their hands and invited us to dance. We were terrible two-steppers of course. But they didn’t mind. They led us around and made us smile and feel alive and breathless and downright happy to be there, grateful to be living in that moment. This was the 11th Street Cowboy Bar in the small town of Bandera, Texas, one of the many memorable finds on the Texas Ranger tour run by the British company Grand American Adventures. Spit and sawdusty and superb: The 11th Street Cowboy Bar in Bandera promises one of the most memorable nights of your life This ten-day holiday takes you on a loop around Texas - the second-largest American state after Alaska - starting and ending at Dallas, and taking in Austin, San Antonio, Big Bend National Park and San Angelo, with other stops in between.

Share this article Share 128 shares The first day to the Lone Star State (so-called because of the one star on its flag) was spent travelling to Dallas (flight not included) and checking in at the hotel, the Holiday Inn Express Central Market Place in Inwood Road, for the welcome meeting at 6pm. Here we met our guide for the trip, Emily, and our fellow travellers - in total six women and one man (who was travelling with one of the women) of varying ages from their 20s to 70s. Most of us were solo travellers but we already knew one other person as we were sharing twin-bed rooms, unless we had paid a ‘solo sleeper’ supplement of around £400 to get our own room for the duration of the trip. Day two was the proper start of the holiday and it began with one of the biggest events ever in human history, namely the fatal shooting of US President John F Kennedy on November 22, 1963. We were driven by Emily on our group’s mini-bus to the former School Book Depository in Dallas, from where Lee Harvey Oswald is said to have fired two fatal shots from the sixth floor. That floor has now been turned into a JFK museum, which takes you (via a set a headphones which you are handed at the entrance) from the start of the Sixties and Kennedy’s election to his presidency, assassination, aftermath and legacy. There is even an exact recreation of the piles of cardboard boxes Oswald is said to have hidden behind as he pointed his gun at JFK’s car. These boxes are cordoned off to the public but you can go up to the seventh floor and get the same view from the corner window that Oswald would have got of the President’s cavalcade as it approached. You can also see the grassy knoll, where some conspiracy theorists believe the shots actually came from. And the two white crosses in the middle of the road, which now mark the spots where each shot found its target. The former School Book Depository in Dallas. The sixth floor window where Lee Harvey Oswald is said to have shot JFK can been seen in the righthand corner, second floor from top. Victim and accused: President John F. Kennedy (left) and Lee Harvey Oswald, who was also assassinated Wandering around inside and outside the museum took up the entire morning and then we had a three-hour drive to Austin, the capital of Texas. As we drove out of Dallas we drove over the white crosses where JFK was shot - and my spine tingled. It was a surreal experience. Maybe because Texas is so big (268,820 square miles - 696,200 sq km - compared with Britain’s paltry 94,058 sq miles - 243,609 sq km) it likes to think it does most things bigger and better than other places. And that is certainly true of its Capitol building in Austin - which is even larger than the Capitol in Washington DC. But whatever you do don’t call Texas’s version pink - macho Texans will get very cross apparently. Despite appearances, its colour is actually ‘sunset red’, explained our guide on the free tour. Pink or red? While Texas’s Capitol building in Austin (above) looks a dusky pink to some people, Texans insist it is in fact ‘sunset red’ in colour There’s a lot to do in Austin - Soco (South Congress district) and Sixth Street have the best places to eat and plenty of interesting arty shops to mooch around and buy gifts. There’s Hope Outdoor Gallery, a very colourful space for public art, where anyone can spray-paint what they like (at the moment there are quite a few profanities about the presidential candidates), and Mount Bonnell, Austin’s highest point, which has glorious views across the city. But perhaps my favourite haunt was the Whip In - a really cool bar-cum-Indian fusion restaurant-cum-grocery store just a five-minute walk away from the hotel we stayed in (the Best Western Plus on South Interstate 35). Just walk out of the hotel and turn left. From the outside it doesn’t look like anything much, and inside it’s a bit spit-and-sawdusty, but the staff and meals and amazing. A great, cheap spot for lunch or dinner. I ate a delicious Chana Dal (roasted sweet potatoes, charred tomatoes and red peppers stewed with yellow lentils and spices) for just $8.25 (£5.65). The glass of Sauvignon Blanc to wash it down with was $9 (£6). Around 15 minutes after sunset there is free and amazing entertainment in central Austin in the form of 1.5million Mexican free-tailed bats that live under the Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge and emerge every evening from March to November. It’s like a giant bat cloud filling the sky. You can watch this natural phenomenon from the Austin-American Statesman park on the southeast side of bridge or from on the bridge itself. Afterwards walk around 20 minutes to Rainey Street to find some bars with live music. Most of the bars are actually bungalows that have been converted into bars, with benches in the gardens and lights strewn about outside. Very hip and pretty and cool. Around a 90-minute drive from Austin is San Antonio, the scene of day four’s adventure and the eighth largest city in the US. It is also the scene of the Battle of the Alamo - made famous in modern times by the John Wayne epic western The Alamo. During this pivotal battle in 1836, all of the Texian defenders of the Alamo mission - including Davy Crockett - were killed by Mexican troops but the cruelty of the latter inspired many other Americans to join the Texian Army, which defeated the Mexicans later that year, ending the revolution and cementing Texas’s place as an American state. You can wander around the mission itself, which has a gigantic gift shop as large as the main attraction - a great place to buy presents for people back home. The Alamo now, where Davy Crockett and around 250 fellow Texians were killed in the pivotal 1836 battle From history books to the big screen: John Wayne (centre) as Davy Crockett in his epic western The Alamo Close by is San Antonio’s extremely pretty river walk - a network of walkways along the banks of the San Antonio River, just below street level. This charming pedestrian area is lined with bars, shops and cafes and looks a more like Venice rather than a cowboy city in Texas. We took a boat trip along the network of waterways for $10 (£6.80), which among other things showed us the building with gargoyles on top that was used in the original Ghostbusters film. In the evening, Emily discovered that a local baseball team, the San Antonio Missions, were playing at home, so we paid $14 (£9.60) a ticket to go and watch them. Things started positively. I was downstairs buying an ice cream when the national anthem was played. Everyone without exception stopped what they were doing, put their right hand on their left breast and sang. It was a very moving moment. Then when my ice cream arrived it was in an upturned plastic baseball cap. Cute. The Missions’ mascot - a green jalapeno in a blue jacket - kept us entertained with games and songs during the (many) breaks. But after a couple of hours, the Missions were losing 8-0, and even though we didn’t quite understand how the scoring worked, we knew it was bad and there wasn’t much point staying to the end. So we left the Missions to their Loser-ville fate. Hotting things up: The Missions’ mascot, a green jalapeno, keeps the crowds entertained despite his baseball team’s dire performance The next day it was also time to leave city life for country and we drove 90 minutes to the Silver Spur Guest Ranch in Bandera County. On the way we stopped at a Walmart superstore to buy some snacks and noticed that it sold rifles for $278 (£190) alongside the crisps and sodas. You can only buy a gun if you are 18 - and the ammunition if you are 21. Silver Spur is a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of urban life. This is real cowboy land. Each room is named after a famous American cowboy - mine was Kit Carson and was a charming mix of flowery eiderdowns, wooden panelling and brick floors. After a home-cooked lunch of spaghetti bolognese it was time for a horse ride around the surrounds. Cowboy country: The Silver Spur Ranch in Bandera County, which offers horse rides, camp fires, hay-wagon rides, s’mores and more One of the ‘bad boys’: A horse at Silver Spur, which despite the moniker and my whingeing are gentle to guests I was promised that my horse, who was called Blackie because he was black (I wonder how long it took to think of that name) was a ‘real darling, a sweetheart’. I was not told he had a penchant for biting the bottom of the horse in front of him, causing that horse to kick up a leg or two, much to his rider’s disgust. At one point Blackie also showed a penchant for galloping even though he was meant to keep to a walk (I am very much a beginner rider) and I was worried I was going to fall off, and regretted my choice not to wear a riding hat. At the time it had seemed so freeing and rebellious. After an hour or so of this fun, it was a joy to sit in the ranch’s very big swimming pool and simply do nothing but breathe. Very deeply. That night was our soiree to the 11th Street Cowboy Bar. When we walked in the front door we were greeted by a group of men at the bar and hundreds of signed bras hanging from the ceiling. I decided there and then that mine was staying firmly on. It was a new M&S model and it wasn’t cheap. Everyone wanted to know where we were from, what had brought us to Bandera and a million other questions. The booze was cheap - about $11 (£7.50) for two wines and a beer - then the music started and we moved to the dance hall at the back. Tradition or bust: Some of the bras dangling from the ceilings and walls of the main bar in the 11th Street Cowboy Bar Our arrival caused quite a stir and we were asked if we’d like to join in several of the dances and even do the percussion to one of the songs. Apparently the tough macho men of Texas are taught how to do the Texan two-step when they are at school - and being able to dance extremely well is a source of great pride to them. They start off dancing with their wives then they gradually move on to the other women in the hall, so no one gets missed out - with all the woman wanting to dance with the two or three best male dancers in particular. It’s kind of like Strictly Come Dancing meets Wife Swap, Country and Western style. But there is no point scoring and no arguments - just lots of happy faces and an atmosphere of great joy and love. And this happens three times a week, week in, week out, regular as clockwork. Back at the ranch we admired the billion gazillion stars kissing the night sky. It’s easy to see why cowboy life has been so romanticized over the years - this form of it, at least, is very romantic. The next morning was free for us to wander around the ranch, have another horse ride if we wished, go fossil digging in the fossil pit or laze by the pool. After a lunch of burgers and chips, some of us headed back to Bandera in the afternoon to see what the town looked like by day. There were lots of Harley Davidsons, lots of cowboy-style men, and a sign that proclaimed Bandera to be the ‘Cowboy Capital of the World’. This has something to do with the fact in that in the old days it was a staging area and known for its supplies and recreation as well as rodeos. Modern-day cowboys: Some locals of Bandera, which declares itself to be the ‘Cowboy Capital of the World’ Back on the ranch, and after a dinner of brisket, cheesy potatoes and courgettes and red peppers, we were treated to a ‘hay wagon ride’ - ie sitting on bales of hay on a truck-driven trailer - by a local ‘cowboy’ called David to see Texas longhorn cattle and their calves and other wildlife, including jackrabbits and deer. Then after the sun set we were taken to a smouldering firepit to make s’mores - so called because after eating one you always want some more - where we poked marshmallows on metal prongs and partially melted them in the flames then sandwiched them between chocolate and biscuits called Graham crackers, while telling ghost stories. David had plenty of other stories to tell and clarified that the traditional Texas greeting is both ‘hey y’all’ and ‘howdy y’all’… even if you are just speaking to one person. So now y’know. Day seven was mostly taken up with a seven-hour drive to Big Bend National Park. The trip was made quicker by Emily playing us The Alamo on the bus’s DVD player and broken by a stop at the park’s visitor centre. There we were shown a short film on how the park only receives 18 inches of water a year. We emerged to a downpour that was so fierce we had to stay in the centre until it had stopped and could get in the bus without getting washed away. Big Bend, which is situated in far west Texas on the US side of the Mexican border, is named after a big bend in the Rio Grande river which runs through the park - 1,000 square miles of protected desert, statuesque mountains, fields of cacti, and wildlife, including 500 species of birds. This is the Texas of western films - dusty, barren and beautiful. It is also where dinosaurs used to roam long before cowboys decided to call it home. Pretty prickly: Big Bend National Park is home to cacti, mountains, desert and wildlife Mighty: The limestone rocks of the national park have formed a majestic landscape Memorable: The sunset seen from the Chisos Mountain Lodge, where our group stayed while in Big Bend We stayed at the remote Chisos Mountain Lodge, where there were no TVs in the room but a gorgeous sunset to look at every night from the restaurant and its outside bar area and a stunning mountain next door. Meals weren’t included but a dinner of chicken breast or stuffed Portobello mushroom was around $20 and very tasty. More stunning mountain scenery was to be had the next day thanks to the river carving its way through the limestone to create a canyon through the desert - and the fact we were canoeing on it. After an hour and a half drive we split into pairs and gingerly got ourselves into shallow-wide boats (the type least likely to sink). It was only then that my partner told me about their fear of water. This made me feel scared. However, for most of the three hours or so we were paddling, we were only in a foot or so of slow-flowing water as it was the shallowest time of year (May). In fact instead of the Rio Grande it was more like the Rio Petit and the canoes got grounded in several places, with our guide having to drag them into the (slightly) deeper water each time. But the slow nature of our journey gave us plenty of time to enjoy the scenery, with the USA on one side, and Mexico on the other. River (not so) deep: Our guides get our canoes ready for our paddling adventure on the Rio Grande We were meant to have a hike in the afternoon but the weather got far too hot for more exercise. This is why the tour only runs in the spring and winter - in the summer, temperatures in Big Bend reach an average high of 94F (34.5C) and often get much hotter. Instead we drove to various beauty spots and took photos then headed to the lodge. Day nine was mostly a day of driving away from Big Bend and to San Angelo, where our destination was a brothel, namely Miss Hattie’s Bordello. This innocent-looking home used to belong to the Hattons but when they divorced in the early 20th century, he kept the downstairs as a saloon and she kept the upstairs and turned into a brothel. It is now a jeweller’s and a museum, the entry price of which is just $6 (£4) per person for a guided tour. We heard about Miss Mable who kept her child’s cot in her room, Miss Blue, who had a peephole in the door between her bedroom and the only bathroom in the house, and Miss Kitty, who inherited a ranch from one of her customers, and many more tales of the women who inhabited the bordello until 1952 when the Texas Rangers shut it down. ‘Surrender’: Miss Blue’s room, complete with a ‘Surrender’ picture on her dressing table, at Miss Hattie’s Bordello in San Angelo Luckily our own accommodation for our last night was far more salubrious - the Hampton Inn on the outskirts of San Angelo, and there were definitely no peepholes in the en-suite bathrooms. Suddenly, or so it seemed, it was our last day, and after a four-hour drive we were in Fort Worth, the fifth largest city in Texas and known for its museums. Its shops are also worth a look - there are plenty of cowboy hat and boot stores and you can buy a pair of decent cowboy boots for around $100 to $200 (£70 to £140) instead of the $300-plus (£210-plus) they cost in Austin’s trendy shops. We had a cheap lunch at the White Elephant Saloon, where a burger cost $5.08 (£3.50) and a hot dog $2.77 (£1.90), before heading to Billy Bob’s Texas, a huge country music venue, with an indoor rodeo arena, mechanical bulls and dozens of bars, that has played host to some of the biggest names in country and pop. A short bus journey later and we were back in Dallas and most of the group headed to the airport but I decided to stay an extra night. There was one last place I wanted to see that was not on the holiday agenda but was on my personal agenda - Dallas. To clarify - Southfork, the ranch where the hit TV soap Dallas was filmed from 1978 to 1991 and 2012 to 2014.   Dallas in Dallas: Southfork today - the ranch where the soap opera dramas of Dallas were played out in the former TV series The late Larry Hagman, who played JR in the hit TV soap Dallas and who died in 2012 after a cancer battle After getting a taxi to the ranch, which is north of the city, I paid my $15 (£10.50) entrance fee and started at the visitors’ centre museum, which included a homage to the late Larry Hagman including the fake pistol used to shoot his character JR in 1980.  Then a tractor train took me and other visitors through the grounds, past JR, Miss Ellie and Jock Ewing's ‘graves’ to mansion.  After admiring Miss Ellie's breakfast table where many a family argument was had, and Bobby's ‘Olympic-sized’ swimming pool (which is actually very small and was filmed with a giant mirror at the end), you go inside the ranch to its Dallas themed rooms (the indoors scenes were filmed in California. Upstairs is JR and Sue Ellen's bedroom and a balcony where you get a good view of the ranch. Afterwards you can wander the grounds at will. As I caught my flight home (direct trips between Dallas and London are around nine hours) I was still dancing - not with my body this time, granted, but with my mind, as thoughts of cowboys, stars, heroes, campfires, deserts, mountains, country music and JR swirled around and around.

The hater: When Drunk History’s Derek Waters specifically requested to do another HateSong interview, we couldn’t deny him. His last one, on Train’s “Hey Soul Sister,” was delightful, and Drunk History—which returns for its fourth season Tuesday, September 27—is one of the best shows Comedy Central currently offers. This time around, Waters went for slightly higher-hanging fruit, though his takedowns are just as fierce. The hated: American Authors, “Go Big Or Go Home” (2016) Derek Waters: Thanks so much for having me back. The A.V. Club: Of course. We don’t get a lot of requests for this one, so I’m glad you asked. DW: Really? I don’t get it. There are so many songs that I hate. AVC: The one you picked this time is certainly very hateable. DW: Had you heard it before? AVC: I hadn’t, but I have heard American Authors’ other big single, “Best Day Of My Life.” DW: [Sings.] “It’s gonna be the best day of my life.” That one? AVC: That’s the one. But enough about that dumb song. How did you pick “Go Big Or Go Home”? DW: Well, I don’t want to say it, but nothing’s going to beat “Soul Sister.” This is just another area at the garbage dump. But it’s still a big garbage dump. I like to put shitty music on my Pandora when I’m rushing to work, so I want to get out of the car. [“Go Big Or Go Home”] was on one of my shitty Pandora stations, and it was like, “Wait, I paid for Pandora so I don’t have to hear advertising”—I thought it was a hot wings commercial or something. First of all, when the song kicks in—and when I say “kicks in,” I mean “unfortunately continues”—it sounds like “Cotton Eye Joe.” I don’t want to date myself, but you remember that Rednex band that did “Cotton Eye Joe”? It’s got the same sound. It’s also promoting being passed out on the floor. I just always thought “Go Big Or Go Home” was a commercial campaign for something. I don’t know why there would be a need to say “Go Big Or Go Home,” especially in a song. It’s just a great waste of time. But I was trying to look at it, like, with an open mind. Maybe he’s talking about heaven. Maybe he’s saying, “Maybe you’ve just got to go big before you go home.” I don’t know how deep they thought about it, though. It’s just an example of why I get upset when people say Americans are stupid. What do you think we’re going to be like if we hear this song over and over again? I haven’t been to a bar in a while, but I’m going to assume college bars have this playing every night. AVC: This is one of those situations where you feel like the song was written specifically so it could be featured in commercials. There’s no way American Authors feels like this is a message they just had to get out in the world. DW: “When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was to be a musician. I lost everything I had, but I just knew that someday I’d be able to tell the world to ‘go big or go home.’ The world needs to know.” You know, “Let It Be,” then “Imagine,” then “Go Big Or Go Home.” I think that’s the order of importance. Anyway, let’s analyze these lyrics. “Don’t feel like going home / But all my cash is gone”—okay, relatable. “I got nothing to do tonight / I’m passed out on the floor”—well, clearly you did something. He’s “up at the hotel bar” and then it doesn’t matter because “I’m feeling fine.” So he’s “passed out on the floor… up in the hotel bar,” but then he says, “I think life’s too short / it’s passing by”? Go home! I don’t mean that like I’m singing the song. I mean, if life is too short, get off the floor at the hotel bar. How can you go big if you’re on the floor? I don’t understand it. It’s mixed messages. “I gave the dice a roll…” Oh, by the way, one thing that blew my mind, is that seven people wrote this song. Seven people. Coincidence? I mean, I’m not going to say it, but I’ll just set it up. How many deadly sins are there? Seven. “Then we lost control.” So now there’s more than one person. “You know we’re lucky that we’ve survived.” Survived what? Growing up with mom and dad’s money? AVC: Drinking on the floor of a hotel bar. DW: I’m sure it’s the W. AVC: They won’t let you get too crazy there. DW: Oh, they don’t? That’s the only hotel I’ve ever heard of. AVC: Honestly, I’m just guessing. Anyway, then it goes, “Oh man, that boat, it flipped.” DW: “’Cause we jumped the ship / Oh man, that boat, it flipped / But we should do it all again tonight.” Then he sings “life’s too short,” but life’s a lot shorter if you listen to this song. My life is definitely shorter now, listening to this song. I picture a bunch of red Solo cups and people who are basically animals dancing to this. Listen to this third verse: “Giving my body all the things I need / Rescue me with a little whiskey / Staying out, don’t need no sleep / I’ll sleep when I’m dead, you can bury me.” That’s sweet. We’re allowed to bury him. This is where I think it’s about heaven: “I guess I’m going home / ’Cause all my cash is gone.” So we go to heaven when we lose all our money? “I spent it all trying to feel alive.” This shit is deep. The last verse, “It’s getting crazy / We’re going to do some things we won’t forget / Go big or go home / I’m going crazy / I’m going to live my life, I got no regrets.” Why don’t you listen to what you just sang? So yeah, my anger isn’t as strong as “Soul Sister,” but what really frustrates me about this song is that it’s one of those algebraic tracks that can get stuck in your head within two seconds. Also, knowing that people are having this filtered into their brains. Let’s be honest: People need to be happy, and if this song makes them happy, that’s cool. I’m just confused. I feel like we all have a voice, but it’s like, “You’re taking your chance to use your voice to say ‘go big or go home’?” I don’t get it. It seems like it’s advertising for the bar that you’re in. Bars must have paid these guys to write this song. “Blow your money or leave. Give us all your money or leave. Stay here until you’re gone.” So many times, it says, “Because all my cash is gone.” I feel like they’re in with Wells Fargo or something. What would be the goal of this song? What do you think? AVC: I’m not sure. Knowing the title, it doesn’t seem like it should be about blowing money drinking and then being sad about it. It seems like he should be singing about how life is more than this or some other bullshit metaphor. He says he has no regrets, but it seems like he has some. DW: Right. “I spent it all trying to feel alive.” I do partake in a couple of drinks now and again, but I’ve never drank to feel alive. “I woke up on the floor! God, I feel alive. I don’t have any money, but man, this bruise on my forehead is really cool.” AVC: That sounds like a young-person thing. It’s cool if you’re 16, but when you’re 35, and you wake up on the floor, you think, “I don’t feel great about what just happened.” DW: Right. But also, if you’re younger, you shouldn’t be spending all your cash at a bar. But you’re right. This is the same kind of music that’s in commercials. It could be about an iPod or something. It sounds like it was made in hopes to get a commercial or get a company behind it. AVC: When I was prepping for this interview, I read that American Authors opened the Wal-Mart shareholders conference this year. DW: Jackpot. There you go. There’s your culprit. “We’re kind of a homegrown band. We do little shows for Wal-Mart.” Oh, that’s so sweet of you. If they’re opening for Wal-Mart, I think that speaks for itself. I mean, I’m sure they’re all very sweet guys. AVC: They live in Brooklyn now, apparently. They seem like a weird band to live in Brooklyn, but sure, why not? DW: Exactly. This band has taught us that it’s going to be the best day of our lives, but also that we have to go big or go home. So that’s a mixed message. AVC: What do you think American Authors means? DW: I don’t know, but it’s probably not what it sounds like. It’s very pretentious. I think maybe they’re trying to say they’re Americans? When people say Americans are dumb, this music isn’t helping. This isn’t helping anybody. I don’t understand what the positives are. Maybe they’ll get a 7-Eleven deal with Big Gulps. AVC: That would be a good tie-in for them. DW: Am I wrong that 7-Eleven or some places like that say, “You gotta go big,” because you’ve got to get a three-gallon Slurpee? You don’t want to just have a small Slurpee. You’ve got to go big. AVC: They could put this song in a commercial for a Carl’s Jr. burger that has three patties and pulled pork on top or something dumb. DW: “Go big or go home!” This is the most I’ve ever said “go big or go home.” Oh! It could be Dave & Busters, too. Something like that. It feels like chicken wings and college basketball playing in the background. AVC: Right, like you’re going to order the appetizer plate you split with the table, because why not? Go big or go home. DW: “You guys want regular seating, good seating, or do you want to go big? Because if you don’t go big, you’ve got to go home.” I can definitely picture a bunch of shots being taken during this. We have to try and find something positive about this song. AVC: Did you watch the video? DW: The video, I was impressed by. I thought it was a really cool animation. They made a very cool video. AVC: There we go. It looks nice. DW: Great video. Just turn off the volume. Great video, if you don’t have sound. Can you ask me maybe one more question? AVC: Let’s see, what other questions do I have here… DW: Have I ever gone big? Have I ever not been able to go big, and had to go home? AVC: Have you ever told anyone on Drunk History to go big or go home? DW: I can humbly say I’ve never done that. “Hey, man, if you’re going to do this, you’ve got to go big or go home.” I’m proud of myself that I’ve never told someone to do that. It’s very aggressive. “Hey, man, I can’t go big. I don’t have any money. Now I have to leave, because I don’t have any money.” Come on, guys. Not everyone is wealthy like you. You don’t need money to go big. AVC: You can make your own alcohol and end up on a hotel floor. DW: Did you like how he sings, “with a little bit of a whiskey,” and then they use the tuner thing where their voice goes up? AVC: Yep. Auto-Tune. DW: It actually made me want to quit drinking. This is what it’s come to. AVC: That would be a funny genesis for your sobriety. DW: This actually might be a great time to get kids not to drink. “Hey, son, I want you to listen to this song. This is what happens when you drink. You like this kind of music.” That being said, you and I both know that we could hear this song in a bar and if we were having a really good time, it would be cheating music, like those anthems that are easy to sing along to, and there’s nobody that doesn’t want to sing with somebody else. This song is going to bring people together. It’s where “We Are The World” left off. Remember last year when you found out that “Hey Soul Sister” was about Burning Man? Would you do a quick search? AVC: I did, but there wasn’t a ton of information out there about this song. The internet was woefully thin this time around. DW: Is it bad that I’m doing an obscure one? AVC: No, it’s fine. Here’s something: American Authors’ band name used to be The Blue Pages, and they’re from Boston. There are four guys in the band, and this is off their second album. DW: Blue Pages? Is that a reference to Yellow Pages? AVC: I guess they stuck with the book theme when they went with the new band name. DW: They love books. They’re American authors. This is what an American author is. AVC: What American authors do you think they are? Salinger? DW: Probably Salinger. Probably Poe. Imagine someone who’s 13 and in their English class. They have to Google, because they need to find an American author to write a book report on, and they come across these guys. They’re like, “These are my favorite American authors.” I just like imagining. Did you see there were seven writers? AVC: I wonder if all four guys in the band are included in that seven. DW: Like you said, it’s an organized band, so I bet it’s the people that formed the group. AVC: Yeah, it’s four of the guys in the band, and then three other randos, all of whom have probably made so much money off American Authors’ success. DW: Oh my god, I’m sure. Like you said, the commercials. AVC: “Best Day Of My Life” has been played over 115 million times on YouTube, which is nuts. Who’s choosing to listen to that song not as part of the ad campaign that they are already watching? DW: I would say it’s a lot of people that don’t think they’re going to have a good day, so they need to crank that to be like, “This is going to be the best day of my life.” I’m sure they’re great guys. I’m just not into the song.

Officer Jeremy Taggart went to Walmart, 1815 East Highland Drive, around 1 p.m. Sunday about the case. Taggart spoke to Logan Burnett, who works in the loss prevention department.  Burnett told police that the three suspects walked into the store, picked up 21 pre-paid Visa cards worth $500 each.  "Burnett went on to say that the suspects divided the pre-paid cards amongst themselves and approached a new cashier," Taggart said. "Once contact was made, the suspects took turns deceiving the cashier into believing that the suspects paid for the cards." The suspects would slide their debit cards to buy the pre-paid cards, but would hit cancel soon after not allowing the transaction to go through, Taggart said.  Once the debit card transaction was canceled, the suspects told the cashier just to hit cash on the register, Burnett told police.  The suspects later left in possibly a white Chevrolet Malibu, police said.  Anyone with information on the case can call Jonesboro Crimestoppers at 935-7867.

The new store formats will emphasize product quality, improve lighting and add refrigerator space for more fresh produce, the German discounter said in a statement Monday. The company also disclosed that rising sales have been at the expense of lower earnings, amid an intensely price competitive market. “The U.K. price war continues to rage on, but we are prepared to ride out the storm,” Matthew Barnes, chief executive officer of Aldi U.K. and Ireland, said on a call with reporters. “We will cut prices further if necessary.” While cutting prices on 30 percent of its products so far this year, Aldi has also won favor with more affluent Brits, who have cast aside stereotypes of Aldi as a place where only hard-up consumers shop. The price war, sparked by Aldi and rival discounter Lidl, has seen profits tumble at larger rivals such as Tesco Plc, while Wal-Mart Stores Inc’s U.K. chain Asda posted its worst-ever sales decline this year. In chasing more upmarket shoppers, Aldi is following Lidl’s lead. Its rival began shedding its no-frills image last year by developing stores with wider aisles and baby-changing facilities. Aldi’s reformatted stores will have new fixtures and better signs, seeking to capitalize on growth in sales of alcohol and diapers, where the retailer’s Mamia brand is Britain’s second biggest-seller. It plans to open 70 new outlets next year in the U.K. The retailer has spent about 1.7 billion pounds over the past five years on its U.K. store expansion and according to Bruno Monteyne, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, Aldi’s proposed store changes “won’t be cheap.” Same-store sales in that market has slowed recently, Barnes said. Having doubled revenue in three years, Aldi said 13.9 million U.K. households now shop at its stores. Its share of Britain’s grocery market has risen to a record 6.2 percent as the country’s big four supermarkets -- Tesco, J Sainsbury Plc, Asda and Wm Morrison Supermarkets Plc -- have all seen their market share dwindle. Sales in 2015 increased 12 percent to 7.7 billion pounds, while operating profit fell 1.8 percent to 256 million pounds, the second straight drop. Despite Aldi’s stated commitment to its U.K. growth, two consecutive years of falling profit have some analysts questioning the feasibility of its expansion plans. The discounter is present in 18 countries globally, some of which may now offer more lucrative opportunities than the U.K. market. “I don’t see them getting there,” Monteyne said of Aldi’s plans to operate from 1,000 U.K. stores by 2022. “They are rational and their returns will be too low to warrant that kind of investment.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo by Roberto Rodriguez Schnucks union grocery workers voted Monday to authorize a strike and reject a proposed three-year contract that they say could cut 133 full-time jobs, threatens health benefits and offers wage increases that do not keep up with the cost of living. Of the 2,194 Schnuck Markets employees who are members of United Food and Commercial Workers Local 655 and voted, 1,934, or 89 percent, rejected Schnucks’ proposed contract. More than 4,500 Schnucks employees are in the union. A strike, if the union decides to pursue it, won’t happen immediately. The union wants to use the strike vote to continue bargaining with Maryland Heights-based Schnucks until the company changes the contract terms or negotiations break down. Union leaders hope to return to the bargaining table this week. Before employees can go on strike, the union has to give the company five days’ notice, according to a termination agreement between the parties. “What was represented today, and is very evident by the vote, was not acceptable on any front,” said David Cook, president of Local 655, of the contract proposal after Monday’s vote. “This seems typical of the 1 percent mentality that were dealing with in America today.” Union leaders point out that the proposal increases employees’ share of health care coverage, threatens health care for part-time employees and lowers employer pension contributions for new employees. In an emailed statement Monday, Schnuck Markets Chairman and CEO Todd Schnuck called Monday’s union gathering a “PR stunt to get attention” and said his company was disappointed that union leadership was pursuing a “vote no” campaign. The company’s goal, the statement said, is “to deliver a proposal that meets the needs of our teammates while keeping our business competitive against nonunion grocers and stores that sell food, and this includes some of the world’s largest companies.” The company, in a statement after the vote, said it plans to meet "with 655 leadership for what we expect to be productive and meaningful discussions," but offered no details on any scheduled talks. Schnuck pointed to superstores, like Walmart, that are selling groceries. He said Schnucks is the largest of four union grocers in the St. Louis area, but there are also 16 nonunion grocers. The proposal includes bonuses of $600 for full-time employees, including department managers, and $300 for part-time employees. But union leaders say that’s not enough, given that the employees in question haven’t had raises since November. Union leaders don’t believe the company’s proposed increased health care contributions are enough to maintain the current level of benefits. The contract also increases weekly health care deductions for all employees. Another proposal the union opposes would affect pension contributions for new employees. Schnucks would give 40 cents an hour in pension contributions for employees hired in 2017 and beyond. Current employees receive 89 cents, but Schnucks would increase that to $1.12 an hour for existing employees. The union also points to a provision that would reduce the scheduled hours reserved for full-time employees from 55 percent to 45 percent. The union estimates that would lead to 133 fewer full-time jobs. Part-time employees hired in 2010 and after would have maximum vacation time of two weeks a year, when they previously could earn up to five weeks. The contract would increase the weeks when no employee can take vacation to four from three. Under the proposed contract, employees could also be moved around to different departments. Members heard from union leaders about what’s in the contract proposal and participated in a question-and-answer session before voting. The short time that employees had to make a decision worried some union members who wanted more time to read the proposal. The contract proposal was presented to union leaders Thursday, but most employees didn’t see it until Monday. Brad Hunt works about 25 hours a week as a checker at the Maryland Heights Schnucks on Dorsett Road. He has worked at Schnucks for less than a year. This was his first time being part of a union. Within minutes of the meeting’s start time, he was flipping through the contract, trying to figure out what it meant. “It’s just a dense document,” he said. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Who's hired? Check our People in Business What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid Prior to the meeting, Hunt said he received texts from the union telling him to “just vote no.” “I feel like I’m being bombarded with information,” he said. Collin Reischman, a union spokesman, said the union arranged the meeting this way because thousands of workers assembling for a vote sends a more powerful message to Schnucks. In the past, the union has mailed contracts to employees and waited weeks for mailed ballots. “When we believe a contract is as bad as this is, we want to have them here to talk about it,” Reischman said of the members. Margaret Watkins, who has worked at Schnucks since 2008 and is a checker at the Bridgeton Schnucks on St. Charles Rock Road, said she doesn’t want to go on strike. She considers her customers to be like her family. “I’m not vengeful toward Schnucks,” she said. “But then again, I’m trying to look out for myself and my co-workers.” The last time grocery workers went on strike in St. Louis was in 2003, when 10,000 employees conducted a strike and lockout that disrupted operations at 97 grocery stores in Missouri. Local 655, Schnucks’ largest union, also has several thousand employees at Dierbergs and Shop ’n Save. Only Schnucks employees were voting Monday night at the Family Arena in St. Charles. Privately held Schnuck Markets operates 99 stores in five states and has $2.7 billion in annual revenue. The grocer said Local 655’s contract covers Schnucks employees in 52 St. Louis area stores in Missouri. Lisa Brown of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.

He was even able to purchase the device and quickly shot an unboxing video to share online, offering a detailed look at the Android TV player. But the biggest news is here is definitely the alleged price. At just $69.99 the Mi Box would be the cheapest set-top box to offer 4K. The only other Android TV option is NVIDIA’s SHIELD, which costs a whopping $199. Roku’s new Premiere player comes extremely close with 4K support for $79.99, and the company’s non-4K options run as low as $29.99. Apple TV starts at $149 without 4K support, while Amazon’s Fire TV offers 4K for $99.99. Of course, there are other factors to consider, but if 4K streaming and price are at the top of your list, the Mi Box may be the way to go. Google’s also expected to unveil a new Chromecast Ultra with 4K support for $69 at its October 4 event, offering another great option that runs Google software.

Little do they know that there is another motorist searching for a free spot as well, leading to a kind of stand-off from Western films – okay, maybe not that situation, but people still get the point. On a serious note, however, an April 2015 study found that drivers wasted on average 55 hours last year by merely searching for a parking spot, which represented roughly $600 million in lost time and fuel. Not too long ago, I imagined a resource to help combat this, and I’m very excited to say that my wish came true! Allow me to introduce Waze, Google’s community-based traffic and navigation app, as well as one of the most ambitious apps I’ve seen so far. After everyone’s favorite search engine made a partnership with INRIX – the “global leader in connected car services and movement analytics,” according to PR Newswire – Waze looks to be promising for many motorists. As a fun fact about INRIX, Andrew J. Hawkins of The Verge indicates that the company offers traffic information from multiple sources to municipalities and news outlets. INRIX also provides parking information and services to leading car manufacturers such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Volkswagen, Toyota, and Lexus. So just what can Waze do? Well, users can essentially give back to their communities by sharing real-time traffic information as well as report any road hazards such as accidents, closed-down roads, and even police traps. The sense of community is especially noteworthy, as users can also make friends, send them locations, and let them know when friends will arrive via the app. In fact, Waze learns its users’ recurring destinations, commuting times, and favorite routes to take while the users learn more and more about how to use Waze. All that aside, the app’s role as a parking pal may be groundbreaking for many people. It makes suggestions about parking lots nearest to a user’s destination. Also, should the user not choose a parking lot before their arrival, Waze will give them the option to pick and navigate to one when approaching a final destination. And after people download the app, finding a good place to park looks to be a piece of cake. Waze is available in the App Store and on Google Play. As a heads-up, please note that the continued use of the GPS running in the background can dramatically shorten a phone’s battery life. Please do not use the Waze app while driving.

CHARLES, MO (KPLR) - Schnucks employees have rejected a proposed contract by a wide margin.  There were 250 votes for and 1,934 against the contract. Union leaders said the membership did like 2 or 3 items in the proposed contract, but there were 15 items members did not like.  As the official said, it all came down to economic advancement. By rejecting the contract, a strike authorization was given by the membership.  But union leaders say they will go back to the bargaining table and try to work out a better deal. Before tonight's vote on a new contract local Schnucks employees and union members filed into the Family Arena in St. Charles to learn about, and then vote, on a contract that had been proposed. Schnucks employees had two voting options, they could either accept the contract and return to work, or reject the contract and authorize a strike. A 2/3rds vote is required to authorize that strike. Leaders in the union have already recommended employees reject the contract. While many had not seen the details of the contract, in a letter to employees, the main issues the union was facing were benefits and wages. There was an extensive period for employees to learn about what's in the proposed contract and ask any questions before voting actually begins. If the employees reject the contract and authorize a strike, it won't happen immediately. Union leaders, in their recommendation to vote for a strike, say that would show how serious they are about accepting reasonable terms. Schnuck's Statement: We'll be meeting with 655 leadership for what we expect to be productive and meaningful discussions, just as we have had with numerous union leaders over the years. Our goal remains the same – to deliver a solution that works for our teammates. It is important that we do this while keeping our business positioned to compete against the more than 580+ non-union supermarkets and stores that sell food throughout our metro area. As we’ve said before, taking care of our people and delivering the kind of shopping experience our customers want and deserve is what’s most important. Success in those two areas is what made Schnucks the choice for our customers for more than 75 years, and it is how we will succeed going forward. Todd Schnuck September 26, 2016 Statement from Todd Schnuck CEO, Schnuck Markets, Inc. The state of the grocery industry has shifted from traditional grocer to multiple formats now selling food. Currently there are four union grocers in the St. Louis area, including Schnucks, and together we have 135 locations. It was 139; four locations closed in the past three years. In contrast, there are 16 non-union grocers - as well as stores that sell food – in the St. Louis metro and between them they have 584 locations, including 84 new stores in the last three years. This group includes some of the largest companies in the world - Walmart, Sam’s, Target, Aldi, Costco, Walgreens and CVS. It also includes Dollar General, Whole Foods, Lucky’s, Fresh Thyme and a few others. None of them have union relationships and they don’t hire union workers. We are concerned that the UFCW Local 655 leadership team is ignoring the explosive growth in our region’s non-union competition, including companies like Walmart, a $482 billion global conglomerate with 37 locations in St. Louis alone. The end result is an uneven playing field. Schnucks is proud to be the largest union-based supermarket, as well one of the largest union employers in St. Louis. Throughout our stores, we employ 10,000+ union members – more than the other three union supermarkets combined. Our union teammates belong to 15 unions, make up 75% of our workforce, and we pay them $200,000,000 in wages annually. We are proud to have held our teammates’ healthcare costs below industry benchmark averages. Our teammates pay approximately 60% less for individual coverage than the average contribution of other hourly retail employees. With family coverage, our teammates are even better off – paying approximately 80% less than hourly retail employees. Our healthcare plan helps our teammates receive benefit coverage they need and keeps our business moving ahead in a hyper competitive market. Currently, we have offered our 655 teammates a three-year contract that includes what they’ve been asking for – more money with substantial, real-dollar increases to the start rate and a shorter time period to progress through the first four pay brackets. We are also proposing a cash bonus and increasing wages at top pay rates. We’re offering an unprecedented 40% increase in pension contributions for current teammates, which meets the request made by Local 655 in negotiations. We are increasing contributions to our healthcare plan, which on a comparative basis could be considered a premium, with an additional $600,000 in annual health and welfare contributions in the first year of the contract and further increases in years two and three of the contract. We’re also addressing requests for longer lead times on work hours by offering work schedules two weeks in advance. Specifically, if our proposal is accepted:– 655 teammates will see their average full-time hourly rate at $18.16; as a comparison Walmart’s average full-time hourly rate is $13.38. For our full-time 655 members, annual salaries plus their welfare and benefit packages will vary. For example, our top clerks’ package will be $43,825 a year, some of our Floral or Salad Bar Manager packages will be $44,761 a year, while most Center Store Manager packages will be $59,477 a year. Top scale, part-time 655 teammates will see a package of $16.37 an hour, which includes their hourly rate as well as our welfare and pension contributions. Depending on hours, they’ll see anywhere from $17,024 a year for a 20-hour week to $29,793 for a 35-hour week. It is my job to ensure Schnucks continues on its successful path. I believe this proposal meets the needs of our teammates while keeping our business competitive against non-union grocers and stores that sell food, which includes some of the world's largest companies. I am very proud of the work our union teammates do every day to deliver the level of service our customers have come to expect, and for the support they give one another. Todd Schnuck   UFCW 655 Statement: Members of United Food & Commercial Workers Local 655, in a secret ballot vote this evening at the St. Charles Family Arena, overwhelmingly rejected a proposed contract from Schnuck Markets and authorized only the second strike in the union’s history against a food chain. The vote was 250 to accept the contract and 1,944 to reject and strike (89%), Local 655 President David Cook announced. Two-thirds was necessary to strike. The recommendation from the union’s leadership and its rank-and-file Bargaining Committee was to reject the offer and authorize a strike. It is the first time that UFCW Local 655 has unanimously recommended rejecting a contract proposal from Schnuck Markets. The union’s current three-year contract expired May 8 but has been extended on a day-to-day basis while negotiations continued. The union will urge Schnucks to come back to the bargaining table and negotiate a fair and reasonable contract to avoid a strike. While Local 655 is currently conducting negotiations with Schnucks, the other two largest employers of the Union, Shop ‘n Save and Dierbergs, have already stated that they will sign the same economic package that Schnucks and Local 655 agree to, effectively making the Schnucks contract the standard by which other contracts will be set. Straubs, whose contract ended last week (Sept. 24), is not in negotiations “We hope this overwhelming rejection sends a clear message to Todd Schnuck that the substantial sacrifices made by his employees over the past three contracts that has allowed his company to be extremely profitable is not acceptable at this time when Schnucks has posted record sales in recent years,” said UFCW Local 655 President David Cook. Cook pointed out that over the past 9 years (the last three contracts) Schnucks’ employees have agreed to almost cost neutral contracts in reduced wages and benefits and work rule changes to keep the company competitive. The rejected contract proposal would require significant cuts in health benefits, reduce the number of full-time jobs, and provides no meaningful increase in wages. “The employees deserve to be recognized for their sacrifices with a fair contract,” Cook said. “Schnucks has been incredibly competitive for years, and this contract asks for their employees to make even deeper concessions.” In contrast, Cook noted that in 2016, Forbes Magazine lists Schnucks as the 168th largest private company with $2.7 billion in revenue, a position that has been improving over the years: in 2009 they were listed as the 191st largest private company; in 2010 as the 174th largest private company. “We are ready to re-enter negotiations with the expectation that Schnucks will re-consider their approach and be willing to bargain a fair agreement, instead of asking more than 4,500 hard-working employees to take continued cuts to their health care benefits and reduce their standard of living,” Cook stressed. “Schnucks has never said they couldn’t afford the contract we are proposing,” he added. “They have simply claimed doing so would make them less competitive, a position that is simply not supported by the facts.” Members employed at Schnucks, Dierbergs, and Shop ‘n Save will report to work on their normal schedules tomorrow. “A strike is a last resort for our members. It is not a first option, and it certainly isn’t something anyone seeks out unless all other options have been exhausted. Our members made it clear by their votes: the current offer is not only unacceptable, it’s outrageous,” Cook said. “We are ready to get back to the bargaining table to work toward attaining a fair offer and avoid a strike.”   Stage is set in St. Charles for tonight's Schnuks employee vote on a new contract.

John Bean, who is the principal at Highcrest Elementary School in Wethersfield, was arrested at a Walmart on Saturday in Hartford. He was charged with interfering with an officer and second-degree breach of peace. "As always, our most important priority is the continuity of high quality instruction for our students, and we are taking steps to ensure that the high level of instruction at Highcrest School will continue during Mr. Bean’s leave," said Wethersfield School Superintendent Michael Emmett. When students and parents talk about Bean, many of them sung him praises. "Mr. Bean has always been so professional," said Samantha Griffin, a parent. "So nice, so gentle with the kids." They said they were astonished to learn of the charges. "When I heard he was arrested, I was shocked," Griffin said. Police have not released the details of what happened. "To hear anything about him being arrested is completely out of character and unexpected," Griffin said. Bean was placed on leave while the legal process plays out. "I think they're definitely making all the right choices," said Michael Gowdy, a parent. "Take him out of the school for right now figure out what's going on and then see if it's right to put him back." Griffin agreed that placing Bean on leave was the correct call. However, she said she's a little concerned about how the situation will impact her children, who are in kindergarten and first grade. She said her children will miss him at school. "If he's gone for an extended period of time the kids are gonna notice because he's so involved in the community," she said. In the end, parents told Eyewitness News that they hope Bean is exonerated so they can go back to praising him. "Hopefully this is just a big misunderstanding or something," Gowdy said. "They gotta have the legal system figure out what's going on and hopefully everything's ok and he can come back and continue being the principal here."

A Union County grand jury also indicted Blake Clay, 33, of Rahway, on a charge of theft by deception, acting Union County Prosecutor Grace H. Park said Monday. She said all the charges are third degree crimes. Clay went to Walmart and Target stores in Clark, Edison, Linden, and Woodbridge multiple times from early February through late April and used counterfeit barcodes to significantly lower the prices of various items, the prosecutor said. On more than 10 occasions, Clay allegedly picked up items ranging in price from $15.99 to $39.99, authorities said. When he switched the bar codes, the items rang up at the register from $1.50 to $4.50, authorities said. Clay was served with a summons in May and was suspended from the police department without pay, authorities said. He was earning an annual salary of $83,308, according to state records. The charges resulted from an investigation of the Special Prosecutions Unit in the prosecutor's office, Park said. Third-degree charges carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison upon conviction. Attempts to reach Clay for a comment were unsuccessful. Tom Haydon may be reached at thaydon@njadvancemedia.com.

The new models are the Roku Express, Express+, Premiere, Premiere+ and Ultra, with only the recently updated (April) Roku Streaming Stick keeping its place. The new entry level, the Roku Express, costs only US$29.99 while providing 1080p HD streaming to HDMI-equipped TVs. If you have an older TV and need composite jack and A/V connections, then an extra $10 gets the Roku Express+ (US$39.99) and is exclusively available from Walmart. As you’ll see from the pictures, the Express model has moved away from the square-ish box to a more rectangular style. For hi-def junkies, the Roku Premiere ($79.99) and Premiere+ ($99.99) offer 4K at 60 Hz, with the Premiere+ also supporting HDR and the Premiere+ remote comes with a headphone jack if you want to enjoy your content in private. Obviously a 4K and HDR compatible TV is needed to enjoy all the features of the Premiere streamers. Finally, the Roku Ultra at $129.99 supports the Dolby Digital Plus decoder with optical out (yay!) voice search and lost remote finder. Uniquely in the range, the Roku Ultra has a USB port for local media playback, though it’s not entirely clear where it’s located on the box. Only the Ultra and Premiere+ have RF wireless remotes, with the Express, Express+ and Premiere remotes working with IR only. In most respects the remotes seem unchanged from previous Rokus. The new devices have been announced for USA, Canada and Mexico with availability from early October. Further news for other territories (UK, Ireland, France) is expected soon.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Todd Leva: Shootings detract from real problems of Black America Monday Sep 26, 2016 at 5:06 PM The fact is, if by the grace of God there was never another police shooting of an innocent black man, America’s black community will still be steeped with real multi-generational, community fracturing, deadly problems that have to get addressed if real change is desired. By Todd LevaCommunity Columnist I’ve watched the latest chaos in Charlotte closely. I lived there for three years studying for my undergrad at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Our youngest daughter was born there and, as a young couple, my wife and I really grew together there. We loved our time there and to see that mayhem is heartbreaking. On the flip side of that, if I am honest with you, it also makes me angry. The problems with this greater issue of police shootings, race, riots, our nation's inner cities, the moral decay of those inner cities, and the economic backdrop is almost endless in scope. Woven throughout this ongoing sad American tale is the erraticism of raw human emotions that are highly charged, perception-driven and, at times, irrational. On one side, these emotions are a driving force of the mob mentality we have seen on countless streets in so many cities of late. On the other, these emotions drive fear, biases and stereotyping. Regardless of side, these raw emotions help feed the inability for America to have a grownup discussion about these issues and their real effects — and God forbid some semblance of solutions. Many may label me a racist when I write that this rioting we have seen time and time again seems so senseless to me. It is literally like watching a pack of raging animals that smell a fresh kill. There is simply no justification for it. None. Looting a Wal-Mart, burning down businesses, hurting innocent people, will never advance a position, nor should it. It only fuels furthers division. I also believe that within the black community (never mentioned), there are these underpinnings of feelings that include despair, guilt, shame and a sense of hopelessness. All it takes is a spark and these emotions are vented and expressed in harmful, illogical ways that ultimately hurt the cause of all black people; especially if this spark comes from outside the black community — enter your local police departments. It's human nature to rally together toward a greater enemy, and our local police departments are sadly filling this role. As well, it’s equally human for it to be difficult for deep introspection, to have thoughts and ideas that go against the mass drum of anger. It is one reason why we see such rage and denial when topics like black-on-black crime or Black Lives Matter are discussed. The hypocrisy is hard for many to see and even harder to talk about. The fact is, if by the grace of God there was never another police shooting of an innocent black man, America’s black community will still be steeped with real multi-generational, community fracturing, deadly problems that have to get addressed if real change is desired. There is no doubt we have seen far too many instances where a police officer has shot someone without justifiable cause. Each time it is tragic and very well may be criminal. However, our nation is quick to second-guess a job that has become all but impossible to do. Our nation's police force is asked to do something no other job demands, and that is perfection every second or face prison time. They are also asked to be America’s protector, social worker, psychologist and parent. The good cops far outweigh the handful of the bad but now today every cop is in more danger than at any time I can remember. While police shootings take the headlines, in cities like Chicago the evidence is overwhelming that black lives matter very little. Right now some little black boy in an unnamed inner city is already a statistic, he just doesn’t know it yet. When he dies we won't know it; we’ll never hear about it because right now, unless he is shot by a police officer, it doesn’t seem his life really matters — and nothing could be sadder. — Todd Leva is a resident of Zeeland.

The Brookhaven Courier Student News Since 1978 Skip to content Campus News Arts & Entertainment Local News Opinion Sports Send Us News ← Coach mentors students on, off court IPS speaker talks Mexico, cartels → Instant film convention develops in North Texas Posted on September 26, 2016 | Leave a comment Brookhaven College professors, photographers and celebrities to be featured at world’s first convention centered on instant film photography. By Amber Gipson Arts & Culture Editor Photo Courtesy of Instant Film Society   Lately there has been a resurgence of nostalgic artifacts, and instant film cameras are no exception. “There is something special about shooting instant film [that] makes you really consider each exposure and slow down and get it right,” according to Guy Reynolds, Dallas Morning News photo editor. This shift is evident as sales of digital cameras have started to drop, according to an article from The Wall Street Journal. Representatives from Fujifilm Holdings Corp. said they expect the company to sell a record 5 million units of their various models of instant film cameras, compared to a predicted 1.4 million digital cameras. The company sees this sales increase as a continuing trend, and on Sept. 6, announced a new line of black-and-white instant film. A group of local photographers, educators and hobbyists are hoping to capitalize on this resurgence. “Now, every mall in North America with an Urban Outfitters sells instant film, and even many big box retailers like Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Jo-Ann Fabrics have started to stock some instant films and cameras,” Daniel Rodrigue, Brookhaven College photojournalism professor and Instant Film Society co-founder, said. PolaCon: An Instant Film Convention, will be the world’s first 3-day instant film photography convention, Rodrigue said. The convention will take place Sept. 30-Oct. 2 in Dallas and Denton, Texas. Steve and Erin Reeves, of MakeShift Photography, former Brookhaven students and current continuing education instructors, will also lead discussions on the basics of packfilm and a lesson on digitally scanning instant film photographs. PolaCon2016 will coincide with the IFS’s fifth annual #PolaWalk at the State Fair of Texas, and feature actor and photographer Jason Lee as a special guest speaker, as well as Patrick Tobin from Impossible Project. The IFS was founded in 2012 by a group of film photographers and educators to increase awareness, accessibility and understanding of instant film photography, according to the DMN. Rodrigue said that IFS members from North Texas and Los Angeles first started discussing a centrally located event with workshops as early as 2014. The planning slowly took shape and PolaCon2016 was announced on social media in September 2015. According to IFS’s website, the group has partnered with Film Photographic and Denton Camera Exchange to host PolaCon2016. It will feature special guest speakers and photographers, panel discussions, a camera swap meet area, an instant film pop-up exhibition, 8″x10″ demos and an 8″x10″ instant photo booth. There will also be film- and camera-specific walks, meet-ups, special pop-up events, Polaroid-friendly photo-ops and backdrops. PolaCon2016 will begin with a 4 p.m. meet-up Sept. 3o in Deep Ellum followed by a mini PolaWalk to Fair Park for the 5th annual rain-or-shine #PolaWalk at the State Fair of Texas. At 7:30 p.m., attendees will meet at Big Tex for a group portrait, camera swaps and scavenger hunt. The event will end with a “Neon at Night” walk through Deep Ellum. Saturday and Sunday of PolaCon are free to attend. However, some workshops, how-to demos, and guest speakers will have limited seating and be restricted to guests who sent RSVPs. All Saturday and Sunday attendees must register through Eventbrite at bit.ly/PolaCon2016. The Second Annual PolaCon will take place Oct. 13-15, 2017.   Share This entry was posted in Local News.

 sweet potato pound cake loafs in more than 500 stores." />     Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            Brown Betty Dessert Boutique Closing Its Store, Going Wholesale by Michael Klein, Philadelphia Inquirer Posted: Monday, September 26, 2016 at 3:22PM EDT Oct. 1 will be the last day to walk into Brown Betty Dessert Boutique in Northern Liberties to snag cupcakes. After 12 years, Norrinda Brown Hayat and her mother, Linda Hinton Brown, say they plan to close their shop to focus on wholesale opportunities. Chief among them is a partnership with Patti LaBelle and Walmart that has Brown Betty's sweet potato pound cake loafs in more than 500 stores. Hayat, a Washington-based lawyer, and Brown, a retired teacher, opened their first location in 2004 in Liberties Walk, near the current location at 722 N. Second St. Among the bakery's distinctions was coverage in the Oprah Magazine, appearances on the Katie Couric Show and the Food Network with Duff Goldman. Both Food & Wine and National Geographic named theirs among the best cupcakes in America. The Brown Betty Cookbook, published in 2012, provided stories behind some of the shop's hits, including a sweet potato cheesecake and an obscenely delicious bundle of calories in the form of a chocolate ganache layer cake called Hattie Don't Play.

(Photo: Chris McKee/flickr/cc) Citing the environmental and public health risks of factory farming, a $1.25 trillion coalition of multinational investors has called on 16 global food corporations—including Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco, and Walmart—to cut their reliance on meat and diversify into plant-based sources of protein.  The campaign launched Monday is backed by a new briefing from the FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return) Initiative and responsible investment organization ShareAction, entitled, The Future of Food: The Investment Case for a Protein Shake-Up (pdf). Our current food system is unsustainable, the report states, listing greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, and growing antibiotic resistance as among the negative consequences of "the factory farming model and the increasing overconsumption of animal products." In fact, the briefing warns, if livestock production and consumption are not swiftly reduced, it will be impossible to reach the goals set out in the Paris climate agreement. An Oxford University study released in March projected that by 2050, food-related greenhouse gas emissions could account for fully half the emissions the world can afford if global warming is to be limited to less than 2°C. According to the FAIRR/ShareAction report: [T]he livestock sector currently accounts for 14.5 percent of global anthropogenic GHG emissions: more than the global transport sector. While there are certainly improvements to be made in production and distribution efficiencies, research indicates that these have only a small part to play; with, for instance, a reduction in food waste likely to lower food-related emissions by just 1 to 3 percent. In contrast, adopting global dietary guidelines with lower meat consumption would cut food-related emissions by 29 percent, vegetarian diets by 63 percent, and vegan diets by 70 percent. "The world's over-reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social, and environmental crisis," said FAIRR founder Jeremy Coller, who also serves as chief investment officer for Coller Capital, one of 40 firms participating in the campaign. "Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low. It simply can't cope with the projected increase in global protein demand." But while the current meat model is unsustainable, prospects are bright in the plant-based protein market, which Coller said is "set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years." In turn, the investors want to know what companies are doing to avoid what Coller dubs the "protein bubble." The FAIRR/ShareAction report points to strategies ranging from the further development of plant-based protein alternatives to more creative marketing around "less-meat" options—for example, "inspiring a modified dietary approach through appealing on-packet recipe suggestions that do not default to meat." As ShareAction campaigns manager Clare Richards declared in a press statement: "Evidence suggests that plant-based protein sources are better for your health, your wallet, and the planet. Consumers increasingly recognize these benefits; and now this coalition of forward-thinking investors are doing the same."

Ginger, a nearly three-year-old German Shepherd mix, was left at the shelter mid-September after her owner became homeless. Story continues below “He was absolutely heartbroken. He just couldn’t keep her and live in a car,” said Apple Valley Animal Shelter’s Gina Whiteside in an interview with the San Bernardino Sun. READ MORE: Dogs crash car into Walmart after owner leaves vehicle running That same day, Ginger managed to jump over her six-foot-tall kennel fence and wandered through the shelter to make her escape. Surveillance footage shows the canine opening three separate doors and even overriding the locked front doors using the emergency exit system. “She was persistent,” said Whiteside. “That door sometimes sticks, but she kept at it until she put her mouth on it and she was out.” Staff found Ginger a few days later, around five kilometres from where she used to live. “When we found her, we think she was on her way to her old home,” said Whiteside. The shelter is hoping the tale of Ginger’s great escape will help attract a caring new owner for her. It appears it has worked. The shelter’s latest Facebook update reads: “Due to a significant influx of inquiries over the weekend we wish to inform the public that response time may be delayed.” “She’s a sweet dog and a great companion,” said Whiteside. “She just needs someone who knows the breed. They are very smart.” Follow @jennynotjen © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Residents of the proposed Windmill Manor project must be 55 years and older, while their rents essentially would be subsidized by the Illinois Housing Development Authority. An Iowa-based firm, doing business as JNB Batavia, wants to build an 80-unit, three-story apartment building on a 4.5-acre site at 2400 Hawks Drive. It sits to the west of the Batavia Wal-Mart store on a curving section of Hawks Drive near the Dreyer Medical Clinic. JNB owner Chris Tritsis said there will be 60 one-bedroom apartments, and 20 two-bedroom apartments, plus a basement apartment for an on-site manager. Of the 80 apartments, eight would be rented out at the market rate. The other 72 would be rent-restricted, with the developer receiving a tax credit from the IHDA. The one-bedroom units would rent for $800 a month, Tritsis said, while the two-bedroom units would be $940 a month. The income limit for residents of the rent-restricted apartments would be $37,000, Tritsis said. The Batavia Plan Commission approved the project at its Sept. 21 meeting, allowing variances on the building height and the parking requirement. The masonry building would stand no more than 47 feet tall, two feet higher than allowed under city code, depending on the final grading of the sloping topography. The parking lot would have 115 vehicle spaces, rather than the 137 specified for a development of that size. Each apartment in the L-shaped building would have an exterior balcony and be cable-ready, Tritsis said, and come with a completely equipped kitchen and wireless internet. The building would include a main lobby, as well as community, exercise, craft, computer and multimedia rooms, along with sitting areas, library and beauty salon, Tritsis said. The apartments would have vinyl or laminate floors in the kitchen and bathroom, Tritsis said, and wall-to-wall carpeting in the living room and bedrooms. The proposal now moves to the Batavia City Council’s Committee of the Whole for review.

Published Sep 26th, 2016 11:38 am tusktotailgate@gmail.com / @tbarkansas story by Jeff Laman Editor’s note: Welcome to the fifth season of Tusk to Tail – the sport of tailgating as organized, performed and perfected by a group of Hog fans who have been tailgating together sober and otherwise for more than a decade. Members of the Tusk to Tail Team are Sean Casey, Jack Clark, Dale Cullins, Greg Houser, Craig May, David Rice and Mark Wagner. Tusk to Tail is managed by Talk Business & Politics against the advice of attorneys and family. The diehards may also be followed on their Facebook page. Or follow the crew on Twitter — @TuskToTail –––––––––––––– The Saturday setup started at 8:30 a.m., which by Dale Cullins’ standards is late. He had already bought supplies from the Walmart across the street before grabbing a space in line for the parking at Jerry World (nee AT&T Stadium). Despite this “late start,” a perfect spot for the Tusk to Tailgate was secured with a beautiful view of the stadium. Craig and Lawson May, Sam Atkinson, Mark Wagner, David and Jackson Rice, among others helped set everything up for the rest of us. My wife, Hope, and I picked up Chris May from the airport around noon and proceeded to join the guys. As Dale mentioned last week, we had primarily snack foods and beverages, though someone picked up a pizza or two for munching. We could see that there had been a bit of rain. A few minutes after our arrival, there was a torrential downpour for nearly half an hour. Pools of water accumulated on the nylon roof of the tents, requiring us to push them off, lest the tents collapse. When the sun came out along with a nice breeze, it was clearly going to be a perfect afternoon. Another thunderstorm passed through before the hot Texas sun created a swampy atmosphere for the thousands of tailgaters around Jerry World. “Somehow I got a sunburn tailgating for an indoor game in the rain,” said David Rice. When you’re the only tailgate on the block with a TV, you end up being very popular. Unexpected visitors happened by to catch a moment or two of Ole Miss’s routing of Georgia or the Gators and Vols tilt. George Knight and Susan Craig Ramey, his girlfriend and a Razorback fan originally from Little Rock, were such a pair. Susan had a Hog hat and face stickers, but she was wearing a Texas A&M t-shirt, which brought about curiosity. “I pull for the Hogs, but I want Trevor to play well,” she said. George is the father of Trevor Knight, the Aggies’ graduate transfer quarterback. Later when they departed, we told them they needed to visit Fayetteville for a game and drop by the tailgate. He said Susan would make sure that happened. Steve Sullivan and Tony Ranchino from KATV in Little Rock stopped by to interview Chris and Craig May. Video of the interview streamed on Facebook live, along with all of us calling the Hogs a couple of times. Tony left to edit while “Sully” stayed around talking to a couple of us about the team and the game. With a couple of hours before kickoff, TTT’s Lone Wolf, Jack Clark, showed up after watching his son play ball in Little Rock that morning.  Kara and Spencer Cullins and Rebecca Rice made a rare appearance at a road tailgate after some shopping in North Dallas. Since the Aggies joined the SEC in 2012, it seems we’re in a Bizarro world every time we play them. For those of us who grew up with the Southwest Conference, we expect to beat the team from College Station every year. And yet, just the opposite has taken place. It is a nightmare I want to end. Unfortunately, the scion of our tailgate guest helped make it even worse. Hog QB Austin Allen had a heck of a game. His passing (28 for 42, 342 yards, 2TDs) and great catches by about everyone except Dominique Reed helped sustain drives or score touchdowns. Unfortunately, #3’s mishandling of the ball resulted in our first turnover. That led to Trevor Knight’s 42 yard unabated run up the middle of the field, tying the game to start the 2nd quarter. Knight is quick, but clearly Noel Mazzone, A&M’s new offensive coordinator, saw something in Robb Smith’s defense to exploit as he zipped for 48 yards and another touchdown to end the quarter (and half) the same way he began. While our offensive line provided some protection to Austin during most passing downs, they did not supply the push we’ve come to expect the last few years on rushing downs, especially on the goal line. Once Rawleigh Williams III gashed A&M’s defense for 55 yards to set up the ball on the Aggie 2-yard line, Arkansas had an astounding series of six or seven unsuccessful goal line runs. The play calling seemed to lack creativity. As it became evident that this part of the gameplan was not working, I heard questioning by the fans for the first time since last season’s Toledo debacle. Fans struggled to understand the selections of plays called by Dan Enos then and at the end of the 3rd quarter. Then, the 4th down run by Keon Hatcher resulted in a 5-yard loss. Why not throw to the corner or back of the end zone a couple of plays earlier? The A&M secondary was getting burned, resorting to pushing or grabbing at the Razorback receivers all night. It did appear Austin made it across the goal line earlier, but the video replay wasn’t conclusive enough to overturn the call on the field. After the turnover on downs, the Aggies wasted little time throwing a 92-yard touchdown to Josh Reynolds. That was the real start of the nightmare, as the Hogs’ solid play for the majority of the 3 quarters all went up in flames. The Hogs managed to score one touchdown in the game with 6:21 left, but A&M responded with another of their own in 1:24. Trevor Knight almost had another TD after a 62 yard run with 1:30 to go. We left to finish tearing down the tailgate and packing away the gear to find it had rained again after we had entered the stadium. As one final parting shot, the automated sprinklers came on promptly at midnight. Sam got soaked folding up tables and chairs, but I didn’t ask if it washed off the feeling that game left in us. As we departed for various hotels around the Metroplex, sports media was beginning to question if A&M could be the team to finally challenge Alabama for SEC supremacy. We shouldn’t have been surprised, as David Rice picked A&M as one of his four playoff teams just days ago. But there are two things we know about Bret Bielema’s Arkansas teams thus far. First, the players don’t quit on him, and more importantly, the team continuously improves as the season progresses. Tusk to Tail is looking forward to next week’s game in Little Rock and the rest of the season.

Uber Now Selling Physical Gift Cards In Stores Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Uber Now Selling Physical Gift Cards In Stores September 26, 2016 2:12 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk car cards gift cards lyft uber transportation Following in the footsteps (or the wheel tracks, as it were) of Lyft, Uber will now also sell physical gift cards in stores. Starting today, Uber customers can buy gift cards at Walmart stores nationwide, the company announced (as well as online at uber.com/gift-cards). The plan is to sell the cards at CVS and Target locations eventually. “Whether it’s exploring a new city, a night out with friends, or simply a safe ride home, Uber is ready to help get the special people in your life where they want to go. And treating them to these experiences has never been easier with the introduction of the Uber gift card,” Uber product manager Drew Quinn wrote in a blog post. The cards can be redeemed directly in the Uber app, and never expire. In August, Lyft announced that it would sell $20 gift cards at Starbucks locations in a partnership with the coffee chain.

Ride-hailing service Uber will begin selling gift cards in stores starting immediately, it announced Monday. The company says it plans to roll out the gift cards to 35,000 retail locations over the coming weeks. They’ll be available at chains like Walmart, Target, and CVS. The gift cards will also soon be available for purchase through Uber’s website, too. To redeem a gift card, recipients will need to enter the code shown on the card into the Uber app before requesting a ride. They will be valid in any U.S. city where Uber is available. The company says they never expire. It’s worth noting, though, that these cards are only valid for Uber rides. They will not work with the company’s other services, like Uber Eats and Uber Rush. While the option to purchase physical gift cards is new, Uber already allows users to request rides for other friends or family members by entering their pickup location and destination. Uber has also offers the option for event hosts to purchase rides for guests in advance. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Brian Hill | Staff Photographer   Amy E. Williams     Just in time to wash all of the impending salt and slush off your vehicle, a new car wash is set to open along the Randall Road corridor this fall. Fuller's Car Wash should be open just south of the intersection of Randall Road and Bowes Road by mid- to late-November, owner Colin Fuller said. Construction on the new business is underway at the Randall Road location, which is in front of the Elgin Wal-Mart Supercenter and Sam's Club, and just to the south of the Elgin Portillo's Hot Dogs. Fuller said he found the location through the folks at Portillo's and thought it was a great place to open another one of his family's carwashes. There are many Fuller's carwashes throughout the Chicago area, including one in Geneva on State Street. There are different kinds of Fuller's carwashes -- some are self-service and some are full service with complete detail services. This new Elgin Fuller's Car Wash location will be a $3 car wash center, Fuller said. There will be free vacuum usage with a car wash purchase, he added. Fuller said the equipment at the center will be state-of-the-art to ensure vehicles get the best and most efficient car wash for the money. Missing the fries: The popular Chicago Grill along Randall Road in Lake in the Hills is now closed. The business at 335 N. Randall Road, which drew in customers for its hand-cut fries and other Chicago favorites such as hot dogs, brats, burgers and beef, closed late last month. Originally the plan was to have a new owner buy and reopen the Chicago Grill, which is on the east side of Randall near Starbucks. However, that deal is on hold, leaving many craving those fries and other goods, which are hard to find elsewhere in the area. Owner Dominick Pulli has said he was selling the business to focus on his other eatery, Bubs Subs, which is located just to the south on Randall Road in Algonquin. Running the two businesses and putting all of the time into both to ensure they were successful and offered the highest of quality of foods was difficult. The spot for now remains vacant, though many customers have been emailing saying they are hoping a new business serving hand-cut fries will open in the location. Save the date: The Algonquin Commons mall has set the date for its annual Halloween event for families. This year, the Boo Party will take place from noon to 3 p.m. on Sunday, Oct. 30. At the event, there will be trick-or-treating at businesses throughout the mall. There also will be more fun for kids on the 30th, including magicians, jugglers, pumpkin decorating, balloon shapes and more. Stay tuned for more information on the Boo Party, which draws in children from up and down the Randall Road corridor each October at the mall. • Amy Williams' column covers all the news of business along the Randall Road corridor from Batavia to Crystal Lake.

Well, one of the city’s largest producers of gyros has new owners and is looking to expand. Downtown Lawrence’s Pita Pit restaurant has been bought by longtime commercial real estate executive Pat Peery and his son Sam. The duo has begun a small scale remodeling of the location at 1011 Massachusetts St., including a new rear entry, new signs, a new large screen television and the installation of free Wi-Fi for guests. Plans also call for a new sidewalk dining area to be built along Massachusetts Street. The menu also has expanded some. The restaurant has begun serving fruit smoothies, with a variety of mango, berry and banana flavors. But the bigger changes to the restaurant may be yet to come. Pat Peery used to direct the real estate activities of Wal-Mart Stores and Kohl’s Department Stores before coming back to Lawrence in 2012. Peery said he and Sam bought the Lawrence Pita Pit with the idea of expanding the chain’s presence in the region. 1011 Massachusetts St, Lawrence, KS 66044 “We intend to grow the business,” Pat said. “We aren’t doing this to just own one Pita Pit. A west Lawrence location at some point would make a lot of sense for us.” The Lawrence store also has launched a catering division and has bought a delivery van. Sam Peery, who runs the day-to-day operations of the restaurant, said the Lawrence store had seen a bit of a downturn under previous ownership, but he thinks the idea of pita can still be a hit with Lawrence diners. I guess I shouldn’t assume you are all familiar with a pita. It is a type of unleavened bread with a pocket that can hold a variety of meats, cheeses and veggies. “I was a customer of a Pita Pit back when I was in college,” Sam said. “I like that it is a healthier alternative. It is less bread than a sub sandwich.” In other news and notes from around town: • I’ve learned the hard way, don’t get your gyro and your Yugos confused, although a used Yugo will cost you less than most gyros. Either way, skip the Yugo, one of the worst cars of all-time, and get a good bike. All this is to say that Lawrence has one of the top-rated bike shops in the country, according to a new ranking. Downtown Lawrence’s Sunflower Outdoor & Bike has been named to the America’s Best Bike Shops list by the National Bicycle Dealer’s Association. The association looks at about 4,000 bike shops across the country, and fewer than 300 bike shops were included on the list. The program involves an application process and mystery shoppers visiting the store to evaluate a host of product and customer service issues. This is the fourth straight year Sunflower has been named to the list. • Here’s the name of a restaurant chain to keep an eye on: Buffalo Wings & Rings. The restaurant recently announced that it has signed a deal to build three restaurants in Wichita, with construction set to begin this year. But the chain also took the unusual step of announcing that Lawrence is the next city in the state where it plans to locate, although the timeline might still be another three years. The chain is a sports bar concept that serves chicken wings and onion rings but also has a large menu of hamburgers, quesadillas, tacos and other items.

Musicians view the years they spend in the honky-tonks as paying their dues for the music business. As it turns out, all that very specific training sets them up to succeed in other industries, too. Toby Keith owns dozens of racehorses, developed his own brand of wild mezcal and licensed his name for a restaurant chain, Toby Keith’s I Love This Bar & Grill. Kix Brooks established Arrington Vineyards in Middle Tennessee and launched a film production company that led to a TV series on the Cooking Channel and a new cookbook. Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan are investors in their own TV series, Buck Commander. And on Sept. 16, Trisha Yearwood — who has already developed her own home furnishings brand — announced the launch of a fragrance line at Walmart. It’s natural for an artist to extend their vocational knowledge by investing inside the music business — Brad Paisley and Tim McGraw own publishing companies, for example; Keith Urban created a line of guitars; and the late Buck Owens established a radio chain. But music is hardly the only line of interest for many artists. Carrie Underwood (sports clothing), Dolly Parton (the Dollywood theme park), Willie Nelson (biodiesel fuel and marijuana), Eric Church (furniture), Zac Brown (leather goods, food enterprises), Kenny Chesney (rum), John Rich (a fashion line) and Miranda Lambert (retail store) are just some of the acts who have put their name and/or their money to work outside of music. Keith “has got the guts to take the risk, and he’s got the money to do it, too,” says his manager, TKO Artist Management president TK Kimbrell. Billboard's 2016 Nashville Power Players List Revealed: Who Rules Music City? Keith, along with Brown, is likely country’s most avid investor beyond the music business. He was the lone writer on many of his hits — including “Should’ve Been a Cowboy,” “Who’s That Man” and “Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)” — and as the mailbox money rolled in, he surpassed what he felt he needed to guarantee his family’s future. That made it possible for Keith to invest in a wide range of companies: Starbucks, a golf course and some strip malls are probably safer bets than some of his other activities. Among the higher risks are the thoroughbreds (Kimbrell estimates that he owns around 200 through Dream Walkin’ Farms) and the I Love This Bar chain, which licenses the rights to his name but is operated by a separate company. “Restaurants and bars are really hit-or-miss,” says Kimbrell. “When you put it on the line and you attach yourself to something, it can always come back on you in some way.” For an investment to work for an artist, it typically requires a connection to his or her lifestyle and interests. Which Artists Were 2015's Biggest Earners on the Road? “I would never go out and do a hairspray product,” says Aldean. “I don’t feel like that’s my brand, and it’s not really believable.” An avid hunter, Aldean has found the Buck Commander TV show and associated products a better fit. It works with his image, fits his schedule and has some built-in promotional value. “The fact that you’ve got [Duck Dynasty’s] Willie Robertson and me and Luke, and especially with all of our social media following, we can post about things and get it out there probably a lot quicker than most could with a startup company,” says Aldean. That ability to run a startup is key. To navigate their way in the music business, successful artists are required to identify and cultivate an audience, build a solid team and continue to believe in their product and tell their story, even when marketplace statistics suggest that failure is the most likely outcome. Berklee Institute for Creative Entrepreneurship’s managing director Panos Panay and CD Baby founder Derek Sivers both see those factors as significant advantages for musicians who choose to pursue other businesses. Thanks to their public position, successful artists are approached with more opportunities than lower-profile business people to get in on the ground floor of other enterprises. But that doesn’t mean that every product or investment is a good idea. Even if it is, it still may not be an ideal fit for the act. Brooks recalls learning that lesson right out of college. A successful Louisiana bar was up for sale, and he tried to persuade his father to loan him the money to buy it. His sales pitch was unsuccessful. “First of all, he told me I needed to go to Nashville or New York or Los Angeles if I was going to play music, to see if I was worth a damn,” recalls Brooks. “Second, [he said] I didn’t know a thing about the bar business.” Familiarity with an industry — or, at the very least, the product — is a major consideration for artists, since their primary business is already one that requires a huge amount of time. The product needs to fit instinctively into their life so that it doesn’t really feel like work. Such was the case for Florida Georgia Line when it developed Old Camp Peach Pecan Whiskey, which went on sale in August. “Whiskey, for us, it just comes natural,” says FGL’s Brian Kelley. “That’s our drink of choice. We say that we took all last year to sample it, but that’s really a lie because we’ve been sampling probably the past 10 years or so. Trying to get the mix right, having a little whiskey drink here and there and enjoying friends and family, that’s something that’s organic to us.” Even Brooks’ new role in food has been a natural evolution. An acting major in college, he put together a film production company after Brooks & Dunn split in 2010. Building on his affinity for exploring steakhouses on tour, the company landed a series, Steak Out With Kix Brooks, on the Cooking Channel in 2015. That led to his new cookbook, Cookin’ It With Kix, published by Thomas Nelson. After several decades of physically exhausting tours, finding the time for his new ventures — in addition to his continuing his role as the host of American Country Countdown — has been as easy as finding time to check out a movie on vacation. “That is not lip service,” he says. “The stuff I’m doing now, it’s just fun.” One significant key to keeping it fun — and profitable — is a basic rule of thumb that most executives follow: hire the right people. Keith has a hands-off attitude about his ventures, says Kimbrell. Whether it’s turning over the keys to his BelMar Country Club in Norman, Okla., or assigning oversight of his label Show Dog Nashville, Keith’s philosophy is to hire an expert and stay out of the way. “Toby has been great at constantly refocusing on what he does best, and that’s writing songs and singing,” says Kimbrell. “If it’s going to take away from his songwriting and singing, he ropes it back in.” That’s yet another lesson artists learn while paying their dues on the way up. The business part is easiest when they follow their passion. No matter how big the other ventures may become, it still starts with the music.

For just this week, if you buy any existing Xbox One S bundle, you’ll score yourself an Xbox One game of your choice for free. Participating retailers include Amazon, Target, GameStop, Best Buy, Walmart and Microsoft’s own store. It’s not completely clear if there’s any restrictions on which title you choose as your free one, but the post over on Xbox Wire explicitly mentions the likes of NBA 2K17, Destiny’s Rise of Iron add-on, Forza Horizon 3 and FIFA 17 as popular contenders. Unsurprisingly, the fine print confirms that the offer can’t be applied to pre-orders, so you’ll have to limit your choice to titles that have already been released. Likewise, the maximum value can’t exceed $59.99. If you ask us, this sounds like a bargain, but it’s all moot if you’ve no interest in upgrading or entering the Xbox family for the first time. The real question is if the Xbox One S does enough to warrant the price. Boasting 4K Blu-ray, video and Ultra HD support, Microsoft’s pushing the console as the quintessential media device for gamers, noting the presence of High Dynamic Range (HDR) as the icing on the cake. Until Microsoft comes out with more details for Project Scorpio, the Xbox One S is, for all intents and purposes, your best bet in regards to enjoying first-party software at its best.

The coalition is urging companies to identify their plans to respond to this risk, in particular by encouraging them to set strategies to diversify into plant-based sources of protein. Backed by a new briefing entitled ‘The future of food - the investment case for a protein shake up’, the investors warn of the risks associated with the growing global demand for protein and an overreliance on the unsustainable factory farming of livestock for its supply. The briefing highlights the environmental, social and public health risks inherent in this model, which financial markets are not currently valuing appropriately. The companies being engaged include Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco, Walmart and General Mills, which holds its AGM in Minneapolis tomorrow. The coalition has been brought together by the FAIRR (Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return) Initiative, in partnership with responsible investment organisation ShareAction. US food giant General Mills - makers of Häagen Dazs and Yoplait - is highlighted as an example of good practice f`or supporting start-up companies such as Beyond Meat, which is developing foods to substitute meat products with more sustainable plant-based alternatives. Jeremy Coller, Founder of the FAIRR Initiative and CIO of Coller Capital, said: “The world’s overreliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis. Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low. It simply can’t cope with the projected increase in global protein demand. Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4% annually over the next five years.” `The analysis report also points to regulatory trends as a driver for corporate action – such as Denmark’s consultation on the introduction of red meat tax and the Chinese government’s plan to reduce its citizens’ meat consumption by 50%. Clare Richards, Campaigns Manager at ShareAction said: “The trend for ‘less but better meat’ is creating new opportunities on plates and in portfolios. Evidence suggests that plant-based protein sources are better for your health, your wallet, and the planet. Consumers increasingly recognise these benefits; and now this coalition of forward-thinking investors are doing the same. As a result of this engagement we hope more companies will embrace the opportunities presented by this growing consumer trend.” Peter van der Werf, Engagement Specialist at Robeco said: "The growing demand for meat will put large pressure on natural resources in the coming decades. Robeco identified this as a financial material topic and engages to improve sustainability in the meat supply chain. Protein diversification is an important instrument to that end. Companies at the end of the meat supply chain have an important role to play towards customers and we will encourage them to make protein diversification an integral part of their strategy."

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Beth Braverman Sep 26th 2016 10:23AM The first debate between Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump is Monday, Sept. 26. Since she began her run for presidency, Clinton has spoken on the shrinking middle class and the financial difficulties low-income earners face. As she prepares for her face-off against Trump, learn about how her policies will affect you, your wallet and the U.S. economy. Cut Taxes for the Middle Class Clinton promises to cut taxes for middle-class families, according to her website, and she'll pay for new tax breaks by increasing taxes on high-earners. A March 2016 analysis of her tax proposals by Tax Policy Center found all tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent. Clinton also advocates closing tax loopholes and enacting the Buffett Rule, which would require millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes. The New York Times reported her tax proposals would place a 4 percent tax surcharge for high-earners making over $5 million, while a new rule would ensure individuals making over $1 million pay a minimum of 30 percent. See: 15 Things You Should Know About Donald Trump's Tax Plan Clinton also wants to reform the capital gains tax system. She wants to discourage short-term trading and reward longer-term investments that help create jobs. Under her plan, investors would be taxed a 39.6 percent statutory rate on gains from holdings held for one to two years, with that rate dropping to 20 percent after the six-year mark, reported Tax Foundation. "For most Americans, an increase in the capital gains tax won't affect them at all," said Tom Wheelwright, certified public accountant and author of "Tax-Free Wealth." "For the average investor who has their money in an IRA or a 401k, there is no impact by all of this."

The middle class is shrinking and the lower class is growing, according to data from Pew Research Center. "Corporate profits are at near record highs, and Americans are working as hard as ever, but paychecks have barely budged in real terms," Clinton said in a July 2015 speech. "Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets." Clinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour, and she supports cities and states aiming even higher. Despite minimum wage hikes by many state and local governments, and by high-profile employers like Walmart and Target, the federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 per hour, the same rate it has been since 2009. Even moving the minimum wage to $12 would raise wages for one in four U.S. workers, according to Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst with public policy organization Demos. "That's a big segment of the workforce, and it would make a big difference for a lot of people," she said. "It would be really good for consumers' wallets." Clinton also backed President Obama when he expanded overtime rules. Starting in 2016, that plan extended overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers, covering salaried workers who make up to $50,400. Provide Options to Avoid and Refinance Student Debt Student loan borrowers carry a mean balance of $26,700, and nearly 17 percent of all borrowers are late or in default on their loans, according to a 2015 report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Furthermore, a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston shows that student loan borrowers appear to be less likely to own a home and have more difficulty accumulating wealth. Clinton addresses student debt in her New College Compact. Advocating for debt-free college, her proposal would allow students to go to in-state colleges and universities without borrowing money for education. She also supports efforts to assist middle- and lower-income students with non-tuition expenses, such as the cost of books and even child care. For graduates straddled with debt, Clinton wants to help Americans with existing student loans refinance at more favorable rates. Expand Paid Family Leave and Affordable Child Care Policies It's been more than 20 years since Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows families to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child and deal with their own or a family member's health needs. That provision puts America behind most other developed countries that offer paid leave for women — and often men. As part of her goal of getting more women in the workforce at higher wages, Clinton supports family-friendly policies such as paid family leave and affordable childcare policies. See: 8 Ways Your Money Habits Are Ruining Your Relationship "I believe that what's good for women is good for America," she wrote in a 2015 op-ed for women's lifestyle media platform SheKnows. "Take child care. It's a women's issue. It's also an economic issue. You can't go to work every day if you can't afford a safe place to leave your kids." This issue gained more visibility in 2015 when several Silicon Valley companies announced changes to parental leave policies that extend more generous benefits to both men and women. Currently, only California, New Jersey and Rhode Island offer paid family and medical leave, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Protect and Expand Social Security The 2016 Trustees Report from the Social Security Administration projected that retirement and disability trust funds would be depleted by 2034 and would "pay about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through the end of the projection period in 2090." The future of Social Security, however, has long been a big point of contention between the two majority parties. Clinton wants to expand and preserve Social Security, saying at a New Hampshire campaign event, "We do not mess with it, and we do not pretend that it is a luxury — because it is not a luxury. It is a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security." Clinton's website outlines her plan for Social Security. Notably, she would oppose efforts to raise the retirement age or reduce cost-of-living adjustments.

Tax Cuts for the Middle Class Hillary Clinton has promised to cut taxes for the middle class so people can increase their take-home pay. She also advocates closing tax loopholes and enacting the “Buffett Rule,” which would require millionaires and billionaires to pay at least 30 percent of their income in taxes. Additionally, she wants to incentivize businesses to share their profits with workers by providing a 15 percent tax credit to companies that do so. See: Are Millennials Better With Their Money Than You? Where she has gotten specific is her plan to raise the capital gains tax, which is paid on the profits made by individuals when they sell property, stocks, businesses or other assets after holding them for a short period of time. Under Clinton’s plan, investors would be taxed 39.6 percent on their gain on assets held for less than two years, with that rate phasing out to the current 20 percent after the six-year mark, according to CNBC. This change, which is meant to encourage longer-term investing and economic growth, would apply to those in the highest tax bracket, which is nearly $465,000 for married joint filers and $411,500 for single filers. “For most Americans, an increase in the capital gains tax won’t affect them at all,” said Tom Wheelwright, certified public accountant and author of “Tax-Free Wealth.” “For the average investor who has their money in an IRA or a 401k, there is no impact by all of this.” Photo credit: Getty 2. Protection for the CFPB Hillary Clinton publicly urged Democrats in Congress to fight a Republican proposal that sought to limit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency created in the wake of the financial crisis to supervise financial institutions’ dealings with the public. The agency is responsible for supervising and enforcing the laws that cover consumer financial products and services, and it aims to provide better transparency for the consumers who use them. “The [CFPB] has only one mission: protecting Americans from unfair and deceptive financial practices — and it’s succeeding,” she wrote in an open letter to Congress. Photo credit: Getty 3. Increased Wages for the 99 Percent Reducing income inequality is one of the central tenets of the Clinton campaign. The gap between the richest and poorest Americans is wider than the gap in any other democracy in the developed world, according to U.S. News & World Report. “Corporate profits are at near record highs, and Americans are working as hard as ever, but paychecks have barely budged in real terms,” Clinton said in a July 2015 speech. “Families today are stretched in so many directions, and so are their budgets.” Clinton supports raising the federal minimum wage to $12 per hour. Despite minimum wage hikes by many state and local governments, and by high-profile employers like Walmart and Target, the federal minimum wage remains stuck at $7.25 per hour, the same rate it has been at since 2009. Many advocates of a higher minimum wage, including Clinton competitor Bernie Sanders, want a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour nationwide. See: How Hillary Clinton Will Close the Gender Wage Gap Even moving the minimum wage to $12 would raise wages for one in four U.S. workers, according to Amy Traub, a senior policy analyst with public policy organization Demos. “That’s a big segment of the workforce, and it would make a big difference for a lot of people,” she said. “It would be really good for consumers’ wallets.” Clinton also backed President Obama’s expansion of overtime rules to more workers. Starting in 2016, that plan extended overtime protection to nearly 5 million workers, covering salaried workers who make up to $50,400.

No Cuts to Social Security The 2015 annual report on Social Security projected that retirement and disability trust funds would be depleted in 2034 and then would “pay about three-fourths of scheduled benefits for 50 years,” according to The New York Times. The future of Social Security, however, has long been a big point of contention between the parties. Republicans, in particular, have been calling for cuts and privatization to address the situation. In April 2015, Clinton called Republicans who want to cut back Social Security “just wrong” and said she’d preserve the retirement benefit. “We do not mess with it, and we do not pretend that it is a luxury — because it is not a luxury,” she said at a New Hampshire campaign event. “It is a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security.” Clinton also has stated that she believes women especially need better access to Social Security and has promised to work to “enhance” the program.

Paid Family Leave and Affordable Child Care Policies It’s been more than 20 years since Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows families to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child and deal with their own or a family member’s health needs.

Currently, California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and the District of Columbia offer paid family leave. Photo credit: Getty 7. Pursuit of a New Foreign Trade Agreement Clinton broke with President Obama and with previous statements recently in opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, which would put in place one of the largest free trade areas in the world. “I still believe in the goal of a strong and fair trade agreement in the Pacific as part of a broader strategy both at home and abroad, just as I did when I was secretary of state,” Clinton said in a statement in October. “I appreciate the hard work that President Obama and his team put into this process and recognize the strides they have made. But the bar here is very high and, based on what I have seen, I don’t believe this agreement has met it.” Photo credit: Getty 8. Help for Small Businesses Clinton wants to “jump-start small businesses” by reducing the time it takes to start a business, expanding access to capital, simplifying and cutting the taxes paid by small businesses, and using technology to allow small businesses to access new markets both domestically and globally. “Despite generations of progress on so many other fronts, it’s still too hard to get a business started today,” Clinton wrote on LinkedIn in May. “Credit is too tough to come by. Too many regulatory and licensing requirements are uneven and uncertain.” Photo credit: Getty 9. Repeal of the Obamacare 'Cadillac Tax' While she has supported the Affordable Care Act and its goal of reducing the number of uninsured Americans, Clinton announced in September that she is opposed to the so-called “Cadillac tax,” which imposes a tax on employers with the most expensive health plans. The goal of the tax is to reduce overall health care costs, but critics say it’s encouraging employers to simply reduce the quality of their insurance and push costs onto consumers. If she were to succeed in repealing the tax, the Congressional Budget Office has said that, without such a tax, the Affordable Care Act might not actually reduce health care costs.

Clinton also wants to increase manufacturing jobs, notably by supporting small manufacturers and start-ups, while making it easier for small businesses to get the answers they need about federal regulations and access to capital programs. Expand the Affordable Care Act Clinton aims to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act. According to her website, Clinton aims to lower the cost of prescription medicines and lower out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles. Her campaign also looks to protect consumers from drug price increases, an issue that came to the limelight when Martin Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals raised the price of the drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015. The topic arose once more in the summer of 2016 after it was shown EpiPen, used for severe allergic reactions, had seen a 600 percent price increase since 2009. Clinton also opposes the Cadillac Tax, which imposes a tax on employers with the most expensive health plans. The goal of the tax is to reduce overall healthcare costs, but critics say it's encouraging employers to simply reduce the quality of their insurance and push costs onto consumers.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 26, 2016 at 10:11AM Image source: Costco. Costco (NASDAQ:COST) will post earnings results for its fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday, Sept. 29. Investors aren't expecting great things out of the world's second-largest retailer. It has missed earnings estimates lately while reporting slowing sales growth in each of the last three quarters. On the other hand, the warehouse giant enjoys some of the strongest customer traffic trends in the industry, and its subscription model produces higher profits even during soft selling environments. This week's quarterly report should show evidence of the strength of that selling approach, despite the fact that consensus estimates are targeting just 3% higher sales and flat earnings for Costco. Here are a few key points for investors to watch in addition to those big-picture figures. How big of a problem is deflation? Deflation has been a huge drag for grocery retailers over the last few months. Kroger in early September saw its comparable-store sales growth nearly cut in half as it lowered its comps outlook for the first time in years. Falling prices for products like meats, dairy products, and eggs combined to push overall food prices down by about 1.5% as the industry suffers through its first bout of deflation since 2009. Grocery price change against the year-ago period. Image source: Federal Reserve Economic Data. Costco gets about half of its revenue from food sales and in that way is more comparable to Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT). The retailing titan in August said that deflation cleaved a full percentage point from its grocery business in the second quarter, but that didn't get in the way of posting solid overall growth. It will be interesting to hear where Costco falls relative to these two retailers on the subject, given that sales growth at its U.S. warehouses has ticked lower in each of the past three quarters. Was the credit card switch worth it? Management will likely spend some time talking about Costco's loyalty card switchover in this week's conference call. After all, moving from an American Express-branded card to a Visa one was a major operating shift that affected over 10 million existing members. Investors have so far only seen the negatives from this move. It has cost the retailer over $40 million in lost signup revenue and confusion over the switch might have caused the slight decline in renewal rates last quarter (to 94.4% from 94.5%). It's also possible that the change has gone over smoothly with Costco's members. If that's true, then the upgraded rewards bonuses should contribute to a more engaged subscriber base -- and might even help the retailer improve on its already stellar renewal rate that for the past two fiscal years has been 91%. Annual renewal rates by fiscal year. Data source: Costco financial filings. Is a membership fee hike on the way? Given that the majority of Costco's profits comes from membership fees rather than product sales, investors are keenly interested in the company's plans for boosting that annual charge. They haven't had much to celebrate on that front since the last increase came in early 2012, or nearly five years ago. Still, a steadily rising membership base has helped push net income higher over that time, even though the subscription price hasn't budged. Costco hasn't said when it plans to implement its next boost, but Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti pointed out to investors in its last conference call that the company has increased prices at an average of once every 5.5 years. If it sticks to that pace, then a hike should be coming at some point during its 2017 fiscal year. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Costco Wholesale.
