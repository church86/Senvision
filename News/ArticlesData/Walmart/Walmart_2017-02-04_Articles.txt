Published February 01, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print  (Reuters) Walmart has been selling its own line of "craft" beers since 2016. Since the six-and 12-can variety packs debuted, the discount retailer has been scaling the alcoholic offering and the beers are now available in 3,000 stores across 45 states. But should brews like Walmart’s “Cat’s Away IPA,” “After Party Pale Ale” and “Pack of Trouble” really be considered “craft?” According to the Brewers Association, an American craft brewer is defined as a “small, independent and traditional.” 5 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT MILLER LITE How small is "small?" The Association says to be considered craft, a brewer must have an annual production of six million barrels of beer or less. To be “independent,” fewer than 25 percent of the brewery should be owned or controlled by “an alcoholic beverage industry member that is not itself a craft brewer.” And “traditional” means that the brewer’s product is mostly derived from “traditional or innovative brewing ingredients and their fermentation.” So, does Walmart, which opereates over 11,000 stores around the globe, qualify? According to a new Washington Post analysis, it’s debatable. The chain collaborates with a company called “Trouble Brewing” to brew its signature beers. But, according to the Post, "Trouble Brewing" doesn't really exist. Instead, the applicant listed on the filings with the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is “Winery Exchange, Inc.” That company has since turned into WX Brands. WX Brands “develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world,” according to its website. But under the “brewery address” section of the TTB filings, Genesee Brewing’s business office in Rochester, N.Y. is listed instead. Genesee is owned by another company that brews Costa Rican lager amid other industrial brands-- i.e. they produce well over the prescribed amount that would be considered "small." FOR THE LATEST FOOD  FEATURES FOLLOW FOX LIFESTYLE ON FACEBOOK  Though the name "Walmart" doesn't appear anywhere on its beer cans, Walmart insists they aren’t trying to trick customers. “We were intentional about designing a package that conveyed a look and feel you’d expect of craft beer,” Teresa Budd, a senior buyer for Walmart’s adult beverage team, told The Post. Whether or not it passes your definition of craft, Walmart's beer has a leg up on its competition when it comes to price.  The beer retails for $7.96 for a six-pack and $13.86 for the variety pack with 12 beers.

The unidentified man was attempting to load the stolen items into a vehicle with three other suspects around 8 a.m. Saturday, sheriff's office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said. A Walmart employee attempted to stop them and then a customer "assisted" the employee, Nieves said. During the "commotion," the customer shot one suspect multiple times. "What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened -- one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm," Nieves told the Orlando Sentinel. "The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect." The suspects fled in a red vehicle, which was found to have been stolen in a Jan. 14 carjacking. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Walmart parking lot, and suspects ran from the scene. By the time deputies arrived, the three suspects were gone. The injured suspect ran into a gas station. Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment but he died. The customer who shot the suspect was not named and the sheriff's office will decide whether charges are warranted. According to FBI statistics in 2015, 268 of 9,616 criminal gun homicides were deemed justifiable by private citizens. FBI defines a justifiable homicide as "the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen." Another 60 cases of justifiable homicides involved weapons other than guns, including knives.

News Customer shoots, kills diaper-theft suspect at Pine Hills Wal-Mart Customer of Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot suspected shoplifter A customer of a Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot a man suspected of stealing diapers and other items from the store Saturday morning, according to the Orange County A customer of a Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot a man suspected of stealing diapers and other items from the store Saturday morning, according to the Orange County Caitlin DoornbosContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy A customer of a Pine Hills Wal-Mart shot and killed a 19-year-old man suspected of stealing diapers and other items from the store Saturday morning, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said man left the store at 5559 Clarcona Ocoee Road with three other theft suspects and was attempting to load stolen items into a vehicle just after 8 a.m. when a Wal-Mart employee attempted to stop them. That’s when another Wal-Mart customer came out in front of the store and “assisted” the employee, Nieves said. A “commotion” ensued, and the customer — fearing for his life — shot one of the suspects multiple times. One of the suspects reached for something, [and the shooter] thought that it was a weapon. — Orange County Sheriff's Office Capt. Angelo Nieves       “What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened — one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm,” Nieves said. “The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect.” The suspects got into their red vehicle, which would later be discovered to have been stolen in a January carjacking, and tried to flee the scene. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Wal-Mart parking lot, so the suspects bailed out and ran from the scene on foot. Deputies were called to the store at about 8:12 a.m. for a report of a “911 emergency,” according to the Sheriff’s Office’s online list of calls for service. By the time they arrived, the suspects were out of sight. The Citgo on Clarcona Ocoee Road where the shot suspect was caught.

(Caitlin Doornbos/Orlando Sentinel) The man who was shot ran to a Citgo gas station across the street from the Wal-Mart, where an ambulance was called. Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment as a trauma patient. Nieves said the man later died at the hospital. A deputy was checking with surrounding stores including a Speedway gas station next to the Wal-Mart for surveillance footage that may have shown which direction the suspects fled.

(Caitlin Doornbos/Orlando Sentinel) Diapers and other evidence remained scattered across the parking lot as detectives worked the crime scene, Nieves said. Few cars remained in the lot as deputies foraged the area. Yellow crime scene tape stretched around the Wal-Mart and a Citgo gas station across the street as of about noon Saturday, banning potential customers from entering businesses' parking lots. Clarcona Ocoee Road remained open to traffic. Orange County Sheriff's deputies investigate near the scene of the shooting.

Deputies will determine whether charges are warranted for the shooter. No identification was released on any of the individuals involved.  Nieves said there were no other victims. cdoornbos@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6931 Caption Officer disciplined after mistaking doughnut glaze for meth Cpl.

Reward offered for information on 3rd suspect in Walmart theft that led to fatal shooting Updated: Feb 6, 2017 - 6:26 PM Twtter A $5,000 reward is being offered for information on the third person involved in a diaper theft that led to a fatal shooting of another suspect at an Orange County Walmart store.  Deputies said a Walmart customer opened fire on Saturday morning on shoplifters who were stealing diapers from the store in the 5500 block of Clarcona Ocoee Road.  Related Headlines State attorney to decide if man who shot Walmart theft suspect will face charges WATCH: Scene from the Walmart shooting Investigators said 19-year-old Arthur Adams was hit multiple times and died at the hospital. The gunman told investigators he fired because he thought one of the shoplifters was reaching for a weapon. The alleged shooter was identified as a 50-year-old black male, and deputies said it will be up to the state attorney’s office as to whether he will face charges. The man was not a member of law enforcement. Deputies have not said if he was legally able to carry a weapon.   .@OrangeCoSheriffs says @Walmart shooter is 50yo black male. They know, but won't release if he was legally able to carry his weapon @wftv pic.twitter.com/vKTWgNFpEz — Cierra Putman WFTV (@CPutman_WFTV) February 6, 2017   Deputies said he was stepping in to help a Walmart employee who was confronting the suspects outside the store.  A second victim, only identified as a juvenile female, was hit in the leg, deputies said. The Orange County Sheriff's Office learned about the girl hours after the shooting when she went to the hospital for treatment. She is considered a witness in the case, deputies said. A third person believed to have participated in the attempted shoplifting is still on the loose, deputies said. It's the second shooting in a Pine Hills Walmart parking lot in under a month. We talk with concerned customers on @WFTV at noon. pic.twitter.com/PN0QKXchQ6 — Lauren Seabrook (@LSeabrookWFTV) February 4, 2017 Witness Renee Kirmani told Channel 9 she saw the three individuals pushing carts filled with diapers and other baby items to a car in the parking lot as a Walmart employee chased after them. "I see them surrounding the car (and) the boys throwing stuff in," she said. "(The employee) was like, 'Don't get in the car.'" Kirmani said she was too busy taking cover to see the shooting take place. "That I didn't see," she said. "I heard shots and then we just ducked down, because we didn't know where the shots were going." Orange County Sheriff's Office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said the suspects got into the maroon Nissan Rogue and fled the scene. The Nissan was reported stolen during a carjacking on Jan. 13, deputies said.  Deputies said the driver of the Nissan hit two vehicles in the parking lot, causing one of the cars to spin, and everyone in the vehicle fled.  The suspect who was shot was found at a nearby Citgo gas station and was taken to the hospital where he died, authorities said. Deputies said the investigation is ongoing and the witness who opened fire is cooperating with the investigation. Workers at the Citgo told Channel 9 the injured suspect walked in and fell to the floor. They said they could tell he was shot multiple times in the leg and stomach. Deputies said Adams is a known gang member and had been arrested 15 times. He was convicted of four felonies.  His friend, Naynay Porter, said Adams was a good person and should not have died that way. “No mother should have to bury their kid,” she said. “He’s done some things in his past he (isn’t) proud of, but he didn’t have to die how he died.”  Deputies are interviewing witnesses and going through surveillance video to see if the suspects were armed. Channel 9 contacted Walmart to learn about the company’s loss prevention policy, but the company declined to comment. Statement from Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings: "The Orange County Sheriff's Office detectives have been working with Walmart representatives and interviewing witnesses to determine the facts in the weekend shooting at the Wal-Mart store. The investigation is ongoing and we ask the community not to rush to judgement.  The case will be presented to the State Attorney for review and appropriate charges will be determined for all involved. The use of deadly force will be evaluated based on law and the right to protect one's self or others from great bodily harm or death."  © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Ordinary merchandise of the past, often seen as inferior or beset by health and safety concerns, no longer rule the roost. Consumers are moving into more esoteric shopping, with online shopping and imported goods at the forefront. Snack foods, personal care products and cosmetics are among the fastest growing purchasing segments, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Directly imported merchandise comprises 30 percent of purchases at Walmart’s membership-only Sam’s Club, with growth in areas such as imported fruit, premium dried foods and liquor. Walmart, which launched its Lunar New Year sales in early January, saw brisk sales of traditional Chinese delicatessen foods, premium wines and chocolates. Marybeth Hays, chief merchandising, marketing and supply chain officer at Walmart China, said the company sources products from 28 countries and has been stepping up collaboration with local suppliers. “Taking my two-year old son to the supermarket would have been such a tedious task during the busy Spring Festival period, so online shopping was a blessing,” Shanghai resident Miriam Yuan said of her pre-holiday purchases. She ordered traditional Chinese foods for elderly relatives in her hometown of Beijing and had the gifts sent there by courier. Consumers born after the 1980s made up 77 percent of online shoppers who placed orders on Alibaba’s Taobao in the run-up to the Lunar New Year. Some 200 select local specialties foods on Taobao attracted buyers in 365 Chinese cities during the holiday shopping period. Alibaba’s Tmall said its imported goods unit, Tmall Global, doubled the number of categories of goods on its platform to more than 3,700 in 2016. The majority of new Tmall Global shoppers last year came from lower-tier cities, with almost a third from third- and fourth-tier cities in China. That compared with about 24 percent in the existing customer base. “For consumers, buying items directly from their countries of origin assures them that they are getting genuine items, often associated with a particular heritage and craftsmanship,” said Daphne Kasriel-Alexander, consumer trends consultant at market research firm Euronomitor International. This new trend of wanting to see where products originate prompted Taobao to initiate live-streaming broadcasts in late December, allowing shoppers to get a close-up look at the farms producing food for sale. Senior researcher Mo Daiqing at China E-commerce Research Center said digital shopping added a new dimension to the traditional Lunar New Year holiday. “Various promotions through online channels especially local specialty products, also provided a retrospective on traditions that might otherwise have seemed distant to the modern digital generation,” she noted. Foreign consumer companies have also been quick to market their products under a premium mantle. French company L’Oreal last year upgraded dozens of boutique shops in China to offer beauty advisors and storefronts featuring skin and hair care products. L’Oreal Group China Chief Executive Officer Stephane Rinderknech told a media briefing last month that the company will continue to expand its product portfolio according to consumer demand. Last year, the company introduced the Roger & Gallet perfume brand and personal care brand Ultra Doux. Currently, 23 L’Oreal brands are available in the China market. “We believe there’s huge growth potential in the beauty business in China, thanks to the nation’s massive middle class and the rising affluence of more than 200 cities,” Rinderknech said. L’Oreal China e-commerce sales jumped 10-fold in the past five years, and China became the second largest global market for the company in 2015. Korean brands are also favorites of young Asian consumers. Beauty brand Too Cool for School invested US$6 million for a 60 percent stake in a joint venture with Shanghai Too Cool Cosmetics. The venture will market South Korean cosmetics in China. “Brands will have to offer consumers more than just convenience,” said Delon Wang, trends manager for the Asia-Pacific at Mintel. “They will also have to emphasize their ethnic and cultural authenticity.” Consumers are no longer just interested in hunting for bargains online. They also want easier payment systems and faster delivery. They want to try new things from around the world, and they want assurances that paying more means higher quality. At JD.com, sales of items costing a minimum 50,000 yuan (US$7,249) tripled last year, while luxury items attracted more buyers from lower-tier cities than from big metropolises like Shanghai and Beijing. Ahead of Spring Festival, JD.com reported that wine, dried fruits and nuts, and fresh food were the top selling products. Home appliances such as cleaning machines and air purifiers were also among the big sellers. Fresh food sales climbed fourfold, while imported fresh food surged 14-fold, especially among consumers aged 26 to 35.

It’s one of the first big moves by Walmart.com’s CEO Mark Lore, whose company Jet.com Wal-Mart bought last year, as it hopes to answer Amazon’s powerful Prime membership success. Wal-Mart says it will reduce shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular essentials like diapers, pet food and cleaning supplies. Its average shipping time has been three to five days. Starting Tuesday morning, it’s also reducing the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50. That’s still lagging Amazon.com, which offers two-day delivery on millions of products for Prime members who pay $99 annually and get several other perks.

MEXICO CITY — Mexico could slap “mirror” tariffs against U.S. fabric and apparel imports if U.S. President Trump imposes a 20 percent or other duty on Mexican imports, something textile executives say would severely harm cross-border manufacturers and retailers alike. “It would be a good idea if the government did something to compensate against this [the Trump tariff],” said Sixto Mercado, vice president of top trade lobby Canaive’s branch in Jalisco State, home to Guadajara. “We have many apparel exporters here who would be affected.” His comments come as Mexico is set to begin negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement by May to meet Trump’s calls for a rewrite. That said, economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in mid-January that if Trump imposes a tariff or a border adjustment tax, Mexico would pursue “mirror actions.” The statement is an indication of the growing tensions between the two neighboring countries, longtime allies, as Trump pursues his plan to build a wall along the border and claims that Mexico will pay for it. The 20 percent tariff or other duty proposal forms part of the plan to fund the wall. A Facebook post showing an empty Walmart store in Mexico.  Courtesy The U.S. ships roughly $6.5 billion worth of apparel and textiles to Mexico — $4 billion is fabric and $1.2 billion apparel parts, according to Canaive. Conversely, Mexico sends back $4.5 billion worth of clothing and textiles — $3.5 billion of apparel and $1 billion of textiles. A possible trade war has strained diplomatic relations and unleashed a nationalist uproar in Mexico with populist groups calling for consumers to boycott American companies including Wal-Mart, Starbucks and McDonalds. Social media is abuzz with tweets-for-tats urging citizens buy Mexican goods with hashtags such as #AdiosWalmart, allegedly hitting sales at the U.S. discounter’s largest international division.  One tweet showed a Wal-Mart hypermarket in Tepeyac, Guadalajara as empty during peak sale hours on payday. The tweet claimed the store is the retailer’s largest selling in Latin America. A Wal-Mart spokesman said the firm is “monitoring the situation” but had no further comment. If the proposed 20 percent tariff is levied (among other options) to pay for Trump’s border wall and Mexico hits back, “we could grow below zero,” Mercado said, adding that exports could plunge 10 percent, despite a record-low peso. In 2016, the textiles and apparel sector grew 5 percent as strong local apparel sales offset a 4.3 percent drop in U.S. sales. As Mexico flirts with a possible recession, Mixto said local sales could this year grow 7 percent compared to 10 percent in 2016. Amid strong anti-American sentiment, he said local-brand turnover could eclipse U.S. brands for the first time in recent memory. “We have never seen such strong nationalism in Mexico,” Mercado said. “Everyone is being urged to buy Mexican products. This will hit American brand sales.” Many consumers could shun Wal-Mart in lieu of Mexican archrival Coppel or choose to buy at department-store chain Liverpool’s lower-end unit Fabricas de Francia. Mexican fashion designers, long in the shadows, could win consumer hearts. This is bad news for the likes of the Axo or El Palacio de Hierro network, which have grown by bringing aspirational U.S. brands such as ck Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Abercrombie & Fitch south of the border.  An executive at Axo said the 20-brand franchisor has not seen “any sales declines” from the patriotic upsurge and is operating “business-as-usual.” It’s clear Axo and rival Sordo Madaleno, a top architecture firm making a leap into foreign fashion licensing (it just opened Mexico’s first AllSaints outlet) will suffer as consumers tighten their belts and seek “Made in Mexico.” To meet the challenges, Mexican apparel producers are seeking new markets in Central America and Europe with which Mexico has a largely vague free-trade agreement. “Costa Rica, Panama and Central America could be good markets to compete on price and quality but not Argentina and Brazil, because they have very strong industries and brands,” Mercado said. In Europe, Mexican fashion jean labels Oggi and Siete Leguas could make successful forays because they have high-quality products using innovative fabrics and new washing technologies, according to Mercado. “These companies sell premium jeans to Levi’s, Wrangler and True Religion so they could also start selling in Europe.” That will require even more innovation, training and other investment the industry has been slow to pursue. “We need to make more fashion and design and to diversify our exports because we are too dependent on the U.S.,” said Alfonso Zepeda, the man behind Expo Denim, a denim trade fair set to open in Guadjalajara in late May, adding that European expansion should be a priority. “Europe represents a huge opportunity with our low peso,” he said. “There are niches we could exploit. Here in Jalisco we make great coats, cotton knits, denim pants and suits. We could sell these to smaller, H&M-like stores.” Manuel de la O, sales director at sewing machine maker Casa Diaz, echoed views that U.S. consumers would pay for any Trump tariff and that American brands will have a hard time replacing Mexican suppliers, at least right away. “They could send their orders to Vietnam or China and save the 20 percent but then the fleet costs would be 5 percent and the investment and costs associated with the geographical shift could bring that to 13 percent,” said de la O. “If you add to that a 3 to 4 percent [possible] mirror tariff from Mexico, would you sacrifice quality for such a small margin gain?” You're missing something!

(WOFL FOX 35) - Orange County deputies say a man accused of shoplifting from a Walmart has died after being shot by a customer who stepped in to help. Deputies say the 19-year-old suspect died at the hospital after being found a Citgo gas station with gunshot wounds. The shooting happened outside the Walmart Neighborhood Market on Clarcona Ocoee Road. Deputies say the the 19-year-old suspect and three other people were stealing baby items from the store. Deputies say after the suspects ran out of the store with the merchandise, employees followed and a confrontation happened by a car in the parking lot. Investigators say the car the four people were in was reported stolen after a carjacking on January 14. Deputies say a customer came to help the employees, but when the customer felt threatened, investigators say the shopper fired a gun that belonged to him and shot the 19-year-old suspect. Investigators say the suspects then drove off and crashed into two cars in the parking lot before bailing out and running off. The man that was shot ended up at a gas station across the street and later died. Right now, deputies are looking for the other three suspects.

Angelo Nieves, of the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, said an incident started near the vehicle and a witness in the parking lot stepped in to help the employee. “They were fleeing from the store when they were confronted by store personnel,” Nieves said. “Some type of commotion occurred at the vehicle as it was being loaded with the stolen merchandise.”  The witness told deputies it appeared that one of the suspects went to grab something, and the witness, who has not been identified, felt threatened. The witness was armed and opened fire, hitting one of the suspects multiple times, deputies said. He later died. “The individual felt threatened. One of the suspects reached for something, (the witness) thought it was a weapon or a firearm,” Nieves said.  Deputies said the customer believed the suspects were armed and was assisting a Walmart employee who confronted the suspects.— Julie Salomone (@JSalomoneWFTV) February 4, 2017 Nieves said the four suspects got into the maroon Nissan Rogue and fled the scene. The Nissan was reported stolen during a carjacking on Jan. 13, deputies said.  Deputies said the driver hit two vehicles in the parking lot, causing one of the cars to spin. The suspect who was shot by the witness got out of the car at some point and went to a Citgo gas station. The three other suspects are still being sought. Deputies said the investigation is ongoing and the witness who opened fire is cooperating with the investigation. Deputies have not said if the witness will face any charges.

(View our Privacy Policy) Chasing a Midtown supermarket, St. Pete mayors missed signs of trouble By Charlie Frago, Nathaniel Lash and Adam Playford CHARLIE FRAGONATHANIEL LASHTampa Bay Times Saturday, February 4, 2017 1:30pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next ST. PETERSBURG — For the past 15 years, a key issue in mayoral elections has been the success of a single grocery store in the low-income, predominantly black Midtown community. Related News/Archive St. Pete Beach mayor resigns 7 Months Ago St. Pete Beach's mayoral future to be discussed Thursday 7 Months Ago St. Pete Beach accepting applications for interim mayor 7 Months Ago In a city where one in four residents is black, no mayor of St. Petersburg can get elected without the black vote. And few things mean more to key black leaders in the city than efforts to improve Midtown. Since race riots gripped the area in 1996, there has been no more visible symbol of those efforts than the bids by Mayors Rick Baker, Bill Foster and Rick Kriseman to lure and keep a supermarket there, at 22nd Street and 18th Avenue S. There also has been no city project in Midtown that has been more ill-fated than the grocery store in Tangerine Plaza. Twice since 2005, major retailers have opened there, and twice they closed. Most recently, a Walmart Neighborhood Market opted to pull out last month, raising questions about whether the city will be able to attract another retailer to take its place. A Tampa Bay Times examination of the collapsed grocery store deals shows that city leaders haphazardly pulled the initial arrangement together and then missed key opportunities to reconsider it. City leaders entered into a deal in which a local businessman would build and then rent out space in Tangerine Plaza, even though he had never managed the lease of a grocery store before. Under the deal, the city owned the land, but the businessman, Larry Newsome, effectively served as landlord. He set the lease rates and kept the monthly rent payments from the grocery store to operate his own companies. Then, rather than force him to abide by the original lease, the city allowed Newsome to change the terms in a way that left the city exposed if the store failed. After Sweetbay, the first grocery store to try its luck in Midtown, pulled out in 2013, city leaders wooed Walmart despite clear signs Newsome was unable to pay his bills — and was running the management deal into the ground. Three years later, the lease was in foreclosure and its future uncertain as Walmart was weighing whether to stay in Midtown or pull out. It pulled out in January. Now the lease to operate the shopping center is set to be sold at auction in March, and Mayor Rick Kriseman's administration says it intends to get it back. If they don't, whoever walks away with the lease will be able to move onto the city property and potentially operate a non-grocery business there, rent-free, until 2044. That's because Newsome, the original property manager, got a sweetheart deal — a 40-year lease at $5 per year that he paid up front. Asked about the city's decision-making over the past 15 years, Kriseman acknowledged mistakes. "I think in hindsight, and again this is hindsight, you look at everything that happened and clearly there were things that were done or not included in an effort to get it there that probably shouldn't have been done," the mayor said. "There was such an overwhelming desire, I think, to get something for that community." Midtown's residents are still among the poorest in the county, still among the least likely to own a car — and once again without a neighborhood grocery store. Missed opportunities City leaders would sink more than $2 million into it, but the plan to bring a grocery store to Midtown wasn't administered carefully from the start. First, there's no record of city leaders ever doing a market study to ensure people in the area could spend enough money to keep a grocery store in business. That's something other big cities do to measure risk in similar deals, said Donald Spivack, a retired deputy chief of the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles. "You get some sense as to where people are buying stuff now and how far are they traveling to get it," Spivack said. "If for no other reason to get a sense how risky the investment was, on the part of the public dollars they put in." Instead of doing such a study, city officials said they met with potential grocers. Those grocers "indicated it would be a viable location," said Bruce Grimes, the city's real estate director. After deciding to move ahead, the city awarded a lease requiring Newsome, a local financial executive, to develop city land into a shopping plaza in a deal funded through low-interest loans. That entitled Newsome, who had never managed tenants in a large shopping center before, to 99 years of operating the new complex at a cost to Newsome of $5 per year. Despite Newsome's inexperience, city leaders said they were reassured that several major development companies, including the Sembler Co., had signed on to his proposal. But city leaders only reluctantly agreed to go along as Newsome started changing the terms of the deal. Newsome's original lease included a promise that the grocery would never close. If it did, the city could take back its lease. But Newsome told city leaders in 2005 that his prospective tenant, Sweetbay, wouldn't agree to those terms. He said he'd already negotiated a less-stringent deal that would allow the grocer to shut down without breaking its lease. Grimes said was he taken by surprise. City leaders responded by reducing Newsome's lease from 99 years to 40 years. But they didn't hold him to the original terms. Instead, they essentially let him rewrite his own lease to be more lenient. A decade later, Sweetbay had closed, Walmart had opened in its place, and city leaders knew Newsome was falling deeper and deeper into financial trouble, unable to pay the loans he had taken out to finance the shopping center deal. Still, they didn't step in. Instead, they stood by as he went into foreclosure. In August, they had to ask the City Council to set aside $2.2 million, in a bid to buy the lease back from Newsome's lenders. City officials told the Times they "had no right or duty" under the lease agreement to monitor Newsome's finances. In August, Newsome told City Council members he had asked Kriseman's administration for help and was refused. Newsome couldn't be reached for comment despite repeated calls to his cellphone. His voicemail box was full. Signs of trouble Then, once the store was opened, city leaders put varying degrees of effort into checking up on the grocer. When Sweetbay opened, Baker said his deputy mayor, Goliath Davis, kept close tabs on Sweetbay's daily operations. But Foster, Baker's successor, fired Davis in March 2011. Davis declined to comment for this story. After Sweetbay left, a company spokeswoman told the Times that officials met with Foster in April 2011 and warned him business was bad. Foster disputes that, saying he had no warning before Sweetbay closed in early 2013. He said the closing was part of a massive company reorganization. After Walmart came in, history repeated itself. Kriseman designated an economic development official to meet with Walmart managers. That official met with store officials regularly in 2014 and 2015. During those two years, Walmart repeatedly told the official that they were struggling to make enough money, records show. In March 2014, two months after the store opened, Walmart representatives started telling the city that the store wasn't meeting its revenue targets in the last week of each month, according to the city's notes from the meeting. They were still telling the city something similar 20 months later, when the store was described as "near the break-even point" in November 2015. Three months after that, the city stopped having face-to-face meetings with Walmart. Instead, Kriseman spokesman Ben Kirby said, "dozens" of phone calls were exchanged and city volunteers and officials were regularly at a police substation next door to the store. Kriseman said he was surprised when Walmart ultimately left. He learned when the city received a "curt" fax, Kirby said. Walmart declined to comment for this story. But in a meeting last month with state and local officials, Monesia Brown, a Tallahasee-based lobbyist for the retailer, said Walmart had no choice but to close the Midtown store. "It's not on the course we hoped it would be," she said. "We've tried everything we can do." After riots convulsed St. Petersburg in 1996, Midtown residents began delivering city leaders with a consistent message: The community lacked basic services. It needed a bank, a post office and a grocery store. "A grocery store was by far the first choice," said Rick Mussett, a former longtime senior city development administrator. Making good on a promise to deliver a grocery store to Midtown gave Baker a lift in his re-election bid in 2005, when he carried 91 percent of the vote in the Midtown area. There was no disputing that things in Midtown needed to be improved. The area was gripped by poverty and crime. Census records show that rates of car ownership in the area were lower than elsewhere in the city, meaning access to a neighborhood grocer was more important there than in other places. But beyond the symbolism of the city investing in Midtown, it wasn't clear that adding a grocery store would do much to alleviate entrenched problems in the low-income area. Researchers have shown grocery stores have little effect on such larger problems. A 2014 study of a newly opened grocery store in a Philadelphia food desert found that only one in four residents adopted it as their main grocer, and that it made no measurable change to their health, or fruit and vegetable intake. Another study in a section of the Bronx, N.Y., found that 13 percent of people in the neighborhood reported shopping at a new supermarket after it opened. Neither study identified the grocery store they studied, making it unclear whether either is still in business. Poverty remains In Midtown, little has changed since Tangerine Plaza opened, Census records show. Poverty rates remain stubbornly high, with as many as half of the households in the area adjacent to Tangerine Plaza living below the poverty line. In 2013, while the city scrambled to bring Walmart into the space vacated by Sweetbay, a team at the University of South Florida St. Petersburg published a study on access to food in St. Petersburg's poor neighborhoods. Their research showed that even with the Sweetbay grocery store open, many Midtown residents still had limited access to fresh, nutritious food. The closure of Walmart didn't surprise associate professor of geography Rebecca Johns, who co-authored the study. The problems in Midtown, she said, came down to poverty. And being close to a grocery store does little to alleviate that, she said. "There are underlying structural problems that need to be addressed," she said. "Bringing in private entities to solve it is just a band-aid." With Walmart closing, City Council member Lisa Wheeler-Bowman, who was elected in 2015 and represents much of Midtown, said the failures of the grocery stores should be a lesson. "Before we put anything in there, we need to get with residents and see what they want," Wheeler-Bowman said. "It's important we ask them this time. We always ask the community leaders, but we need to ask the regular people who are actually going to patronize these stores." In the community, the reaction to the store's closing was mixed. Some Midtown residents said they only rarely visited the Walmart. Frazier Williams, 57, said the closure didn't faze him. "I take a bus to the north end of town to do groceries" at the shops there, he said. Willie Young said he avoided the Walmart even though he lives only a few blocks away, because he doesn't like the crowds there. He added that he shops for groceries just once a month, when he buys rice and chicken. "I eat cheap," he said. Mohammad Ittayem, who runs a small meat shop not far from Walmart, said it didn't surprise him that Walmart was closing. "The area is just not big enough for big businesses and small businesses together," said Ittayem, whose shop also carries canned goods, sugary sodas, potatoes, lettuce, peppers and lemons. "I have loyal customers who come back here." Others said the closure was the latest in a string of broken promises to Midtown. "They promised to revitalize the Southside," said David Hughes, 52, who grew up in the Gas Plant neighborhood before it was demolished to make way for Tropicana Field. "That was a lie." Others, like Charles Carter, said they'll miss the market sorely. As news of the pull-out spread through the community late last month, Carter sat on a folding chair in front of his house on Queensboro Avenue, just around the corner from Tangerine Plaza, and reflected on what the closure meant for him. A 75-year-old retired truck driver, Carter doesn't own a car, and the nearby market meant he could make regular, quick trips. Now he'll have to take a bus to a more distant store and stock up on frozen foods. "I'm going to have to buy more when I go shopping now, and it's going to have to last longer," he said. "I'm just trying to survive." Contact Charlie Frago at cfrago@tampabay.com. Contact Nathaniel Lash at nlash@tampabay.com. Contact Adam Playford at aplayford@tampabay.com.

McIntyre February 4, 2017 9:10 am EST Print Email Tweet One of the objections investors have about Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), which was evidenced again in its most recent quarter, is that its primary e-commerce business barely makes any money. Indeed, the operating margins of this part of the company were only 0.8%, worse than Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT), according to reports of their most recent earnings. Amazon’s margin across the whole company was 2.9% last quarter, but the strength of the number was provided by Amazon Web Services. North American e-commerce sales were $26.2 billion, on which the company had an operating profit of $816 million. International e-commerce revenue was $14 billion, on which the company lost $487 million. AWS revenue was $3.5 billion, and its operating profit was $926 million. For the entire company, revenue was $43.7 billion, on which Amazon had an operating profit of $1.3 billion. In its fiscal third quarter, which ended October 31, Wal-Mart’s revenue was $117.2 billion, on which it had operating income of $5.1 billion, or 4.3%. Since e-commerce is such a small part of its revenue, the measures are almost entirely from brick-and-mortar sales. This model is supposed to be a disadvantage. Based on operating margin it is not. Amazon management may argue it continues to invest in the future. However, Wal-Mart management would make the same argument as well. Target’s most recent quarter was considered poor. However, its operating margin was strong, as measured against most other large brick-and-mortar retailers. Revenue fell 6.7% to $16.4 billion for the period that ended at the close of October. Operating income was $1.1 billion, up 21.1%. That leaves an operating margin of 6.4%. Almost all large retailers make very little money in the current environment. Amazon makes almost nothing. It has been said over and over that at some point Amazon has to stop experimenting and investing in marketing enough to show a reasonable profit.

Sheriff’s Office spokesman Capt. Angelo Nieves said man left the store at 5559 Clarcona Ocoee Road with three other theft suspects and was attempting to load stolen items into a vehicle just after 8 a.m. when a Wal-Mart employee attempted to stop them. That’s when another Wal-Mart customer came out in front of the store and “assisted” the employee, Nieves said. A “commotion” ensued, and the customer — fearing for his life — shot one of the suspects multiple times. One of the suspects reached for something, [and the shooter] thought that it was a weapon. — Orange County Sheriff's Office Capt. Angelo Nieves       “What we have at this point is that the individual felt threatened — one of the suspects reached for something [and he] thought that it was a weapon or firearm,” Nieves said. “The individual who was assisting the [employee] was armed and used that weapon to fire on the suspect.” The suspects got into their red vehicle, which would later be discovered to have been stolen in a January carjacking, and tried to flee the scene. The car then smashed into two parked cars in the Wal-Mart parking lot, so the suspects bailed out and ran from the scene on foot. Deputies were called to the store at about 8:12 a.m. for a report of a “911 emergency,” according to the Sheriff’s Office’s online list of calls for service. By the time they arrived, the suspects were out of sight. The Citgo on Clarcona Ocoee Road where the shot suspect was caught.

Orange County Fire Rescue medics then took the man to Orlando Regional Medical Center for treatment as a trauma patient. Nieves said the man later died at the hospital. A deputy was checking with surrounding stores including a Speedway gas station next to the Wal-Mart for surveillance footage that may have shown which direction the suspects fled.

Few cars remained in the lot as deputies foraged the area. Yellow crime scene tape stretched around the Wal-Mart and a Citgo gas station across the street as of about noon Saturday, banning potential customers from entering businesses' parking lots.

Yet, myths about its safety abound. False Witnesses reveals the individuals behind these lies. President Trump was reportedly briefed by two male CEOs this morning on policies for “women in the workforce.” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon and Mark Weinberger, chief executive of EY, addressed the subject during Friday morning’s meeting of chief business leaders, according to the Wall Street Journal. Female CEOs were scheduled to attend the meeting to address other topics, including regulation and trade. A class action lawsuit brought on behalf of nearly 1.5 million women who worked at Walmart alleging that it had systematically engaged in gender discrimination was thrown out in 2011 by the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided the group did not qualify as a class. The Court did not rule on whether Walmart was guilty of discrimination. Appreciate our work? Rewire is a non-profit independent media publication.

DONATE NOW The following year, nearly 2,000 women from 48 states filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming the company discriminated against them. In July 2016, gender discrimination suits against Walmart were still being litigated. Friday’s meeting was part of the “President’s Strategic and Policy Forum,” a group of CEOs convened to “meet with the President frequently to share their specific experience and knowledge as the President implements his economic agenda,” according to a December press release on the announcement put out by the Trump transition team. “Members of the Forum will be charged with providing their individual views to the President—informed by their unique vantage points in the private sector—on how government policy impacts economic growth, job creation, and productivity,” said the release. Trump’s campaign platform included some policies that could help women in the workplace, though critics argue his plans fall short. His suggestion for paid family leave, for example, excluded new fathers and workers seeking paid time off to deal with their own health or that of a family member—something advocates say is critical to a robust and effective family leave policy. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter, on Thursday hosted a dinner party for business magnates in which women in the workforce was discussed, according to a Politico report.

The teenager was allegedly loading the merchandise into a stolen vehicle with three to four other people Saturday morning when the customer saw an employee at the Pine Hills store confronting the suspects and attempted to help, the Orlando Sentinel reported. “While helping the employee, the customer felt threatened by one of the suspects, who the customer believed was arming himself,” Orange County Sheriff Capt. Angelo Nieves stated in a press release. WESH-TV A box of diapers rests in the parking lot of a Florida Walmart after an alleged shoplifting incident turned deadly. “The customer who had a firearm of his own fired to defend himself and the suspects all jumped into their red vehicle and attempted to flee,” he stated. WFTV reported that the teenager was shot multiple times. A witness speaking to WESH-TV said she heard as many as eight shots fired. The suspects took off in their vehicle before crashing it into two other cars in the parking lot. They then abandoned the vehicle and took off on foot. The 19-year-old who had been shot attempted to flee into a nearby gas station but collapsed once inside. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead. The suspects’ vehicle was later identified as having been stolen in a Jan. 14 carjacking, Nieves said. No arrests have been made in the case. Authorities said they are still considering whether charges will be pressed against the customer who fired the gun. “We have a situation where someone rendered aid, they provided assistance to someone else. Currently they’re being cooperative and they’re providing information and statements,” Nieves said of the customer at a press conference Saturday.

Today we ask Malcolm Scovil, Head of Business Development at Tophatter, to tell us more about the opportunity and how sellers can sign up. To be honest, when I heard it was an auction based marketplace I was a little sceptical – aren’t auctions a bit 1999 and buyers prefer fixed price immediate purchases today? However the thing Tophatter has going for it is mobile, once you’ve got the app installed and a constant fast moving stream of products instantly available to bid on it’s easy to get a little carried away and start spending. Of course my initial impressions don’t really matter, what counts is can you shift product at scale on Tophatter and will you make margins which are profitable? These are questions we put to Malcolm and he had some interesting answers to share: What is Tophatter? Tophatter.com is the world’s fastest, most entertaining marketplace for mobile shoppers. This week, we’re announcing our launch to the UK online seller community. Over 10 million shoppers around the world discover deals on jewelry, accessories, electronics, beauty, home and other impulse items. Tophatter started 5 years ago in Palo Alto, California. The founders wanted to make shopping more fun and game-like. They created a new buying format around 90 second auctions. Imagine an eBay auction, but just the last two minutes where all the action happens. Can you share some statistics about your business? Tophatter is 5 years old 80 employees Industry-leading 80% sell through rate Average selling price £10 – £40 (up to £100+ for branded items) 500,000 items sold each week 75,000 unique shoppers per day 10 million shoppers 90% of shoppers are women aged 18-65 Over 300,000 new shoppers each month Top seller generates $10 million + per year on Tophatter App available on iOS and Android in US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa. France, Germany, Spain launching soon. What makes Tophatter exciting for UK eBay and Amazon sellers? Tophatter is now a major mobile shopping platform alongside Amazon, eBay, Sears, Walmart and other leading marketplaces. If you’re a professional online seller, there are several reasons to sell on Tophatter. Guaranteed exposure for your products. Every item is featured on the front of the mobile app and website. Move inventory quickly with 80%+ sell through rate. In an age when eBay and other platforms are moving away from auctions, Tophatter re-invented the auction to be faster and mobile optimised for the modern-day shopper. Seller-Focused. We call our sellers ‘Partners’. Our team aims to understand your business goals, help you get started, and sell 500-5,000 items per week. Get started fast. Tools to boost performance, insights to track best-selling products and an Account Manager you can actually speak with on the phone. Only pay when you sell. There are no ongoing monthly fees or listing fees. Alpha Jewelry on Tophatter Alpha Jewelry is a fast-growing jewelry business based on the East Coast of the USA. They sell fashion jewelry on multiple ecommerce marketplaces. They came to Tophatter looking for a new channel to grow sales. In their first full month they sold 500 items. They then added 200 top performing products and scaled within three months to selling over 7,000 products per month. Within six months, they are on track to sell 20,000 items per month.   What makes Tophatter exciting for UK shoppers? Tophatter is a marketplace for shoppers that enjoy game-like, impulse buying. It’s very different to Amazon and eBay. The 90 second auction format means sellers experience the thrill of winning (or losing) in under two minutes. This adrenaline and instant gratification is unique to Tophatter. The most common word we see in shopper reviews is that Tophatter is ‘addictive’. Here is an example: “Addictive!! I found this site to be very efficient and hassle free. It has become a daily habit for me to visit this site at least 10 times a day. Love it!! – Opal M, January 2017 How does selling on Tophatter work? Similar to eBay, sellers list and ship their own items. Sellers simply add their inventory (manually, via CSV, API, ChannelAdvisor, etc) and start seeing sales within a few hours. There are no fees to list or start selling. You only pay when an item sells. How much volume can sellers expect to sell per week? Most new sellers start by adding a few products to test out the platform. Once you’ve added your first 50-100 SKUs sellers see volume growing significantly. New sellers sell 100-1,000 items each week within their first 1-2 months. Top Sellers grow to sell 5,000-10,000+ items per week. What products sell best on Tophatter? Top categories are Jewelry, Apparel, Electronics, Home, Accessories, and other impulse items. Women come to Tophatter to find deals and gifts for themselves and their friends and family. They also shop at Walmart/Asda, QVC, Home Shopping Network, and similar stores. Items in the impulse price range sell best: from £10 – £40. Top SKUs are bracelets, rings, handbags, drones, smart watches, footwear, and similar items. What is the profile of a typical seller on Tophatter? Tophatter sellers are experienced ecommerce sellers and sell on Amazon, eBay, Groupon, and similar marketplaces. Most of them are actively looking for new marketplaces and channels to grow their business. They understand the power of being on a marketplace early. Mid-sized and large sellers receive 500 to 10,000 orders from Tophatter each week. Top Sellers generate millions dollars per year on Tophatter. Increasingly, larger businesses and brands are selling on Tophatter to move impulse items or products for liquidation. How do your selling prices compare to other marketplaces? As a seller on Tophatter, the key metric is Average Selling Price (ASP). Some items sell for more than other marketplaces. Some items sell for less. To get the highest ASP, the key is to set starting prices low so several bidders compete to win your products. What are the mistakes to avoid as a new seller on Tophatter? Hundreds of new sellers joining Tophatter each month. There are 3 common pitfalls we see some new sellers make. 1. Setting starting prices too high Low starting prices drive more bidders. That means a higher average selling price for sellers. 2. Adding a small number of products We recommend that all new sellers add at least 100 products when they start selling. This gives our system enough data to determine what’s selling best so we can sell that item more. It’s easy to add them via CSV. 3. Not leveraging your Account Manager Account Managers help sellers ramp quickly, identify successful products, and give advice on how to scale their account. The Tophatter Seller Hub is also a helpful tool for new sellers. Why are RRPs on your site so high, often in $100s compared to selling prices in low $10s. Is this misleading buyers? As a young marketplace, we are constantly trying to patrol exploitations. RRPs are a bit tricky as they do not apply to everything, they can change, or differ by channel. We have adopted the policy to allow sellers to enter RRPs, but if this is abused it will very likely have a negative result for the seller. After the sale, we do the following to ensure a positive experience moving forward: Offer easy returns If the product is not what the customer was expecting they will receive a refund no questions asked. Throttle undesirable products Inflated RRPs will lead to lower product ratings and reduce the number of times items get scheduled in auctions. How does a consumer know the shipping cost up front (e.g. from a Chinese seller to a UK buyer)? Sellers set shipping prices for each region where they ship. Shoppers see the shipping cost to them (based on their location) marked on the item listing when they are bidding. Where are your sellers mainly based (USA/China/UK/Other)? Most of our sellers are in the in the US. Asia was our second major market that opened last year and is growing well. Now we’re launching to sellers in the UK and Europe as our third major market. The Tophatter app is live for shoppers in the US, UK, Australia, and the UK. It will soon be available in France, Germany, and Spain. As a seller, you only have to list items once and they appear for buyers in all countries where you choose to sell. What is the proposition for sellers (fees etc)? Sellers can simple sign up and get started. There are no ongoing monthly fees or listing fees. Sellers pay an average of £3.00 to £4.00 each time an item sells in an auction and a flat 10% each time an item sells in a Buy Now. This amount is deducted from the payouts sellers receive on the 1st and 16th day of the month. There is a payment processing fee of 2.9% + £0.25 on all transactions. What else would you like to tell Tamebay’s readers? Our approach to launching in Europe is to engage closely with the seller community. We’ll be attending the Spring Fair in February, Internet Retailing Expo in April, and Catalyst Connect in May and look forward to meeting UK and European sellers in person.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Photo: Facebook.com/MissingZoeCampos Image 33 of 33 Missing for 3 years, family offers reward for Texas man 1 / 33 Back to Gallery A Texas man went to Wal-Mart three years ago. Someone spotted him driving away. Since then, John Terry hasn't been seen or heard from. Now, Terry's family and friends have raised $10,000 and Hill County investigators say they're taking a fresh look at what may have happened to him. Haley Carmona, a family friend who is leading a fundraising effort for the reward money, said Terry's two sons and family just want to bring him home. FEW SIGNS: Police found her car, but no other sign of missing Texas woman "We owe it to the family and to the boys and to John to find out exactly what happened," Carmona told KWTX-TV. Terry was last seen Oct. 17, 2014 driving away from the Wal-Mart in Hillsboro. Deputies found his abandoned pickup truck the next day on Hill County Road 2346 with the windows down and the keys still inside. In a puzzling twist, deputies also found blood and other evidence they've declined to discuss in Terry's home. CRUEL DISCOVERIES: 2 weeks, 2 bodies found by search crew, but not the woman they sought Terry, who is listed with Texas Equuisearch and in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons database, was last seen wearing a black shirt with red lettering, a gray ball and jeans. He has brown hair, a full beard, stands 5-foot-9 and weighs about 180 pounds. Investigators ask anyone with information about his whereabouts to call the Hill County Sheriff’s Office at (254) 582-5313. LAWRENCE, MASSACHUSETTS — Family and friends are mourning the loss of a Massachusetts teen who was horrifically beheaded by a classmate. The Boston Globe reports that Lee Manuel Viloria-Paulino disappeared on Nov. 18, leaving behind his phone and wallet. The teen’s family had filed a missing person’s report, but authorities considered him a runaway and largely ignored the case. Two weeks later, a woman walking her dog along the Merrimack River spotted his body near the riverbank. He had been decapitated and gruesomely mutilated. Both arms were hacked below the elbow, and his head was lying about 50 feet away. Police investigating the brutal slaying believe it was carried out by Viloria-Paulino’s classmate, 16-year-old Matthew Borges, but have not disclosed a motive for the murder. Borges was arrested on Saturday after authorities found evidence linking him to the killing. He is expected to be charged as an adult with first-degree murder.

Lock and Dam No. 4 can be seen in the background. As seen on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. Email Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters. Robin Bergstrom always had a vision of getting fitness-minded people safely around Harrison. The township commissioner is closing in on that goal. Bergstrom, in November, landed a $50,000 grant through the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County's Active Allegheny Program. She plans to use it to design upgrades to Harrison's section of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail to make it safer for commuters. Active Allegheny grants are designed to provide assistance to communities to help them develop plans and design transportation projects that increase opportunities for physical activity and provide bicycle and pedestrian connections to local destinations. Harrison is one of the first municipalities to receive a grant from the program, which is only a year old. Harrison's designated trail is passable but not really safe, Bergstrom said. She has concerns about traffic and people walking, biking and using wheelchairs along sections of roadway that don't have sidewalks. “There's so many people right now that walk to Wal-Mart plaza, but there's no sidewalks so they're walking on the street, or they're walking on the curb at some points and kind of doing a tight-rope act,” she said. “I'm a biker myself, so I always wanted it to be as safe as it could for other people to get around.” Planning forward Harrison's designated sections of the trail encompass sections of Broadview Boulevard, Freeport Road and River Avenue. Those areas will be the focus points of the project. Some of the proposed upgrades include handicapped-accessible traffic intersections, adding sidewalks where there aren't any and implementing trail designation signage. Also under discussion is whether one lane of Spring­hill Road, which connects Freeport Road in Natrona Heights to the township's Natrona section, can be transformed into a bike lane. “This has been something I've been thinking about for a while,” Bergstrom said. Bergstrom is sending out design proposals for the project, which will be done in these three phases: • Broadview Boulevard and continue through the Heights Plaza Shopping Center and Alsco Park. • Freeport Road to the Wal-Mart Plaza and Harrison Hills Park. • River Avenue through Natrona. River Avenue will need to be connected to the two sections via Springhill Road, which intersects with McWilliams Drive at Alsco Park. Bergstrom said the trail along River Avenue will be the most difficult to upgrade. On one side, there is the ATI Flat-Rolled Products steel mill and River Avenue. On the other, there are steep banks along the Allegheny River. There will be a need for construction in that area, Bergstrom said, but at this time she is “not sure what to do with it.” “It's a challenge,” she said. Along Freeport Road at the Wal-Mart plaza, Bergstrom has witnessed people using wheelchairs, pushing strollers, and walking and biking along one lane of the road because there aren't sidewalks. She has seen pedestrians and bicyclists moving similarly on Springhill Road. “Someone's going to get hit,” Bergstrom said. She plans to meet with residents and township officials to get their input on the designs. She hopes to complete a conceptual design by July, and a detailed design within six months after that. The township will be applying for subsequent grants for the detailed design and implementation of the upgrades. If those grants are approved, construction could start by as early as summer or fall 2018. “We're real excited,” Bergstrom said. “I think this is an opportunity for us to make the town look good and to provide some healthy options for people, too.” Safety, health, opportunity The goal of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail is to connect Downtown Pittsburgh to Harrison Hills Park, but some parts aren't completed. Upgrades to Harrison's part of the trail will help toward that goal. Upgrading Harrison's section of the trail could draw the attention of more serious bikers because the Allegheny County park offers passage to the Rachel Carson Trail, the Tredway Trail and Freeport-Butler Trail. Though the main goal of the upgrades is to make the township safer and healthier, Bergstrom said there could be some economic benefits. “We definitely think it would help the town ... especially down in the Natrona area, where you have the river­front,” Bergstrom said. “We have a kayak launch, we have a beautiful park down there, we have a dam there where there's fishing. “If people could bike up and they could fish, they could take their kids to the playground as a little stop-off and kind of have a nice little day.” Bob Mulshine is president of the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, which is dedicated to the development, protection and promotion of hiking, biking and walking trails throughout Western Pennsylvania. Mulshine said upgrades to Harrison's section of the Three Rivers Heritage Trail would be beneficial because people are more likely to bike if they have better access to trails. “Freeport Road was upgraded a while back, but it didn't really get a nice shoulder or sidewalks along the side of it, so the main entry to the park is on a road that has fairly fast traveling traffic,” Mulshine said. “Today's day and age, people are busy. If you can roll out of your garage (on your bicycle), you're an awful lot more likely to do that than if you have to get a bike rack put on your car ... drive with that someplace and then have to take it off.” Madasyn Czebiniak is a Tribune-Review staff writer.

As the economy worsens, the need to move product decreases, and more people are willing to sign on to drive despite the stresses of long distance hauls. Tim Dominick tdominick@thestate.com i By Jeff Wilkinson jwilkinson@thestate.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The signs are everywhere. You pull up to your favorite fast-food restaurant, and they have posted “Now hiring all levels.” Or the lines at the big box discount stores are longer. These are all signs that the economy, which reeled for years through the Great Recession, is not only on the mend, but is rolling. “Those long lines at Wal-Mart mean two things,” said Lewis Gossett, chief executive of the South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance, whose membership is beginning to feel the pinch of higher production demands coupled with a tightening job market. “More people are buying things, and the store can’t find enough help. “People have more options today,” he said. “And they are stepping up to the next level of work.” Here are five lesser-known indicators that the economy is moving in the right direction: Eating out Spending on food service from both South Carolina residents and out-of-state visitors rose to $3.9 billion in 2015 from $2.8 billion in 2009, at the end of the Great Recession, according to the state Department of Parks and Recreation. Bobby Williams, chief executive of the local restaurant chain Lizard’s Thicket, said his stores have seen a 10 percent increase in sales since 2010. And he expects that momentum to continue. “We’re a good barometer about what is going on,” he said “If our business is good, everybody’s business is good.” Williams is president of the Columbia Restaurant Association, a division of the S.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association. He noted the large number of new restaurants that have opened in Columbia in recent years, particularly in the Vista, and said it was an indication an improving economy. “The Vista is booming and everybody is happy,” he said. Lizard’s Thicket has 14 locations around the Columbia area and one in Florence. The biggest growth in the franchise, he said, is in the Blythewood store. Williams said the company is beginning an aggressive refurbishing program for its stores this year, “and maybe expansion in the future.” Travel Like restaurants, hotels are riding the improving economic wave. People have more disposable income, and they feel more secure that their jobs are safe. So they are willing to take a vacation. S.C. Parks and Recreation statistics show spending on hotels in the state skyrocketed to nearly $3 billion in 2015 from $1.9 billion in 2009. “I think we’re going to continue to improve in terms of occupancy and rate per room,” said Andrew Lucas, general manager of The Inn at USC/Wyndam Garden Columbia. “We felt the bottom back in 2008. Since then people have started traveling again.” Adding to the rise in the economy are the growing travel habits of millennials, he said. “They are looking for new experiences,” said Lucas, who also is president of the Columbia Lodging Association, also a chapter of the S.C. Restaurant and Lodging Association. “They are willing to spend money on those experiences and not so much on things, possessions. That’s going to help drive our occupancy.” But tapping into that millennial vein will take a new type of marketing in a new economy: social media. “We’re going to have to be on our game because you can’t hide a bad experience anymore,” Lucas said. “One bad review will kill you.” Truck drivers Oddly enough, truck drivers – or the lack thereof – is a huge indicator of which way the economy is moving. As the economy improves, more freight must be moved and more jobs become available. As the economy worsens, the need to move product decreases, and more people are willing to sign on to drive despite the stresses of long distance hauls. Rick Todd, chief executive of the South Carolina Trucking Association, said freight companies are always looking for drivers. “But when the economy ticks up, the situation is exacerbated,” he said. “When there are slowdowns, it takes the pressure off.” The American Trucking Associations posted the shortage at about 20,000 nationally in 2011. But the group estimates that number could grow to nearly 100,000 by the end of this year. “When there is more competition for jobs, there are more people willing to drive,” Todd said. “When the economy improves and you increase freight demand, you need more drivers.” He added that millennials are turning a cold shoulder to the industry: Only one half of 1 percent of drivers 18 to 21 years of age have a commercial drivers license. Drivers 52 and older carry 45 percent of the commercial licenses, and they are nearing retirement. “We’re staring down the barrel of a gun,” Todd said. Shortage of workers Another shortage that could have even more lasting ramifications in South Carolina are high-skill manufacturing jobs. A University of South Carolina study shows jobs requiring a college degree, including from two-year and four-year programs, will jump from 61.5 percent in 2013 to 66.7 percent in 2030. A national study by the Deloitte Manufacturing Institute shows that over the next decade, nearly 3.5 million manufacturing jobs will likely have to be filled, resulting in 2 million of those jobs going vacant. For Gossett, of the S.C. Manufacturing Alliance, keeping up with that curve is vital to the state’s economic future. “It’s a bad situation right now,” he said. “The entire country is dealing with a skill shortage and we think it’s going to intensify. If a state wants to remain competitive, they are going to need to be on top of the workforce issue.” South Carolina might be more at risk than other states, he said, because it has a small population and some big-hitting, rapidly expanding manufacturers like Boeing and BMW – with more, like Volvo and DaimlerChrysler, on the way. But Gossett said he is confident the state, through its strong technical school system and private initiatives, can rise to the challenge. “We’ve always met the need and and we will continue to meet the need,” he said. Home remodeling versus purchasing When the economy was in the dumps, not only was it harder to qualify for a loan to purchase a house, but many people chose simply to remodel their existing homes in the face of financial uncertainty. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in South Carolina in 2016, annual employment growth for new construction was approximately 9 percent, compared to just 6 percent for remodeling construction. By contrast, in 2014, remodeling construction employment growth was approximately 5 percent new compared to just 3 percent for construction employment growth. “As the economy has improved, more people have become employed and have more disposable income,” said USC economist Joseph Von Nessen. “In addition, those that were already employed are more confident that they will remain employed for the foreseeable future. “This has resulted in a shift in consumer buying patterns towards the purchase of new homes and away from the remodeling of existing homes,” he said. Leisure spending in South Carolina The amount of money spent on dining, hotels, transportation and recreation in South Carolina is growing steadily. It’s an indication that the economy is on the mend. 2009 – $9.9 billion 2010 – $10.8 billion 2011 – $11.8 billion 2012 – $12.6 billion 2013 – $13 billion 2014 – $13.5 billion 2015 – $14 billion SOURCE: S.C.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

News Border & Baja California With Trump, a resurgence of Mexican nationalism at the border What you need to know about the border in San Diego and the wall What you should know about the U.S.-Mexico border and the wall Trump has ordered. What you should know about the U.S.-Mexico border and the wall Trump has ordered. Sandra DibbleContact Reporter Tijuana can seem highly Americanized, its parking lots crowded with California license plates, its avenues dotted with U.S. fast-food outlets, even the presence of Walmart and Home Depot stores in the city’s farthest reaches. But  for all the trappings of U.S. culture, many residents of this city have been holding fast to their Mexican identity in recent days. A wave of nationalism unseen for decades has swept across Mexico since Donald Trump assumed the U.S. presidency — and the sentiments have reached as far as northern border cities such as Tijuana. But the feelings play out differently in a city where the border is a daily reality, where business and political leaders often have houses in both countries, and where many residents routinely cross to study, shop, work, bank and visit family. “We feel aggrieved, and we feel offended,” Gilberto Leyva Camacho, president of the Tijuana Chamber of Commerce. “There is no need for so much aggression toward a neighboring country when we’ve been brothers all our lives.” Leyva, whose Tijuana used car business depends on importing U.S. vehicles, is among those calling for residents to temporarily refrain from shopping in San Diego. One group linked to Mexico’s Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, is sending a message largely through social media: “Don’t cross to the other side!” from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Sunday, to “let Trump know that we have dignity.” It would be the first  such boycott since Operación Dignidad in 1994, which urged Tijuana residents to avoid crossing the border in protest of California’s Proposition 187 ballot initiative that sought to deny unauthorized immigrants state health care, education and other services. Some counter that boycotts of San Diego businesses are the wrong approach — that they hurt some of Mexico’s staunchest supporters, and that the times call for joining forces. “I hope that this dynamic of separation does not settle in,” said Gustavo Fernández De León, director of Colegio Eiffel, a private school in downtown Tijuana, and a former president of the business group Coparmex. ”We are a region and no one can deny this.” In San Ysidro, where shops look to Mexican customers for 90 percent of sales, merchants are watching anxiously. “I empathize and sympathize with them,” San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce executive director Jason Wells said of the boycott proponents, even though he disagrees with their tactic. “But we’re the same team.” Trump’s calls for Mexico to fund an extended border wall and for a tax on imports have signaled a new era in U.S.-Mexican relations. Despite uncertainty over the future, “one thing is clear,” the Mexican historian Lorenzo Meyer wrote in a column last month in the Mexico City newspaper Reforma. “The bilateral relationship has suffered a drastic change, and neither the Mexican government nor Mexican society can pretend that after the storm there can be a return to business as usual.” Still, many border groups are fighting to maintain their cross-border relationships even as strains have developed at  the national level. Among them: The CaliBaja Bi-National Megaregion Initiative, an umbrella organization for seven economic development groups in the United States and Mexico, which promotes  a single economic region spanning San Diego County, Imperial County and the state of Baja California — an area with  more than 6.5 million residents and a combined gross domestic product of more than $210 billion and a workforce of 3.3 million. Mexican nationalism Mexican nationalism has its roots in the 19th century, forged during turbulent decades that saw it emerge from Spanish colonialism, fight off French intervention and lose a large amount of territory in the Mexican-American War. A period of intense economic interaction with the United States over the past thirty years led to a softening of the intensity of Mexican nationalistic sentiments, said Tonatiuh Guillén, president of the  Colegio de la Frontera Norte, a Tijuana-based think tank known as Colef. Massive migration to the United States has also changed the equation: Today some 12 million U.S. residents are Mexican-born, and their 11.5 million offspring have a right to Mexican citizenship, Guillén said.   In Mexico, “having a family member, a contact, a friend, an acquaintance in the United States has become part of the reality of our lives,” Guillén said. That has resulted in interactions that have made “our nationalism far more complex,” he added. Tijuana’s proximity to California, a state whose leaders have spoken out against Trump’s immigration stances, can serve to temper nationalistic sentiments, said Guillén. But a brief border boycott can send an important message, by highlighting “the size of our interactions, their importance, and that is worthwhile,” he said. In the two weeks since Trump launched his term, many Tijuana residents have been looking toward Washington, D.C.— and also south to Mexico City, watching carefully as the country’s leaders respond to the new U.S. president.

A giant Mexican flag flies on Thursday above Tijuana's Cuartel Morelos, a military base near downtown. (Alejandro Tamayo / The San Diego Union-Tribune) Giving a rare news conference late last month in the Mexican capital, billionaire Carlos Slim called for an ambitious infrastructure program and other measures to strengthen the country’s economy. “The best fence is made up of investments, economic activity and opportunities for employment in Mexico,” Slim said, adding that “people leave because they don’t have economic opportunity.” On Wednesday, President Enrique Peña Nieto presided over re-launching of the “Made in Mexico” brand by the federal  government and private sector, in a ceremony that highlighted products such as tequila, avocado, organic coffee, beer and flat-screen televisions. In Tijuana, the influential business umbrella group, Consejo Coordinador Empresarial on Tuesday initiated its own “consume in Mexico” campaign — but remained staunchly opposed any effort to discourage shoppers from crossing into California. On both sides of the border, much of the public discussion has taken place through social media. In Tijuana, many have taken to posting images of the Mexican flag on their Facebook pages. Jaime Cháidez Bonilla, a Tijuana cultural critic, explained his disinterest in renewing his U.S. visa. “It seems like an indignity to walk, line up for two hours, and wait for an inspector to look at you in the face and deign to allow you to pass to ‘the other side’,” he wrote on his Facebook page that is widely followed by members of the city’s cultural community. The first seven days of the Trump administration confirmed his decision to not renew his U.S. visa, he wrote and added: “I will never again travel to the United States.” Early Thursday at Tijuana’s Hotel Marriott, members of the civic group Los Madrugadores saluted the Mexican flag before launching into their monthly meeting. Pablo Vera, a professional property appraiser in Tijuana and former president of the group, said he plans to increase his consumption in Mexico — but will not stop crossing the border to meet with Mexican clients who live in San Diego. The crisis in relations, “has caused us to go back to identifying with our country, and that is a very good thing,” Vera said. “It’s awakened this feeling that we don’t need to depend so much on the United States.” But for the many who have dual U.S.-Mexican citizenship, the issues are not so clear-cut. San Diego resident Bertha Fridman, a Mexico native and naturalized U.S. citizen, was among the customers who crowded on Thursday morning into Tamales Colorado, small storefront in downtown Tijuana. Carrying away bags filled with steaming tamales, Fridman spoke of her allegiance to both countries.  “I love Mexico, I love the people, I love the food, I love everything,” said Fridman, who owns a post office box and money exchange business in San Ysidro. “But I love the United States also, it opened its doors to me, and it is thanks to the country that I have work.”   sandra.dibble@sduniontribune.com @sandradibble   Privacy Policy Copyright © 2017, The San Diego Union-Tribune Mexico Donald Trump The Home Depot US Politics Latest Most Popular Today's Paper Jobs Homes Cars Contact Us 60°

Phone scam targets granny By Lisa Redmond, lredmond@lowellsun.com Updated:   02/03/2017 07:32:43 AM EST Gilberto Baez LOWELL -- A 77-year-old Springfield, Missouri, grandmother was stunned when she received a phone call from a "prosecutor" Monday morning saying she needed to wire $2,500 to bail out her grandson who was charged with drunken driving after causing a serious motor-vehicle accident. When her grandson was put on the phone, his voice "didn't sound right," but she was told his mouth was injured in the accident, according to court documents. The grandmother immediately went to the bank, withdrew $2,500 and wired the money via a MoneyGram. Nearly 1,500 miles away at the Walmart at 333 Main St. in Tewksbury, Tewksbury police allege that 28-year-old Gilberto J. Baez, of Lawrence, used a fake Maryland driver's license in the name of Ronny Boggs to pick up the money. But because the store has had previous cases involving the same type of scam, the store's loss-prevention agent was suspicious and contacted the Tewksbury police. As Baez walked out the door toward a waiting car, he walked straight into police handcuffs. In Lowell District Court on Tuesday, Baez, of 162 Spruce St., Apt. 2, Lawrence, was released on $750 cash bail after pleading not guilty to charges of larceny over $250 by false pretense and forge/misuse of a RMV document (two counts). He is scheduled for a pretrial hearing on March 30. Tewksbury police say Baez is also being investigated with a similar incident at the Walmart in Methuen. When Tewksbury police spoke to Baez, he presented a Maryland driver's license that belonged to Ronny Boggs, 28. Advertisement Police noted the graphics on the driver's license were of poor quality, suggesting it was a fake. A check of a driver's license in Massachusetts and Maryland under the name of Ronny Boggs showed nothing, police said. Surveillance footage from Walmart showed the suspect and another man enter the store and cash the MoneyGram for $2,500. Once he was arrested, a pat search revealed items to that indicated the suspect's real name is Gilberto Baez, who had two warrants for his arrest in Lawrence District Court for operating with a suspended license and distribution of a Class A drug, possession to distribute a Class A drug and possession to distribute cocaine. When police contacted the Missouri grandmother by tracing the transaction number, she said she knew she had been scammed when she received a second call, hours later, from the same caller. During the second call, she was asked her to send another $2,500 because the charges had been upgraded because the pregnant victim's baby had died. "At this point, she grew suspicious and called her grandson who answered and was fine," police said. "She realized she had become a victim of a very popular nationwide 'grandparents' scam."

It only took nine seconds for a drug investigation for the Sallisaw Police Department and Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office to go wrong. In the video you can see officers making contact with the suspect's vehicle. As officers make contact with the suspects, a takedown vehicle enters the Walmart parking lot before the suspect's vehicle takes off. "The suspect's vehicle backs up and when he backs up is when he hits the officer and drags that officer approximately 30 feet and hits a curb there in [the] Walmart parking lot," Sallisaw police captain Jeff Murray said. Officers then began firing shots. "I believe there were eight rounds fired total," Murray said. "The shots were fired at the suspect to end the threat of being run over again. The officer was already struck once by the vehicle, but the vehicle was coming at him again." The three suspects in the car, Joshua Rose, Crystal Rose and Duane Bryant were all arrested after a short pursuit by police. The suspect's car was hit five times by the gunfire, some shots just inches away from where the driver was sitting. "They're extremely lucky," Murray said. "Where the vehicle was in relation to the officers was a close proximity." Officer Blake Brunk was the officer hit by the vehicle and has been released to return back to work when he is ready. "He's doing better," Murray said. "He's up and mobile, still sore, but he is up and around." The other officer involved has also been released to return to work. Police said the meeting at Walmart was set up by the suspects. Officers never expected it to end with gunfire and an injured officer. "Everything from a regular traffic violation, stopping somebody, can escalate," Murray said. "An incident can escalate to the point of gunfire." The driver of the vehicle is facing several charges including aggravated assault on a police officer and felony eluding. The two passengers are facing drug charges, among other charges.

That's the warning from Julianne King, who narrowly avoided a scam that could have cost her $2,500. "People are calling, saying they're from Microsoft, they have you go to the computer and claim they owe you money," the Culver woman said after receiving such a call Thursday afternoon. After receiving money — actually just a hacked transfer from her savings account — King was instructed to buy iTunes gift cards at Wal-Mart and send along the numbers to the caller, who roused King's suspicion from the get-go. "I had him on the phone for over an hour," King said. "I kept trying to trip them up, but they had an answer for everything." When she got to Wal-Mart, an employee stopped her and told her that another woman came in buying $3,000 in gift cards — they both were being scammed, the employee said. King ran to the bank and froze her accounts, but the caller was persistent. "I think people need to know — they just keep hounding you," King said. "I had to turn off my cellphone and landline because he wouldn't stop calling." Companies do not call customers regarding viruses, security or software or with offers of money, and they certainly cannot require you to give them iTunes gift card codes. "These scammers take advantage of your reasonable concerns about viruses and other threats," says the Federal Trade Commission. "But the purpose behind their elaborate scheme isn't to protect your computer; it's to make money." The FTC urges people not to rush to a decision when facing an unknown caller, even if it sounds like the call is coming from a reputable business. The FTC also says to keep credit card, bank account or Social Security numbers to yourself no matter what. The FTC says to immediately hang up on pre-recorded calls that are trying to sell something. If your number is on the National Do Not Call Registry and someone calls anyway, it is most likely a scam, the commission says. Telephone scams are as old as the telephone, and internet scams are as old as the internet. Avoiding scams online means not trusting email and especially email attachments from people you don't know. The FTC and security experts also recommend frequently changing passwords and making them strong and unguessable — and never the same across multiple accounts.

Police initially responded to the Walmart on Main Street in Ephrata for a car illegally parked in a handicapped space. Officers saw Felix enter the car with unpaid merchandise, including a $300 security system. Felix was charged with retail theft and taken to Lancaster County Prison on a separate warrant. He was later released on Jan. 25, police said. Surveillance footage caught Felix stealing the same security system at around 9:50 a.m. Jan. 26 at Wal-Mart. Additional retail theft charges have been filed for the second incident, police said.

(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) By John Wagner and Max Ehrenfreund By John Wagner and Max Ehrenfreund February 5 Follow @WPJohnWagner Follow @MaxEhrenfreund It could in theory be a perfect solution for President Trump — a “border adjustment tax” that helps him deliver corporate tax relief or a big infrastructure package, while potentially bolstering U.S. manufacturers and allowing him to claim that his marquee campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has been paid for. But it might never happen. Trump first panned the idea as “too complicated.” Then his press secretary floated it late last month as a way to make Mexico pay for the wall. Soon after, the White House started to back away, claiming that the policy shift being pushed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) is only one of many options under discussion. The early tensions over the tax plan and the mixed signals being sent by the White House provide a glimpse into what could become a major intraparty rift as Congress considers how to pay for the border wall and enact new tax cuts. House Republicans are counting on a windfall from a border adjustment tax to fund broader tax relief, but Senate Republicans remain cool to the idea, with some even mocking its potential consequences. “Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said in a tweet. “Mucho Sad.” The White House’s position is, at best, inconsistent. “This is a source of very heated debate, even within the conservative community,” said Stephen Moore of the Heritage Foundation, a proponent of the border adjustment tax who advised Trump during his campaign. “It’s not going anywhere if you can’t at least rally Republicans around it.” Moore lamented that he did not spend more time pushing the idea on Trump when he had his ear. “I never had a chance to sit down and explain it to him. If I had, I think I could have told him it would accomplish a lot of what you want to do.” Democrats are poised for the fight, promising to argue that the tax would raise the cost of imported merchandise at Walmart and other retailers, hitting the very working-class voters who helped carry Trump to victory. Republicans also are facing a political dilemma of their own making. After years of deriding any tax increase as a burden on the economy, they find themselves trying to sell a more nuanced view, arguing that the border adjustment tax will be good for the taxpayers overall, even if it hits some businesses and consumers more than others. Under the House Republican plan, corporations would no longer have to include sales from exports when calculating their income for tax purposes. Meanwhile, profits on exports would be free of taxation. In the short term, the plan would generate a lot of money for the federal government. Since the United States imports more than it exports, the new taxes on imports would more than make up for the big break on exports. The plan would yield about $1.2 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. That could allow Trump to move forward with a plan to cut corporate taxes to 15 percent from the current level of 35 percent. The proposal could bolster the manufacturing sector, including in Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Ohio that propelled Trump to the White House. Boosters of the House GOP plan say that the new system would be a boon for U.S. producers who compete with goods and services from overseas — although there is disagreement among economists about whether the system would accomplish that goal. And, as the White House suggested, a small fraction of the revenue raised from the tax could fund the $12 billion to $15 billion estimated cost of Trump’s wall — though whether that meets the definition of Mexico “paying for” the wall is another matter. Longtime Washington observers say it’s possible that the fate of the House GOP tax plan could become intertwined with that of Trump’s promise for a massive infrastructure package — an idea about which Republican leaders are lukewarm. Both initiatives are likely to be taken up in earnest in the spring. Trump has said he would like to see more than $1 trillion invested in the nation’s aging roads, bridges, airports and other critical infrastructure, though that initiative is expected to rely heavily on private-sector spending. If Trump comes on board, he faces a major sales job in the Republican-controlled Senate, said Jim Manley, a former senior aide to former Senate minority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). “The question is whether he could move them by the sheer force of his personality or an onslaught of tweets,” said Manley, now a Washington lobbyist. The border adjustment tax being pushed by House Republicans differs from the “border tax” that Trump mused about on the stump and on Twitter. Trump has been vague about his intentions, but the tax could be focused more punitively on particular companies and raise only a fraction of the revenue envisioned under the House GOP plan. Proponents of the broader House plan say that the current international tax system unfairly penalizes American companies. “We lose both here and abroad,” Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “This means today Chinese steel is cheaper here in the U.S. than American steel. Mexican beef and autos are cheaper than American beef and autos. Foreign oil is cheaper than American oil.” Many economists, however, doubt that the GOP plan would have any real benefits for U.S. firms competing with foreign companies. They argue the price of the dollar in global currency markets would climb in response to the tax, canceling out any advantages for U.S. producers. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports relatively more expensive, and imports relatively cheaper. Trump’s only public comments about the border adjustment tax have cast cold water on the idea. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, he called the idea “too complicated.” But that was before the kerfuffle late last month, when White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that a 20 percent tax on goods coming in from Mexico would cover the cost of building the border wall. His comment was widely interpreted as an endorsement of the broader House GOP plan — but Spicer and other White House aides said later in the day that it was meant as just one possible way for paying for the wall. Adding to the confusion, Peter Navarro, the head of Trump’s National Trade Council, went on CNBC the following day and said, “There’s no question that we need a border adjustable tax of some kind.” But, he added, “It’s one that has to be flexible.” Navarro suggested that Japan and Germany be treated differently, for example, which is not what the House GOP plan envisions. Navarro was also asked what other leading advisers to Trump think about the idea. “They should speak in their own words,” he said, adding that he was sharing only his views. A request by The Washington Post to interview Navarro was referred by the White House to Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council. Cohn’s office said he was unavailable. In a CNBC interview Friday, Cohn said a border adjustment tax is “one of the options that is on the table” and suggested that revenue from the tax could help the administration achieve its other goals. Trump advisers began tax talks in early January in a meeting with Ryan and his team. Even aides to Ryan acknowledge there is a major education effort ahead to get lawmakers and others to understand the border adjustment tax proposal. But the lack of consensus among economists over the benefits and drawbacks of the idea has made rallying support behind it challenging. The Republican plan “has turned out to be like a Rorschach test,” said Edward Kleinbard, a legal scholar at the University of Southern California. “People can see in it anything they choose.” politics Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

At each step, jihadist handlers kept in constant touch with their recruits through encrypted messaging applications, right up to the men's arrest in June. (Atul Loke/The New York Times)(ATUL LOKE) By The New York Times HYDERABAD, India -- When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India's major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims. For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State's first strike on Indian soil. They vetted each new member of the cell as Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement. And from Syria, investigators believe, the group's virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots. Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here in June, the Islamic State's cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times. As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Yazdani's offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by ISIS whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet. In the most basic enabled attacks, ISIS handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws in order to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their ISIS interlocutors, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Texas, were initially labeled the work of "lone wolves," with no operational ties to ISIS, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group's method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training. Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State's name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group. "They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process -- from radicalization to recruitment into a specific plot," said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. "If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack." Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Yazdani's case presents one of the most detailed accounts of how ISIS is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group's reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York. "I fear this is the future of ISIS," said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. A diverse portfolio Until roughly a year ago, ISIS recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a "hijrah," the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad's journey to escape persecution in Mecca, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticized videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the Islamic State's most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, al-Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group. But by late spring 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both U.S. and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was al-Amrik, who was killed along with his wife on April 22 when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa'ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of ISIS' "external attack planners" who "actively sought to harm Western interests." The Defense Department's account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Yazdani, al-Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across the United States, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus, Ohio; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester, New York. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Lutchman reached out to al-Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. "Dream come true," al-Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint. Instead, the handler suggested Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year's Eve -- less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an "operation" and kill "1000000s of kuffar," al-Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other "brothers" to take part. They stayed in contact as Lutchman went to Wal-Mart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar's customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an FBI informant. At the time of his arrest, Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler's voice, or saw so much as photograph of him, according to the court filings. By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadis, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, ISIS operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other ISIS colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Ohio, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, ISIS announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. "If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad," the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. Local assets At the time al-Amriki was killed in April, he had been exchanging messages with Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria. One of eight children, Yazdani, 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad's Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching ISIS online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate. "Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion," Yazdani told investigators from India's National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company. He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group's preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with al-Amriki. "I created a Telegram ID," Yazdani told investigators, "and sought his guidance to reach Syria." After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Yazdani get a visa, al-Amriki's directions changed course: "He asked me to work for IS by staying in India itself." It was a period in which ISIS was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, al-Amriki handed off Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, "WindsofVictory." His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi. The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves "Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind," the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name. At the end of May, Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men's interrogations. "It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white color polyethylene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles)," Mohammed told investigators. "We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment." When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops the handler set up for them. Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees -- around $1,000 -- and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons. Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said. The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork. As soon as Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive. Once that system was in place, the handler told Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a "bayah," to ISIS' leader. Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email. By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men's pledge of allegiance to ISIS. The file was uploaded around the time Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said. The men's families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them. One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer. Global reach Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the ISIS stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone. The first time officials in Europe described an attack as having been "telecommande," or remote-controlled, was in spring 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg. When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times. "OK, brother, now pay attention," one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. "Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Megane," the message said. "Look at the front right tire -- you'll find the keys placed on top." The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched. Later, French investigators said they had found that Ghlam's handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join ISIS. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Ghlam's plot. Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially "quarterbacking" the attack: "They're from there, so they can essentially tell someone, 'OK, go 10 yards and go this way." Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects' phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world. In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager's handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax -- "The damage would be much greater," the handler advised -- but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. "I want to enter paradise tonight," he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper. In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organizing for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who molded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money. In several investigations, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home. Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said. Weak Links While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed ISIS to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks. Instead of opening fire on a church, Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the ISIS recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself. The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest. "He didn't even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up," said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is one of the Islamic State's most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group's capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the Myanmar Embassy. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of al-Amriki's followers in Hyderabad. The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mohammed's home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. "We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste," Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to "cook the rice." By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mohammed's home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

Kalanick wrote to his employees that he'd spoken with Trump on Thursday to "let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that." His departure came on the eve of the first meeting of the group at the White House, planned for Friday. Disney CEO Bob Iger won't attend either; instead he will be at a company board meeting in California, according to a person close to Iger who requested anonymity to discuss the CEO's schedule. White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. Led by Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and chief executive of the private equity group Blackstone, the council has about 15 members, including the leaders of Wal-Mart, Tesla, the Cleveland Clinic and Pepsi. The council is "designed to provide direct input to the president from many of the best and brightest in the business world in a frank, non-bureaucratic, and nonpartisan manner," according to a Blackstone press release in December announcing its formation. Yet public outcry about Trump - specifically his executive order suspending the country's refugee program and halting other aspects of immigration - has put some business leaders in an uncomfortable spot. Uber, a ride-sharing company popular in urban, largely Democratic areas, has been buffeted all week by boycott campaigns that began when people perceived it as trying to break a taxi strike to and from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport that was in response to the executive order. Kalanick condemned the executive order and has contributed to relief groups, but calls for a boycott had continued. One woman urging boycotts for all companies tied to Trump said only total resignation from the Trump business forum would satisfy her. "This is not a 'seat at the table' moment. This is a flip-the-table moment," said Shannon Coulter, one of the organizers of the anti-Trump social media campaign "Grab Your Wallet." Other forum members said they'd keep their commitment. Toby Cosgrove, CEO of the Cleveland Clinic, is planning to attend. "He has an opportunity to talk directly to the president, and that is a good opportunity," said spokeswoman Eileen Sheil. Sheil said the clinic employs doctors and caretakers from many countries, and was directly affected by the travel ban. She said a Sudanese citizen who is a first-year resident at the Cleveland Clinic is stuck in Sudan and unable to return to work. General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra remains a member of the advisory group and plans to attend the Friday meeting, spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk said in a statement that he'd attend. He said he and others on the council "will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy."

(Photo Illustration by Johannes Hart/New York Daily News) BY Ross Barkan SPECIAL TO THE DAILY NEWS Sunday, February 5, 2017, 5:00 AM An infinitesimal number of people in human history know what it's like to possess many millions or billions of dollars. Money to keep your descendants rich long after you're dead. Money to follow whatever impulse coursing through your brain. Money beyond all reason. Money that tends to surround you with people who praise you at every turn and nod when you speak. Donald Trump, by most accounts, is the wealthiest person to ever occupy the White House, though details of his income and wealth won't be known until he releases his tax returns, which will probably be never. His cabinet-in-waiting and inner circle is undoubtedly the richest ever assembled. Betsy DeVos, Wilbur Ross and Linda McMahon are all billionaires. Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, is worth hundreds of millions. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, occupies a similar stratum, and the architect of Trump's apocalyptic nationalism, Steve Bannon, is an alt-right mogul who has earned a fortune from Seinfeld royalties, despite never working on the show. Being extraordinarily rich, either through inheritance or hard work or some combination of the two, may or may not be an indicator of aptitude. But one thing is certain: With great wealth comes great confidence. If you've acquired a fortune in the private sector, and the swagger to match, the public sector must seem wholly tamable, crammed with bureaucrats who've never had a "real job" or had to claw for a paycheck in a world without discernable safety nets. "I alone can fix it," Trump declared at the Republican National Convention, a show of hubris that comes with believing you've amassed enough money to do just about anything — including running the United States of America. It wasn't the first or last time Trump saw a straight line between business-world success and a string of certain victories in public service. "I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far," Trump boasted in 2015, shortly before he kicked off his campaign. "Nobody's ever been more successful than me." The fatal flaw in Trump's psychology is endemic to many wealthy people who attempt new ventures. Prior spectacular success (Trump's business triumphs are debatable, but he at least has enough money to campaign in a private jet) clouds doubt, and a messianic assumption takes hold: Whatever I do, it must be right. For New Yorkers, this mindset was often evident in a man who would go on to become Trump's harsher critics, Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg, the self-made billionaire and former three-term mayor, was transformative, rightly recognized for leading the nation in banning indoor smoking, repurposing post-industrial waste for parkland and guiding the city out of its post-9/11 doldrums. His national campaigns for gun control and against obesity were commendable. And unlike Trump, Bloomberg usually surrounded himself with a cadre of qualified individuals willing to disagree with him when the time came. Even still, the man's Pharaonic net worth fueled a singular arrogance that was ultimately his undoing. Though he never declared, like Trump, that "I alone" can fix the city, his actions spoke to that sentiment. In 2003, as rising real estate prices began to drive the city's middle class and poor to the fringes, he said that New York was a "luxury product," not the "lowest-priced product" like Walmart. If working stiffs couldn't live here, too bad. 36 photos view gallery Donald Trump in the White House After the 2008 economic collapse, he engineered an overturning of the popular term limits law, granting himself a third term. He reasoned that New York needed his financial expertise one more time, rejecting the notion that any other leader, Democratic or Republican, was fit to lead the city. Bloomberg's third term, borne out of this arrogance, marred what could have been a far more uplifting legacy. His choice of Cathie Black, a Kushner-like neophyte when it came to education, as the city schools chancellor was so disastrous that the former Hearst executive resigned after only 95 days. When a blizzard rocked the city in 2010, Bloomberg blithely encouraged residents to take in a Broadway show and rode out the storm Bermuda, his weekend getaway. More miseries piled up later, from the CityTime corruption scandal to Hurricane Sandy, a storm the city failed to adequately respond to, leaving residents homeless for years. Most unfortunately, perhaps, Bloomberg allowed his unflagging belief in himself to cloud his ability to respond to complaints about his police department. Since he, as a powerful white man, never knew what it was like to have a police officer stop and search him repeatedly, he disregarded the pain of black and brown New Yorkers, and indulged in Trumpian hyperbole when activists and Democrats called for the NYPD to curtail the ballooning number of stop-and-frisks, telling reporters in 2013 he "wouldn't want to be responsible for a lot of people dying." There was never much soul-searching from Bloomberg. Even today, he would never lament the unintended consequences of his economic policies, like the rampant gentrification driving ever increasing numbers of poor and working-class people out of the city. For Bloomberg and Trump, apologies are all but nonexistent. How could a relative pauper possibly pass judgment on a man with enough money to purchase a small nation-state? Perhaps it comes down to this: The ultra-wealthy, especially those who owe a great deal of their wealth to family and circumstance, forget how much they owe to happenstance. They misconstrue lucky breaks with native skill. The happenstance and circumstance, the narrative-ruining realities of genetics and timing, are conveniently forgotten. Trump has credited his own brainpower-a "winning gene" in at least one interview-with his success. As the late Wayne Barrett meticulously documented, Trump owes many of his accomplishments in the real estate world to his father, one of New York's most powerful developers. Fred Trump's substantial wealth and political connections paved the way for Trump in Manhattan, allowing him both an entry point into a rarefied world and a cushion for his monumental failures. His father had to sign his bank documents. So far, Trump's White House is not only America's wealthiest, but perhaps its most incompetent. Yes, it's early, and all administrations are prone to rookie mistakes. But Trump has surrounded himself with so few humble, practiced hands than he's dramatically increased the odds of making major mistakes. He is far rasher and more impulsive than Bloomberg ever was, so hideously cocksure that he can hardly trust anyone but himself. Betsy DeVos, who's expected to win approval at her Senate committee confirmation vote Jan. 31, has pumped millions of dollars into programs to boost charter schools in her home state and beyond. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Have any doubt that Trump doesn't know what he doesn't know? Recall his regular boasts that he knew more about ISIS than the generals do, and had good reason to trust sources other than the U.S. intelligence community. The shoddy execution of the immigration ban demonstrated the consequences of such an attitude in horrifying real-time. Trump's executive order barring citizens and refugees from seven Muslim-majority nations, beyond its immorality, was implemented in isolation, undertaken as only a tone-deaf mogul with excessive confidence in his own abilities would. The State Department, the Defense Department and the Justice Department did not help him craft it. Trump's secretary of homeland security, John Kelly, only saw the details shortly before the order was finalized. The result? American citizens and green card holders, in addition to refugees who thought they'd already secured a place in our nation, were halted at airports. Chaos ensued. Officials on the ground scrambled to catch up. Federals judges issued stays. Around the same time he was signing the immigration executive order, Trump was elevating Bannon to a post on the National Security Council while limiting the roles of his Joint Chiefs of Staff and director of National Intelligence. Bannon has no foreign policy experience. But he is rich and Trump likes what he says. In Trump's Alice in Wonderland White House, a deficiency of expertise is an asset, and pretenders truly can inherit the throne. The pretenders may well have cost the life of an American Navy SEAL. Over dinner, less than a week into taking office, Trump hastily approved a military raid in Yemen to gather intelligence on an Al Qaeda collaborator. The raid was risky and the Obama administration had postponed the operation. But with Bannon and Kushner's blessing — the two men of course attended the dinner with military advisers — the soldiers were sent into combat. There is risk inherent in any such operation, and we'll never know exactly what to attribute to poor planning. But we do know that Trump's team made a series of bad judgments. Al Qaeda fighters knew they were coming, dooming the raid. In addition to the American commando, several civilians died, including the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Al Qaeda leader who was killed in a drone strike in 2011. A $75 million aircraft was also destroyed. Past Presidents understood that advisers with high-level experience in government were mandatory. Even Presidents who experienced meteoric rises, like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, knew they needed to surround themselves with experts and seasoned hands. They knew from their careers as elected officials, attorneys and, in Obama's case, activism, that magic wands and obscene self-regard are not enough to move Washington. Bannon and Kushner, with egos to match their bank accounts, are little more than enablers in this shambolic new order, overmatched for the tasks ahead of them. Kushner was a largely ineffective steward of a mid-sized, weekly newspaper, and a real estate developer who never would have had a career without his father, a self-made millionaire like Fred Trump. After overseeing a presidential campaign that was largely improvised by Trump himself and the beneficiary of extraordinary luck, including a historically unpopular Democratic nominee, Kushner has been elevated to heights once unimaginable. Money can't buy foresight or experience. This is something the historically unpopular Trump White House will learn soon enough. Barkan is a writer in New York.

World MEXICO & THE AMERICAS In Mexico, Trump triggers a surge in patriotism, anti-American sentiment MEXICO-US-BORDER-FUEL-PROTEST Yuri Cortez / AFP/Getty Images People gather Jan. 31 at El Zocalo square in Mexico City during a protest against a gasoline price increase and U.S. President Donald Trump's plan of building a wall on the border.

(Yuri Cortez / AFP/Getty Images) Laura Tillman Recently, Alma Siller Contreras traveled to the U.S. Consulate in the northern Mexican city of Hermosillo with a mission: to hand over her tourist visa, along with a handwritten message about U.S. President Trump. “This is my way of protesting against him and supporting my beloved country and its people,” Contreras wrote. She had long used her tourist visa to shop and visit family north of the border, but began contemplating giving it up when she and her husband watched Trump announce his candidacy with what she considered an odious attack on the character of the Mexican people.  “I said, ‘He has a hatred in his soul; this isn’t normal. He’s not prepared to be a leader of a country. This is dangerous,’” Contreras recalled. “I said, ‘If he wins, I’m going to return my visa.’ My husband said, ‘I don’t think he’ll win, he’s crazy.’ I never thought it would happen.” On Jan. 30, she made good on her pledge. Through actions big and small, a wave of nationalism is rising in Mexico. It’s not joyous or self-congratulatory. These expressions of patriotism appear defensive, uneasy and even mournful in tone, as Mexicans wait to see whether Trump’s threats will turn to action. In the meantime, many here are asking themselves what they can do to support their fellow citizens. The answers take many forms. South of the border, Mexicans are puzzled by Trump's relentless and pointless antagonism Robin Abcarian The police academy graduation ceremony in Tecate, Mexico, was a solemn affair.   As hundreds of family members looked on, 106 newly minted police officers and state marshals stood at attention, marched in formation on the flat, sun-baked parade grounds, and accepted diplomas from law enforcement... The police academy graduation ceremony in Tecate, Mexico, was a solemn affair.   As hundreds of family members looked on, 106 newly minted police officers and state marshals stood at attention, marched in formation on the flat, sun-baked parade grounds, and accepted diplomas from law enforcement... (Robin Abcarian) For Luis Alberto Trasviña, a history teacher in Baja California, action meant bringing his family to the Mexican capital on vacation instead of going to the U.S. — a way to support the national economy and avoid anti-Mexican sentiment. For chef Eduardo Garcia, owner of several restaurants in Mexico City, it meant offering free classes on using Mexican-produced ingredients. The first class instructed 50 students in how to choose and use Mexican avocados. For a group of families from a Protestant church with Mexican and expat members in Mexico City, it meant organizing to protest anti-immigrant policies. “We want to do something, and people feel helpless,” said Doug Keillor, a member of the group and founder of a nonprofit that advocates for juveniles in Mexico’s criminal justice system. Though Keillor’s wife was pushed and told to go back to the U.S. while she was shopping at a Wal-Mart in December, Keillor viewed the incident as an aberration. Most Mexicans, he said, are savvy about U.S. politics. Keillor, who notes he and his wife are adopting a 2-year-old Mexican boy, added, “If we eventually move back to the U.S., we come from a very homogeneous part of Minnesota, a very red, politically, part of Minnesota — are we going to be very excited to bring our Mexican son to live there?”  A movement to buy Mexican products is also being pushed in friendly conversation and by government officials. President Enrique Peña Nieto relaunched the label "Hecho en Mexico," or Made in Mexico, last week on Twitter, saying the label should signify quality and trustworthiness. On social media, profile pictures have switched to Mexican flags. Hashtags such as #AdiosAStarbucks encourage consumers to boycott U.S. brands. But some Mexicans find it all a bit silly. Luis Padilla, a 20-year-old university student in Mexico City, has no plans to change his spending habits, or his brand of coffee.   “I like their coffee, and simply not buying a cup of their coffee is not going to hurt the president over there,” he said. Pragmatically, he would continue to buy the brands of clothes he preferred, whether from the U.S. or Japan or Mexico, and he expected that the trend to boycott U.S. products would pass among his peers as well. “It’s not bad to experiment with the traditions of other countries. It’s always good to learn,” he said. But it appears some Mexicans are steering away from U.S. products. The Alsea company, which owns the Starbucks brand in Mexico, has tried to communicate to consumers that its coffee is from Chiapas, that it employs more than 7,000 people in the country, and that it’s completely Mexican-owned. At a Starbucks in Mexico City’s Condesa neighborhood, baristas seemed frazzled by the overnight shift in public opinion.  “I don’t think it’s well thought-out,” barista Luis Maguey said of the trend. “It was shocking to see —  it made me sad. We work to support our families.” Kevin Ganser, a 29-year-old entrepreneur, said the election of Trump had prompted him to go all-in on a new startup that aims to link expats with housing in Mexico City. When Americans look up Mexico City, he wants them to be greeted with a “warm and friendly face.”  Some politicians have suggested that if Trump’s policies inflict damage on Mexico, the country could rebound if Mexicans keep their heads down and work harder. That rhetoric frustrates Alfredo Perez, a 48-year-old engineer, who says it pre-supposes that Mexicans aren’t doing the the best they can for themselves and their families. The work week in Mexico is already six days long. “How are we going to work more?” he asked. As for Contreras, whose letter went viral after her cousin posted it on Facebook (Contreras herself doesn’t have a profile), she has no regrets about what she considers a personal choice to stand up for her country.  “Mexicans are good people. There are always exceptions anywhere, but in general, the humble people of Mexico have very good hearts. I am Mexican, and [Trump] can’t generalize all Mexicans are this way or that, that all people from a country are the way that he imagines in his distorted brain,” she said. “This is a place of faith, and of hope.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss An appeals court has ruled: Trump's travel ban will remain blocked.

(Evan Vucci, AP) Multimedia   ·   User Galleries   ·   News in Pictures Send us your pictures  ·  Send us your stories What To Read Next {{item.title}} Related Links Donald Trump praises wrong Ivanka Ivanka Trump doesn't want to fall with dad Donald Melania Trump is set to be a long-distance first lady Washington - She may have no official White House title. But Ivanka Trump already is proving that she is an unofficial power player. This week, the first daughter joined President Donald Trump at a policy meeting with business executives and accompanied him on a trip to Delaware's Dover Air Force Base on Wednesday to honour the returning remains of a US Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. She also hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have only underscored questions about the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organisation and her own lifestyle brand to move to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Trump told ABC's 20/20 last month. Whatever Ivanka Trump does, it will likely be unprecedented. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside - or a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has sought to halt speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told 20/20 that "there is one first lady". But joining the president on the sombere trip to Dover was the kind of duty that would typically fall to the president's spouse. "That's a typical scene you usually see played out with the president and the first lady, not the first daughter," said Katherine Jellison, who chairs the history department at Ohio University. Back in Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home in the tony Kalorama neighbourhood for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event. They requested anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss a private dinner. Trump also weighed in this week on a policy matter behind the scenes. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have impacted LGBTQ workplace rights and supported a White House statement that went out pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion, which was first reported by Politico. Bumps Ivanka also hit a few bumps this week - and learned about the bigger spotlight for the first family. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of herself and husband Jared Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. A source close to Ivanka said she feels badly about what happened and regrets the post. Her self-named lifestyle brand also took a hit when Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Rosemary K Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, said in a statement that the brand "continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016". A brand spokesperson said Nordstrom did order both shoes and clothing for spring and moved forward with the purchase of clothing. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organisation and her lifestyle brand - which offers shoes, clothes and messages of female empowerment. Her company will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. Complicated The process of unwinding those roles is complicated. The Trump Organisation has not filed paperwork yet to remove Ivanka Trump from its liquor license for a company tied to the Trump Soho hotel in Manhattan, according to New York State Liquor Authority spokesperson William Crowley. He said companies must update their licenses within 10 business days of any management changes, and that requires agency review and approval first, and that process has not even begun because the agency has not received a request yet. Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organisation, said on Friday that all paperwork had been filed to separate Ivanka Trump from the businesses. He noted that it was a lengthy process, which took several weeks. He did not immediately answer questions about that specific liquor license.

EVERETT — A 36-year-old woman would stay in vacation rentals and rummage through belongings owners left behind. With tidbits of personal information, she allegedly opened bank and credit card accounts in the owners’ names. More than $50,000 was reportedly stolen. The Everett woman was arrested in early January on suspicion of 54 felonies following a lengthy investigation by the Everett Police Department’s financial crimes unit. She has since been charged in Everett District Court with identity theft and forgery. Prosecutors are reviewing additional cases involving the woman. In August, an identity-theft victim told police someone had opened a BECU credit card in her name, in addition to other credit card accounts. She had lost $30,000 by that point, according to a probable cause affidavit. The woman made 51 transactions on a credit card registered to the victim over a span of 16 days, police allege in court papers. Records show the woman spent nearly $800 on purses at a Coach outlet store and about $1,160 at a Walmart in Marysville. The transactions do not include the cash that was reportedly withdrawn or transferred into fraudulent accounts. The woman allegedly opened multiple accounts online with BECU under the victim’s name. She claimed she worked for Boeing and earned more than $17,000 a month, according to a probable cause affidavit. Two other people had their personal information stolen, such as their Social Security numbers and birthdates, according to the affidavit. The woman also allegedly obtained someone’s phone number, physical characteristics, driver’s license number, previous addresses, names of relatives and their ages, police said. A financial crimes detective distributed photos around the police department of the woman making a transaction at a BECU location. In December, an Everett police officer was in the McDonald’s parking lot along Colby Avenue when he saw someone in a passing car who matched the woman in the photos. That car was registered in the name of another identity-theft victim, according to the affidavit. The woman sitting in the passenger seat also was wearing the same bracelets and rings as the woman in the photos. At the time of the arrest, the woman was carrying 13 memory cards and two cellphones. The case demonstrates that people need to exercise caution when inviting others to rent their homes, Everett police Sgt. Matt Mekelburg said. “We are continuing to investigate this suspect and expect to find additional information that leads to more victims,” he said in a press release. “It’s unfortunate that victims had their personal information stolen and used for criminal activity. While we understand the concept, we want people to recognize the risks of renting out their homes, and leaving personal information behind.” Caitlin Tompkins: 425-339-3192; ctompkins @heraldnet.com.

Groene’s Education Committee has some controversial issues to deal with, including whether to allow charter schools and whether to allow vouchers to be used to pay for private education. RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD State Sen. Mike Groene is one of several conservative lawmakers swept into leadership positions this year over Democrats and more moderate Republicans. LINCOLN — State Sen. Mike Groene has led a petition drive to cut school budgets, thinks schools waste too much money on administrators and frills, and believes that parents, not teachers or special interests, should control education. He’s blunt, combative and often harsh, and now he’s sitting in a powerful spot: as chairman of the legislative committee that oversees public education in the state. The head of the Legislature’s Education Committee is a post usually reserved for a former teacher or school administrator, or someone who has served on a local school board, someone viewed as a reliable vote for education. By contrast, Groene, a 61-year-old salesman of agricultural equipment from North Platte, got his start as a critic of spending by his local school district. In 2006 he led a statewide petition drive to limit government spending that was opposed by the state’s teachers union, the Nebraska State Education Association, among others. And now he’s taking heat for a fiery email exchange with a public schools defender two years ago in which he described teachers as “lazy” and “second rate.” Groene is unapologetic, saying the comments were taken out of context. “I’m not a cheerleader. I’m a businessman who wants to improve public education,” Groene said. “Schools can do better.” He is one of several conservative lawmakers swept into leadership positions this year over Democrats and more moderate Republicans. His defenders say there’s nothing wrong with having a fiscal conservative in the top spot of a committee that decides issues related to schools and teachers. “I don’t think it’s a bad idea to have someone approach education from a little bit different perspective, especially when we have a budget shortfall. He focuses on the taxpayers,” said Crete Sen. Laura Ebke, the Legislature’s only Libertarian and a friend of Groene. But critics say that he’s anti-public education and they are angry over a series of emails he exchanged in 2015 with a retired actuary from Hastings. In the emails, Groene wrote that teachers keep their jobs only because of tenure, which protects teachers from being fired without just cause. “Ever since the cowardly draft dodgers of the sixties hid behind education deferments and infested our public education system, our public schools have weakened,” Groene wrote. Citizens need to reclaim education, he added, and if teachers don’t like it, “Walmart is hiring.” At least one Democratic blogger said the comments show that Groene should not even be on the Education Committee, much less run it. Jane Kleeb, the head of the Nebraska Democratic Party, called on Gov. Pete Ricketts to ask Groene to resign. She termed the email comments “disgusting.” “Reading Groene’s emails to voters makes you wonder if he says this in public, how can he be a fair legislator when dealing with school budgets and other critical issues facing our state?” Kleeb said. Ricketts, in comments Friday, said he had not seen the email, but that no matter how people feel about education, “we want to respect our educators” and that conversations should be based on “respect and dignity.” Reaction from Groene’s legislative colleagues runs the gamut, from “stupid” and “disappointing” to this is what sometimes happens when you get into a heated debate via email or over the Internet. “Unfortunately, it’s sometimes not what you say but how you say it,” said Lincoln Sen. Patty Pansing-Brooks, a member of the Education Committee. She added that teachers deserve support and respect. Norfolk Sen. Jim Scheer, the speaker of the Legislature, said he had “a conversation” with Groene after copies of the emails were sent to senators and school superintendents in mid-January. “I think Sen. Groene regrets some of the comments in the terms he made them,” Scheer said. He added that the senator shouldn’t be criticized just because he has different views on the future of education in the state. For his part, Groene said he has nothing to apologize about. The comments were taken out of context, he said, and were meant to condemn only bad teachers. He said that his debating style is to “try to get under the skin of my opponent,” which he did, and that sometimes he pushes that too far. “Basically, if I did anything wrong, I was blunt,” he said. “And that’s what I’m known for.” Later, the senator added, “I say what we all say around the kitchen table. I’m not politically correct. I don’t need to be.” The email exchange came as no surprise to people in North Platte, where Groene has earned a reputation for aggressively opposing school spending proposals and other projects that use tax dollars. He co-founded the Western Nebraska Taxpayers Association, which advocates for cuts in spending and lower taxes. The group went to court to fight the use of tax dollars to build a local tourist attraction, the Golden Spike Tower. Groene and his group also opposed the use of tax increment financing for economic development projects, including a new Menards store, by the city. Such tax breaks benefit one entity while requiring others to foot the tax bills, he said. TIF is more about “urban renewal” than economic growth, Groene maintains. “I believe in tax breaks for everybody or tax breaks for nobody,” he said. A conversation between Groene and Ricketts led to the founding in 2006 of the conservative Platte Institute for Economic Research. Ricketts was the board president; Groene was one of the board members. The senator cut his conservative teeth digging into the budget of the North Platte school district. He objected to spending he considered wasteful or extravagant. One project he fought was buying artificial turf for the high school football field. Groene, who described himself as a “working-class Republican,” said spending needs to be focused on the classroom, not on a “plastic football field” or another layer of administrators. “Some of these things get made because of community vanity,” he said, and not for sound reasons. After unsuccessful campaigns for the Lincoln County Board and the local community college board, Groene decided to run for the Legislature in 2014. He filed just a couple of weeks before the deadline out of frustration after attending a state legislative hearing. He promised his wife he wouldn’t spend more than $2,500 of their money on a campaign. Despite being outspent by a 5-to-1 ratio, he said he won the election by knocking on more doors, talking to more voters. “I went to every neighborhood,” Groene said. But some detractors in North Platte said he was elected to “get him out of town” — a line that Groene himself used during a recent legislative hearing. Critics say he opposes too many community initiatives, uses profanities too often, and tries too hard to provoke people. Former North Platte state senator Tom Hansen, whose wife was a teacher, described Groene as a hard worker who “gets a little intense.” Pansing-Brooks, a current legislative colleague, said she’s nicknamed Groene “Sunshine,” as a reminder to him to lighten up. Groene said he appreciated the nickname, but he enjoys a good, lively debate because it hones one’s debating skills. At his favorite cabin retreat along the South Loup River hangs a sign he had made that reads: “Politics & Religion is the only table talk at this cabin.” But Bert Peterson, a retired actuary from Hastings, said he was shocked at the responses Groene sent to him about a newspaper op-ed piece he’d emailed concerning the correlation between poverty and low educational achievement. The email exchange was in July 2015, but Peterson said when he realized that Groene had been elected chairman of the Education Committee, he shared the emails with every state senator and every school superintendent in the state, as well as others in education. Peterson said they needed to be aware of the senator’s “absolute ignorance of education, and his hateful attitude toward educators.” Groene said that Peterson was a “self-appointed” expert on education and proof of the “arrogance” of those in education toward opposing views. “They believe the educational system is theirs, that it does not belong to the people, and the people are ignorant,” the senator said. Groene said he’s been put “on the hit list” by liberals since the resignation of another outspoken conservative in the State Legislature, former Papillion Sen. Bill Kintner. Not only was Groene’s private email exchange released, Groene said, but a Facebook page that used to detail Kintner’s sometimes inflammatory quotes is now dedicated to Groene. “But I haven’t done anything,” said Groene, who doesn’t use Twitter or Facebook. Observers say there’s always a learning curve for a new committee chair in the Legislature, and Groene appears to be working to become a better listener, including to other points of view. As the leader of the eight-member Education Committee, he’ll have to work to form consensus in a group that appears to be evenly split between moderates and conservatives. The committee has some controversial issues to deal with, including whether to allow charter schools and whether to allow vouchers to be used to pay for private education. Groene said he’s open to those ideas, under certain conditions, but that his big priority is to reduce property taxes by using the state aid to schools process. He said he has changed since the email exchange two years ago. Last year he was in the minority as he led filibusters to derail proposals to provide tax credits for wind farms and require vaccination against meningitis. “I’ve now got a position of power. I can get things done without being an agitator,” the senator said. Officials with the NSEA did not return phone calls seeking comment about Groene, but the organization is supporting one of his bills — one that allows teachers to use physical force if a student becomes unruly or violent. One veteran lobbyist, John Bonaiuto of the Nebraska Association of School Boards, said that while times have changed, Groene is very accessible, as well as very frank. “He’s definitely a conservative, with his own point of view,” Bonaiuto said. “What I have to do is work hard, when we are at odds, that maybe he isn’t seeing the whole picture.” paul.hammel@owh.com, 402-473-9584 +4  Mike Groene RYAN SODERLIN/THE WORLD-HERALD More information 'This is not business as usual': Senators debate budget bill as roughly $900 million shortfall looms The majority of the proposal goes along with recommendations by Gov.

President Donald Trump, accompanied by his daughter Ivanka, waves as they walk to board Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House in Was Source: Associated Press She hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have focused attention on the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organisation and her own lifestyle brand, and moving to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband, Jared Kushner, who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Ivanka Trump told ABC's "20/20" last month. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside — or for a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has tried to end speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by stepmother Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told "20/20" that "there is one first lady." But joining the president on the Dover trip was the kind of duty that usually would fall to the president's spouse. In Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event.  Ivanka Trump also weighed, behind the scene, on a policy matter. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have affected LGBTQ workplace rights and she supported a White House statement pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion. Her involvement was first reported by Politico. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of her and Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her company, which will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. no more content back to top loading error refresh LATEST POPULAR FEATURED news 00:15 1 LIVE: Brisbane Global Tens - NZ teams show class after early struggles 04:19 2 As it happened: Farewell Spit whale rescuers sent home after a second day of heart-wrenching efforts 00:16 3 Watch: Cory Jane scores last minute intercept try to complete Hurricanes comeback win 00:15 4 Watch: Liam Messam catches Rebels napping to score first ever Brisbane Tens try 5 Firefighters battle huge blaze in Waikato's Pureora Forest Park 03:04 Video: 'Get it off our whenua' – TeTii marae member in standoff with media over cameras Marae representatives asked police to move TVNZ cameras off a public road. 01:53 'Let's have a shot' - mayors in NZ's poorest regions want power and funds to tackle poverty The idea involves creating special zones in the Far North, Rotorua Lakes and the Gisborne district. 01:52 Northland's big dry: Government offering financial help to drought-stricken farmers One farmer has been forced to sell 60 cows and reckons he'll lose $200k this season. 03:12 'We think iwi are best placed to look after children removed into the state's hands' Maori leaders want new rules in CYF legislation .

Vaugh Corrections center Thursday in Smyrna, Delaware. (Suchat Pederson/The Wilmington News-Journal) Union blames staffing shortage for prison guard’s death Sat Feb 4th, 2017 7:14pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. Associated Press SMYRNA, Del. — The killing of a guard during an inmate uprising at Delaware’s largest prison was entirely preventable, according to a correctional officers’ union leader who blamed state officials for ignoring chronic staffing shortages that put prison workers at greater risk. Sgt. Steven Floyd, 47, was found dead early Thursday after a nearly 20-hour hostage standoff at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna. On Friday, he was posthumously awarded a promotion to lieutenant and the Medal of Valor, the department’s highest honor. Floyd was one of four staff members, including a female counselor, taken hostage Wednesday after inmates in a unit holding about 120 inmates ambushed him and forced him into a closet. Inmates released two hostages before a tactical team used a backhoe to breach the building and rescue the woman. “If there had been a correct amount of staffing for a maximum-security building, the inmates would not have been able to overpower the officers, take control of the building and murder Sergeant Floyd,” said Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware. “Bottom line is, you cannot run daily operations of that building with three corrections officers safely,” he said. The problem is not unique to Delaware, observers say. For years, many states have struggled to attract and retain correctional officers, largely because they are woefully underpaid, said David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project. “The correction officers are really the backbone of every prison … if you don’t have enough officers, really every aspect of prison operations breaks down,” he said. In some states, prisons are competing for workers with Wal-Mart and McDonald’s, Fathi said. In Nebraska, the state prison has trouble keeping correctional officers because its county jails will pay them much more, he said. Klopp who has worked for the Delaware Department of Correction for 29 years, says he makes about $49,000 annually. A rookie cop in the central Delaware town of Milford starts at $48,000, he said. Authorities have said there are about 90 correctional officer vacancies within Delaware’s prison system on any given day. That’s almost double the 55 correctional officer vacancies reported in fiscal 2010, but less than half of the 260 vacancies in fiscal 2006, according to a Department of Correction annual report. A department spokeswoman said Commissioner Perry Phelps would not comment on staffing until the investigation into this week’s uprising is finished. But the department acknowledged in its most recent annual report that “workforce availability and eminent risk are intimately linked,” and that current staffing levels reflect budgetary restrictions, not adherence to National Institute of Corrections recommended standards. When correctional officer jobs remain vacant, prisons are short staffed for extended periods, the report notes. It adds, “Covering security posts with officers who are unfamiliar with the tasks or post location elevates security risk.” Klopp said one of the two guards taken hostage along with Floyd this week was a rookie, and the other was working overtime and not normally assigned to the building where the uprising occurred. Officers frequently are forced to work overtime to make up for staff shortages. Klopp said overtime pay amounted to about $22 million over the past year. Correctional officers often don’t find out until the end of their shifts that they are being “frozen” to work an additional shift. “They are still forcing people to work overtime to make the facilities run at minimum staffing. They tell you you can’t go home,” Klopp said. “Not having enough staff, not having enough senior staff, and the amount of overtime that we work leads to fatigue and complacency, because we have to work so much to make the facility run,” he added. According to a 2015 annual report, the DOC had 1,710 filled correctional officer positions in fiscal 2015, up from 1,664 the prior year but well short of the 1,796 approved positions. More than a decade ago, a state task force said staff and management were complacent about security at the Smyrna prison. The panel was established in 2004 after a female counselor was held hostage and raped. The inmate who held her was shot to death. Klopp said that, to his knowledge, none of the recommendations made by the task force in 2005 has been implemented. Klopp and state Sen. Bruce Ennis of Smyrna, chairman of the Senate Corrections and Public Safety Committee, said turnover among prison guards averages about a dozen a month. “They can’t train them fast enough,” Ennis said. “When you lose 13 guards a month, it’s kind of hard to keep up.” Most Read Police: Attack by woman near Arlington was fueled by meth ARLINGTON — An Arlington woman is under investigation for assault and unlawful… Feb 10th, 2017 by Scott North Olivia Newton-John show to promote new album in Everett Olivia Newton-John — the movie star (“Grease”) and singer (“I Honestly Love… Feb 10th, 2017 by Gale Fiege Monroe man allegedly schemed to have wife, daughter murdered MONROE — A Monroe man is accused of trying to hire a… Feb 9th, 2017 by Rikki King Fugitive watch Herald staff EVERETT — The state Department of Corrections’ Everett office has… Feb 10th, 2017 by Herald Staff Julie Muhlstein Everett dog owners hope for the best at Westminster show Meet Zoom.

Photo: The New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet By Rukmini Callimachi - - Published: 9:42 AM, February 5, 2017 HYDERABAD (India) — When the Islamic State identified a promising young recruit willing to carry out an attack in one of India’s major tech hubs, the group made sure to arrange everything down to the bullets he needed to kill victims. For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the Islamic State’s first strike on Indian soil. They vetted each new member of the cell as Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement. And from Syria, investigators believe, the group’s virtual plotters organised for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots. Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here in June, the Islamic State’s cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times. As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Yazdani’s offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by ISIS whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet. In the most basic enabled attacks, ISIS handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws in order to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their ISIS interlocutors, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Texas, were initially labelled the work of “lone wolves”, with no operational ties to ISIS, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group’s method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training. Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State’s name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group. “They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process — from radicalisation to recruitment into a specific plot,” said Mr Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Mr Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defence of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. “If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack.” Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Yazdani’s case presents one of the most detailed accounts of how ISIS is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group’s reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York. “I fear this is the future of ISIS,” said Ms Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO Until roughly a year ago, ISIS recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a “hijrah”, the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad’s pilgrimage, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticised videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the Islamic State’s most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, al-Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group. But by late spring 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both US and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was al-Amrik, who was killed along with his wife on April 22 when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa’ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of ISIS’ “external attack planners” who “actively sought to harm Western interests". The Defence Department’s account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Yazdani, al-Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across the United States, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus, Ohio; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester, New York. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Lutchman reached out to al-Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. “Dream come true,” al-Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint. Instead, the handler suggested Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year’s Eve — less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an “operation” and kill “1000000s of kuffar”, al-Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other “brothers” to take part. They stayed in contact as Lutchman went to Wal-Mart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar’s customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an FBI informant. At the time of his arrest, Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler’s voice, or saw so much as photograph of him, according to the court filings. By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadis, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, ISIS operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other ISIS colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Ohio, Aaron T Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, ISIS announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. “If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad,” the group’s spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. At the time al-Amriki was killed in April, he had been exchanging messages with Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria. One of eight children, Yazdani, 30, grew up in a cramped apartment in the slum of Aman Nagar B, in a narrow alley that smells of sewage in Hyderabad’s Old City. He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching ISIS online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate. “Since then, I was inclined to join Islamic State and work for the cause of religion,” Yazdani told investigators from India’s National Investigation Agency, according to his interrogation record, which was obtained by The Times and was first reported by NDTV, a New Delhi-based television company. He logged into Twitter and searched the hashtags #ISIS and #Khilafa, the terrorist group’s preferred spelling of caliphate. In a few keystrokes, he made contact with al-Amriki. “I created a Telegram ID,” Yazdani told investigators, “and sought his guidance to reach Syria.” After months of frustrating and failed attempts to help Yazdani get a visa, al-Amriki’s directions changed course: “He asked me to work for IS by staying in India itself.” It was a period in which ISIS was refining the way it exports terror, increasingly relying on cyberplanners with local knowledge. Just before his death, al-Amriki handed off Yazdani to a different handler, known only by his Telegram screen name, “WindsofVictory”. His identity has not yet been confirmed by Indian officials, though they believe he is Indian because he spoke fluent Hindi. The new handler guided the eight-member cell as it took shape, exchanging messages with Yazdani as the engineer recruited his family members and friends. They named themselves “Jund-ul-Khilafa-Fi-Bilad-Hind”, the Army of the Caliphate in India, according to the interrogation records, which misspelled part of the Arabic name. At the end of May, Yazdani received a message telling him to go to the Nanded Airport, about 200 miles away. He and an accomplice, Habeeb Mohammed, 31, drove all night. After they reached the airport the next morning, the handler told them to head to the Railway Division Office. Near that office, he said, they would see a plastic bag hanging from a tree, according to the transcripts of the men’s interrogations. "It was informed by the handler that opposite to DRM office, there are two trees and on one of the trees there would be a white colour polyethylene sheet (used for wrapping fragile articles),” Mohammed told investigators. “We spotted the place, and I, first on the pretext of urinating, went to check for the consignment." When they opened the bag, they found two pistols and 20 bullets, according to their account to law enforcement. It was one of at least four drops the handler set up for them. Because the pistols were rusted, they say the handler instructed them to travel to the railway station in the city of Ajmer, about 600 miles to the north. This time they were told to bring 65,000 rupees — around S$1,363 — and leave it near the railway track sealed in a plastic bag, which would be picked up and used as payment for weapons. Because the communication always had to go through the handler, the members of the Hyderabad cell never directly interacted with the arms seller. When they were arrested, they could not provide any clues as to who had left the contraband, Indian investigators said. The Hindi-speaking handler guiding the men in Hyderabad also insisted on using a kaleidoscope of encrypted messaging applications, with Yazdani instructed to hop between apps so that even if one message history was discovered and cracked, it would reveal only a portion of their handiwork. As soon as Yazdani indicated he was willing to undertake an attack, the handler instructed him to download ChatSecure, a messaging app to be used when they spoke by phone. When he used his laptop, he was told to contact the handler via Pidgin, another encrypted tool. He was told to create an account with Tutanota, a secure email service. And the handler taught Yazdani how to use the Tails operating system, which is contained on a USB stick and allows a user to boot up a computer from the external device and use it without leaving a trace on the hard drive. Once that system was in place, the handler told Yazdani to prepare a handwritten oath of allegiance, known as a “bayah”, to ISIS’ leader. Members of the cell signed it using their noms de guerre, and Yazdani was told to scan it to his laptop, using Tails to obscure the operation. Next, he was told to upload it to gulf-up.com, which allows users to upload files and produces a URL that can be shared with a third party. The link to the URL was to be sent via the secure email. By methodically working through URLs archived on the website, The Times was able to find the image of the one-page handwritten document containing the Indian men’s pledge of allegiance to ISIS. The file was uploaded around the time Yazdani told investigators he had done so, and the document matched his description of the wording he had disclosed to the authorities. Until they were alerted to its existence, Indian investigators were not aware that the document was still archived on the website, they said. The men’s families have denied that they played any role in a terrorist plot, and accuse the authorities of planting evidence against them. One Indian investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief reporters, said officials were able to crack the full extent of the case only because Yazdani and his accomplices confessed during interrogation, divulging the passwords to their accounts after their arrests last summer. GLOBAL REACH Though the Hyderabad case is among the most detailed in showing how Syria-based handlers directly facilitated terrorist attacks abroad, it is neither the first, nor the only one. Investigation documents from Europe show that a growing share of attacks bear signs of contact with the ISIS stronghold, even though the attacker was initially described as acting alone. The first time officials in Europe described an attack as having been “télécommandé”, or remote-controlled, was in spring 2015 after a young information technology student named Sid Ahmed Ghlam tried to open fire on a church in the Paris suburb of Villejuif. Instead, he shot himself in the leg. When the police searched his car, they found his Lenovo laptop containing a series of messages showing how he, too, had been guided by a pair of handlers who provided both the weapons and the getaway car, according to hundreds of pages of police and intelligence records obtained by The Times. “OK, brother, now pay attention,” one of the messages begins, instructing the then-23-year-old to head to the suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, where he would find the automatic weapons in a bag left in a locked car parked near a sandwich shop. “Search among the cars that are parked there near the big road and look for a Renault Mégane,” the message said. “Look at the front right tire — you’ll find the keys placed on top.” The handler then instructed him to store the weapons in another car in a parking garage 10 miles away, a precaution in case his apartment was searched. Later, French investigators said they had found that Ghlam’s handlers were French citizens who had traveled to Syria to join ISIS. They, in turn, tapped their criminal network back in France to arrange the logistics of Ghlam’s plot. Mr Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Programme on Extremism at George Washington University, said the handlers were essentially “quarterbacking” the attack: “They’re from there, so they can essentially tell someone, ‘OK, go 10 yards and go this way.’” Wiretaps, interrogation records and transcripts of chats recovered on suspects’ phones and laptops show that this level of guidance has occurred all over the world. In Germany, a man who set off a bomb outside a concert and a teenager who assaulted train passengers with an ax were both chatting with handlers until minutes before their attacks. The teenager’s handler urged him to use a car instead of an ax — “The damage would be much greater,” the handler advised — but the young man said he did not have a driving permit. “I want to enter paradise tonight,” he said, according to a transcript obtained by a German newspaper. In northern France, a pair of attackers who had been guided by an Islamic State cybercoach slit the throat of an 85-year-old priest. The pair had not known each other, and according to the investigative file, the handler introduced them, organising for them to meet days before the attack. Intelligence records obtained by The Times reveal that the same handler in Syria also guided a group of young women who tried to blow up a car in front of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. And investigations into attacks in Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh reveal that the recruits were directly communicating with Islamic State handlers who moulded the plots as they took shape and helped arrange logistics, in some cases wiring money. In several investigations, a pattern has emerged: The attacker initially tries to reach Syria, but is either blocked by the authorities in the home country or else turned back from the border. Under the instructions of a handler in Syria or Iraq, the person then begins planning an attack at home. Law enforcement officials describe that sequence of events in one of the most recent foiled attacks in France, where a group of people are accused of plotting to hit the popular Christmas market in Strasbourg, having been given the GPS coordinates of a location to pick up weapons. At least one of the five men arrested had been turned back from Turkey, French prosecutors said. WEAK LINKS While a reliance on local amateurs has allowed ISIS to announce that it can stage terrorism around the world, it has also led to many failed attacks. Instead of opening fire on a church, Ghlam shot himself in the leg. Instead of laying waste to a music festival this past summer, the ISIS recruit in Germany detonated his bomb prematurely, killing only himself. The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest. “He didn’t even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up,” said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is one of the Islamic State’s most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group’s capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the Myanmar Embassy. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of al-Amriki’s followers in Hyderabad. The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10kg bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mohammed’s home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. “We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste,” Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to “cook the rice”. By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mohammed’s home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

For 17 months, terrorist operatives guided the recruit, a young engineer named Mohammed Ibrahim Yazdani, through every step of what they planned to be the ISIS's first strike on Indian soil. They vetted each new member of the cell as Yazdani recruited helpers. They taught him how to pledge allegiance to the terrorist group and securely send the statement. And from Syria, investigators believe, the group's virtual plotters organized for the delivery of weapons as well as the precursor chemicals used to make explosives, directing the Indian men to hidden pickup spots. Until just moments before the arrest of the Indian cell, here in June, the Islamic State's cyberplanners kept in near-constant touch with the men, according to the interrogation records of three of the eight suspects obtained by The New York Times. As officials around the world have faced a confusing barrage of attacks dedicated to the Islamic State, cases like Yazdani's offer troubling examples of what counterterrorism experts are calling enabled or remote-controlled attacks: violence conceived and guided by operatives in areas controlled by ISIS whose only connection to the would-be attacker is the internet. In the most basic enabled attacks, ISIS handlers acted as confidants and coaches, coaxing recruits to embrace violence. In the Hyderabad plot, among the most involved found so far, the terrorist group reached deep into a country with strict gun laws in order to arrange for pistols and ammunition to be left in a bag swinging from the branches of a tree. For the most part, the operatives who are conceiving and guiding such attacks are doing so from behind a wall of anonymity. When the Hyderabad plotters were arrested last summer, they could not so much as confirm the nationalities of their ISIS interlocutors, let alone describe what they looked like. Because the recruits are instructed to use encrypted messaging applications, the guiding role played by the terrorist group often remains obscured. As a result, remotely guided plots in Europe, Asia and the United States in recent years, including the attack on a community center in Garland, Texas, were initially labeled the work of "lone wolves," with no operational ties to ISIS, and only later was direct communication with the group discovered. While the trail of many of these plots led back to planners living in Syria, the very nature of the group's method of remote plotting means there is little dependence on its maintaining a haven there or in Iraq. And visa restrictions and airport security mean little to attackers who strike where they live and no longer have to travel abroad for training. Close examination of both successful and unsuccessful plots carried out in the Islamic State's name over the past three years indicates that such enabled attacks are making up a growing share of the operations of the group. "They are virtual coaches who are providing guidance and encouragement throughout the process - from radicalisation to recruitment into a specific plot," said Nathaniel Barr, a terrorism analyst at Valens Global, who along with Daveed Gartenstein-Ross of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington wrote one of the first articles discussing the virtual plotters. "If you look at the communications between the attackers and the virtual plotters, you will see that there is a direct line of communication to the point where they are egging them on minutes, even seconds, before the individual carries out an attack." Detailing this kind of plot direction has become a critical focus of counterterrorism officials in the United States and Europe, as they try to track terror planners who pose a lasting threat and to unravel the criminal networks that the group uses as middlemen to facilitate attacks. Yazdani's case presents one of the most detailed accounts of how ISIS is exporting terrorism virtually. This style of attack has allowed the terrorist group's reach to stretch into countries as disparate as France and Malaysia, Germany and Indonesia, Bangladesh and Australia. And plots have been discovered in multiple locations in the United States, including in Columbus, Ohio, the suburbs of Washington and upstate New York. "I fear this is the future of ISIS," said Bridget Moreng, an analyst whose research on the virtual plotters was recently published in Foreign Affairs. A Diverse Portfolio Until roughly a year ago, ISIS recruiters aggressively pushed the message that going to Syria was a spiritual obligation. They described the physical journey as a "hijrah," the Arabic word used to refer to the Prophet Muhammad's pilgrimage, imbuing the act with religious meaning. The recruiters hid within an ocean of 2.3 billion live social media accounts, flooding the internet with romanticised videos of life inside the caliphate, as well as brutal execution videos, using them as clickbait to lure potential recruits. One of the ISIS's most influential recruiters and virtual plotters was known by the nom de guerre Abu Issa al-Amriki, and his Twitter profile instructed newcomers to contact him via the encrypted messaging app Telegram. Among those who sought him out, asking for instructions on how to reach Syria, was Yazdani, who had convinced himself that it was his religious duty to move his family to the caliphate. By 2015, al-Amriki was one of close to a dozen cyberplanners based in Syria or Iraq who were recruiting volunteers abroad, according to a tally based on investigation records from North America, Europe and Asia. Initially, they made little effort to hide, posting grandiose threats against the West on public social media feeds. They were sometimes discounted as mere cheerleaders for the terrorist group. But by late spring 2015, they were considered enough of a threat that both U.S. and British intelligence began tracking their movements, methodically targeting them with airstrikes and killing several since then. Among them was al-Amrik, who was killed along with his wife on April 22 when a bomb flattened their apartment in Al Bab, Syria. The Pentagon press secretary, Peter Cook, identified him as a Sudanese citizen also known as Abu Sa'ad al-Sudani, and described him as one of ISIS' "external attack planners" who "actively sought to harm Western interests." The Defence Department's account showed, moreover, that the handler had been involved in far more than just the Hyderabad case, planning attacks on three continents. At the same time that he was recruiting Yazdani, al-Amriki was grooming attackers in Canada and Britain, as well as at least three other young men in suburbs across the United States, according to court records. They included a former member of the Army National Guard living in Virginia; a warehouse worker from Columbus, Ohio; and Emanuel L. Lutchman, a 25-year-old in Rochester, New York. Looking for ways to get to Syria, Lutchman reached out to al-Amriki on Dec. 25, 2015, asking what it was like to live inside territory controlled by the group. "Dream come true," al-Amriki responded, before telling the young man that the Syrian border had been closed, according to the criminal complaint. Instead, the handler suggested Lutchman carry out an attack right at home on New Year's Eve - less than a week after their first exchange. Plan an "operation" and kill "1000000s of kuffar," al-Amriki instructed him, using a derogatory Arabic word meaning infidel. Over the course of several chats via the Telegram service, they planned how Lutchman would attack a bar serving craft beer to celebrate the holiday, prosecutors say. The two men discussed recruiting three other "brothers" to take part. They stayed in contact as Lutchman went to Wal-Mart, where he spent $40 on two ski masks, two knives, a machete, zip-ties, duct tape and latex gloves. He planned to abduct one of the bar's customers and videotape himself killing the victim, prosecutors say. And they exchanged a flurry of messages, as the 25-year-old began to voice doubts and the handler assumed the role of therapist, patiently listening and reassuring him. Lutchman was arrested at his home the day before his planned attack on Merchants Grill in Rochester, outed by the accomplice he had recruited, who turned out to be an FBI informant. At the time of his arrest, Lutchman had been communicating with the handler for a total of five days. It appears he never heard his handler's voice, or saw so much as photograph of him, according to the court filings. By late 2015, travel to Syria had become treacherous. Intelligence services on both sides of the Atlantic were getting better at identifying aspiring jihadis, arresting dozens as they prepared to board flights for Istanbul in hopes of crossing into Syria. At first, ISIS operatives instructed recruits to throw off law enforcement by taking more indirect routes. They also began urging followers to head to other ISIS colonies, including in Libya. That was what law enforcement officials said a young man from Columbus, Ohio, Aaron T. Daniels, was trying to do in November, when he was arrested while trying to board a United Airlines flight to Houston, from where he would travel to Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, before continuing toward Libya. No longer describing the journey to Syria as a spiritual necessity, ISIS announced last year that those who could not reach the caliphate should attack at home. "If the tyrants have closed in your faces the door of hijrah, then open in their face the door of jihad," the group's spokesman, Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, said in a message released in May. - Local Assets At the time al-Amriki was killed in April, he had been exchanging messages with Yazdani in India for more than a year, patiently offering encouragement as his recruit tried and failed to get a visa first to Greece, and then to Turkey in an effort to reach Syria.

He beat the odds, earning an engineering degree and landing a job as a quality inspector in Saudi Arabia for nearly four years, before returning to India. While abroad, he began watching ISIS online propaganda, and soon he became consumed by a desire to leave it all for the caliphate.

The same thing happened the day before the end of Ramadan on July 2 inside a police compound in Indonesia, where another remotely guided attacker hit the switch on his crudely assembled suicide vest. "He didn't even knock over the flowerpot on the ledge next to where he blew himself up," said Sidney Jones, director of the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict. Indonesian officials say the suicide bomber had been incited to attack by Bahrun Naim, a 33-year-old Indonesian man who is one of the Islamic State's most prolific cyberplanners, operating from the group's capital in Raqqa, Syria. Initially, Naim wired money to families in Indonesia to pay for travel to Syria, officials said. Later, the bank transfers he sent were to be used to buy the chemicals needed to build explosives, according to the interrogation records of his recruits. In just over a year, the young men with whom he was in touch attempted at least six attacks, targeting a police post, a Buddhist temple and a church, as well as foreigners visiting the country. In November, a college dropout who the police said had at least been initially in contact with Naim was arrested as he prepared to attack the Myanmar Embassy. In his home, the police recovered a quantity of explosives that could have resulted in a blast twice as powerful as the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, the police spokesman told local news media. Yet nearly all of the plots attributed to Naim have failed. And it was human error that finally led to the arrest of al-Amriki's followers in Hyderabad. The plot began to unravel in June after the men were instructed to collect a 10-kilogram bag of ammonium nitrate left beside a canal next to mile marker No. 9 on the Vijayawada Highway. They returned to Mohammed's home to begin preparing a bomb, but could not figure out how to replicate the steps in the instructional YouTube video sent to them by the handler. "We could not succeed in making powder, as it became jellylike paste," Yazdani lamented, according to the transcript of his interrogation. They tried using a tea strainer. They tried heating it longer. They began talking on their cellphones about their efforts to "cook the rice." By then, the police were wiretapping their calls and suspected that all the food talk was a crude attempt at misdirection. Early on June 29, the police banged on the door of Mohammed's home. In his bedroom, they found the half-cooked explosive in his refrigerator.

Even Nintendo Switch pre-orders are almost here. Advertisement First and foremost, the Nintendo Switch is a replacement for the ageing Nintendo Wii U. When docked, the Switch will output to a television set like any other video game console that came before it. It’s when users need to get up and go that they’ll realize just what a major departure from the norm the Switch is. Removing the console from its base switches it into a mobile mode. Users need only add two Joy Con controllers on either side of the device’s screen and they can keep playing away from their television set. Read: Nintendo Switch Release – What it is and What We Know Here’s what you need to know about Nintendo Switch pre-orders, and why it’s best that you get your debit or credit card ready as soon as possible to get your device reserved. Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders: Price and Bundles The key to any successful video game console launch are pricing and bundles. If the console price is too high, enough casual users won’t be willing to make an investment. If they stay behind, developers don’t have a large enough base to make the games that they develop for a platform profitable. Bundles offer a way for console makers to defray some of the cost in adopting a new video game console. A perfect example of both of these things working against a console is Microsoft’s Xbox One and the Sony PlayStation 3. The PlayStation 3 had a high price tag because of the Blu-Ray player Sony insisted on it including. The Xbox One only came with a Kinect sensor at launch, boosting the price by $100, supposedly. Advertisement Nintendo seems to have learned from Microsoft and Sony’s mistakes. The Nintendo Switch will cost $299.99 in the United States.  Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders: Nintendo Switch Release Date Originally, Nintendo expected to have the Nintendo Switch release date sometime within 2016. Delays in launch titles caused the company to delay its efforts. By late 2016, Nintendo had a rough time frame of March 2017, but didn’t say what day. The Nintendo Switch The Nintendo Switch will arrive on store shelves March 3rd in the United States. The company may have missed the 2016 holiday shopping season, but it’ll now have the rest of the year to work out kinks and get ready for the next massive giving season. What’s more, the spring isn’t as usually stuffed with game releases and console updates as the fall is. Nintendo should be able to easily dominate gaming news coverage. There are some high-profile releases, but nothing on the scale of the Nintendo Switch’s release. Advertisement Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders: Where to Make Your Purchase For now, where you make your Nintendo Switch pre-order doesn’t matter in a big sense. That being said, there are some things to consider. Best Buy Best Buy is offering Nintendo Switch pre-orders soon. As the company has a trade-in program for store credit, you could unload some of your old stuff to make your purchase more affordable. The Best Buy pre-order page is up. The company recently reopened Nintendo Switch pre-orders with a month left until launch. If you’re quick, you may be able to reserve one before they run out again. GameStop Advertisement GameStop’s in-store trade in program is a great way to save on Nintendo Switch pre-orders. If you’re planning for this new console to replace the old Wii U that you have, better to trade it-in and save. It’s also worth noting that GameStop doesn’t charge you the full price of an item when pre-ordering. If you head into a store, you can reserve your Nintendo Switch with a minimum down payment, then slowly cover the rest of the cost up until release day. Right now, GameStop’s website is showing a “More Info,” on both systems, which is a trick the company uses to convince buyers to click through to each bundle’s store page. Walmart Walmart briefly had stock of the Nintendo Switch up, but logging into the site and visiting the Nintendo Switch page again shows that the console is out of stock. Amazon Advertisement An Amazon Prime subscription won’t get any a big discount on Nintendo Switch pre-orders like it does with games. That being said, the company’s lightning fast trade-in program for old games and systems could prove useful. Instead of waiting to receive titles, Amazon’s Trade-In programs credit’s user’s account with a gift card almost immediately. It’s also worth noting that Amazon doesn’t charge for items until they’ve been shipped. Amazon lets users request a notification when pre-orders kick off there. Skyrim, FIFA and Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are all available for pre-order when browsing the site’s search results. [ See the Nintendo Switch at Amazon ] Nintendo Switch Pre-Orders: What to Keep in Mind If you’re set on placing a Nintendo Switch pre-order, there are some things to know. First, don’t take your time placing your pre-order. Nintendo has a reputation for not producing enough of any of its hardware. It’s a reputation it managed to enhance with the botched launch of the Nintendo NES Classic last year. If you think you’ll want one at launch, place a pre-order. Second, when placing your Nintendo Switch pre-order, keep an eye out for any games that you might want. Lastly, you shouldn’t forget to factor in the price of the console’s online multiplayer. Nintendo says that the service will be free at first, before requiring a subscription to use. We don’t yet know how much online play will cost. Good luck with your Nintendo Switch pre-orders. 22 Confirmed Nintendo Switch Games The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild   1 / 22  The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild was the first exclusive game confirmed for the Nintendo Switch. This new entry in the series is Nintendo’s attempt at introducing open-world mechanics to the modern franchise. Link has advanced mobility – he can jump or climb. The game’s different dungeons can be completed in any order. Players can craft some items using materials that they find in the open world. Amiibo figures are supported too. Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is one of the Nintendo Switch games that you don’t need new hardware to experience. It’s also coming to Nintendo’s Wii U console.   1 / 22 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

There are now at least three boot-camp programs for early-stage firms up and running around town aimed at helping them overcome the odds and succeed in a market in which most start-ups fail. Meanwhile, others such as San Francisco-based Hax have started bringing their classes of start-ups here on field trips to make pitches. The draw? In many cases, it’s because start-ups are looking to partner with major retailers such as Minneapolis-based Target Corp. and Richfield-based Best Buy to have them either carry their products or integrate their tech services. It also comes at a time when the number of start-ups has been exploding amid the growth in Internet of Things-related gadgets and shows like “Shark Tank” that inspired a new generation of entrepreneurs. “It’s a natural evolution of the market,” said Ryan Broshar, managing director of Techstar’s retail-focused accelerator housed at Target’s headquarters, which is currently soliciting applications for its second class of start-ups for this summer. Two of the start-ups from the inaugural class have moved their headquarters to Minneapolis. “It’s a good sign that there’s that much activity here that can support these accelerators,” Broshar said. In some cities, he added, it’s not uncommon for there to be five to 10 accelerators so it’s about time that the Twin Cities scene begins to grow, too. There are many different kinds of accelerators. The traditional model is one in which investors offer deep mentorship and guidance through 10- to 13-week-long boot camps in which they help companies fine-tune their strategies and focus. The goal for start-ups is often to strengthen their business models and to secure more funding. Last year, Eden Prairie-based Sprosty Network, a consulting and strategy firm made up mostly of former Best Buy executives, launched a new concept called RetailXelerator. Now in its third class, it focuses on later-stage companies ready to “scale up” and get products picked up by big retailers. Its 10-week program is run through webinars held once a week on everything from distribution and branding to product development and manufacturing. It culminates with all of the companies, some of them international, coming to the Twin Cities for a few days to make pitches before a private audience of retailers that have included Amazon, Sears, Verizon and Wal-Mart. The accelerator also works to set up one-on-one meetings with companies such as Target and Best Buy. Rick Rommel, who leads the program and previously led new business ventures at Best Buy, has seen firsthand how hard it is for retailers to work with small, nimble start-ups that may still be pretty raw. At the same time, retailers want to stay relevant and carry the newest products. “How do you breach that gap?” he said. “It’s getting harder to connect to retailers because there are more and more start-ups.” So retailers are asking for help with that curation, or to “find the needle in the haystack,” he said. While Sprosty partners weren’t sure what to expect when they first started, they’ve been pleasantly surprised to be inundated with several hundred applications for each class. They started small with the first class, which was focused on smart home products, and accepted just seven companies in the program. The second class was run exclusively for an undisclosed retailer that was looking for private-label options. All nine food-related start-ups in that class are in active negotiations or have purchase orders in place, according to Sprosty. The current class has 16 start-ups in it. While many accelerators require teams to move for the duration of the program (with the hope some will choose to move to that city), the Sprosty folks knew that can be a hardship. So that’s another reason why they decided to make their program web-based. That was one of the appealing parts of the program to Trago, a smart water bottle company out of Austin, Texas, that took part in RetailXelerator’s first class. The young company had already taken part in another accelerator the year before where they got more general mentorship and funding. And while its owners didn’t want to just hop from one accelerator to another, they saw a need in what Sprosty had to offer. “We are a small business,” said Jac Saltzgiver, Trago’s chief executive. “We didn’t have a sales team per se. We were just two people. So how do you go scale and get out into the market? It’s a tough problem to solve.” After pitch day, they connected through Sprosty to Best Buy, which will carry their products on its website, he said. Hax started coming to the Twin Cities last year upon the suggestion of its program director, Kate Whitcomb, formerly a buyer for Target in Minneapolis and then at Target’s smart home store, Open House, in San Francisco. Some companies like Apple, Amazon, Home Depot and Lowe’s often come out to meet Hax’s start-ups in San Francisco. But that’s not easy for every company, especially when companies have downsized corporate staffs. “They only have so much time,” Whitcomb said. “There is much less time for discovery.” So she thought it would be good for her start-ups to come to Minneapolis to make pitches directly to Target and Best Buy on their home turf. “We’re not always trying to help the team make a sale,” she said. “Sometimes, it’s just about getting feedback.” While most of the accelerators in the Twin Cities have a retail or product focus, Gener8tor, a Milwaukee-based program that expanded to the Twin Cities last year, is more open to all kinds of start-ups. “There wasn’t an all-purpose, generally available accelerator in town,” said Mark McGuire, a venture partner with Gener8tor. “We’ve had a lot of people asking us to come to town.” Gener8tor started in Minneapolis with a shorter, free and part-time version of its accelerator called gBeta, sponsored by the University of Minnesota. It is just for Minnesota-based start-ups and gives preference to U firms. It will run one or two more of those programs this year as well as a full-blown accelerator that will have no geographic restrictions. “Now the question is, can we get follow through funding for our companies that want to grow and stay here?” McGuire said.   kavita.kumar@startribune.com kavitakumar View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

The Latest: Prosecutor: Suspect did not take hostages Associated Press | 0 comments REYNOLDS, N.D. (AP) — The Latest on the manhunt for a suspect accused of shooting at a North Dakota state trooper, stealing a car with a baby inside (all times local): 12:30 p.m. A North Dakota prosecutor says the suspect accused of shooting at a state trooper did not take hostages before shooting himself in an apartment. Ramsey County State's Attorney Kari Agotness said in a statement Saturday that while other people were in the Devils Lake apartment with 23-year-old Daniel TwoHearts, "this was not a hostage situation." Police had said TwoHearts barricaded himself in the apartment with two hostages. Police got the man and woman out and were negotiating with TwoHearts when he shot himself. TwoHearts was airlifted to a hospital. His condition is not known. The ordeal began Thursday night with an attempted traffic stop in Grand Forks. Authorities say TwoHearts fired at a trooper who was not hit and stole two cars, including one with a baby inside. ___ 12:45 a.m. Police say a crime spree by a man who fired at a state trooper is over after the suspect shot himself rather than surrender. Police Capt. John Barnett tells the Devils Lake Journal (http://bit.ly/2k6lU3F) that Daniel TwoHearts shot himself once. He says the wound did not appear to be fatal before he was airlifted to a hospital. Police say TwoHearts fired three shots at a trooper after road spikes stopped his pickup, then stole a car with a baby inside it. Police again used spikes to stop him, and recovered the baby unharmed as the man fled. Police say TwoHearts later stole another car, abandoned it, then took a man and woman hostage in the apartment where he ultimately shot himself Friday night. ___ 4:30 p.m. Authorities say a second vehicle believed stolen by a man who shot at a North Dakota state trooper has been found abandoned, but the suspect remains at large. The North Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday the stolen GMC Sierra was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Devils Lake. Law enforcement officials in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota are on the lookout for the 23-year-old man. He's accused of shooting at a trooper, leading officers on a chase and stealing two cars, including one that had a baby inside. It began Thursday night when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks. The pickup driver fled but was later stopped near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. ___ 10:45 a.m. Authorities are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper in North Dakota and stealing a car with a baby inside.

Two others in the truck were arrested. Hischer says the suspect then stole an idling car with a baby inside from outside a residence in Hillsboro. He was stopped near Reynolds and fled. The baby was found safe inside. Authorities say he remains on the run after stealing another car in Reynolds. ___ 7:45 a.m. Authorities in eastern North Dakota are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper and stealing a car with a baby inside.

Panneerselvam vs Sasikala: Who will lead Jayalalithaa's party? Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here WASHINGTON: Even without an official White House title, Ivanka Trump is proving to be a power player. Just this past week, the first daughter joined President Donald Trump at a policy meeting with business executives and accompanied him on a trip to Delaware's Dover Air Force Base to honor the returning remains of a US Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. She hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have focused attention on the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organization and her own lifestyle brand, and moving to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband, Jared Kushner, who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Ivanka Trump told ABC's "20/20" last month. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside _ or for a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has tried to end speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by stepmother Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told "20/20" that "there is one first lady." But joining the president on the Dover trip was the kind of duty that usually would fall to the president's spouse. "That's a typical scene you usually see played out with the president and the first lady, not the first daughter," said Katherine Jellison, who heads the history department at Ohio University. In Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a private dinner. Ivanka Trump also weighed, behind the scene, on a policy matter. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have affected LGBTQ workplace rights and she supported a White House statement pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion. Her involvement was first reported by Politico. She also hit a few bumps and learned about the bigger spotlight for the first family. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of her and Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Rosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, said in a statement that the brand "continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016." A brand spokesperson said Nordstrom did order shoes and clothing for spring and moved forward with the purchase of clothing. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her company, which will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. The process of unwinding those roles is complicated. The Trump Organization has not filed paperwork yet to remove Ivanka Trump from its liquor license for a company tied to the Trump Soho hotel in Manhattan, according to New York State Liquor Authority spokesman William Crowley. He said companies must update their licenses within 10 business days of any management changes, and that requires agency review and approval first, and that process has not even begun because the agency has not received a request yet. Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, said Friday that all paperwork had been filed to separate Ivanka Trump from the businesses. He said it was a lengthy process and took several weeks. He did not immediately answer questions about that specific liquor license.

Gaming 32 0 0 February 1, 2017 Nintendo NES Classic Edition Stocks And Availability To Increase Soon? Ronald Cress Nintendo’s NES Classic Edition stocks quickly ran out when it was re-released 31 years after its original launch. What was initially a sort of a throwback and a tribute to the good old 8-bit days suddenly became an obsession – everyone on the internet suddenly went crazy trying to get their hands on one. Now, the Japanese company has sold 1.5 million units, and as a result, it is increasing the console’s production. During Nintendo’s recent earnings briefing, company president Tatsumi Kimishima confirmed the figures and at the same time apologized for the NES Classic Edition shortages. “We apologize to our consumers and retail partners for the inconvenience caused by product shortages,” he said. “Some parts require time to procure, but we are working to increase production.” Of course, with the increase in production, we can expect more stocks of the NES to make its way to retailers soon. It is unknown how long fans will have to wait for it to become available again, but at the very least, there is hope that more are arriving sooner than later. [Image by Eugene Hoshiko/AP Images] As of now, stocks of the miniature console are still elusive. GameStop released limited stocks last week, and they were all sold out within minutes. Walmart also frequently made the NES available in short doses in the past, but as can be guessed, a ton of interested fans did not even get the chance to see it go live on the website. Best Buy also has the NES Classic listed on its website, though it’s sold out. Target, on the other hand, may have some stocks in their physical stores. The retailer has advised fans to check their branches as the console will not be available on their website. For those who cannot wait for the NES Classic to become available again, there are always other options – but they must be prepared to pay more than the original cost. The NES Classic Edition only costs $59.99 – only if the buyer is lucky enough. As the console is hard to come by in major retailers, some have taken advantage of the situation to sell units for way more than its retail price. There are a lot of listings for the NES on Amazon and eBay, but note that they are fulfilled by marketplace sellers. A unit can sell for $100 and up, though one can consider himself extremely lucky should he be able to purchase one for less than double its original price. Third-party sellers in Walmart are also in on this profitable business. An NES Classic Edition unit sells for about $160 and up, depending on the seller. If it’s any consolation, though, all of them offers free shipping. CNET also reports that there are some NES stocks over at Chunk Toys and Player’s Choice, but they have it for around $200. Newegg has the console at its most expensive price on this list at $210 — still, it’s nowhere near the $5,000 NES console that was sold on eBay months ago. The console has 30 titles in it. Some 8-bit classics include Super Mario Bros., Mega Man 2, The Legend of Zelda and Final Fantasy. Nintendo has already announced that there are no more games coming apart from the original titles, so why is everybody suddenly willing to spend $60 and up on a package of 30 old-school games when they are available on emulators? Nintendo sells 1.5 million NES Classic Editions and apologizes for shortages. https://t.co/NSRXI0SvbV pic.twitter.com/fmO9n5XdG7 — Game Informer (@gameinformer) February 1, 2017 What propelled the fans to go crazy over the NES Classic Edition remains a mystery. Is it the nostalgia? Or is it the “limited edition” tag that comes with it? Would No Man’s Sky have fared better if Hello Games released a limited amount of copies? Unfortunately, no one knows the answer.

Track the turmoil in Tamil Nadu here WASHINGTON (AP) — She may have no official White House title. But Ivanka Trump already is proving that she is an unofficial power player. This week, the first daughter joined President Donald Trump at a policy meeting with business executives and accompanied him on a trip to Delaware's Dover Air Force Base Wednesday to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. She also hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have only underscored questions about the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organization and her own lifestyle brand to move to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Trump told ABC's "20/20" last month. Whatever Ivanka Trump does, it will likely be unprecedented. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside — or a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has sought to halt speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told "20/20" that "there is one first lady." But joining the president on the somber trip to Dover was the kind of duty that would typically fall to the president's spouse. "That's a typical scene you usually see played out with the president and the first lady, not the first daughter," said Katherine Jellison, who chairs the history department at Ohio University. Back in Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home in the tony Kalorama neighborhood for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a private dinner. Trump also weighed in this week on a policy matter behind the scenes. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have impacted LGBTQ workplace rights and supported a White House statement that went out pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion, which was first reported by Politico. Trump also hit a few bumps this week — and learned about the bigger spotlight for the first family. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of herself and husband Jared Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. A source close to Ivanka said she feels badly about what happened and regrets the post. Her self-named lifestyle brand also took a hit when Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Rosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, said in a statement that the brand "continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016." A brand spokesperson said Nordstrom did order both shoes and clothing for spring and moved forward with the purchase of clothing. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her lifestyle brand — which offers shoes, clothes and messages of female empowerment. Her company will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. The process of unwinding those roles is complicated. The Trump Organization has not filed paperwork yet to remove Ivanka Trump from its liquor license for a company tied to the Trump Soho hotel in Manhattan, according to New York State Liquor Authority spokesman William Crowley. He said companies must update their licenses within 10 business days of any management changes, and that requires agency review and approval first, and that process has not even begun because the agency has not received a request yet. Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, said Friday that all paperwork had been filed to separate Ivanka Trump from the businesses. He noted that it was a lengthy process, which took several weeks. He did not immediately answer questions about that specific liquor license. ___ Associated Press writer Bernard Condon in New York contributed to this report.

Ramsey County State's Attorney Kari Agotness said in a statement Saturday that while other people were in the Devils Lake apartment with 23-year-old Daniel TwoHearts, "this was not a hostage situation." Police had said TwoHearts barricaded himself in the apartment with two hostages. Police got the man and woman out and were negotiating with TwoHearts when he shot himself.

Law enforcement officials in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota are on the lookout for the 23-year-old man. He's accused of shooting at a trooper, leading officers on a chase and stealing two cars, including one that had a baby inside. It began Thursday night when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks.

Credit: AP photo President Donald Trump gives a thumbs-up as he walks from Marine One to Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., Friday, Feb. 3, 2017. prev next         comments Retired General Electric CEO Jack Welch says his two-hour White House meeting with President Trump and other business executives “far exceeded my expectations” and covered issues ranging from immigration to financial regulations to women in the workplace. “I’m telling you it was one of the best meetings I’ve ever been to in my life in terms of real stuff, real issues being discussed,” Welch told the Herald by phone last night. “No phony baloney. Nothing like that.” Welch said he has met with nearly every president since 1981, and found Trump surprisingly well-versed on topics, engaged and genuinely focused on the task of creating jobs. “Real guy and really concerned about every worker in the country,” said Welch. “Solid, down-to-earth, on top of the issues. The guys at the GE plant in Lynn would love him.” Welch publicly supported Trump for president, but pulled it in October after the “Access Hollywood” tape emerged of Trump making lewd comments about women. Trump met with Welch and a panel of CEOs from corporations including Tesla, JPMorgan Chase, General Motors and Wal-Mart and even assigned them tasks to perform before they meet again. Welch said the economic advisory panel will reconvene monthly at first, then quarterly. Trump broached a variety of subjects with the CEOs — a border tax, the travel ban, limitations on lending — but didn’t submit firm proposals, said Welch. “It was as intense as a GE staff meeting or a Herald staff meeting — guys with their shirtsleeves rolled up going at it,” said Welch. “There wasn’t one iota of negativity. The people in the room want to go to work for him and bring him the best suggestions possible, and he wants to get them done fast.” Trump’s huddle with corporate brass, however, drew criticism from Wall Street watchdogs, including Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who chided him for taking his first swings at easing financial regulations later in the day. “Donald Trump talked a big game about Wall Street during his campaign, but as president, we’re finding out whose side he’s really on,” Warren said in a statement. She blasted Trump for “literally standing alongside big bank and hedge fund CEOs,” and then signing two executive orders she claimed will benefit only Wall Street. The first Trump directive orders the Treasury secretary to review elements of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that was signed — or rushed, critics argue — into law in 2010 amid the Great Recession. “Today we’re signing core principles for regulating the United States financial system. It doesn’t get much bigger than that, right?” Trump asked as he scratched his signature on two executives orders from the Oval Office. The second orders the Labor Department to push back an April start date for an Obama-era rule requiring that retirement advisers put the best interests of their clients first. Supporters of the Obama provision contend it will keep advisers honest and stop them from steering their clients toward funds with the highest commissions. Critics argue it will limit retirees’ investment choices and could force them into unwanted low-risk funds. The orders continue Trump’s steady dismantling of President Obama’s legacy. Trump has already moved to strike down Obamacare, scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership and restart the Keystone XL Pipeline. Trump’s pause on immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations also drew Obama out of retirement to publicly encourage nationwide protests against the president’s actions.

Joshua Komer / Forum News Service2 / 3 Daniel Michael Two Hearts3 / 3 DEVILS LAKE, N.D. — A man facing an attempted murder charge was at large Friday night after shooting at a state trooper, kidnapping a baby and crisscrossing northeast North Dakota in multiple stolen vehicles, authorities said. The North Dakota Highway Patrol and other agencies have been looking for 23-year-old Daniel Michael Two Hearts since late Thursday. Law enforcement agencies said he fired a 9mm at a state trooper during a chase that spanned two counties Thursday night, according to a news release. The Traill County State's Attorney's Office charged Two Hearts with the Class A attempted murder felony, which carries a maximum punishment of 20 years in prison and a $20,000 fine. The Highway Patrol said Two Hearts abandoned a stolen 2013 GMC Sierra at the Devils Lake Wal-Mart shortly before 3 p.m. Friday. The vehicle was the fourth — including three stolen vehicles — Two Hearts used to elude police. Attempts to apprehend him started shortly after 9:30 p.m. Thursday near Grand Forks when a North Dakota Highway Patrol officer attempted to stop a red 2003 Chevy Silverado on Interstate 29 for a loud exhaust, according to a news release. The state trooper chased the vehicle, which at times exceeded 100 mph, south on the interstate toward Hillsboro, N.D., about 40 miles south of Grand Forks. Traill County Sheriff Steve Hunt said two Traill County deputies deployed spike strips just south of Hillsboro and forced the vehicle to stop about a mile south of town. Highway Patrol said Two Hearts then exited the truck and fired at the trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. Two Hearts fled on foot while two passengers in the Silverado were arrested. Meth was found in the pickup, according to the release. Law enforcement still were looking for Two Hearts as of 11 p.m. Thursday when they received a report of a stolen sedan with an infant inside in Hillsboro, according to the release. Authorities located the car, which was northbound on County Road 81 east of Reynolds, N.D., about 20 miles north of Hillsboro. Officers again deployed tire spikes, disabling the car. That's when Two Hearts fled on foot again, according to the release. The baby was found in the stolen vehicle safe and unharmed. Hunt said they were aware the baby was in the car when spike strips were deployed. "All things considered, it turned out about as well as it could have," Hunt said. However, Two Hearts continued to avoid capture. Sometime between 11:30 p.m. and 6:30 Friday morning, he stole a silver 2005 Ford Taurus in Reynolds, according to Hunt. The Highway Patrol said he ditched the Taurus in Northwood, N.D., 27 miles away, where he stole the GMC Sierra, later found in Devils Lake. The Highway Patrol asked residents not to approach the suspect and to report any suspicious activity to local authorities. Two Hearts is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs about 160 pounds, according to authorities. Two Hearts has faced multiple criminal charges in the past, including several cases involving theft, burglary, drugs, fleeing and escape.

Bush, the annual number of background checks conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or in some states, including Pennsylvania, by state law enforcement agencies, for citizens who want to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers such as Wal-Mart, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Dunham’s Sports and Grice Gun Shop fluctuated between 8.4 million and 12.7 million. Major news media, most liberally biased, gave frequent coverage — signifying their shock and dismay — to the rapid and unprecedented increase of background checks during the Obama administration. In 2009, there were 14 million. In 2016 there were 27.5 million. During Barack Obama’s eight-year term, there were 157.2 million. Most but not all background checks lead to a purchase. There are probably more than 100 million guns in private ownership and use in this country now than when Obama took office, despite his recurrent rhetoric about additional “reasonable restrictions” that should be imposed on it. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence for the claim that the gun-buying surge occurred not merely despite his rhetoric, but because of it. Be that as it may, there is another unpublicized but important aspect to the gun-buying surge during Obama’s administration. Over the past few years, the Pennsylvania Game Commission and wildlife management agencies in all other states have been receiving larger and larger annual payments from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. The money (generally referred to as P-R funds) is all tax revenue from an 11 percent federal excise tax on sales of rifles, shotguns, ammunition and archery equipment and a 10 percent federal excise tax on sales of handguns. The taxes were established by the Pittman-Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act, passed in 1937 and amended in 1970 and 1972. Annual P-R distributions to the Game Commission were in the $7 million to $9 million range during most of the Bush administration . They increased to $10 million in 2007 and $11.4 million in 2008. After Obama was elected they began to increase more abruptly, reflecting the surge in firearm and ammunition sales across the country, reaching $24.9 million in 2016. The P-R distributions to all states in 2016 totaled an impressive $695 million. Obama’s efforts to thwart lawful gun ownership and use by American citizens during his eight years as president were spectacularly unsuccessful but indirectly benefited wildlife conservation in every state. That’s a win-win for law-abiding Americans who cherish liberty and the natural environment. Phil Edmunds lives in Boalsburg.

Las Vegas Sun February 11, 2017 Currently: 62° — Complete forecast Las Vegas Sun The Sunday News Vegas INC Opinion Sports Politics Entertainment Las Vegas Weekly Events Sports betting UNLV sports Gaming Education NHL in Las Vegas Smith's World HS Basketball Newsletter signup 0 Union official blames staffing shortage for guard death Suchat Pederson / The Wilmington News-Journal via AP Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna, Del., remains on lockdown following a disturbance on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. Geoffrey Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware, said he had been told by the Department of Correction commissioner that prison guards had been taken hostage at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna. Associated Press Friday, Feb. 3, 2017 | 6:44 p.m. SMYRNA, Del. — The killing of a guard during an inmate uprising at Delaware's largest prison this week was entirely preventable, according to a correctional officers' union leader who blamed state officials for ignoring chronic staffing shortages that put prison workers at greater risk. Sgt. Steven Floyd, 47, was found dead early Thursday after a nearly 20-hour hostage standoff at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna. Late Friday, the Delaware Division of Forensic Science completed an autopsy and said Floyd's death was homicide by trauma. On Friday, Floyd was posthumously awarded a promotion to lieutenant and the Medal of Valor, the department's highest honor. Floyd was one of four staff members, including a female counselor, taken hostage Wednesday after inmates in a unit holding about 120 inmates ambushed him and forced him into a closet. Inmates released two hostages before a tactical team used a backhoe to breach the building and rescue the woman. "If there had been a correct amount of staffing for a maximum-security building, the inmates would not have been able to overpower the officers, take control of the building and murder Sergeant Floyd," said Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware. "Bottom line is, you cannot run daily operations of that building with three corrections officers safely," he said. The problem is not unique to Delaware, observers say. For years, many states have struggled to attract and retain correctional officers, largely because they are woefully underpaid, said David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project. "The correction officers are really the backbone of every prison ... if you don't have enough officers, really every aspect of prison operations breaks down," he said. In some states, prisons are competing for workers with Wal-Mart and McDonald's, Fathi said. In Nebraska, the state prison has trouble keeping correctional officers because its county jails will pay them much more, he said. Klopp who has worked for the Delaware Department of Correction for 29 years, says he makes about $49,000 annually. A rookie cop in the central Delaware town of Milford starts at $48,000, he said. Authorities have said there are about 90 correctional officer vacancies within Delaware's prison system on any given day. That's almost double the 55 correctional officer vacancies reported in fiscal 2010, but less than half of the 260 vacancies in fiscal 2006, according to a Department of Correction annual report. A department spokeswoman said Commissioner Perry Phelps would not comment on staffing until the investigation into this week's uprising is finished. But the department acknowledged in its most recent annual report that "workforce availability and eminent risk are intimately linked," and that current staffing levels reflect budgetary restrictions, not adherence to National Institute of Corrections recommended standards. When correctional officer jobs remain vacant, prisons are short staffed for extended periods, the report notes. It adds, "Covering security posts with officers who are unfamiliar with the tasks or post location elevates security risk." Klopp said one of the two guards taken hostage along with Floyd this week was a rookie, and the other was working overtime and not normally assigned to the building where the uprising occurred. Officers frequently are forced to work overtime to make up for staff shortages. Klopp said overtime pay amounted to about $22 million over the past year. Correctional officers often don't find out until the end of their shifts that they are being "frozen" to work an additional shift. "They are still forcing people to work overtime to make the facilities run at minimum staffing. They tell you you can't go home," Klopp said. "Not having enough staff, not having enough senior staff, and the amount of overtime that we work leads to fatigue and complacency, because we have to work so much to make the facility run," he added. According to a 2015 annual report, the DOC had 1,710 filled correctional officer positions in fiscal 2015, up from 1,664 the prior year but well short of the 1,796 approved positions. More than a decade ago, a state task force said staff and management were complacent about security at the Smyrna prison. The panel was established in 2004 after a female counselor was held hostage and raped. The inmate who held her was shot to death. Klopp said that, to his knowledge, none of the recommendations made by the task force in 2005 has been implemented. Klopp and state Sen. Bruce Ennis of Smyrna, chairman of the Senate Corrections and Public Safety Committee, said turnover among prison guards averages about a dozen a month. "They can't train them fast enough," Ennis said. "When you lose 13 guards a month, it's kind of hard to keep up." 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

But no mention was made of one particular place where Trump and his czar could improve things for about 700 Americans right away — the upstate chemical plant which Schwarzman had a stake in through a subsidiary of his private equity firm Blackstone until he sold his interest over the summer. The CEO of Blackstone opened the meeting by saying its purpose was to “advise the government on the areas where we could do things a lot better in our country, for all Americans.” Some of the other topics at the forum included “the immigration thing” as well as regulatory relief tax and trade, “women in the work place” and infrastructure, Schwarzman said. Blackstone Group CEO will earn record-setting $1B in 2015 As he and Trump — joined briefly by Vice President Mike Pence — posed for a White House photo-op alongside big-name business leaders from JP Morgan, Wal-Mart, Pepsi and others, some of the 700 striking union workers at Momentive Chemical plant upstate headed to court. They were there to fight the company’s efforts to cripple their strike — now in its third month. Momentive’s lawyers argued the strikers — members of IUE-CWA union — were a public danger, according to Dom Patrignani, the union vice president.

Organized labor making a comeback in America under Trump “It’s not our strike that’s hurting their image — it’s their failure to negotiate a fair and decent contract.” All the IUE-CWA union leaders are named as defendants in the case. Momentive’s lawyers are also targeting the “burn barrels” used by strikers to stay warm as they picket 24 hours a day. They told the judge the fires were a danger to the public, Patrignani said. “They’re trying to freeze us out, but we already have a back-up plan,” he said. Trump moves to lift bank rules imposed after economic collapse According to Patrignani, he’s already gotten phone calls from several unions as well as supportive citizens offering to donate outdoor wood stoves. Front page of the New York Daily News for February 3, 2017 “It’s already being worked out,” he added. The judge denied Momentive’s request for a temporary restraining order to curtail the strikers immediately. The rest of their injunction request will be heard Feb. 22, the judge said. NYC has the power to protect workers from construction accidents Momentive said it doesn’t comment on pending litigation. The 700 striking workers walked off the chemical plant in upstate New York Nov. 2 after contract talks broke down over proposed cuts to health care and life insurance. On Thursday, the strikers will be in the city to protest at Schwarzman’s Park Avenue home — even though the private equity firm owner sold his stake in Momentive and has nothing to do with its current labor woes, according to a spokesman.

A “double whammy” of a broken water pipe and a fluoride overfeed forced more than 80,000 Chapel Hill and Carrboro residents to search for beverages to last at least through the weekend. At the Walmart on U.S. 15-501, just across the Chatham County line from Orange County, people frantically rushed to the water aisle, only to find it empty. Employees tried to let them know when the next shipment was coming in. Standing in front of the beer and holding jugs of water, Jordan Thomas, a senior at UNC, said he had been on his way to his first midterm when he was told classes had been canceled and the campus was shut down. Thomas said his girlfriend works for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and is now deployed in Texas. When he told her about the Orange County water shortage, she told him to drop everything and find water. “It’s really strange,” he said. “I’ve been here for four years, and this is the first time anything like this has happened.” Thomas said he wasn’t particularly fearful, yet.

Some said they were preparing for Super Bowl Sunday when they learned about the water shortage and decided to pick up something extra to drink. Others said they were planning to leave the area and stay with friends or families. Nick Wilkinson and Allee Olive, who live in Carrboro, said they would stay with friends out of town Friday night. Wilkinson said they would stay with family in Winston-Salem if things became dire. Richard Pizzano was visiting UNC with three law school students from out of town and said that nearly every place in Chapel Hill they intended to visit was closed. “I wanted to take them to Top of the Hill, which is a classic place to take people, but it’s closed,” Pizzano said of the popular Franklin Street bar. He and the students are staying in a hotel in Chapel Hill and weren’t exactly sure Friday afternoon where they’d be spending the rest of their stay. “The traffic was horrendous,” he said. “It was like the scene from War of the Worlds when the Martians were coming and everyone was evacuating with the school buses (leaving). I have never seen anything like this.” Residents with questions can call Orange County emergency officials at 919-245-6111, send a text message to 888777 with the phrase “owasawater” in the message line, and get updates on Twitter @ocncemergency. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:10 UNC's Roy Williams discusses loss to rival Duke Pause 3:13 HKonJ March 2015 2:30 UNC's Justin Jackson credits Duke's toughness 2:40 Highlights from Duke's big win over North Carolina 3:11 Duke's Mike Krzyzewski on the Blue Devils' big win over rival North Carolina 0:33 High school basketball player scores 92 points in a game 7:23 Your guide to the penumbral lunar eclipse 1:26 Who's at the door?

(AP) - The Latest on the manhunt for a suspect accused of shooting at a North Dakota state trooper, stealing a car with a baby inside (all times local): 12:30 p.m. A North Dakota prosecutor says the suspect accused of shooting at a state trooper did not take hostages before shooting himself in an apartment. Ramsey County State's Attorney Kari Agotness said in a statement Saturday that while other people were in the Devils Lake apartment with 23-year-old Daniel TwoHearts, "this was not a hostage situation." Police had said TwoHearts barricaded himself in the apartment with two hostages. Police got the man and woman out and were negotiating with TwoHearts when he shot himself. TwoHearts was airlifted to a hospital. His condition is not known. The ordeal began Thursday night with an attempted traffic stop in Grand Forks. Authorities say TwoHearts fired at a trooper who was not hit and stole two cars, including one with a baby inside. 12:45 a.m. Police say a crime spree by a man who fired at a state trooper is over after the suspect shot himself rather than surrender. Police Capt. John Barnett tells the Devils Lake Journal (http://bit.ly/2k6lU3F) that Daniel TwoHearts shot himself once. He says the wound did not appear to be fatal before he was airlifted to a hospital. Police say TwoHearts fired three shots at a trooper after road spikes stopped his pickup, then stole a car with a baby inside it. Police again used spikes to stop him, and recovered the baby unharmed as the man fled. Police say TwoHearts later stole another car, abandoned it, then took a man and woman hostage in the apartment where he ultimately shot himself Friday night. 4:30 p.m. Authorities say a second vehicle believed stolen by a man who shot at a North Dakota state trooper has been found abandoned, but the suspect remains at large. The North Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday the stolen GMC Sierra was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Devils Lake. Law enforcement officials in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota are on the lookout for the 23-year-old man. He's accused of shooting at a trooper, leading officers on a chase and stealing two cars, including one that had a baby inside. It began Thursday night when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks. The pickup driver fled but was later stopped near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. 10:45 a.m. Authorities are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper in North Dakota and stealing a car with a baby inside. A North Dakota Highway Patrol trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. The pickup driver fled. Officers put down tire spikes and stopped the truck near Hillsboro. Lt. Troy Hischer says the suspect exited the truck and fled after firing three shots at a trooper, who was not hit. Two others in the truck were arrested. Hischer says the suspect then stole an idling car with a baby inside from outside a residence in Hillsboro. He was stopped near Reynolds and fled. The baby was found safe inside. Authorities say he remains on the run after stealing another car in Reynolds. 7:45 a.m. Authorities in eastern North Dakota are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper and stealing a car with a baby inside. The North Dakota Highway Patrol says a trooper attempted to stop a pickup truck on Interstate 29 in Grand Forks for a loud exhaust about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. The driver took off and led officers on a 40-mile chase. The man got out of the vehicle near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. Authorities say the driver ran to Hillsboro and stole a car with a baby inside. Officers caught up with the driver about 20 miles away. He fled into a field. The baby was safe in the car. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement President Donald Trump convened with the heads of some of America's largest corporations on Friday at the White House for a meeting intended to make good on the administration's pledge to reduce regulation, promote women in the workplace, and cut taxes. Meeting with biggest business leaders this morning. Good jobs are coming back to U.S., health care and tax bills are being crafted NOW!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric, told CNBC it had been a "fabulous meeting" and said the president "engaged forcefully" on every topic. Steve Schwarzman, CEO of private equity firm Blackstone and chairman of the council that arranged Friday's meeting, said the session had been "spirited intellectually" and that the members had had a "balanced discussion" about "taxes, trade, infrastructure, women's issues, education, and how to bring home jobs in terms of training people in technology." Other attendees at Friday's business huddle included members of Trump's economic advisory council, such as JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, Walt Disney's Bob Iger, Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon, and Mary Barra of General Motors. The meeting also included First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, senior adviser to the president; as well as Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. One notable absentee was Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned from his spot on the president's council Thursday amid fierce backlash from customers furious at Kalanick's seeming connection to Trump's controversial immigration ban that limits travel to America from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Kalanick said Thursday that his participation on Trump's council was not meant to be construed as any endorsement of Trump's policies. However, billionaire inventor and environmentalist Elon Musk, also heavily criticized for his position on the board due to seemingly contradictory stances with Trump, has not shied away from his role. In contrast to Kalanick, Musk tweeted a message on Thursday explaining that he was remaining on the board in order to "serve the greater good." Regarding the meeting at the White House: pic.twitter.com/8b1XH4oW6h— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 3, 2017 Corporate America is struggling to please an increasing divide: Customers and investors who oppose Trump's hard-line policies, and those who applaud his strong-arm techniques. And many business leaders on the president's council are stuck between a rock and a hard place as they seek to advise — or at least appease — the president while remaining firm on their own values and satisfying those of their client base. Related: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds', Won't Speak Out Against Trump Trump has already called out several major companies via Twitter, including General Motors, L.L. Bean, and Ford. In December, he tweeted, "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" Following his tweet, Boeing stocks slid by more than 1 percent in premarket trade.

The Strategic & Policy Forum is chaired by Blackstone CEO Stephen Schwarzman, who recruited the advisory committee's members. They include the CEOs of General Motors, JPMorgan, and Walmart. For the first meeting, the council discussed tax and trade, regulation, infrastructure, women in the workforce, education, and immigration. Notably absent were Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger, who said he could not attend due to a scheduling conflict, and Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, who resigned just a day prior to the meeting in response to pressure from his employees and customers in the wake of Trump's immigration ban. "We're bringing back jobs, we're bringing down your taxes, we're getting rid of your regulations, and there are some really exciting times ahead," Trump told the press ahead of the meeting. Click ahead to see who had a seat at the table in the White House's State Dining Room. Stephen Schwarzman — Co-founder chairman, and CEO of Blackstone © Provided by Business Insider Inc Schwarzman, the king of private equity, is the chairman of Trump's business council. As chairman, he selected its members, and told CNBC that the president "loved them all." At the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Schwarzman said he was bullish on Trump's effect on the economy. "We're going to have higher growth rates in the United States. We're liable to have a stronger dollar," he said. He noted that "We have to watch to see what happens [with] some of the tax proposals because they are highly complex. ... We have to be mindful of that." Indra Nooyi — Chairwoman and CEO of PepsiCo © Provided by Business Insider Inc Nooyi, along with IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, was assigned to the tax and trade topic for the first meeting.  The PepsiCo CEO found herself in a Trump-related fiasco following the election in November: In an interview with the New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin, Nooyi — who supported Hillary Clinton — congratulated Trump on his victory but noted that many of her employees were crying the day after his election, with minorities wondering if they would be safe in his administration. This led to a couple of viral fake-news posts and an online call to boycott Pepsi. Nooyi joined the business council in December as has not commented on the administration since. Doug McMillon — President and CEO of Walmart Stores © Provided by Business Insider Inc Though there are three female executives on the council, McMillon and EY CEO Mark Weinberger were tasked with speaking to the topic of women in the workforce. The Walmart CEO has not personally released a comment about Trump. But Walmart joined the Americans for Affordable Products group, along with more than 100 retailers like Target and Best Buy, who are in opposition to the Republican-controlled House's proposed "border adjustment tax" that would place a 20% tax on imported goods. Jamie Dimon — Chairman, president and CEO of JPMorgan Chase © Provided by Business Insider Inc In January, Dimon said in a public statement that he would do what he could to help the Trump administration improve the economy.  "The United States is well positioned to build on the momentum the US economy is already showing," he said. "President Trump and the new Congress have both identified economic growth and job creation as top priorities, and America's business leaders fully agree." Dimon and the rest of JPMorgan's leadership team sent a memo to staff following Trump's immigration ban offering support to affected employees and pledging dedication to a diverse workforce. Mary Barra — Chairwoman and CEO of General Motors © Provided by Business Insider Inc Barra was put in charge of the topic of regulation, along with Patomak Global Partners CEO Paul Atkins, and has already met with Trump and other automotive CEOs to discuss her industry. She told Vanity Fair in January that General Motors, with its "build where we sell" policy, has "much in common with the new administration," and that she is looking forward to working on the business council. Following the immigration ban, GM's head of HR sent a company-wide memo full of resources for helping employees affected by the travel restrictions.  Mark Weinberger — Chairman and CEO of EY © Provided by Business Insider Inc Weinberger, along with fellow male CEO Doug McMillon, led the discussion of women in the workforce. The EY CEO told Fortune in December he was "optimistic" about Trump's presidency, notably tax reform and infrastructure spending. In a statement sent to Business Insider following Trump's immigration ban, Weinberger said that while he understands the importance of national security, he was committed to assisting employees affected by immigration restrictions and noted that the restrictions "will have an impact on our ability to work as a globally connected organization." Ginni Rometty — Chairwoman, president and CEO of IBM © Provided by Business Insider Inc Rometty was assigned to leading the the discussion on tax and trade, along with PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. Following Trump's victory, Rometty wrote an open letter congratulating him and offering advice on the topics of vocational training, infrastructure, healthcare, government spending, tax reform, and veteran care. In response, an IBM engineer gathered support among colleagues to sign an online petition calling for the company to expand diversity programs and refuse to take government contracts — it got 1,000 signatures. In response to the immigration ban, IBM released a statement saying it was committed to diversity and inclusion and said it would advocate for openness in the world.  Larry Fink — Chairman and CEO of BlackRock © Provided by Business Insider Inc Fink led the discussion on infrastructure, along with Global Infrastructure Partners chairman Adebayo Ogunlesi. At Davos, Fink said that he expects tension between Trump and the Federal Reserve and that the administration would need to carefully navigate relationships with Japan and China, the country's two biggest lenders. One day ahead of Friday's business council meeting, Fink sent a memo to BlackRock staff calling for a recommitment to maintaining strong relationships with teams overseas and developing a diverse organization, during an "uncertain" and "uneasy" retreat from globalization. Elon Musk — CEO and CTO of SpaceX, CEO of Tesla, chairman of Solar City and co-chairman of OpenAI © Provided by Business Insider Inc Trump has an affinity for Musk, inviting him to his recurring tech council as well as his first big meeting at the White House. It is also in Musk's favor to have cordial ties to the administration, since Musk's companies Tesla, SpaceX and Solar City have benefited from billions of dollars in government subsidies. After Trump's election, Musk said he was optimistic about Trump's dedication to American manufacturing. Musk clearly expressed his disapproval with Trump's immigration ban and said he would discuss it with the business council. Following Kalanick's resignation from the business committee ahead of its first meeting, Musk released a statement saying that he was remaining on the council because while his participation did not suggest an approval of all of the administration's policies, "I believe at this time that engaging on critical issues will on balance serve the greater good." Jack Welch — Former chairman and CEO of General Electric © Provided by Business Insider Inc Welch, known for his intense and highly successful tenure as the head of GE from 1981-2001, has expressed his support for Trump primarily through his Twitter account. Following the release of Trump's lewd comments in an "Access Hollywood" leaked tape in October, Welch said he felt Trump was "the wrong messenger" for values he agreed with, but eventually reverted to a vocal endorsement of Trump's policies. Paul Atkins — CEO of Patomak Global Partners and former commissioner of the SEC © Provided by Business Insider Inc Atkins — as Trump's lead regulation adviser, outside of the committee — led the discussion on regulation, along with GM's Barra. Atkins was the Securities and Exchange Commission's commissioner from 2002-2008, and is a vocal opponent of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, which scaled back risk-taking among America's largest financial institutions in the wake of the financial crisis. Trump is expected to sign an executive order that would repeal the law, according to the Wall Street Journal. Adebayo Ogunlesi — Chairman and managing partner at Global Infrastructure Partners © Provided by Business Insider Inc Ogunlesi led the discussion on infrastructure, along with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.  The Nigerian billionaire investor has not commented publicly on his work with the Trump administration. Toby Cosgrove — President and CEO of the Cleveland Clinic © Provided by Business Insider IncPolitico reported that Cosgrove, a Vietnam War veteran, was Trump's pick for Veterans Affairs secretary, before Cosgrove withdrew himself for consideration in January. He had previously turned down the same offer from President Barack Obama. He told the Wall Street Journal in January that he was honored to have the president seek his advice. Rich Lesser — President and CEO of the Boston Consulting Group © Provided by Business Insider Inc Lesser has been CEO of BCG since 2013. He has not publicly spoken about the Trump administration. Jim McNerney — Former president and CEO of Boeing © Provided by Business Insider Inc McNerney, the former head of Boeing, has not spoken recently in public about his views on the Trump administration, but last March he told CNBC that he found Trump's rhetoric around trade to be "very dangerous." Kevin Warsh — Distinguished visiting fellow in economics at the Hoover Institute and former governor of the Federal Reserve System © Provided by Business Insider Inc Warsh was the Federal Reserve's Wall Street liaison during and after the 2008 financial crisis. He is seen as one of Trump's potential picks to fill a Fed governor slot, according to Politico. Daniel Yergin — Pulitzer Prize-winning author and vice chairman of IHS Markit © Provided by Business Insider Inc Yergin, an expert on energy, told Bloomberg after Trump's election that he expected the president to reverse the progress of regulation, and that global trade needs the most concern and focus within Trump's first 100 days.

In the process, he has opened rifts between companies. More About: Trump and Manufacturing Getty Images Advertisement President Donald Trump has needled Mary Barra at General Motors Co. He’s troubled Doug McMillon at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and gone after Boeing Co., once headed by Jim McNerney. Those business leaders, and about a dozen others, sat down on Friday with Trump to talk trade, regulation and more. Welcome to “The Apprentice: CEO Edition.” In his first two weeks as president, Trump has rewritten the Washington playbook for corporate America, as he has for U.S. allies. In the process, he has opened rifts between companies over how to approach matters ranging from taxes to immigration and revealed the first cracks in companies’ tentative embrace of him, drawing criticism from some of the chief executives who were in the room Friday morning. Popular Now FINANCIAL ROUNDUP: Lifted by Elevator Unit, ThyssenKrupp Returns to Profit Rockwell Automation Technology Will Help Manufacture Human Tissue, Organs Made in USA: Growing Panes for a High-Tech Window Company And from one who wasn’t: Uber Technologies Inc.’s Travis Kalanick on Thursday quit the president’s Strategic and Policy Forum after coming under fire from drivers and customers. Trump opened the meeting while the press corps was in attendance by flattering the CEOs, calling them “the biggest and best minds in the country.” With the topic of women in the workforce on the agenda, Trump positioned Barra to his left and PepsiCo Inc.’s Indra Nooyi and IBM’s Ginni Rometty to his right. The gathering of the 18-member group, led by Blackstone Group LP CEO Steve Schwarzman, will give America’s first billionaire commander-in-chief a chance to reprise his “Apprentice” role on a grand scale. Business, after all, is Trump’s world. And after decades of globalization, that world is shifting rapidly as a confluence of forces, both economic and political, signal an end to an era of unbridled trade. The format for the meeting is somewhat fluid, according to a person familiar with preparations for the session, and Kalanick’s departure upsets the plans. Walt Disney Co.’s Bob Iger didn’t attend as well due to a previously scheduled board meeting. ‘Emboldened’ CEOs Later in the day, Trump is scheduled to order reviews of a requirement that investment advisers work in the best interests of their clients, and the Dodd-Frank Act, a White House official said. After introductions, the CEOs and Trump discussed topics ranging from tax reform to infrastructure, with some executives presenting prepared remarks on specific issues. “I’m pleased to have been part of a very constructive discussion on how we can all work together on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. economy, create jobs and address safety and environmental issues,” Barra said in a statement. Barra was expected to talk about the auto industry’s desire for a second look at fuel-economy rules that the Obama administration affirmed just before leaving office. The Environmental Protection Agency mandates a fleet average of 50.8 miles per gallon by 2025, from 35.3 mpg today. Trump’s comment that automakers “are being so stymied, so restricted with regulation,” suggested that the subject had come up. Immigration, particularly sensitive for the technology industry, was at one point to be first on the agenda -- a week after Trump’s controversial action to halt immigration from seven mostly Muslim Middle Eastern countries that sparked nationwide protests and pushback from U.S. companies, including Nike Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. Kalanick and Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk had volunteered to lead that discussion, the person said. Kalanick, who was criticized by employees and customers for engaging with Trump, told Uber staff in a memo last week that he would raise his objections directly with the president. Will the Uber co-founder’s former colleagues in the group challenge Trump? On the issue of immigration at least, “they are emboldened,” said David Johnson, CEO of Strategic Vision PR Group in Atlanta. The protests against the executive order “gives them cover.” ‘Uneasy Times’ Musk expressed his objections to Trump’s executive order on immigration and suggested changes, in what Schwarzman told CNBC were “straightforward, easy” discussions. BlackRock Inc. CEO Larry Fink, a member of the forum, sent a memo to employees Thursday about the “uneasy times,” reiterating the firm’s “commitment to diversity and inclusion” and concerns about “the backlash against globalization.” What he will say at the meeting is anyone’s guess. Given the president’s penchant for surprise attacks against companies on Twitter, and his stance as a hard-bargainer in his real-estate career, the men and women in the room may be wary, Johnson said. “The big question is what Donald Trump do they get. People say that the Donald Trump in these private meetings is different than the public Donald Trump.” Taxes were on the agenda after battle lines were drawn this week on a proposal, spearheaded by House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, that would reshape the corporate code. A coalition of retailers and automakers announced its opposition to the so-called “border-adjustment tax” on Wednesday. The next day, a group of big industrial companies went public with its support. Billions at Stake At stake is billions of dollars in potential taxes. Both sides were represented at the meeting, with Wal-Mart’s McMillon against the plan and former Boeing CEO McNerney supporting it, Schwarzman told CNBC. The dueling arguments appeared to have pull with Trump, Schwarzman said. Supporters say it would boost U.S. job creation by favoring exports. Critics call it a new tax on American families -- because prices for goods would increase -- that might pay for companies that export a lot to reduce their taxes significantly. Perceived support or criticism of the president could generate boycotts on either side of the country’s partisan divide, Johnson said. “If it leaks out that they went along and didn’t say anything after taking stands publicly, their entire brand will look fake,” Johnson said. “Trump supporters will attack them as all mouth and no action. People who bought into the stand they were taking automatically turn on them.” The meeting is the latest in a series of White House events designed to allow Trump to solicit feedback from business leaders -- and burnish his image as a can-do businessman ready to strike deals. Since taking office, the president has welcomed corporate executives from the pharmaceutical and automobile industries to the West Wing, as well as union leaders and the heads of large American manufacturers. On Thursday, executives from Harley-Davidson Inc. rode their motorcycles up the south driveway of the White House.   Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Feb 01, 2017 Asia-Pacific China Europe Latin America North America Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Email Print Comment Quote In a political environment skewed by fake news and “alternative facts,” the real impact of President Donald Trump’s policies is easily obscured. At the recent Tarnopol Dean’s Lecture Series on the Trump administration and the economy, Wharton experts offered their unvarnished take on the impact of these policies on the capital markets, the dollar, economic growth and job creation — and backed them with analysis based on data. After closing above 20,000 for the first time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been giving back some of its gains of late amid a flurry of Trump mandates: escalation of a trade war with Mexico, anchored by a 20% tariff on its goods; making good on a promise to exit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in Asia; and instituting a temporary immigration ban on seven mainly Muslim countries that could hurt the quality of the U.S. workforce — especially in Silicon Valley — among others. Initially, the Dow was buoyed by Trump’s proposal to substantially cut corporate taxes, roll back many regulations and spend on infrastructure. “Investors and businesses very much like the Republican agenda. Notice I didn’t say the Trump agenda,” says Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel. “Why do they like the Republican agenda? Lower corporate taxes, less regulation, lower taxes on interest and dividend income. All that is very, very good for investors.” Siegel lays out the bull case: “If there’s a significant corporate tax cut, and most people expect there to be one, that could add 10% to earnings in and of itself. So that alone, you could say, could give 10% to the stock market. In addition, you have a cut back in regulations, which is something again that both investors and businesses want, that could be another boost that some people say could be worth 10%.” He notes that those projections do not even include potential gains from infrastructure spending. “If there’s a significant corporate tax cut … that could add 10% to earnings in and of itself. So that alone, you could say, could give 10% to the stock market.” –Jeremy Siegel However, U.S. stocks have been whipsawed lately by Trump’s other orders. “What the market doesn’t like is most of the Trump agenda that is not part of the Republican agenda — clearly, big tariffs on imports, such moves as restricting immigration in a significant way, currency wars — anything like that is very anti-Republican,” Siegel says. The market has moved up “cautiously” because it is yet unsure whether Trump will follow the Republican path all the way. “I’m not going to put all my marbles there yet because anything can happen under Trump.” The bear case is that the economy will take a big drubbing if trade wars break out. Siegel says that many Republicans believe the high Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the 1930s that taxed thousands of imported goods led to the Great Depression. While Siegel himself — along with most macroeconomists — does not agree with that premise (believing the cause was monetary collapse and the Federal Reserve’s inaction), if protectionism does break out globally, it would be disastrous depending on its magnitude. “If there is a trade war, the market would react extremely negatively,” he says. “We’d be down 10% to 15%.” Coming Trade War? Wharton international management professor Mauro Guillen says protectionism is a “terrible idea.” Trade barriers have been enacted in the recent past, such as President Nixon levying a 10% tariff across the board in the early 1970s. “Every time you’re introducing protectionism, you’re hurting the consumer.” There’s also the issue of substitution. If a 20% tariff on Mexican goods was put in place, it is not certain that people would automatically buy more products that are made in America. “Some consumers and companies will say, instead of buying from Mexico, I’m going to buy from an American-based producer, or they could go to China or Indonesia, or Costa Rica,” Guillen adds. “It’s not clear how the issue is going to play out.” Moreover, many U.S. companies will have to scramble to adapt quickly to a major shift in rules. “Many other companies that source components from China will be caught off guard,” Guillen says. “They’ve been doing business, they’ve been making investments, they’ve been making decisions for a long time assuming a certain set of rules. Now, if those rules change overnight, they’re going to find themselves in a very difficult situation.” Sponsored Content: Guillen further questions the rationale behind choosing to launch a trade war with Mexico, whose exports make up about 10% to 12% of the U.S. trade deficit. “Why pick a fight with Mexico? … The problem is broader than that.” He also points out that the 18% devaluation in the Mexican peso — since Trump won the election — could offset the 20% proposed tariff. Overall, Guillen says the larger question for Trump and his policies is this: “What are you trying to accomplish?” When it comes to trade, Siegel explains that Trump’s point is to level the playing field. “We let their goods in, but they don’t let our goods in. Or they put much more restrictions on our exports than we do on their exports. It is true if we get those countries to accept more of our exports, actually both of us would be better off. … We didn’t push hard enough” to get into their markets. However, Guillen points out these trade imbalances might be true for China, but not Mexico. “There is free trade both ways.” There is talk of instituting a “border adjustment” to further boost U.S. trade, says Siegel. The rule exempts exports of U.S. companies from taxes, but also reduces the deductions they can take on imports to lower taxable income. “This is a huge subsidy to exports, a huge tax on imports and every economist says that will cause the dollar to be stronger.” Siegel says some models see the dollar appreciating by as much as the actual corporate tax rate if the full terms of the border adjustment is adopted and the impact would be “mammoth.” Since the U.S. still imports more than it exports, he believes the net impact of this move will be to boost revenue. U.S. companies that make goods domestically and sell them abroad will be winners while big importers like Walmart are the losers. “The EU did not figure out exactly when to stop [centralizing decisions] and where to let in enough [national] decision-making.” –Mauro Guillen The dollar could appreciate by about 25% if the corporate tax rate fell to 20%, and the real value of imports and exports will be unaffected as exchange rates fluctuate, adds Kent Smetters, Wharton professor of business economics and public policy who was deputy assistant secretary for economic policy under President George W. Bush. (Siegel disagrees because he says it does not take into account global capital flows.) “But here’s the issue. Even though this creates a level playing field with France and other European countries that have a territorial VAT [value added tax], getting that through the WTO [World Trade Organization] — that will be the fight,” Smetters says. Some European companies get a VAT refund. Smetters says that back then, the Clinton administration instituted its own form of border adjustment, which the Bush administration inherited. However, the lawyer-stocked WTO ruled that it was illegal, he adds. “The lawyers understand statutory incidents” and have less insight into economic policies. European Tensions Europe is facing some deep divisions over economic and immigration policies as well. “Differences in opinion are getting bigger and bigger,” Guillen says. “On top of that comes Brexit [British exit from the European Union] but the most worrying is you do have populist parties, and their [support] is growing” in the upcoming European elections. These parties tend to be anti-immigrant and favor leaving the EU. Add to the conflagration the Italian banking crisis, a worsening situation in Greece and a youth jobless rate in some European nations of 45%. At least, the people who voted for Brexit got one thing right. “There’s this dogma in Brussels [EU headquarters] that more integration in Europe is the solution to every problem. I personally believe that’s not the case,” Guillen says. “The EU did not figure out exactly when to stop [centralizing decisions] and where to let in enough [national] decision-making.” Sharing one currency — over half of EU members use the euro — complicates the matter. However, Siegel believes no country will be leaving the Eurozone – the group that shares the currency. “If Greece didn’t leave the euro, no one’s leaving the euro. The idea is ludicrous that these [populist] parties in Italy are going to lead them out of the euro. The Italians remember the Italian lira [which at one point was trading at 2,500 to the U.S. dollar].” He notes that “if it weren’t for the immigration issue, there wouldn’t be Brexit.” Immigration Reform In the U.S., illegal immigration was a key issue for the Trump campaign. Trump has pledged to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico to stem the flow of undocumented workers and somehow make Mexico also pay for it. But an analysis by Smetters actually shows that deporting these workers — estimated between 11 million and 12 million overall — would hurt the U.S. economy. “Undocumented workers tend to take on lower wage jobs. … That forces native-born workers to, in fact, trade up in terms of their education, in terms of their skillset.” –Kent Smetters Trump’s plan assumes that if these workers were deported, native-born workers would take over these jobs. “That’s just simply not empirically true,” Smetters says. “When you export undocumented workers, those [typically low-skilled] jobs really aren’t replaced by native born workers” but by automation. Moreover, the presence of undocumented workers raises the wages of those who can legally work in the U.S. “Undocumented workers tend to take on lower wage jobs that don’t require English and that don’t require as much social skills. That forces native-born workers to, in fact, trade up in terms of their education, in terms of their skillset.” Smetters adds that while undocumented workers tend to have lower skill levels, a third of legal immigrants have college degrees. Guillen says immigration overall drives innovation, with immigrants launching 24% of all tech ventures in the U.S. over the past two decades. “That speaks volumes about the dynamism of immigrants at the high end and low end.” Smetters does see Trump softening his stance on immigration once he builds his long-promised Mexican wall. “If he gets that political win … everything will be more negotiable.” Ironically, the Trump proposal that could get plenty of political headwinds might be the issue of infrastructure spending. Wharton Dean Geoffrey Garrett, who moderated the talk, surmised that hardline Republicans wouldn’t want to run up the deficit while Democrats wouldn’t want to help a major Trump initiative. Smetters says one answer is to focus on repairing existing infrastructure instead of building new ones. “Repairs have the highest ROI [return on investment],” he says, noting that more than 400 Pennsylvania bridges need inspection in the next two years. If they fall into disrepair, “the disruption to transportation there could be very large.” Citing Knowledge@Wharton Close For Personal use: Please use the following citations to quote for personal use: MLA "How Will Trump’s Policies Affect the U.S. Economy?."

The real reason there can even be real sustainable growth in the first place is to institute (or threaten) policies that will bring back jobs to America. The only way US economy can start growing again is to bring back jobs. This will spur on the secondary markets. Trump’s agenda is the only one that will be able to do that. The rest of the analysis is simply academic of lower taxes. Cold and hard decisions are required. It is wishful thinking to suggest that the economy can have sustainable growth without trade wars. Dave Woods The last thing we want is to bring back jobs as we knew them. With our relatively small US population, we want to help create the integration and project management roles of the future, and open our borders to create win-win relationships for service and trade roles, which we clearly need. Je Ya I would like to respond because you are a Professor and assume you are a US Citizen. President Trump, your alumni, never wants to star a trade war. He always wants a fair trade。for example, if a country charges US products 70% tarrif but US charges theirs zero tarrif, who started trade war? Trump wants to charge 70% tarrif to match theirs, is this a fair trade or trade war? If your answer is latter, it only tells that you are not US citizen, or a US traitor, or the other country’s spy. Am I right? I am not a professor but a normal US citizen who know right and wrong. Je Ya Without logics or with twisted mind to force US citizens to believe you is why Hilary lost and Democratic Party lost in entire country legal systems from President, supremium court judge, senate, house, governors and there will be more and more loses to Democratic Party. If you want to win back, first you must love America from your heart. We do not see it from any Democratic leaders and members. Love is not from your mouth, is from your heart and action. You do not love America but Trump does. This article you wrote is another evidence that you do not love America! We see it crystal clear. Edward Dodson One of the great statements in defense of free trade was written in the late 19th century by the American political economist Henry George. However, his analysis went far deeper than to merely point out the counter-productive impact of tariffs, quotas and other such restrictions. George spent the last three decades of his life fighting against landed (i.e., rentier) privilege. Under the conditions then existing (little changed today) the benefits of free trade would be captured by the rentiers as increases in the asking price for land, natural resources and land-like assets (i.e., those best described as “natural monopolies,” such as the broadcast spectrum). Yes, we do need comprehensive restructuring of how government at all levels raises revenue. Reduction in the tax rate imposed on the value of actual capital goods (i.e., buildings, machinery, technologies) is the right public policy. Reduction in the tax rate imposed on income earned producing goods or providing services is also the right public policy. We want to encourage investment in capital goods and in the delivery of high quality services. Taxes on these assets and activities imposes significant deadweight losses on economic output. Rents, on the other hand, result from aggregate investment in public infrastructure and amenities. As economists generally acknowledge, the taxation of rents not only imposes zero deadweight loss on output, the exact opposite occurs. A near-100% tax on the potential annual rental value of locations and other natural monopolies makes it financially expensive to hold such assets out of production. Land parcels in towns and cities would very quickly be developed to highest, best use. Speculation in land would no longer divert large amounts of financial reserves from more productive use.

President Donald Trump's supporters call for a boycott. Uber allegedly takes advantage of the President's anti-immigration decree to drum up business? Users unsubscribe from the app en masse. Mr Trump's election has laid bare the deep divisions in American society, a discord that has forced many businesses to walk a fine line to avoid alienating consumers. "Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can," said brand expert Bruce Turkel. "The biggest problem is that anything they say can be misinterpreted." Sportswear manufacturer New Balance, for instance, found itself embroiled in controversy after its chief executive Matt LeBretton voiced optimism following the election. "We feel things are going to move in the right direction," he said in an interview, prompting outrage on Twitter, where users called for a massive boycott of the sneaker company, forcing the brand into damage control. "From the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them, we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life," the company said. Beverage giant PepsiCo faced similar backlash from the opposite camp. Two days after the election, the company's chief executive Indra Nooyi said her employees "were all in mourning". WALKING A FINE LINE Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can. The biggest problem is anything they say can be misinterpreted. BRAND EXPERT BRUCE TURKEL, on firms trying to avoid alienating consumers. The retaliation came instantly: "It's probably a good time to pass on the Pepsi products," conservative site The Gateway Pundit wrote. Calls for boycotts often proliferate on Internet forums such as Reddit and 4Chan, as well as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Others originate from more structured protests. The Grab Your Wallet website, launched last October, lists companies suspected of favouring Mr Trump, either because their leaders contributed to the real estate billionaire's campaign or because they do business with the Trump family. The long "boycott" list includes department store Macy's, retail giant Walmart and beer brand Yuengling. "Brands have always been political, but now consumers can see more of this activity and are making decisions based on this information," the site's co-founder Shannon Coulter says. The impact of boycott campaigns is difficult to evaluate, however, because calls to blacklist specific companies tend to get lost in the frenzy of social media. "Consumers have an incredibly short memory," marketing expert Merry Carole Powers said. Still, some companies fear losing customers by staying silent. Nordstrom, a chain of department stores, recently announced it would drop the Ivanka Trump clothing line belonging to the President's elder daughter. Last Friday, the chief executive officer of Cargill, the largest closely held US company, became the latest corporate leader to voice concerns about Mr Trump's executive order to curb immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and trade protectionism. In a speech and an opinion column in the Huffington Post, Mr David MacLennan warned of the economic dangers posed by curbs to legal immigration. He also said that trade protectionism risks creating food shortages and even sparking conflict. "There's no margin in the middle," says Mr Turkel, who recently wrote the book All About Them, focused on company branding. "If you stay quiet, you get nothing out of it. You have to figure out who your audience is and what are their values."

(NASDAQ:AMZN) got slammed after reporting a shortfall in its fourth-quarter sales and offering a below-consensus first-quarter sales guidance. While the sales concerns are justified, especially given that AMZN stock has risen 58% over the past 52 weeks, I view major share price weakness as an opportunity. AMZN stock trades at 55 times its 2017 earnings per share (EPS) and 22 times its book value, both indicating that major growth is discounted into the share price, so it should not be a surprise that the stock lost some ground. In reality, many traders probably hoped for a bigger decline than the 3.5% move.

In 2016, Amazon.com reported that it had delivered over two billion units for sellers while the number of active sellers surged in excess of 70%. In all, sales were shipped to shoppers in 185 countries from sellers in over 130 countries. (Source: "Amazon.com Announces Fourth Quarter Sales up 22% to $43.7 Billion," Amazon.com, Inc., February 2, 2017. ) In addition, AMZN stock will benefit from the growing adoption of the company's "Amazon Web Services" (AWS) cloud business that witnessed year-over-year growth of 47%, to $3.5 billion in 2016. A look at the yearly chart of Amazon stock shows the impressive upward trend that has been firmly in place since 2009.

The immediate result of that would be a fierce trade war that America would almost certainly lose. Trump is now entering uncharted waters. He has already demonstrated his ignorance of Asian affairs in a number of recent developments. For the moment, China has decided to wait for the US to make the first move. A trade war would be problematic for the region, not least for South East Asia, which would be most likely to suffer negative fallout as a major trade partner to both the US and to China. But it would not be a disaster for China, mainly because the US needs China more than vice versa. Unfortunately for Trump, it’s not the 80s anymore. Twenty years ago, the situation might have been different. China was dramatically underdeveloped, and it wanted access to Western technology and manufacturing techniques. China has most of what it needs now, and what it doesn’t have it can easily obtain from vendors outside the US. The fastest growing markets for the best items China produces, like laptop computers and cell phones, are in developing regions such as India, Latin America and Africa. In contrast, China itself is a market that the US can hardly ignore. By the end of 2015, Chinese consumers had bought 131 million iPhones. The total sales to US customers during the same period stood at only 110 million. And iPhones are only a small part of US exports. Boeing, which employs 150,000 workers in the US, estimates that China will buy some 6,810 airplanes over the next 20 years, and that market alone will be worth more than US$1 trillion. Were Trump to start a trade war, the most immediate effects would probably be felt by companies like Walmart, which import billions of dollars of cheap goods that are bought mostly by the people who voted Trump into office. The prices on almost all of these items would quickly skyrocket beyond the reach of the lower economic brackets — not because of manufacturing costs, but because of the tariffs. The result would be an economic war of attrition that China is infinitely better positioned to win. China’s foreign currency reserves now stand at about US$3 trillion. In contrast, the US has foreign exchange reserves that hover at around US$120 billion. Trump’s tariffs would automatically trigger penalties against the US in the World Trade Organization (WTO), and might even lead to the WTO’s collapse, which would lead to higher tariffs against US exports. While it might take a while for that to happen, the turmoil would be catastrophic for American business and employment. China, on the other hand, would emerge relatively unscathed. In fact, the importance of the US-China relationship is already being challenged by other players. Apple’s iPhone sales in China are running into competition from local Chinese manufacturers, and Samsung is more than happy to fill any void that the Chinese can’t deal with. Likewise, the Chinese would happily shift their trillion dollars in future aircraft purchases to Airbus, a European firm that is already building a plant in China to finish assembly of large, twin-aisle jets. Both China and leading economic experts hope that a trade war won’t happen. The American political system is relatively mature with checks and balances, but with a president who often acts uniquely based on his own beliefs regarding complex issues, almost anything is possible. Professor Winter Nie is the regional director of Southeast Asia and Oceania for IMD business school. Shanghai Daily condensed the article for space.

Officials say the missing girl is seven year old Ahrorha Eakin. She is a white female, blonde hair, about four feet tall and approximately forty pounds. According to the Rains County Sheriff’s Office Facebook post, she was last seen wearing a multi-colored sweater with a teal t-shirt and has purple fingernail polish. Officials say she was also wearing black pants. Her father is 29-year-old Jonathan Dwayne Eakin, about six feet tall, 180 pounds, with dark brown hair and hazel eyes. According to the Rains County Sheriff's Office Facebook post Eakin has a prominent tattoo of a lion, lamb and Scripture with vines on one upper arm and tattoo sleeves on lower arms. Around 1 pm, on Saturday the officials say Salina Eakin met her ex-husband Jonathan Eakin at the Emory City Park to comply with court ordered custody papers. At the time of the exchange , Jonathan said that, “he had a friend drop him off.” No vehicle was visible. Deputies say Salina left the children with Eakin and went home. Deputies also say she was ordered by the court to leave her children with him for the duration of his custodial visit. Deputies say Jonathan Eakin took all three children into the woods towards the creek, telling them that they were all “going for a hike”. In the process of this, he separated the children and crossed the creek, leaving his two sons (nine and eleven years old) in the woods. Jonathan fled from his sons with his daughter. Deputies add that at no time was a vehicle seen nor was a description of a vehicle obtainable. Jonathan is not known to own a vehicle. They go on to say that, a ground search of the area was immediately performed by Rains County Deputies and officers from surrounding agencies. The Emory Volunteer Fire Department provided assistance with search personnel and a drone equipped with a video camera. Rains County successfully obtained a latitude and longitude return on the phone about ninety minutes after the girl was last seen. The coordinates placed the phone in the Sherman, Texas area near a Wal-Mart. Successive pings to the cellphone indicated a northern direction of travel into Oklahoma. The Rains County Sheriff’s Office has received information that Jonathan’s intended destination might be the State of Colorado. A missing person’s alert has been issued. Deputies say they are trying to verify reports that Jonathan Eakin has done something like this before with the same daughter. Deputies say Jonathan has a license with the states of TX., FL. and CO. The Rains County Sheriff’s Office says Jonathan Eakin will be charged with kidnapping and most likely 2 counts of child endangerment for leaving his two sons in the woods. In a Facebook comment, the Rains County Sheriff's Office stated that there has to be specific perimeters met before an Amber Alert can be formally issued. They are working on getting all of the information so an alert can be sent out soon. If you have any tips or information please contact the Sheriff's office at 903-473-3153, or you can submit anonymous tips to the Lake Country Crime Stoppers at 903-885-2020. Copyright 2017 KTRE.

Like Germany in the 1940's, China has many more prisons and concentration camps: Here is a list of some of them, and they all hold political prisoners. Powo Tramo, Chushur Prison, Delapuxie Prison,Lhasa Juvenile Offender Detachment, Xizang Autonomous Region Prison, Karze Prison, and Trisam Prison for more details: click here I strongly encourage Secretary Tillerson in this article to press the Chinese on these prisons/concentration camps, and to ask for International monitoring. Maybe it is too much to ask and too soon, but what a message it would send if he were to visit Drapchi Prison in Lhasa Tibet, in addition to those stuffy formal boring state dinners in Beijing with all sort of bloviating speeches of course intent on covering up the genocide of Tibetans that has killed 20% of their population since 1959, and to keep up the tenor of responses, and not let our foreign policies re: Tibet and China devolve into mere corporate subservience. For Tibetans, this situation is awful, but will get worse and worse. The US doesn't use the Dalai Lama to "stir up trouble"; but only those few American with international knowledge combined with a sense of Justice and Compassion, have been outspoken about China's abuse of Tibetans, the genocidal tragedy that goes on an on, like a broken record with only noisy oblivious hostility from Beijing. I directly helped 6 to 8 Tibetan political prisoners get released from Chinese prisons, which are all over Tibet (like the concentration camps were all over Germany), so indeed I know of what I speak. - Advertisement - The strategy involved extensive correspondence in Mandarin pressuring the Chinese government through its Ambassadors in every nation in the world, to not continue its stupid and obvious genocide of Tibetans, that they weren't foooling anyone, despite having learned from the Germans' genocide to do it much more slowly, hide it much more secretively, and to label it as "re-education," concentrating on other methods like intentionally spreading AIDS and punishing any demonstration whatsoever of loyalty to the Dalai Lama. Maybe some in other nations will listen. The only one I distinctly remember as understanding these "non-professional" strategies of mine was Erkki Tuomioja when he was Foreign Minister. from 2000 to 2007 and 2011 to 2015. He is now a member of Finnish Parliament, and could far better and more effective advice to Secretary of State Tillerson than let's say the more likely prospects of listening to the CEO's of Walmart and other nations who do billions of dollars of business with China on a daily basis. I am truly gratified, surprised, and encouraged by Secretary of State Tillerson's response to written questions posed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but thus far, I feel uncertain that Trump will do nothing specific to help Tibetans in any way. By doing nothing in the White House, the Chinese will feel emboldened to step up their psychotic pathological lying genocidal oppression of Tibetans, unabated.

American neocons are bombing, invading, murdering, and destroying entire countries: including Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria. Lesser victims get President-selected drone assassinations. Everybody gets US gunboats sailing the seven seas, ready to open fire on any challenger to America's self-appointed hegemony. Other nations like Ukraine get the State Department/CIA-sponsored "color revolution" treatment: mercenary-led terrorism, civil war and regime change. US military activity in "the Dark Continent" is dark because US media don't report what happens in Africa. The CIA and other US military-security agencies operate black site torture prisons globally. The CIA has been staging coups, deposing elected governments, and installing neoliberal-friendly puppet regimes for decades. American neoliberals are waging financial and economic warfare against entire currencies and countries: including Venezuela, Russia, Iran, not to mention Puerto Rico and much of Latin America that is already under dollar-dominance. Americans are occupying a "homeland" that was taken by force from Native Americans, Mexicans, and Hawaiians in wars of conquest. And America's holier-than-thou "liberals" are being called upon to mount a moral high horse protesting what China is doing in Tibet?! When you can control the imperialist carnage that your own government is visiting upon nations, and stop the 'market' conquest and plunder that your bankers and corporations are wreaking upon the Earth, then you might be in a moral position to lecture other nations. Until then, focus on the log in your own eye rather than the speck in the other's eye.

After many years working inside and outside of poltics and as a Buddhist myself, I am at best one who practices and cultivates REALPOLITIK. I couldn't stop the Neocons and certainly can't stop any Republicans, all of which is totally out of my control and my spheres of influence, but if the new Secretary of State shows a positive stance on something I care deeply about, I will commend him in articles like this. re you the sort of person who would pontificate and toss about international value judgments and who would have sat silent while the Germans were destroying the Jews? That is how your comment rubs me. Do you imply that all of these bad things that America has done or caused disallows them to help the Tibetans? There are damned few international powers that will do so anyway, and I will not accept the kind of besmirching that you at least seem to be doing. Maybe you would like to clarify your position? Maybe you could write your own article but I hope it does more than castigate the US as the source of any valid commentary to help protect and preserve the Tibetans. The Chinese even imported prostitutes from large cities like Shanghai and Beijing who were infected with AIDS, to special brothels in Lhasa Tibet, whose sole intent was to bring down Tibetan men after they contracted AIDS. Maybe you should watch this 30 minute video about efforts by Spaniards to sue China for its abuses in Tibet: Submitted on Sunday, Feb 5, 2017 at 11:52:31 PM     (2+)   Maurice Webster (Member since Dec 6, 2016), 6 articles, 52 comments Reply to Derryl Hermanutz:    This article is about something positive that may be occurring in the larger context of the overwhelming maelstrom of largely bad news thus far since the Inauguration, and you sound as if you have some non-American's anger about anything reminding readers of Chinese Genocide or even the historic genocide of the Jews before and during World War II. Is that really your point of view? However, I think your insights are clear, judging, if I may, by your own words from your author's page, which are indeed well thought out. You appear to be a German living in Costa Rica, with a real sense of economic and philosophical history, which gives you some credibility in terms of international perceptions. Plutocracy is a neofeudal tyranny of lawless power, serving the interests of wealth rather than democratic justice. Responsible government with the power to legislate and enforce laws and control its own monetary system is our only bulwark against concentrated corporate power, which is why plutocrats are intent on destroying the credibility and power of elected governments leaving the new feudal masters free to abuse and plunder the masses of serfs at their leisure. But you are entirely missing the boat of accuracy when you comment on this heartfelt article: "you might be in a moral position to lecture other nations. Until then, focus on the log in your own eye rather than the speck in the other's eye." There are 300+ million Americans. If we waited until all of our ducks were lined up to make any international observations outside of someone else's narrow concept of what was permitted and what was tolerated by goosestepping philosophers and arm chair activists, nothing would get done, and certainly, China would be killing Tibetans off a lot faster than they have already. The author of this article has discerned one positive thing in the new administration's actions, perhaps a diamond in the haystack.

YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT TIBET WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT THREE BRUTAL BRITISH INVASIONS INTO TIBET FROM INDIA AT THE TURN OF 19TH-20TH CENTURIES, THE THREE OF THEM DEFEATED WITH HELP FROM CHINA (SHAME ON DALAI-LAMA!). The second was the bloodiest - around 1900 - and the diary of the chief of campiagn - Major Francis Younghusband (yeah, what a name) - was for sale on Amazon. You can't watch "Kundun" and "Seven Years on Tibet" without watching the Chinese movie "Red River Valley" about the invasion. And you can't condemn Mao (and I don't justify any atrocities committed by anybody whatsoever) without knowing that after independence of India, some of the British troops were moved into the Himalayan kingdoms which clearly loomed as a possibility of a 4th invasion. So again, the British Empire and the American which jumped into the bandwagon after the WWII are the same as responsible for the situation in Tibet. And no Tibetan in his/her sane mind would support Drapchi prison and Chinese nuclear dumpsites to be exchanged for CIA's secret prisons and Pentagon's test fields for WMD. Not to mention the fact that in the independent Tibet of the times before peasants were being expropriated of up to 90% of their production to feed the Court annd the monasteries, and no one knows for sure (maybe some Tibetans do) how many lives the construction of the Potala Palace claimed. So, no difference from other "great" civilizations worldwide, and no difference in the fact that Dalai-Lama represents essentially the interests of aristocracy which - same as the aristocracies worldwide - is playing a scam on his own people first, and then on those who identify him with "wonderful and unique" Tibetan culture and with Tibetan "traditional" society.

I have little tolerance for armchair observers with sweeping personal value judgments. I have been involved with Tibetan causes (particularly the ghastly plight of political prisoners in the many Chinese prisons built in Tibet) and their solutions for four decades. This article is a news article, above all, one that is genuinely enthused by the new Secretary's stance, and by contrast, I find very little since Nov. 20th that I can think of or write about as positive directions coming out of Washington. Watch this situation carefully. It is volatile and it is evolving rapidly. Please watch this video. There are many more on YouTube.

Occasionally I have some downloaded. Second, you should know me here by now. I coincided with you in comments to OEN stuff many times already. If there is one "armchair observer" who does NOT tolerate genocide ANYWHERE that is me. Congratulations for your involvement with Tibetan causes. But as I wrote once click here jumping into a mess and risking one's own life for a story certainly makes great journalism, but this approach makes analysis in depth impossible. One of a few exceptional reporters covering both is George Eliason - on Ukraine precisely. THE WAY he does journalism should be an example to all the reporters and activists. HISTORY IS THE SOURCE OF THE LAW - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. The same applies to Politics and Economics - the History is the key to understand and develop them, not the abstract concepts with pretension to be timeless or "eternal" click here - be it "communism", "democracy" or the over-thrashed concept of Human Rights. And same as it is useless to talk about TODAY'S Ukraine without talking about History of relations between Russia and Poland (and Germany and Ukrainian emigrants in the USA, as George wrote about it extensively), same as it is useless to discuss TODAY'S Colombia without going back to April 9, 1948, at least, it is USELESS TO DISCUSS TIBET WITHOUT DISCUSSING BRITISH INVASIONS. It is a disgrace and a hypocrisy. What is Dalai-Lama's concept of "independence" for Tibet beyond his books on spirituality? What I wrote above? China's never gonna let it happen for purely imperial(ist) reasons. So, enough of "color revolution" or "color independence" scams behind the mask of "struggle for democracy", "humanitarian interventions" or "regime changes". By saying this I DON'T justify ANY ATROCITIES COMMITTED BY ANYBODY (AS I STRESSED IT OUT ABOVE). But selling your soul to one devil so to get rid of another equals the same kind of ruin under another flag AND THIS IS THE LESSON FINALLY TO BE LEARNT FROM THE LAST 25-30 YEARS OF HISTORY - at least. Pope John Paul II - another "saint" - while thrashing the Teology of Liberation (with Ratzinger as the knight with the biggest spear in this enterprise) was doing business with Italian-American mafia and passing money to Pinochet - all in the name of "fighting communism" (speaking of videos, find the documentary "Bank of God" on www.telesurtv.net/english - and "Godfather III" - not-so fiction around John Paul I; the sequel to to it would be the Polish crisis - cooked up BY THE WEST within the "Soviet bloc" - which allowed Cardinal Wojtyla to become History's 2nd youngest Pope). And please tell me, the Finn you talk about was not Foreign Minister to Marti Ahtissaari - another disgraceful Nobel Prize in Peace given for creation of Kosovo - a private state created (largely by Clintons and Madeleine Albright) for a mafia of traffickers with drugs, weapons and human organs. And, BTW, main recruitment center for Daesh in Europe nowadays. Tillerson is not gonna help you unless Exxon Mobil finds oil in Tibet. As CEO he was more interested in Venezuela click here click here And if they do, they will ask for a treaty with Tibet demanding impunity to American military for War Crimes which Uribe gladly granted the US in Colombia. China is not gonna say a word unless the topic of British invasions is brought up (which in CHINA'S mind justifies everything it did) and if it is forced to negotiate anything on Tibet EVER, it's as clear as water that its standpoint wil be the History - vs. the "timeless" concepts of the West. The clash of imperialisms, however, with pretensions to "eternity" will be a sad show to watch. It's definitely time for the victims to unite and to see - first than nothing - where the historical enemies are. It's imperialism as phenomenon no matter the flag click here. It's the aristocrats. In terms of "development", it's the bait of a "vertical" one - up-and-up - vs. the need for the peoples to survive HERE-AND-NOW horizontally, but preserved for the longest time possible historically.

(Facebook) By Scott Hewitt, Columbian Arts & Features Reporter Published: February 5, 2017, 6:05 AM A   A Related story Doing the right thing can be nuanced, complex: Allies, accomplices, anti-racists present different challenges Going public A blogger named Kat Blaque posted a fascinating story about her internet adventures with an insurance agent named Kenneth. When Blaque posted an admittedly snarky comment about white men’s dislike of “political correctness,” Kenneth — a total stranger — came back at her with both guns blazing. His hatred was couched in threatening, obscene, sexually and racially violent language. He made death threats. Blaque stopped engaging. She simply took screen shots of his comments and shared them with her fans. They inundated Kenneth’s employer, New York Life Insurance, not just with complaints but with Kenneth’s own repulsive words. New York Life has a policy against such behavior. An investigation didn’t take long. Kenneth was fired within a day. And how did Blaque feel when all this was over? “I felt like getting some New York Life Insurance,” she wrote. — Scott Hewitt What you did, who you are When a thief steals your wallet, the video blogger Jay Smooth says, you don’t chase him down in order to label his character or scold his bad life choices. You want your wallet back. “I don’t care what he is, but I need to hold him accountable for what he did,” Smooth says. The same is true when it comes to tough conversations about race, he says. In commentaries called “How to Tell Someone they Sound Racist” and “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Discussing Race,” Smooth urges us to separate “what you did” from “who you are.” Focus on facts and behavior, not your judgment of someone else’s soul. Rather than provoking guaranteed defensiveness and denial by labeling someone “a racist,” point out that their words or deeds could be taken that way. Everyone makes mistakes, Smooth says, and everyone carries around thoughts and feelings they’re not proud of — stereotypes and prejudices that are best kept private. Denying they exist is pointless. We need to recognize and grapple with them. But language that allows no middle ground and no forgiveness doesn’t help. “We deal with race and prejudice with this all-or-nothing, good person/bad person” view, Smooth says. “Either you’re all racist or you’re not racist at all.” Options like that make it hard for us to admit that the reality is somewhere in between, and work on our imperfections, he says. “The belief you must be perfect in order to be good is an obstacle to being as good as you can be,” he says. —Scott Hewitt If You Go Clark County events related to Black History Month (All events are free, except where noted.) • What: “I’m Not Racist … Am I?” film screening, followed by a discussion with director Catherine Wigginton Greene. • When: 5 p.m. Feb. 9. • Where: Firstenburg Student Commons at Washington State University Vancouver, 14204 N.E.

That’s what we’re told about terrorism or even the hint of terrorism. So ask yourself: When a bully harasses and intimidates a stranger — unleashing a torrent of hatred at someone inhabiting a turban or hijab or the wrong skin color or gender, or who’s maybe smooching someone of the same sex — how far away from terrorism is that? (Webster’s definition: “The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.”) Most of us instinctively look away from trouble. It’s hard not to. But many are warning that an ugly new morning has dawned in America — a time when bigots feel permission to let their feelings fly. (In his smart “Saturday Night Live” monologue on Jan. 21, comedian Aziz Ansari begged all those liberated racists to “go back to pretending!”) “It seems like it’s OK because we now have this world leader who behaves this way, and was behaving this way before he got elected,” said Carmen McKibbin, local president of the League of United Latin American Citizens. “It didn’t prevent him from getting elected.” Now isn’t the time to recoil in fear. Now is the time to be an “upstander,” not a bystander. “Not doing anything sends a message both to the person who’s being targeted and to the oppressor that this is normal and OK,” said Michelle Polek of the YWCA Clark County. “It is not normal and not OK.” But, she added, you don’t want to increase the danger for the target, nor for yourself. “We want to send a very clear message — but we want everyone to be safe,” Polek said. Sometimes, speaking out “may not be the safest solution.” The Columbian reached out for practical advice and resources. What do you do, how do you help, when there’s an outbreak of hate speech nearby? Four D’s First, you prepare. Otherwise, soaring adrenalin and decreased brain power may get the better of you. Do what professional first responders do: get rehearsed and ready. According to Hollaback! — a New York City nonprofit that was launched to combat “street harassment” — you’ve got choices. Hollaback! calls them the Four D’s: direct, distract, delegate, delay. Here’s direct: Vancouver native Jasmine Rucker, an undergraduate and the president of Black People United at Washington State University Vancouver, was standing with her aunt at the checkout line at Wal-Mart in Hazel Dell when a white man started bullying the cashier — because she was wearing a hijab. That’s the traditional head covering worn by Muslim women in public. Rucker was scared, but her fiery aunt didn’t hesitate to scold the man: “How would you feel if you were just doing your job and somebody started bothering you?” At first the man got even more upset — but eventually he settled down and even apologized, Rucker said. Even more direct: A friend of Carmen McKibbin’s was alone in a local coffee shop when political news came on TV and a stranger gleefully asked if she’d be watching the presidential inauguration. She said no. The man instantly revved into anger. McKibbin’s friend calmly replied: “I don’t discuss politics with strangers. But I know how to use my pepper spray.” The hater backed off. McKibbin’s friend reported the incident on Facebook and got a wave of sympathy and support. These are ideal outcomes of situations that could have gone worse. Direct response can be risky; fighting fire with fire and using powerful labels like racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe, hater, harassment, can provoke even angrier, more outrageous behavior. Just as powerful, without a word being said, is standing by the victim and glaring at the hater. Or whipping out your cellphone and starting to record. Haters who realize their behavior will become permanent record can become humble, indeed. “There are clear but nonaggressive ways of showing where you stand and who you support,” said Stephanie Barr of the YWCA. Sideways A good illustration of the second D, distract, is a simple, four-panel cartoon by Maeril, a Parisian artist and blogger, that’s popular on social media lately. Maeril’s “What to do if you are witnessing Islamophobic harassment” features a man clenching his fists and screaming at a dark-skinned, hijab-wearing woman on a bus when a white bystander intervenes — in a sly, nonconfrontational way. Here’s a version: 1. Approach and ignore. Approach the person being attacked. Sit down and say hello. Be calm, collected and friendly. Ignore the attacker. 2. Friendly conversation. “How about this weather, huh? Did you see ‘Rogue One’? Isn’t it terrible about Carrie Fisher? Are you headed for the mall? Me too, I’m buying a birthday gift for my mother. I can’t believe she’s turning 85!” 3. Build the safe space. Maintain eye contact and dialog with your new friend. Never acknowledge the attacker. You are strengthening a safe space and derailing the threat. We learned this in school: Nothing deflates most bullies better than no attention and no reaction. 4. Escort if necessary. Ignored and irrelevant, the attacker backs off. Accompany your new friend to a safer place and ask if they’re OK; respect their wishes if they just want to go about their business. Barr said this model can be effective — and safe for the intervener. “I’m not a big person,” Barr said. “I’m five-foot-one. The strategies that I tend to employ are sideways.” This one’s even more sideways: A bystander on a subway in New York City saw kicking and punching break out between a woman and a man she said was following her. The bystander stepped in between them — while paying rapt attention to nothing but the potato chips he was munching. It was odd enough to distract the combatants; it bought enough time for others to get involved too. (The video wound up on TV news; New Yorkers hailed “Snack Man” and said his potato chip strategy could bring peace to the Middle East.) Hollaback! offers other ways to be distracting: Announce you’re lost and need directions. Spill your coffee. Make some other creative commotion. Sing “The Star Spangled Banner” at the top of your lungs. Here’s a combination of direct and distract (with nothing to do with race). A smart friend of this reporter once witnessed a fist fight on Main Street in Vancouver. He instinctively ran forward, yelling, “I just called 911!” It wasn’t true. But the combatants immediately fled in opposite directions. “The point is, don’t be silent when there’s something you can do,” Barr said. “Assess the situation. Use whatever power you have to say, that’s not OK.” Get help If you don’t feel safe stepping in, ask for help. That’s the third D: delegate. Try whatever authority figure is around: bus driver or train conductor, teacher, manager, bouncer. Try enlisting other bystanders. But don’t call police before checking first to make sure that’s what the victim wants, Rowland urged. The unfortunate reality today is that many minorities don’t trust the police. If the incident is over before you can intervene — if somebody hurls a racist insult and walks away — you can offer sympathy and help making calls. Which brings us to the last D: delay. You want to do the right thing, but you don’t want to get hurt. If you don’t feel safe stepping in immediately — or it’s all over before you know it — step in afterwards. Offer to be an escort. Offer support and sympathy. Ask how else you can help. The most damaging thing for victims, Barr said, is bystanders who look away and do nothing. “I have heard from people about the times they were harassed in public and everybody stayed silent. Nobody stood up,” Barr said. “They never forgot that.” Resources online • www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatterVancouverWA • Showing up for Racial Justice PDX: surjpdx.org • Showing up for Racial Justice Clark County: email surjccwa@gmail.com • www.ywcaclarkcounty.org • my.lulac.org/group/599 • studentaffairs.vancouver.wsu.edu/student-diversity • www.ihollaback.org • YouTube: “How to Tell Someone they Sound Racist” and “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Discussing Race,” video blogs by Jay Smooth   Scott Hewitt Columbian Arts & Features Reporter  360-735-4525  @_ScottHewitt  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Snodgrass was shot at her friend’s Brookside home, where her friend’s son killed his mom then shot himself. The T-shirt’s slogan, “Tougher than Tupac,” came from Snodgrass’ nephew, who pointed out that the hip-hop artist reportedly was shot four times and died, while Snodgrass was shot five times and lived.

Courtesy of Kristen Oehlert 1 of 7 i By Katy Bergen kbergen@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Alice Snodgrass was chatting with her longtime friend Nicki Alexopoulos in the living room when she saw a shadow outside her friend’s Brookside home. “That’s Patrick,” Alexopoulos said quietly as her 38-year-old son approached the door. When Patrick Alexopoulos entered the foyer that afternoon last October, Snodgrass saw her vivacious friend’s demeanor shift. Nicki became subdued and alarmed. Patrick wanted $25,000, and he wanted it now. Nicki, sitting quietly with her hands in her lap, her eyes cast down and her leg on a footstool — she was still recovering from knee surgery — refused his demands. He drew a gun and began to describe it — the number of bullets, the magazines. He came off as inexperienced and accidentally fired it at the floor. The noise was loud, but it didn’t appeared that a bullet had dented the floor. Snodgrass wondered if the weapon was fake. Sirens blared somewhere, and that seemed to unnerve Patrick. He told his mother to make up her mind. Snodgrass smelled the lasagna she had brought burning in the oven and asked permission to take it out. In the kitchen, she wondered what to do. Her phone was in the foyer. And what kind of weapon was a pan of lasagna compared to a gun? Snodgrass was standing in the formal dining room behind Patrick when he fired the first shot into his mother, in the leg. She doesn’t remember thinking, just pushing toward and out the front door. “I just knew at that point that I had to contact other people,” Snodgrass recalls. “Yell. Scream. Get away. Because he had finally used the gun.” And then, just as fast, she was down, the impact of bullets shoving her face-first into the frontyard grass. As she waited to die, she heard more gunshots. Then, silence. A reason to visit Nicki Alexopoulos’ daughter, Kristen Oehlert, had asked Snodgrass to pay her mother a visit. Snodgrass had known Alexopoulos and her family for more than 30 years, since the women met teaching in mid-Missouri. Alexopoulos had recently discovered that her son had embezzled money from her 96-year-old father and herself. Banks were preparing to prosecute, leaving Alexopoulos with a mountain of paperwork and stress. She planned to ask for a restraining order against her son, confiding to family he had been physically abusive earlier that year. She could use some cheer, Oehlert, 34, said. And when Snodgrass called Alexopoulos, her friend was eager for a visit. So on Oct. 25, Snodgrass headed north from her home in McDonald County to have dinner with an old friend. Domestic violence is an insidious crime, and that day it disrupted a quiet Brookside neighborhood. Shortly after 6:30 p.m., Patrick Alexopoulos used a 9 mm gun to shoot his mother to death. He shot Snodgrass five times. He killed himself. Snodgrass wonders now if she was a wrinkle in his plan to intimidate his mother for money. A retired teacher and school librarian, Snodgrass had spent 42 years married to Ted, the love of her life, raised two children into adults, kept close relationships with family and friends — she felt as if she was an unlikely person to experience domestic violence firsthand. But in October it became a permanent part of her story, as it had long been for Nicki Alexopoulos. Snodgrass likens her experience to literature, a passion both women shared. “The theme is that domestic violence can happen to anyone. And more people probably need to know the warning signs. And that more of these organizations need help making families aware of what can be done for them,” Snodgrass said this week from her home in McDonald County, where she returned after nearly a month at St. Luke’s Hospital. “The plot would be the 30 years Nicki went through. With the final chapter, I became a victim, too.” A friendship is born Snodgrass and Alexopoulos’ friendship started in a preparation period they shared with Snodgrass’ sister, also a teacher, early in their teaching careers at Boonville (Mo.) High School. Snodgrass, a home economics teacher, and Alexopoulos, an English and literature teacher, shared the same witty and biting humor and quickly became “close and loud” friends. The principal swore he would never give them the same prep period again. “They’d laugh at each other, and they’d put each other in their place,” said Oehlert, Alexopoulos’ daughter. “They were both outspoken, independent women. They clung to each other in that regard.” The friendship remained strong even when Snodgrass changed school districts, and when Alexopoulos got divorced from her first husband years later. Oehlert’s close relationship with Snodgrass helped, too. Alexopoulos was an academic, and a talented writer, Snodgrass said, but she was by all accounts lacking in certain homemaking skills. Oehlert turned to Snodgrass to learn cooking, sewing and crafting things. Eventually, Oehlert tagged along on Snodgrass family trips, giving her mother a respite from parenthood when Patrick was in high school and spending more time with his friends. “It was an opportunity,” Oehlert said, “for her daughter to spend time with a close family friend that she’d had the utmost respect and trust in.” Snodgrass said she never developed a relationship with Patrick, who was “not easy to get close to.” She said she knew that throughout Patrick’s adulthood Alexopoulos experienced times where her son seemed angry and troubled, but it wasn’t something Alexopoulos talked about with her often. In the mid-1990s, Snodgrass moved to McDonald County with her family. She’d spend the next 14 years teaching library science before retiring in May 2009. Her husband, a U.S. Army veteran and member of the Missouri National Guard whom she met at the University of Missouri, served as a principal at elementary and junior high schools before retiring in 2006. Alexopoulos moved to the Kansas City area in 1996 and taught at Fort Osage High School. Following retirement in 2001, she became an adjunct professor at Avila University. They continued to see each other when they could: at Oehlert’s track meets, her wedding in 2007, a trip to Branson, Mo. And they supported each other through harder moments, such as Ted Snodgrass’ death in June 2015 from colon cancer. It seemed to Snodgrass that later in her life, Alexopoulos was “beginning to connect with things she had lost.” She found old photographs of her family and shared them online. She would travel to New York City and apartment-sit for a producer. She loved the Humans of New York photography series. She married again, and though the relationship ended, she remained friends with her second husband. And she also became more open about sharing a part of her life Snodgrass was familiar with — her experiences much earlier in her life with domestic violence. For Domestic Violence Month in October 2013, Alexopoulos began writing detailed Facebook posts about her experiences, the abuse that she told others was directed at her and Patrick. She was also beginning to write down her memories in journals with the hopes of someday publishing her work, Oehlert has said. Alexopoulos wanted to speak about her experiences to help other people who found themselves the victims of “undeserved torture.” “We tell our stories of violence against humanity not because we want people to feel bad or pat ourselves on the back,” Alexopoulos wrote. “We tell our stories because, if we do not, the world might forget that this type of violence ever occurred.” Snodgrass remembers reading one of Alexopoulos’ posts while on a cruise in Hawaii with her husband. “I’d sit on that cruise ship and read them, and I felt so blessed,” Snodgrass said. “Like, ‘Hey, I’ve had a pretty good life.’ “You are on a cruise with your husband, and your friend is talking about the absolute terror she went through isolated in a rural area.” Waiting to die In the front yard of Alexopoulos’ home, Snodgrass never lost consciousness after she was shot. Instead she tried to move, and, in pain and bleeding profusely, stayed put. The scream she tried to summon when she left the house never came. A neighbor returned to his house to secure his family, then ran out to her. Snodgrass wasn’t sure how much time passed. She thought of Ted, who had left the military without a scratch. She would die, Snodgrass thought. She would die, reunite with her husband, and have to explain why she had joined him so soon. In an ambulance, a paramedic whispered in her ear. “You are five minutes away from St. Luke’s Trauma Center, and you are in the first ambulance out of here,” she remembers him saying to her. She heard him speak to other emergency responders. “There are two more inside, but there is no hurry,” he said. And it was then, Snodgrass says, that she knew for sure that her dear friend was gone. Out of the woods On the night of the shooting, word traveled quickly. Amanda Judy, Snodgrass’ daughter, was getting gas on her way to work as a retail manager at a Wal-Mart in Butler when she picked up a phone call from an unknown 816 number. “Your mom’s been shot,” a person at the hospital said. “Your mom’s been shot, but she doesn’t want you to speed.” Judy, 43, didn’t think immediately of domestic violence. She thought of carjackings, a drive through a bad neighborhood. She began calling family and friends. Snodgrass’ son, Robert, 32, got a similar call but let it go to voice mail because he was out to dinner with a friend. His number was the only one Snodgrass could remember to tell hospital workers — it’s one digit different from her own. The hospital found her daughter’s number through Judy’s work. Robert had just purchased a new house in Joplin, and his mother had spent a lot of time painting it with him, sharing her concerns about Alexopoulos and her son. When he heard there was a shooting, he said he felt he knew immediately who had done it. At the hospital, an entourage of people in the waiting room learned the extent of Snodgrass’ injuries. She had been shot at least five times. Her left arm was shattered. She had extreme abdominal injuries and had an ostomy bag inserted. Doctors said they were optimistic but deeply worried about the possibility of infection. For the next day and a half, it was unclear what would happen. But doctors were encouraged when Snodgrass woke up. That morning, Snodgrass still couldn’t talk because her ventilator was still in. “Do you know where you are?” her family asked. She nodded. “Do you know what happened to you?’ She nodded. She spelled out Nicki’s name on a letterboard, inquired about her glasses and later, when she could speak, asked how she was going to vote. In the weeks that followed, doctors marveled at her body’s resilience. She spent just five days in the intensive care unit. She needed additional surgery to put a metal plate, screws and a rod in the arm that a bullet had shattered. She had seven open wounds, one that has yet to close. A bullet remains in the left part of her chest. Snodgrass said she was pleasantly surprised by her visitors: high school classmates she hasn’t seen in three decades, former students, her physician from McDonald County, Alexopoulos’ neighbors, some of whom gave her a guardian angel necklace she still wears. At night, when there was less fuss about her, Snodgrass said she dwelled on everything that happened. “You lay in the hospital, and they pester you all day,” she said. “You wake up in the middle of the night, and you realize how lucky you are and also what you lost.” Five days after the shooting, Snodgrass’ 10-year-old granddaughter, Lexi, pulled her mother into a bedroom and demanded to know how “Grandma was really doing.” And Judy touched her daughter’s arms and belly to show her where Grandma was injured, and told her Grandma was going to be OK. Later, the Judys had to write to a teacher to let her known that if their son, Matthew, who is enjoying a “tall-tale” phase, speaks about his grandmother getting shot, he actually isn’t fibbing. Both Judy and Robert Snodgrass uprooted their lives to take care of their mother. The week before Thanksgiving, Alice Snodgrass returned home. By Christmas, she was functioning by herself with the help of her children and home health aides. And by New Year’s Eve, Snodgrass sent her son back to his new house in Joplin. But recovery remains tough, even as Snodgrass heals. Robert Snodgrass said he and his mother counted on the kindness of the community, the friends who raised money for her by selling “Tougher than Tupac” T-shirts (the hip-hop artist was shot four times and died, and Alice Snodgrass was shot five times and lived), a former nurse from church who came in the middle of the night to help the Snodgrasses through a tough night, the dozens of people who brought food during the first several weeks, the former student who still comes to pack an abdominal wound when home health aides can’t visit. “I shouldn’t have been surprised at the level of the support she got from the entire community,” Robert Snodgrass said. “The level of support she got was amazing.” Finding a new normal Despite it all, Alice Snodgrass will tell you that getting shot five times is not the worst thing to ever happen to her. That is the loss of her husband, whom she met when one of her sorority sisters at Mizzou set a few girls up on dates with her military friends. Alice and Ted Snodgrass weren’t paired together on that first date in early 1973. They were married by August. He wouldn’t have been “much of a nurse,” she admits. He was humorous and sarcastic, and sometimes that led to friction. “But you miss that kind of thing,” Snodgrass said, and she believes his death is a “harder thing for me to get over than this.” And so as her body heals, she continues life without Ted. Her left arm has grown stronger — she can hold a 4-pound weight. Her right hand still has some numbness. The scars on her arm from two bullets have yet to soften. She has one last surgery planned in April. And then there’s the massive wound — the one on her stomach that has taken months to heal. She is eager to return to her life, to stop missing school foundation meetings for nurses appointments, to end the home health visits, to get her beagle-Pekingese, Ridley, back from her son. And then there’s the question: What next? The Snodgrass family and others are quietly dismayed by the gun laws that allowed Patrick Alexopoulos to buy a gun the same morning he shot his mother and Snodgrass. But Snodgrass knows that advocating for stricter gun laws in Missouri might “be swimming upstream.” She wants to do more advocacy in the domestic violence realm, as Oehlert also plans to do in the coming years. She’ll start by speaking at a Ceremony of Life for Alexopoulos planned for 2 p.m. Feb. 25 at the Uptown Theater. Snodgrass sees their story as a reminder that domestic violence can happen to anyone, that if “you don’t help in any kind of situation that can erupt into violence, the violence can reach out and touch you.” “You can become a victim, also,” she said sitting in her kitchen last week. “Even an unlikely victim. But if you do survive, then you got a life to give back to. And that’s what I’m trying to do.” Katy Bergen: 816-234-4120, @KatyBergen Related content Wounded friend recalls Brookside murder-suicide LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Crime Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:01 Idaho's Sally Boynton Brown speaks at Democratic forum Pause 1:49 George, an 8-week-old Lab Mix, steals hearts on UberPUPPIES Day 2:45 Somali refugees settle into their new home in Kansas City 3:30 Community prepares for Somali family's arrival after executive order barred them last week 2:16 Paint collides with metal during the World of Wheels show 2:57 Royals introduce outfielder Jorge Soler 2:07 Somali refugees finally arrive at new home in Kansas City 0:53 Five things to know about Royals pitcher Jason Hammel 0:30 Little kids from both soccer teams join dogpile after a goal 2:32 Melania Trump's focus as First Lady is to end cyberbullying Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago Here's a closer look at Crime Stoppers TIPS hotline 1:56 a day ago Here's a closer look at Crime Stoppers TIPS hotline 2:57 3 days ago Prosecutor, defense attorney make opening statements in Van Note murder trial 0:54 4 days ago Two men found shot to death in Kansas City, Kan.

Pawan Singh / The National Dubai Chamber suggests mall owners should lower rent amid retail slowdown Andrew Scott February 5, 2017 Updated: February 5, 2017 10:43 PM Related Structure of Al Maryah Central mall in Abu Dhabi completed Yas Mall attracts 40 million visitors since opening Dubai retail space rise may bring rents down to keep units full, says JLL Hatta mall a part of Aswaaq expansion UAE megaprojects 2016 – in pictures Related Structure of Al Maryah Central mall in Abu Dhabi completed Yas Mall attracts 40 million visitors since opening Dubai retail space rise may bring rents down to keep units full, says JLL Hatta mall a part of Aswaaq expansion Topics: Shopping Mall owners should reduce rents to compensate for the slowdown in the retail sector, the chief of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said. Hamad Buamim called for mall operators to reduce their rents this year after retailers reported a severe contraction in sales through 2016 as macro factors such as a strong US dollar, low oil prices and Brexit-heightened job insecurity curbed spending. Retailers could come under more pressure if the dollar, to which the dirham is pegged, appreciates further. That is likely, according to the US investment bank Citibank, which expects the greenback to appreciate by another 7 per cent this year. "We need the mall operators to reduce rents and costs," Mr Buamim said. He said last year, "most retailers did not actually lose money but they did not see any growth. We need the mall operators to make rents and costs variable, so it is a win-win situation for both parties. The dollar has made the UAE very expensive, our retailers must realise that if they limit themselves to Dubai then there will be little growth available". About 260,000 square metres of retail space was completed in Dubai last year, according to broker JLL, which is the highest volume handed over since 2010. This is expected to be exceeded this year and next, with 350,000 sq metres due in 2018. A significant indicator of the headwinds facing the retail sector was the decline in sales registered by Dubai Duty Free last year, despite rising passenger traffic through Dubai’s airport. While the retail climate is increasingly challenging in the UAE and the wider region, some groups are still expanding. Virgin Megastore plans to add one store in Qatar in May and another in the Emirates this year. While many retailers registered double-digit losses against 2015, Virgin Megastore posted single-digit losses, and hopes for a return to sales growth with its application of sales technology. "The Apple Store opening in Mall of the Emirates hit our sales," said Nisreen Shocair, the president of Virgin Megastore Mena. She said Virgin mitigated the downturn by bringing in value-priced products with higher margins and a refusal to discount. "We found the use of technology helped us target our customers. We knew families still like to spend 30 minutes in the shop, but they had economised. Technology will play a big role in the brand moving forward as we know our customers better. We are looking forward with realistic optimism." The rise of e-commerce has also played a part in the struggles of conventional retailers. Data about the options and choices viewed by customers has allowed digital players to target customers and tailor their products. This knowledge needs to be harnessed by online and offline merchants. "The UAE is behind the curve on digital analytics," said Danny Karam, the vice president of Booz Allen Hamilton. "Mall operators and retailers need to know what time you came to the mall, how long you spent and at what shops you stopped, which can lead to predictive retailing. The giant retailers Walmart and Westfield have been using this technology with programmatic ads that target you specifically. The UAE’s retailers need to offer omnichannel experiences to gain the data first." Nakheel, the developer behind Ibn Battuta Mall, said its retail rents were linked to the Rera index and "therefore reflected market conditions". Majid Al Futtaim, the owner of Mall of the Emirates, and Emaar, which owns The Dubai Mall, did not respond to queries from The National. David Macadam, the chief executive of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centres, said the "percentage rent model" is better suited to softer economic conditions where rent is linked directly to turnover. ascott@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Retail Dunkin’ Donuts’ parent beats expectations as profits rise KFC owner Yum Brands hurt by loss of appetite for Pizza Hut Nissan unfazed by Trump’s Mexico factory outbursts as sales accelerate Lulu opens new Saudi hypermarket MOST VIEWED Business | All Person named on loan is liable for UAE debts, and not his family UAE visa renewal rejection is Government’s prerogative Money & Me: Dubai MMA fighter saves up for the lean times High costs of fixed-term savings plans means lost trust in financial advisers must be rebuilt a step at a time Gratuity Calculator app helps resigning UAE employees figure out what they’re owed Divorce costs alter depending on your location IEA says Opec complying on oil production, but sees coming supply growth HLG appoints new management team and embarks on strategic review Red Bull Air Race gives Abu Dhabi’s tourism sector wings More Most Viewed Rare celestial show will be visible in the UAE on Saturday America’s ban on Iranian citizens has handed hardliners ammunition Red Bull Air Race season takes off against Abu Dhabi’s ‘spectacular skyline’ Princess Haya and children make Dh145 million donation to needy families in Jordan Iraq’s prime minister calls Trump, asking for country to be removed from travel ban list Why I won’t invest in anything that involves effort Person named on loan is liable for UAE debts, and not his family Pakistan Super League 2017 fixtures: When and where to watch each match in the UAE UAE Air Force arobatic team shows its colours at the Red Bull Air Race - in pictures UAE visa renewal rejection is Government’s prerogative More Most Viewed Back to the top EDITOR'S PICKS Gratuity Calculator app helps resigning UAE employees figure out what they’re owed Q&A: What Abu Dhabi’s 3 per cent municipality fee means for you Where Abu Dhabi rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures Where Dubai rents have risen and fallen, Q3 2016 – in pictures FOLLOW US Tweets by @TheNationalUAE SPOTLIGHT Targeted by Assad, Syrian athletes fight to keep sport alive Emirati life coach Hala Kazim on finding the road to happiness About us Contact us Work with us Privacy policy Terms and conditions Advertise with us Subscribe Sitemap super.ae alittihad.ae thenational.ae anazahra.com ngalarabiya.com adtv.ae adradio.ae admedia.ae

Andrew Seng aseng@sacbee.com Grace Brito, 7, and her mom, Nicole, play with an American Girl doll who has her own toy diabetes kit, complete with an insulin pen, pump and blood-sugar monitor. Andrew Seng aseng@sacbee.com 1 of 4 i By Claudia Buck cbuck@sacbee.com With an estimated 30 million Americans struggling with diabetes, the disease is one of the nation’s most entrenched chronic conditions. It’s also one of the most expensive. Consider these facts: ▪  In California, roughly 55 percent of adults either have diagnosed diabetes or blood-sugar levels that put them at high risk of developing the disease. That includes roughly 1 in every 3 adults ages 18 to 39 – a finding researchers call alarming. ▪  In terms of personal health care spending, diabetes tops the nation’s list of 155 chronic conditions, hitting $101.4 billion in 2013. According to the American Diabetes Association, average medical expenditures for people with diabetes are an estimated 2.3 times higher than for those without it. ▪ The cost of insulin alone has spiked by triple-digit percentages in the past 20 years. “It’s horrible for patients,” said N. Chesney Hoagland-Fuchs, a registered nurse and chairwoman of the Diabetes Coalition of California. She said prices for insulin medications began a slow climb after the recession and started “shooting up” around 2013. Over the past 20 years, the price of human insulin produced by two major manufacturers – Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk – rose 450 percent, after accounting for inflation, according to a 2016 Washington Post analysis of data from Michigan-based Truven Health Analytics. A single 10-milliliter vial of Eli Lilly’s Humalog insulin – less than a month’s supply for many adults – was listed at $254.80 last year, compared with $20.82 in 1996, a Truven Health representative said. Insulin is only one sliver of the cost of living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Depending on their treatment regimen, diabetics often spend hundreds of dollars annually on medications, syringes, pumps, needles, blood-sugar sensors and monitors, even alcohol swabs for finger stick testing. It all adds up. On average, those with diagnosed diabetes have annual medical expenses of $13,700, more than half of which is directly attributed to their disease, according to the American Diabetes Association. Grace Brito, just 7 years old, has been coping with Type 1 diabetes for almost half of her young life. Because her body cannot produce insulin, Grace gets six daily shots, tests her blood sugar with finger pricks six or more times a day and wears a costly monitor that checks her glucose levels around the clock, alerting her mother whenever her blood sugar spikes or dips. All told, her Sacramento parents spend nearly $1,600 a year on medical supplies to keep her diabetes in check, not including diabetes-friendly snacks and juice drinks. If it weren’t for health insurance, said her mother, Nicole, the family’s costs could be triple that amount and completely unaffordable. For instance, Grace’s glucose-monitoring system – a three-part sensor, transmitter and monitor recommended by her doctor – would have cost nearly $4,000 retail, but was covered by the family’s Kaiser health plan. “I renew every time a prescription comes due. If we were having to pay more, we’d be scraping by,” said Brito, a mother of three whose husband works in sales for Verizon. “You never know if your insurance somehow lapses. Or you have nothing on hand to help you out. I worry about that.” Last March, a UCLA Center for Health Policy Research study estimated that more than half of all Californian adults – 15.5 million people – either have diagnosed diabetes or are prediabetic, in which blood sugar levels are higher than normal but not yet considered full-blown diabetes. Nationally, diabetes diagnoses only recently have slowed after steadily rising for about two decades. In 2012, nearly 30 million U.S. adults had diabetes, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Another 86 million Americans have prediabetes, according to the CDC. If current trends continue, the CDC estimates, as many as 1 in every 3 Americans could have diabetes by 2050. A lot of this happens behind closed doors, so it’s very hard to distinguish what’s really being paid. Jeffrey Hoch, associate director, UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research, speaking of the negotiations in which drug prices are set The most common form of diabetes is Type 2, which typically occurs in adults and is caused primarily by age, obesity, physical inactivity or family history. It can be controlled with diet, exercise and medications to lower blood-glucose levels, but often progresses to requiring daily insulin injections. Type 1 diabetes, often diagnosed in children and teens, occurs when the body’s pancreas stops producing insulin. It’s called insulin-dependent diabetes because patients cannot survive without the hormone, either by injection or a pump. The personal cost of managing the disease is daunting. Treating diabetes soaked up $101.4 billion in personal spending in 2013, primarily for pharmaceuticals, according to a study last year by the University of Washington-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Diabetes topped the institute’s list of 155 conditions tracked over 18 years, including cancers and heart disease. In California alone, the cost of treating diabetes was estimated at more than $27 billion in 2012, according to the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes drugs are a significant part of the national debate over out-of-control prescription drug costs. One cause for increasing prices is growing demand as more people are diagnosed. Even though three pharmaceutical companies – Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi – manufacture insulin products, competition has not lowered the annual list price of these lifesaving drugs. Pharmaceutical companies regularly tweak their insulin products, extending their patents and preventing generics from entering the market. Another factor: Pharmacy benefit managers, who negotiate with drug companies on behalf of health plans, set prices that aren’t disclosed. So what people pay depends heavily on how well their insurance provider negotiated. “A lot of this happens behind closed doors, so it’s very hard to distinguish what’s really being paid,” said Jeffrey Hoch, associate director of the UC Davis Center for Healthcare Policy and Research. “The price is related to what insurance you have, and the results are different whether you’re on Medicaid, Medicare or are self-paid or on private insurance.” To cope with rising costs, some patients cut corners. Some use their doctors’ free insulin samples. Others stretch out their dosages, cutting them in half or skipping every other day. Some reuse insulin needles. In worst-case scenarios, patients stop using insulin, which can cause severe spikes or drops in blood sugar, said Hoagland-Fuchs of the statewide diabetes coalition. If left untreated, the disease can lead to serious complications including stroke, kidney disease, blindness and lower-limb amputations. Some patients have gone back to older types of insulin, known as NPH, which sell for as little as $25 a vial at Walmart. While affordable, these older versions are slower-acting than the newer versions. “The danger is that (NPH) kicks in three hours after you take it,” said Hoagland-Fuchs, creating gaps in which patients could experience dangerously high blood-sugar levels. “It’s a tool we shouldn’t be using.” Diabetes is the cash cow of the pharmaceutical industry. You have to have (insulin). You have to buy it or you risk losing your life. Keith Wick, 31, a Sacramento IT specialist with Type 1 diabetes Higher costs appear to have created an online marketplace for some diabetes products. A recent Sacramento Craigslist ad, for instance, offered “CASH ON THE SPOT FOR DIABETES TEST STRIPS” while promising “pickup within 30 minutes.” Even those with an employer’s insurance find the costs daunting. Keith Wick, a 31-year-old information technology specialist, was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a teenager. Two years ago, the Sacramento resident was paying about $60 for a 90-day supply of Lantus and Humalog, which covered about five insulin injections a day. Today, even with Kaiser Permanente health insurance, that same dosage costs about $210, roughly a 250 percent increase. “Diabetes is the cash cow of the pharmaceutical industry,” said Wick, who works for the state Department of General Services. “You have to have (insulin). You have to buy it or you risk losing your life.” Wick and his wife are squirreling away savings to pay for newer technology to treat his diabetes. Wick wants to buy a continuous glucose-monitoring system, which would cost about $6,000 for an insulin pump and $1,000 for the blood-sugar sensor and monitor. His health plan will cover about 80 percent of the hardware cost, but that doesn’t include the disposable insulin cartridges and the sensor’s batteries, which must be replaced every three months. And he’d still need to test his blood-sugar levels at every meal with finger sticks. Last year, to cover the anticipated expense, Wick and his wife added money to their health plan’s flexible spending account. “It’s expensive. It’s a lot out of your pocket every year,” said Wick, who’s had Type 1 diabetes for about 18 years. For Medi-Cal patients, the state covers the full cost of diabetes medications, but price spikes have led to constraints on which medications Medi-Cal doctors can prescribe. Dr. Gilbert Simon, medical director of Sacramento Family Medical Clinics, which treats about 30,000 Medi-Cal patients in Sacramento County, said doctors are required to start with cheaper, non-insulin solutions that are often not as effective at reducing blood-sugar levels. “It prolongs the process of getting to the most effective medications,” he said. “The real cost to patients is in delayed treatment.” The combination of rising diabetes diagnoses and spiraling costs is a “terrifying” prospect for Harold Goldstein, executive director of Public Health Advocates, a Davis-based nonprofit that commissioned the 2016 UCLA prediabetes study. Calling it a vicious cycle, Goldstein said higher costs mean lower-income people often don’t have the financial resources to manage their disease, compared with those who can afford better medications and monitoring systems. As a result, they often land in hospitals with expensive complications, which only adds to California’s overall medical costs. “If we want to get health care costs under control,” Goldstein said, “the single most (important) thing we have to do is get diabetes costs under control and prevent diabetes from happening in the first place.” Claudia Buck: 916-321-1968, @Claudia_Buck Related content Mom describes how costs add up to treat her daughter's diabetes Health & Medicine Suggested for you Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:35 See dramatic aerial views of damaged Oroville Dam spillway Pause 1:09 Oroville Dam spillway: 'It's not supposed to do that' 1:43 Water continues to rush down Oroville spillway on Friday 1:02 Union Pacific train derails into water south of Elk Grove 1:14 UC Davis law student helps free people detained in San Francisco's airport after Trump refugee executive order 0:44 Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying 1:08 Damaged Oroville Dam spillway undergoes more water releases 1:40 Eric Holder makes first visit to California Capitol as outside counsel 0:31 Watch incredible water releases from Oroville Dam - 15,000 cubic feet per second 1:48 Oroville Dam spillway endangers baby salmon Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago "It's slowed me down.

Users unsubscribed from Uber after the company allegedly took advantage of the US anti-immigration decree to drum up business. Published: 13:59 February 5, 2017 AFP   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Washington: Starbucks promises to hire 10,000 refugees? President Donald Trump’s supporters call for a boycott. Uber allegedly takes advantage of the president’s anti-immigration decree to drum up business? Users unsubscribe from the app en masse. Trump’s election has laid bare the deep divisions of American society, a discord that has forced many businesses to walk a fine line to avoid alienating consumers. “Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can,” says brand expert Bruce Turkel. “The biggest problem is anything they say can be misinterpreted.” Sportswear manufacturer New Balance, for instance, found itself embroiled in controversy after its CEO Matt LeBretton voiced optimism following the election. “We feel things are going to move in the right direction,” he said in an interview, prompting outrage on Twitter, where users called for a massive boycott of the sneaker company, forcing the brand into damage control. “From the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them, we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life,” the company said. Beverage giant PepsiCo faced similar backlash from the opposite camp. Two days after the election, the company’s CEO Indra Nooyi said her employees “were all in mourning.” “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white: Are we safe?” she said. The retaliation came instantly: “It’s probably a good time to pass on the Pepsi products,” the conservative site The Gateway Pundit wrote. Calls for boycotts often proliferate on internet forums such as Reddit and 4 Chan, as well as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Others originate from more structured protests. The Grab Your Wallet site, launched in October, lists companies suspected of favouring Trump, either because their leaders contributed to the real estate billionaire’s campaign or because they do business with the Trump family. The long “boycott” list includes the department store Macy’s, retail giant Walmart and beer brand Yuengling. “Brands have always been political, but now consumers can see more of this activity and are making decisions based on this information,” the site’s cofounder Shannon Coulter says. The impact of boycott campaigns is difficult to evaluate, however, because calls to blacklist specific companies tend to get lost in the frenzy of social media. “Consumers have an incredibly short memory,” marketing expert Merry Carole Powers says. Still, some companies fear losing customers by staying silent. Nordstrom, a chain of department stores, recently announced it would drop the Ivanka Trump clothing line belonging to the president’s eldest daughter. “There’s no margin in the middle,” says Turkel, who recently wrote the book “All About Them,” focused on company branding. “If you stay quiet, you get nothing out of it.” “You have to figure out who your audience is and what are their values.” Uber appears to be playing by ear as it devises its strategy. The company first distanced itself from Trump’s executive order temporarily barring refugees and travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries. But it then came under fire for allegedly taking advantage of a New York taxi driver protest against the ban, prompting a wave of unsubscriptions. As taxi drivers went on strike refusing to pick up passengers at JFK airport, Uber not only continued to operate but also dropped its surge pricing. Rival Lyft was quick to set itself apart, vowing to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed lawsuits against Trump’s measures. The strategy paid off with the Lyft app notching more iPhone downloads than Uber for the first time. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick then attempted to make amends by quitting Trump’s business advisory group, saying “the executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America.” And with the approach of the Super Bowl — one of the advertising world’s central events — every marketing move is facing microscopic scrutiny. The beer giant Budweiser is slated to air an immigration-themed advertisement focused on the difficulties the brand’s German founder faced when he arrived in the United States in the 19th century. South of the border, consumer trends are less divided. In Mexico, the campaign “Consumers, the cry of war” is urging people to boycott all American brands in protest against Trump’s anti-Mexican threats.

Mike Wolanin | The Republic Local News A new use Vacant grocery store being renovated by new owners By Mark Webber - 2/4/17 10:08 PM A vacant former supermarket on Columbus’ east side has a new use — community grocery store and restaurant. Guanajuato Grocery Store and Restaurant is expected to open sometime in March at the former Marsh Supermarket building at 2710 State St., said owner representative Jaime Campos. One of Campos’ brothers currently operates La Guanajuato, a small Mexican food outlet at U.S. 31 and Henry Lakes Boulevard near Taylorsville. But Campos said the substantially larger location on Columbus’ southeast side will be a full service supermarket featuring fresh meats and vegetables. While the groceries may be conventional, the cuisine of the more than 70-person capacity restaurant on the building’s northwest side will be mostly Mexican food, Campos said.

Now supervising the renovation, Jaime Campos is the brother of owner Geraldo Campos, who operates four similar businesses in the Indianapolis area, Jaime Campos said. The Campos brothers named their stores Guanajuato after a small state in central Mexico northwest of Mexico City where they were born and raised. Located on a 2.56 acres lot, the store and restaurant near the CSA-Fodrea campus will have 26,383-square-feet of space. Since the 58-year-old building has always served as a supermarket, the renovation did not require involvement by the Columbus Planning Commission, said Jeff Bergman, city/county planning director. First operated as a Marsh Supermarket, the Indianapolis-based Marsh later re-branded the building as a LoBill Food Store. The store was then converted into a Marsh Hometown Market, which provided 45 full-time jobs, before finally closing at the end of February 2013. At the time, a number of city officials viewed the Marsh closing as another blow to an area already needing revitalization. For east-side residents, the nearest grocery store would be Walmart on 10th Street, about two miles away. But even with the past history of the building, Jaime Campos said his family feels confident in their investment. “We’ve had a lot of successful in Indianapolis, and we’re hopeful it will be the same thing here,” he said. The property, long owned by now-retired Little Champ Oil Inc. president Tom Crippen, was sold to Geraldo Campos on Nov. 20, 2015, for $450,000, public records show. Impressed by both the size of the building and the parking lot, Jaime Campos initially thought the renovation “would be something easy to do,” he said. However, that was not the case. In fact, Jaime Campos estimate his family will have invested nearly $200,000 in improvements by the time the grocery store opens. Much of the existing electrical and plumbing that needed work had been encased in cement, according to county inspection reports. “We had to take all the floors up,” Campos said. “We’ve taken almost everything down that was here, including plumbing, electrical and water coolers.” Last April, the Bartholomew County Health Department listed 19 separate things the new owners would either have to add or repair for the new grocery store. But after tackling one project at a time throughout most of last year, inspectors finally given the business a green light Dec. 29. “At this point, we’re just trying to do some little details to finish everything,” Jaime Campos said. “We plan to open as soon as we can.” About the new store and restaurant Guanajuato Grocery Store and Restaurant Location: 2710 State St. Description: Full-service conventional grocery store and more than 70-seat Mexican restaurant.

President Donald Trump’s supporters call for a boycott. Uber allegedly takes advantage of the president’s anti-immigration decree to drum up business? Users unsubscribe from the app en masse. Trump’s election has laid bare the deep divisions of American society, a discord that has forced many businesses to walk a fine line to avoid alienating consumers. “Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can,” says brand expert Bruce Turkel. “The biggest problem is anything they say can be misinterpreted.” Sportswear manufacturer New Balance, for instance, found itself embroiled in controversy after its CEO Matt LeBretton voiced optimism following the election. “We feel things are going to move in the right direction,” he said in an interview, prompting outrage on Twitter, where users called for a massive boycott of the sneaker company, forcing the brand into damage control. “From the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them, we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life,” the company said. Beverage giant PepsiCo faced similar backlash from the opposite camp. Two days after the election, the company’s CEO Indra Nooyi said her employees “were all in mourning.” “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white: Are we safe?” she said.  The retaliation came instantly: “It’s probably a good time to pass on the Pepsi products,” the conservative site The Gateway Pundit wrote. ‘No margin in the middle’ Calls for boycotts often proliferate on Internet forums such as Reddit and 4Chan, as well as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Others originate from more structured protests. The Grab Your Wallet site, launched in October, lists companies suspected of favouring Trump, either because their leaders contributed to the real estate billionaire’s campaign or because they do business with the Trump family. The long “boycott” list includes the department store Macy’s, retail giant Walmart and beer brand Yuengling. “Brands have always been political, but now consumers can see more of this activity and are making decisions based on this information,” the site’s cofounder Shannon Coulter says. The impact of boycott campaigns is difficult to evaluate, however, because calls to blacklist specific companies tend to get lost in the frenzy of social media. “Consumers have an incredibly short memory,” marketing expert Merry Carole Powers says. Still, some companies fear losing customers by staying silent. Nordstrom, a chain of department stores, recently announced it would drop the Ivanka Trump clothing line belonging to the president’s eldest daughter. “There’s no margin in the middle,” says Turkel, who recently wrote the book “All About Them,” focused on company branding. “If you stay quiet, you get nothing out of it.” “You have to figure out who your audience is and what are their values.” Super Bowl stakes Uber appears to be playing by ear as it devises its strategy. The company first distanced itself from Trump’s executive order temporarily barring refugees and travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries.  But it then came under fire for allegedly taking advantage of a New York taxi driver protest against the ban, prompting a wave of unsubscriptions. As taxi drivers went on strike refusing to pick up passengers at JFK airport, Uber not only continued to operate but also dropped its surge pricing. Rival Lyft was quick to set itself apart, vowing to donate US$1 million (RM4.4 million) to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed lawsuits against Trump’s measures.  The strategy paid off with the Lyft app notching more iPhone downloads than Uber for the first time. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick then attempted to make amends by quitting Trump’s business advisery group, saying “the executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America.” And with the approach of the Super Bowl — one of the advertising world’s central events—every marketing move is facing microscopic scrutiny. The beer giant Budweiser is slated to air an immigration-themed advertisement focused on the difficulties the brand’s German founder faced when he arrived in the United States in the 19th century. South of the border, consumer trends are less divided. In Mexico, the campaign “Consumers, the cry of war” is urging people to boycott all American brands in protest against Trump’s anti-Mexican threats. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Ringgit likely to trade easier vis-à-vis greenback next week Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Trump says he’ll win travel ban battle, more measures coming (VIDEO) Turmoil, legal woes define Trump’s White House debut Qatar Petroleum boss says Trump ‘very positive’ for oil Me, me, me, me, me — Frank Bruni Trump blast rattles alliance with Australia Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

(AP) — When Sharp County Sheriff Mark Counts showed up to a house in Cherokee Village to assist other law enforcement agencies with a drug bust on Oct. 7, 2016, he wasn't expecting his life to change. Up until that point, his voice was one of his most important tools on the job, whether it was giving orders to his officers, directions to suspects or speaking to the public — he relied on it on a daily basis. But when he found a hidden trapdoor and opened it, he would lose his voice and find himself wondering if he could carry on his career in law enforcement. It also almost cost him his life. Probation and parole officers had conducted a home visit at the residence of Donna Murphy, 60, of Cherokee Village. As they entered, the officers said they saw a firearm in "plain view" on the kitchen counter, which was a violation of Murphy's probation as she was a convicted felon — meaning she wasn't permitted to possess firearms in the first place. Another resident, Thomas Yarbrough, 60, was sitting next to the firearm. After a sweep the officers sought a search warrant, which brought the Sharp County Sheriff's Office and other agencies in. "We had information there would be drugs and possible firearms," Counts said. Counts was part of a group consisting of Sharp County deputies, the Drug Task Force and the Cherokee Village Police Department that searched a residence belonging to Donna Murphy, The Batesville Daily Guard (http://bit.ly/2l0gA2t ) reported. The house had a lot of rooms, according to Detective Sgt. Aaron Presser, and the officers split up, with one man searching each room. Counts had the misfortune of searching a room that had a hidden trapdoor, hiding chemicals to make meth. Counts was the one who found the trapdoor in the floor, under which a metal box was hidden. The box contained chemicals for making meth, like drain cleaner and ether. That wasn't unexpected. What was unexpected, however, was that the chemicals were leaking. "When I opened the box and smelled it, I knew I was in trouble," Counts said. "I got to where I couldn't breathe and couldn't talk within minutes." The chemicals in the box were strong enough that it was corroding, according to Counts. The way the box opened, it caused the chemicals' fumes to hit Counts directly in the face. "He was walking and talking when I got there," said Chief Deputy David Huffmaster. But within minutes, Counts had already seen his voice reduced to a whisper. That was a Friday night. By Sunday, his condition had deteriorated and following church, he knew he had to get help. "I couldn't breathe," Counts said. "I thought I was going to die." Following church, he went to White River Medical Center and was placed in the ICU, where he would spend four days. After leaving the ICU, he would spend four more days in the hospital. "(Before) that Friday when I went into that house, I felt great," Counts said. "When I got out of the hospital, I didn't even have the strength to get into the truck." Murphy and Yarbrough were both arrested that night. According to reports, Yarbrough said he had been cooking "shake and bake" methamphetamine for years. He also said that the meth lab found in the bedroom had been in the house for years. Yarbrough and Murphy both face charges for simultaneous possession of drugs and firearms, a class Y felony; manufacture of methamphetamine, a class Y felony; drug paraphernalia, a class B felony; manufacture of a Schedule VI controlled substance, a class A misdemeanor; and possession of a controlled substance. Murphy was also charged with possession of firearms by certain persons, a class B felony. If convicted, Yarbrough and Murphy could spend the rest of their lives in prison. They have yet to go to trial. After being released from the hospital, Counts continued to see an ear, nose and throat doctor. He also began to attend pulmonary therapy sessions in Batesville on a daily basis. He would spend November largely off work, trying to recover. During November, he also came down with pneumonia. Every morning he makes the trip to Batesville and afterward he goes to work at the sheriff's office in Ash Flat. "I spent November at home wondering if I could go back," Counts said. The chemicals from the meth lab had inflamed his throat and the swelling has yet to go down, and even months later, his voice is little more than a whisper. And for Counts, that has been the hardest adjustment to make. "Even now on most days I have to go home and take a nap," Counts said. Counts and other officers did not know they were walking into a meth lab. "Twenty years ago there were a lot of meth labs," Presser said. "They were bad and used stuff you could buy from Walmart." Since the mid-2000s, the number of meth labs found in the area has declined dramatically. "In the late 1990s to early 2000s, we were getting up to six (meth labs) a week," Huffmaster said. "Now we're down to one or two a year." Huffmaster said that a good deal of the reason for the decline is meth imports from Mexico, where it is mass produced in almost factory-type environments. He also said that tougher sentences had played a role in removing many native meth makers from the street. But many of those native meth makers are seeing their prison terms end and some go back to their old ways when they get out. Counts has been in law enforcement for almost 20 years. He began working as a policeman in Ash Flat, and then went to work as a policeman in Cave City and then working as a deputy for the county before being elected sheriff in 2010. "I talk," Counts said. "I give speeches and that sort of thing. I couldn't have imagined something like this." The damage to his voice has affected all aspects of Counts' job. Even the regular background sounds of an office, like fans and shuffling paperwork, can drown out Counts' voice. "In a room with two or three people, you'll never hear me," Counts said. Counts said that before the incident, he would be taking phone calls constantly throughout the day. "Now I'm down to three or four a day," Counts said. But that doesn't mean that phones have been rendered useless for him — texting has become one of his primary ways of communication. "My kids are 16, 15, 12 and 10," Counts said. "The two oldest have cellphones and I have to text them and the younger ones I have to speak to face to face." Counts said he also has to communicate with his wife via text, even when they're in the same room. At the office, Counts said he relies on his deputies to communicate for him. "Presser and some of my supervisors do the talking for me," Counts said. Counts is also suffering from low oxygen levels. The average person's oxygen level is 95-100. Counts' is in the low 90s. Values under 90 percent are considered low by the Mayo Clinic and anyone under 60 requires oxygen. Right now, it is unknown how long, or even if, Counts' voice will return on its own. But despite that, he has reason to be optimistic. In April, Counts will undergo a procedure at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences that will use Botox injected directly into his vocal cords. "They say that within a few days I'll be talking like normal," Counts said. He has also received support from many throughout the county and outside of it. "Everybody has been so good to me," Counts said. "At one point I think I was on every church's prayer list." The incident has not affected Counts' love for his job. He plans to run again for office in 2018, when the term length for sheriffs and other county-level officials goes from two years to four. "To be 40 years old and being in pretty good health and working 12-hour days to now has been a long road," Counts said. ___ Information from: Batesville Guard, http://www.guardonline.com/ An AP Member Exchange shared by The Batesville Daily Guard.

(Tina Lovgreen/CBC) Related Stories Vancouver Chinatown Foundation offer to buy May Wah Hotel rejected What should the future of Vancouver's Chinatown look like? Chinatown tailor shop honoured as a pillar in Vancouver Chinese-Canadian community Hui Qing Chen has called Vancouver's Chinatown home for the past 20 years, but lately, she says, it doesn't feel like home. "Lots of changes, it used to be very bustling," she said through an interpreter on Saturday adding that it's even difficult to get affordable groceries in the area as many businesses have closed "There is a lot of coffee shops that have popped up, but as a senior I can't afford those coffees," she said. Vancouver senior Hui Qing Chen says she is concerned over the planned revitalization of the city's historic Chinatown and her place in it. (Tina Lovgreen/CBC) Chen's concerns over the future of what started as a ghetto in the late 19th century for incoming Chinese immigrants that quickly grew into one of the largest, most vibrant Chinatowns in North America, were shared by others at a public forum on Saturday. The City of Vancouver's revitalization plans seek to preserve Chinatown's unique history but also to bring new life to the area with economic development. "The proposals don't prioritize the low income Chinese community they just want height and width for developers to come in," said Beverly Ho with Chinatown Concerned Group. Scaled back proposals If plans are approved by council, the rezoning could allow for buidlings to be built as high as 15 storeys, while also allowing for more retail space. "That means demolishing all of those buildings and businesses that make Chinatown unique for something like a Walmart that has appeared in L.A's Chinatown," said Melody Ma who is with Save Chinatown Heritage Campaign. But city planners say that's not the case as they've scaled back proposals to reflect the feedback people like Ma and Ho are providing and there is a proposal to have 20 per cent of housing in Chinatown for seniors like Chen. Watch Tom Wanklin, senior planner for the Downtown Eastside explain how the city is listening to concerns: Vancouver's Chinatown revitalization1:12 "We are always concerned about how to balance revitalizing the Chinatown economy and also protect the heritage culture of Chinatown," he said. City councillor Adriane Carr says she understands why many people in the community are tentative about what Chinatown will become. "It is not just about something in the future, they are seeing adjacent development that creates the anxiety," she said.

PHOTO: INDEPENDENT WASHINGTON: Starbucks promises to hire 10,000 refugees? President Donald Trump’s supporters call for a boycott. Uber allegedly takes advantage of the president’s anti-immigration decree to drum up business? Users unsubscribe from the app en masse. Trump’s election has laid bare the deep divisions of American society, a discord that has forced many businesses to walk a fine line to avoid alienating consumers. “Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can,” says brand expert Bruce Turkel. “The biggest problem is anything they say can be misinterpreted.” Sportswear manufacturer New Balance, for instance, found itself embroiled in controversy after its CEO Matt LeBretton voiced optimism following the election. “We feel things are going to move in the right direction,” he said in an interview, prompting outrage on Twitter, where users called for a massive boycott of the sneaker company, forcing the brand into damage control. India’s techies fear US crackdown on high-skilled visas “From the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them, we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life,” the company said. Beverage giant PepsiCo faced similar backlash from the opposite camp. Two days after the election, the company’s CEO Indra Nooyi said her employees “were all in mourning.” “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white: Are we safe?” she said. The retaliation came instantly: “It’s probably a good time to pass on the Pepsi products,” the conservative site The Gateway Pundit wrote. Calls for boycotts often proliferate on internet forums such as Reddit and 4Chan, as well as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Others originate from more structured protests. The Grab Your Wallet site, launched in October, lists companies suspected of favoring Trump, either because their leaders contributed to the real estate billionaire’s campaign or because they do business with the Trump family. The long “boycott” list includes the department store Macy’s, retail giant Walmart and beer brand Yuengling. Tech firms unite to challenge Trump immigration order “Brands have always been political, but now consumers can see more of this activity and are making decisions based on this information,” the site’s cofounder Shannon Coulter says. The impact of boycott campaigns is difficult to evaluate, however, because calls to blacklist specific companies tend to get lost in the frenzy of social media. “Consumers have an incredibly short memory,” marketing expert Merry Carole Powers says. Still, some companies fear losing customers by staying silent. Nordstrom, a chain of department stores, recently announced it would drop the Ivanka Trump clothing line belonging to the president’s eldest daughter. “There’s no margin in the middle,” says Turkel, who recently wrote the book “All About Them,” focused on company branding. “If you stay quiet, you get nothing out of it.” “You have to figure out who your audience is and what are their values.” Uber appears to be playing by ear as it devises its strategy. The company first distanced itself from Trump’s executive order temporarily barring refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. But it then came under fire for allegedly taking advantage of a New York taxi driver protest against the ban, prompting a wave of unsubscriptions. As taxi drivers went on strike refusing to pick up passengers at JFK airport, Uber not only continued to operate but also dropped its surge pricing. Tech companies to meet on legal challenge to Trump immigrationorder Rival Lyft was quick to set itself apart, vowing to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed lawsuits against Trump’s measures. The strategy paid off with the Lyft app notching more iPhone downloads than Uber for the first time. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick then attempted to make amends by quitting Trump’s business advisory group, saying “the executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America.” And with the approach of the Super Bowl — one of the advertising world’s central events — every marketing move is facing microscopic scrutiny. The beer giant Budweiser is slated to air an immigration-themed advertisement focused on the difficulties the brand’s German founder faced when he arrived in the United States in the 19th century. South of the border, consumer trends are less divided. In Mexico, the campaign “Consumers, the cry of war” is urging people to boycott all American brands in protest against Trump’s anti-Mexican threats.

The 23-year-old Grosse Pointe resident had just watched a movie with a friend and wanted to swap outerwear before heading to a popular hookah spot in Midtown Detroit that he loved visiting, recalled his mother, Percilla Poole. As usual, the college student with two jobs and bountiful humor seemed upbeat. “I love you,” Poole told her son as he moved to the door. “Be safe.” Hogan responded: “I love you. I’ll be back.” He never returned. Hours after that exchange, the aspiring veterinarian was dead, felled by bullets just outside a lively nightspot, amid an area bursting with new development and often touted as one of the Motor City’s best neighborhoods. Surveillance footage of a vehicle investigators connect to the Jan. 8 fatal shooting.  (Photo: Detroit Police Department) Weeks later, Detroit investigators are extending their hunt for an assailant in the Jan. 8 slaying they do not believe was random. “We really are asking for the public’s help to bring closure to the family and get this very violent killer off the street,” said Michael Woody, director of media relations for the Detroit Police Department. “To be able to commit such a crime in front of an establishment that is packed full of potential witnesses, I mean that is brazen.” The death sent shock waves across the area and led some to wonder if Midtown, long viewed as a haven amid its neighboring troubled spots, was back in crime’s crosshairs. Coupled with the recent shooting of a university police officer, the shooting heightened worries about safety. The slaying, which occurred shortly after Wayne State University police Officer Collin Rose was fatally shot last November about a mile south, stunned those who live, visit and work in Midtown. “This is crazy,” Maya Almaleki, owner/manager of Maya’s Indo-Pak Cuisine on Second Avenue, said between taking orders on a recent rainy night. “Who was expecting that? It was shocking to me.” The slaying “has been extremely upsetting for my tenants,” said Sydney Rooks, who manages the nearby Sheridan Court Apartments. “Anytime anyone loses their life, especially in a senseless way, is upsetting to everybody. We know it happens all too often these days. We’ve had very little of it in Midtown. It is very disturbing to us.” The area, which includes parts of Detroit’s Cass Corridor, boasts numerous restaurants, theaters, galleries, museums, stores and other destinations attracting visitors from across the region, according to Midtown Detroit Inc. At least 10 finished developments added 645 new residential units and 20,000 square feet of commercial space last year, the group found. Meanwhile, the policing efforts of Midtown Compstat, a collaboration of security agencies and the Wayne State University and Detroit police departments that focused on crime hot spots and high-impact offenders, led to a 54 percent decrease overall in crime between 2008-15, and a 68 percent drop in robberies, larcenies and auto thefts, officials said. Buy Photo Eric McCoggle, 44, who lives in the area, feels like it is safe but he has seen situations between individuals escalate.  (Photo: Robin Buckson / The Detroit News) Woody said crimes like the Hogan shooting “are not indicative of Midtown or the downtown area,” where the more prevalent issues are property crimes. Midtown Detroit executive director Susan Mosey called the shooting “highly unusual.” In the wake of the incident and amid growing resident concerns about nightlife near the scene, she said the group has boosted security there through a private patrol working with WSU police, she said. “We have also been providing an overnight security patrol in Brush Park for the last six months at the request of residents in that area. This has been working very well in both areas at this point. We are committed to keeping these patrols as long as needed to ensure the safety of our residents and visitors to our district.” Ben Ness, an employee at the Marcus Market down the street who was working the night of the Hogan shooting, said he was surprised by the gunfire in an area he described as “unusually quiet.” Detroiters noted crime in the neighborhood decades ago, he said, but that changed along with the area’s recent transformation. “This is a swanky, shiny polished area now. And with the Wayne State police, too — they have so much extra law enforcement around here. I always feel very secure.” The shooting did not alarm Aaron Setzer, who frequents the Bronx Bar on Second. “It’s less common, but it still can happen,” he said on a mid-week evening. “I’m sure it’s safer now, but it doesn’t mean it’s out of the question.” Buy Photo Mourners gather Jan. 13 for a candlelight vigil near Second and Canfield in Midtown Detroit, where 23-year-old Devante Hogan was fatally shot.  (Photo: Mark Hicks / The Detroit News) A family mourns Hogan’s family, meanwhile, still seeks answers. “I don’t understand: How can a child that don’t gang-bang, don’t sell drugs, don’t do nothing but school, a job and back home get gunned down right here?” said his aunt, Sheletha Poole. Hogan, who attended Michigan Collegiate High School in Warren, was studying at Macomb Community College, intent on becoming a veterinarian, she said. The young man worked as a mattress assembler and also at Wal-Mart, relatives said. “He’s a very hard worker,” an aunt, Yalanda Johnson, said. A cousin, Cawanna Costner, said Hogan had no criminal record and was more content to “chill” and crack jokes with loved ones. “He liked music, he liked hookah, hanging with his family and friends,” she said. “He’s not a hood guy — none of that extra stuff. No drama.” Until the shooting, Percilla Poole said she thought Midtown was safe. She still prefers to believe the violence that claimed her son’s life is “really not about the area; it’s the person who did it,” she said. “I would like to know why they would even do something like this.” Authorities are working to learn the same — combing surveillance footage that filmed a person of interest, who allegedly fled in a white, four-door Chevrolet Impala SS with a sunroof and spoiler on the back end, Woody, the Detroit Police spokesman, said. “We do not believe that this was random. However, we do believe it was isolated: between those two individuals.” To spur tips, police recently released an image of the car. “We don’t want anybody to forget,” Woody said. “We want to remember this young man and we want to find his killer.” Regardless of what prompted the shooting, loved ones are hoping to keep Hogan’s memory alive. On a Friday evening shortly after the shooting, dozens gathered at the intersection near the site. As cars passed, they arranged candles to spell his name then bowed their heads as Pastor Antonio Pitts prayed. Then, one by one, several lit white sky lanterns and lifted each in the freezing air. Some of the observers cried. Others were somber and reflective. “That night changed everything,” said Tayvon Smith, a longtime friend. “He should be here. They took the wrong person.” To help Anyone with information on the Jan. 8 fatal shooting of Devante Hogan is asked to call the Detroit Police Department at (313) 596-1616.

WASHINGTON: Starbucks promises to hire 10,000 refugees? President Donald Trump’s supporters call for a boycott. Uber allegedly takes advantage of the president’s anti-immigration decree to drum up business? Users unsubscribe from the app en masse. Trump’s election has laid bare the deep divisions of American society, a discord that has forced many businesses to walk a fine line to avoid alienating consumers. “Companies that were working very hard to stay neutral no longer can,” says brand expert Bruce Turkel. “The biggest problem is anything they say can be misinterpreted.” Sportswear manufacturer New Balance, for instance, found itself embroiled in controversy after its CEO Matt LeBretton voiced optimism following the election. “We feel things are going to move in the right direction,” he said in an interview, prompting outrage on Twitter, where users called for a massive boycott of the sneaker company, forcing the brand into damage control. “From the people who make our shoes to the people who wear them, we believe in acting with the utmost integrity and we welcome all walks of life,” the company said. Beverage giant PepsiCo faced similar backlash from the opposite camp. Two days after the election, the company’s CEO Indra Nooyi said her employees “were all in mourning.” “And the question that they’re asking, especially those who are not white: Are we safe?” she said. The retaliation came instantly: “It’s probably a good time to pass on the Pepsi products,” the conservative site The Gateway Pundit wrote. ‘No margin in the middle’ Calls for boycotts often proliferate on internet forums such as Reddit and 4Chan, as well as social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Others originate from more structured protests. The Grab Your Wallet site, launched in October, lists companies suspected of favoring Trump, either because their leaders contributed to the real estate billionaire’s campaign or because they do business with the Trump family. The long “boycott” list includes the department store Macy’s, retail giant Walmart and beer brand Yuengling. “Brands have always been political, but now consumers can see more of this activity and are making decisions based on this information,” the site’s cofounder Shannon Coulter says. The impact of boycott campaigns is difficult to evaluate, however, because calls to blacklist specific companies tend to get lost in the frenzy of social media. “Consumers have an incredibly short memory,” marketing expert Merry Carole Powers says. Still, some companies fear losing customers by staying silent. Nordstrom, a chain of department stores, recently announced it would drop the Ivanka Trump clothing line belonging to the president’s eldest daughter. “There’s no margin in the middle,” says Turkel, who recently wrote the book “All About Them,” focused on company branding. “If you stay quiet, you get nothing out of it.” “You have to figure out who your audience is and what are their values.” Super Bowl stakes Uber appears to be playing by ear as it devises its strategy. The company first distanced itself from Trump’s executive order temporarily barring refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. But it then came under fire for allegedly taking advantage of a New York taxi driver protest against the ban, prompting a wave of unsubscriptions. As taxi drivers went on strike refusing to pick up passengers at JFK airport, Uber not only continued to operate but also dropped its surge pricing. Rival Lyft was quick to set itself apart, vowing to donate $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union, which has filed lawsuits against Trump’s measures. The strategy paid off with the Lyft app notching more iPhone downloads than Uber for the first time. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick then attempted to make amends by quitting Trump’s business advisory group, saying “the executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America.” And with the approach of the Super Bowl — one of the advertising world’s central events — every marketing move is facing microscopic scrutiny. The beer giant Budweiser is slated to air an immigration-themed advertisement focused on the difficulties the brand’s German founder faced when he arrived in the United States in the 19th century. South of the border, consumer trends are less divided. In Mexico, the campaign “Consumers, the cry of war” is urging people to boycott all American brands in protest against Trump’s anti-Mexican threats.

News Sports Life AV Review LV Leader Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Homes Classifieds Site Archive Apple Valley’s Project Jupiter up for approval Saturday Feb 4, 2017 at 5:34 PM Feb 4, 2017 at 5:50 PM Matthew Cabe Staff Writer @DP_MatthewCabe APPLE VALLEY — The Town Council will hold a special meeting to vote on approval of the covertly dubbed Project Jupiter, a distribution center set to be built on 106 acres within the town’s northern borders. In addition to approving the project — a move that would clear the way for the developer to submit a building plan — a resolution to be considered Tuesday would first deny an appeal of Lozeau Drury LLP that alleges the project requires its own Environmental Impact Report, according to town documents. The appeal relates to the California Environmental Quality Act review of the project, which includes a certified EIR for the North Apple Valley Industrial Specific Plan and a supplemental Mitigated Negative Declaration prepared specifically for the project, according to Assistant Town Manager Lori Lamson. The MND was approved by the Planning Commission director in late 2016, town documents show, but the appeal contends the project may have a significant effect on traffic, biological resources and air quality, thus requiring a new EIR. The Planning Commission denied the appeal earlier this month. Town officials have withheld the name of the distribution center’s future occupant both in documents and in public, but it’s widely believed the facility will be the new home of discount retailer Big Lots. The company previously confirmed its consideration of moving its Rancho Cucamonga-based distribution center “30 or 40 miles north of its current location,” and town documents list Todd Noethen — Vice President of Distribution Support Services for Big Lots, according to his LinkedIn account — as the project sponsor. On Saturday, Town spokeswoman Kathie Martin told the Daily Press that Jupiter remains the official word for the project, as shown in the meeting’s agenda. “The Owner Participation Agreement is between the town and Apple Valley Distribution Center, LLC,” Martin said. “Following the lead of the client, we still omit the name of the end-user.” During a discussion of the project last February, Town Manager Frank Robinson said he could not elaborate on the company that would occupy the building, but he coyly remarked it would be built on a “big lot,” leading the Daily Press to describe the project, at the time, as the “worst-kept secret in the High Desert.” The 1.3-million-square-foot facility, which would be slightly larger than the adjacent Wal-Mart Distribution Center, is expected to employ between 400 and 500 people when it’s operational. Construction of the facility near Navajo Road and LaFayette Street — north of the Apple Valley Airport — will employ another 300 workers. The project is expected to earn the town $2.8 million in development impact fee payments and an estimated annual property tax revenue of more than $600,000, according to previous Daily Press reports. The resolution before the Town Council on Tuesday is also expected to adopt the MND and approve a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, according to the agenda. Town officials have said the distribution center would help expand infrastructure improvements and act as a catalyst in attracting more industrial firms to north Apple Valley. A second appeal filed by the Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance was rejected by the town because application fees weren’t paid in a timely manner. The alliance may still provide comment during the meeting, though. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at 6:30 inside Council chambers. Town Hall is located at 14955 Dale Evans Parkway. Visit www.applevalley.org/services/town-clerk/agendas/february-7-2017-special-meeting for more information.

(AP) — The husband and father of a woman and teenager killed after two suspected car thieves crashed into them says he’s relieved the second suspect has been arrested. David Arredondo [auth] said in an interview with KRQE-TV (http://bit.ly/2l7bJfb) he was relieved that 24-year-old Paul Garcia was arrested, calling it the best news he’s gotten since the stolen car’s driver, Elexus Groves, was arrested. Police in Edgewood on Thursday arrested Garcia after a tipster spotted him at a Walmart. Garcia was in a stolen car that was fleeing from police when it crashed into a family, killing 14-year-old Shaylee Boling on Jan. 18. Her mother, Shaunna Arredondo-Boling, died on Tuesday. Groves was arrested two days after the crash and charged with homicide and multiple other charges.

The fruit, sold sliced and marketed under the brand Arctic Apple, could hit a cluster of Midwestern grocery stores as early as Feb. 1. The limited release is an early test run for the controversial apple, which has been genetically modified to eliminate the browning that occurs when an apple is left out in the open air. Critics and advocates of genetic engineering say the apple could be a turning point in the nation’s highly polarizing debate over genetically modified organisms (GMOs). While genetic modifications have in the past been mainly defended as a way to protect crops, the Artic Apple would be one of the first GMOs marketed directly to consumers as more convenient. “What companies are desperate for is some really popular GMO product to hit the market,” said McKay Jenkins, the author of a forthcoming history of the debate. “Any successful product could lift the cloud over GMOs.” Industry executives predict the apple could open a whole new trade in genetically engineered produce, potentially opening the market to pink pineapples, antioxidant-enriched tomatoes and other foods in development. “We see this as less about genetic modification and more about convenience,” said Neal Carter, founder of the company that makes the Arctic Apple. “I think consumers are very ready for apples that don’t go brown. Everyone can identify with that ‘yuck’ factor.” GMO critics say they are hopeful, however, that consumers will continue to show skepticism about the produce. Despite a growing consensus in scientific circles that GMOs pose little risk, environmental and consumer groups have successfully mounted campaigns against GMOs over the past 30 years, successfully limiting the practice to commodity crops such as soybeans and corn. Anti-GMO groups have successfully pushed for GMO crop bans in places like Boulder, Colorado, and Sonoma, California, and several major food brands have agreed not to use genetically modified ingredients. Critics have also questioned how consumers will be able to judge the freshness of sliced apples when they don’t brown. “This apple is understudied, unlabeled, and unnecessary,” said Dana Perls, the senior food and technology campaigner with the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. “It’s only a matter of time before consumers realize they’re being falsely marketed to … And then there will be an uproar.” Carter and his company, Okanagan Specialty Fruits, have bet millions of dollars that this will not be the case. The Canadian fruit-grower, now a fully owned subsidiary of the biotechnology firm Intrexon, has spent the past 20 years developing the Arctic Apple under the direction of Neal and his wife, Louisa. Neal, a bio-resource engineer and longtime apple- and cherry-grower in British Columbia, planted his first crop of non-browning Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples in 2003. After nine years of testing, the Carters petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to deregulate the apples, which would allow them to sell in the United States. Despite vocal opposition from anti-GMO groups — which organized petition drives and sent public comments by the tens of thousands — the agency ruled in February 2015 that the apple posed no significant health or environmental risks. For the Arctic Apple, however, the greatest test is yet to come: whether the convenience of a non-browning apple is enough to persuade consumers to look past GMO’s negative reputation. “I don’t know what their chances are — it’s a very polarized debate,” said Michael White, an assistant professor of genetics at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “But I think this is huge. What the Arctic Apple is doing, trying to push GMOs on their own merits, could lead to a more positive discussion.” Despite widespread scientific consensus that genetic engineering is not dangerous to human health, the practice remains controversial and poorly understood. Both the World Health Organization and the National Academy of Science have concluded that there are no health reasons for avoiding the current slate of genetically engineered foods. But in a 2016 poll conducted by the Pew Research Center, 39 percent of Americans said that they believed genetically modified foods were worse for their health than other foods. And the Non-GMO Project, a nonprofit that opposes genetic engineering and administers the Non-GMO label seen on some North American foods, points out that 92 percent of American consumers believe that genetically modified products should be labeled, according to Consumer Reports. Most Americans already consume a large number of GMOs or GMO-derived ingredients every day. Ninety percent of all corn and soybeans grown in the United States are engineered to improve agricultural efficiency and withstand frequent pesticide applications. The resulting corn and soy are frequently fed to animals intended for human consumption, or routed into such processed foods as cornstarch, corn meal, corn syrup, soybean oil, soy lethicin and dozens of other derivatives. Yet even if consumers already eat GMOs, very few do so knowingly. To date, most agricultural engineering has focused almost exclusively on improving yields for producers. The exceptions are the Flavr Savr tomato — the world’s first commercialized GMO, which suffered lackluster sales and was eventually pulled following its introduction in 1994 — and the more recent non-browning Innate Potato, currently sold at Walmart and several other stores under the White Russet brand. But the Arctic Apple has a distinct advantage over its predecessors: It’s being sold sliced in 10-ounce bags as a convenience snack food. The Carters say they’re imitating the baby carrot model, which has proven a success for vegetable growers, helping to catapult sales of the vegetable. Pre-sliced apples, currently treated with chemicals to prevent browning, enjoy a similar popularity in school cafeterias and Happy Meals. “We might eventually sell them to distributors for service in schools,” Carter said. “We thought our initial go-to-market strategy would be through food service. But a significant number of retailers reached out, and we realized — they’re ready for us.” Just in case they’re not, of course, Okanagan has hired a marketing consultant and a consumer research firm, convening apple-tasting focus groups and commissioning surveys. Okanagan, which had six full-time employees 14 months ago, plans to quadruple that workforce in the next two years. The February trial-run is part of that public relations campaign; Okanagan wants to “validate our messaging and go-to-market strategy” before launching commercially in the fall, Carter said. The apples will be available at 10 locations of “a few” regional Midwestern grocery chains, which Carter declined to name, where employees will be on hand to poll customers about their first impressions. Crucially, the apples’ packaging will not explicitly declare that they’re genetically engineered - to get that information, shoppers will have to scan a QR code with a smartphone. This was one of the most controversial points of the Obama administration’s GMO labeling law, which requires that genetically modified ingredients be noted with an on-package statement, approved symbol or electronic code. Okanagan has argued that, thanks to media coverage, most consumers will already know that its apples are GMOs. This non-browning technology could theoretically be applied later to any number of tree fruits, including pears and cherries, which Okanagan’s scientists have already begun to research. The success of the Arctic Apple could embolden the creators of other consumer-directed GMOs currently waiting in the wings. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved an engineered pink pineapple containing the pigment lycopene, which has been found to reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease in consumers who eat tomatoes. In Britain, researchers have developed a tomato that contains extra antioxidants. And many of the United States’ major agrochemical firms, including DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto, have indicated a desire to introduce GMOs with marketable consumer benefits, if consumers seem ready to accept them. That concerns critics of the Arctic Apple and genetic engineering. More than 130,000 people signed just one of the petitions opposing Okanagan’s initial deregulation petition, citing concerns over yet-unknown “negative unintended impacts on human health and the environment.” Among the loudest critics of the apple are Friends of the Earth and Food & Water Watch, both environmental groups, and the Organic Consumers Association, Consumers Union and Center for Food Safety, all of which represent customers. CFS has particularly faulted Okanagan for not running more tests on the impact of genetic change to the apple tree, as opposed to just the fruit. “It’s an unnecessary genetic change intended to grow market share,” said Martha Crouch, a plant biologist and consulting scientist for CFS. “It carries with it environmental and health risks. That puts a larger burden of proof on the company that makes it.”       Related Articles Weekly roll call report: Dental health services in tribal settings Contractor tabbed for Saddle Rock project Semi truck removed from river Commercial curbside recycling suspended in Manson New hospital enthusiasts to gather PUD ends 2016 with budget boost from Alcoa Advertisements   SOCIAL Facebook Twitter Pinterest Instagram APPS Apple iOS Google Play SERVICES Subscribe Make a Payment Digital Edition E-mail Newsletters Newspaper in Education Special Publications Commercial Print Advertise With Us CALENDAR NCW Calendar Add an Event CONTACT US Paper Delivery Issue World of Savings Anniversaries Engagements Weddings Vacation Stop Letter to the Editor Staff Directory Contact Us MULTIMEDIA Videos Photos Photo Galleries Webcams CLASSIFIEDS Homes Jobs Business Classifieds PARTNERS The Art of Community NCW Foothills Magazine Lake Chelan This Week Medical, Health & Wellness Directory Quincy Valley Post-Register The Washington Post National Weekly Wenatchee Mom Blog Wenatchee Valley Business World © The Wenatchee World 2017 Terms of Use Forum Standards Privacy Policy

(AP) — The Latest on the manhunt for a suspect accused of shooting at a North Dakota state trooper, stealing a car with a baby inside (all times local): 12:30 p.m. A North Dakota prosecutor says the suspect accused of shooting at a state trooper did not take hostages before shooting himself in an apartment. Ramsey County State's Attorney Kari Agotness said in a statement Saturday that while other people were in the Devils Lake apartment with 23-year-old Daniel TwoHearts, "this was not a hostage situation." Police had said TwoHearts barricaded himself in the apartment with two hostages. Police got the man and woman out and were negotiating with TwoHearts when he shot himself. TwoHearts was airlifted to a hospital. His condition is not known. The ordeal began Thursday night with an attempted traffic stop in Grand Forks. Authorities say TwoHearts fired at a trooper who was not hit and stole two cars, including one with a baby inside. ___ 12:45 a.m. Police say a crime spree by a man who fired at a state trooper is over after the suspect shot himself rather than surrender. Police Capt. John Barnett tells the Devils Lake Journal (http://bit.ly/2k6lU3F) that Daniel TwoHearts shot himself once. He says the wound did not appear to be fatal before he was airlifted to a hospital. Police say TwoHearts fired three shots at a trooper after road spikes stopped his pickup, then stole a car with a baby inside it. Police again used spikes to stop him, and recovered the baby unharmed as the man fled. Police say TwoHearts later stole another car, abandoned it, then took a man and woman hostage in the apartment where he ultimately shot himself Friday night. ___ 4:30 p.m. Authorities say a second vehicle believed stolen by a man who shot at a North Dakota state trooper has been found abandoned, but the suspect remains at large. The North Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday the stolen GMC Sierra was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Devils Lake. Law enforcement officials in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota are on the lookout for the 23-year-old man. He's accused of shooting at a trooper, leading officers on a chase and stealing two cars, including one that had a baby inside. It began Thursday night when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks. The pickup driver fled but was later stopped near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. ___ 10:45 a.m. Authorities are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper in North Dakota and stealing a car with a baby inside. A North Dakota Highway Patrol trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. The pickup driver fled. Officers put down tire spikes and stopped the truck near Hillsboro. Lt. Troy Hischer says the suspect exited the truck and fled after firing three shots at a trooper, who was not hit. Two others in the truck were arrested. Hischer says the suspect then stole an idling car with a baby inside from outside a residence in Hillsboro. He was stopped near Reynolds and fled. The baby was found safe inside.

Since then, he has had over two billion loops, making his account one of the most followed ones. Vine may have shut down as a platform and has transitioned into Vine Camera but Cameron continues his reign as social media royalty. He just won the People’s Choice Award for Best Social Media Star a few weeks ago. And the numbers speak for themselves: He has 9.8 million followers on Twitter, 17.8 million on Instagram, over 5.3 million subscribers on YouTube and over 3.7 million likes on Facebook. But this social media star is also out to conquer the world of fashion and entertainment. ADVERTISEMENT He has two movies under his belt (“Expelled” and “The Outfield”), a single and a Netflix show that launched in December, “Chasing Cameron.” He signed with IMG Models and has done campaigns for Dolce & Gabbana and Calvin Klein. Now, he joins models Gigi Hadid, Lucky Blue Smith, Kendall Jenner and Sean O’Pry and Asian superstars Sandara Park and Mario Maurer as the newest Penshoppe ambassador. “Cameron is one of the most relevant figures of today. As a social media rock star, he inspires and entertains people. He’s young, relatable and has a good sense of style and that makes him perfect for Penshoppe,” said Jeff Bascon, brand director for Penshoppe. Cameron’s campaign shoot was shot by John Russo in Topanga, California, with Cameron wearing pieces from Penshoppe’s Summer collection. The clothes will be available in stores this month. “We are offering an array of easy fashion pieces that people can just mix and match. Statement pieces would be the light-colored pants, printed tops, shorts and salmon jacket.” That salmon jacket was Cameron’s favorite from the shoot. “That’s why I have it on. I really like it,” Cameron said. Despite the cold, it was a fun shoot, Jeff said. “Cam was sociable. He made it a point to reach out to people and made everyone feel comfortable. He brought energy to the set. I remember us just vibing to some RnB and hip-hop music during the shoot.” Does Cameron’s Penshoppe campaign mean we will be seeing him in the Philippines soon? Yes, both Jeff and Cam said. “I have to go there,” Cam said. “I can’t wait for everyone to meet him,” Jeff said. Penshoppe has a lot of surprises in store for fans this year, starting with the opening of The Penshoppe Capital at UP Town Center on Feb. 10. “It’s the biggest flagship store showcasing our new design concept,” said Jeff. “We want the fans to know that we are very appreciative of the support they’ve been showing Penshoppe. This year, we want to give them more reasons to support us. With the activities lined up this year, they’ll be happy for sure.” Super: Why did you say yes to Penshoppe? Cameron: Who wouldn’t say yes to Penshoppe? (laughs) Super: What do you like about the brand? Cameron: The thing I like about the brand is that I would actually wear all of their clothes and I got the chance to take some of the clothes home. I’ll probably take them all. Super: How was the shoot? Cameron: The shoot today was awesome. Everyone on the set was so inviting and so welcoming. It was so fun. I got to go on a Harley. I got to put on some dope boardshorts, I’m obsessed with boardshorts, I’m from California. The whole scenery and the vibe of the shoot… everything was like to the tee, great. Super: Do you have favorite pieces from the collection? Cameron: One of my favorite pieces is this pink jacket, that’s why I have it on. I really like it. Super: How does it feel to have more than 2 billion loops on Vine? Did you think this was going to happen when you were starting? Cameron: It’s definitely interesting, it’s crazy to think about. Super: What’s the craziest thing you’ve done for a Vine video? Cameron: It was really early in the game, I think I was 17 and me and my friend… I flew to Omaha, Nebraska and we ended up going to Walmart and it was around Halloween. Me and him, we climbed up and we fell into this.. you know those big things that hold all those bouncy balls? It was full of those pumpkin buckets… We dove into a pile of those and then ran out. Super: Are you excited about “Chasing Cameron”? What can you tell us about it? Cameron: Oh, I’m so stoked about “Chasing Cameron.” It’s basically following me and a bunch of other kids and kind of what’s going on with this generation and how social media is affecting not only everything that we do but everything in the traditional space and kind of educating people on what it is, how the millennials are leveraging it to make their own businesses and what the future looks like. Super: How much fun do you have during MagCon? Will MagCon ever make a stop in the Philippines? Cameron: Doing MagCon is so fun because I get to spend quality time with the fans. On top of that, I get to perform, I get to hang with my best friends, it’s a great vibe. It’s one of the things that you have to be there to understand and I cannot wait to take it to the Philippines. We’re definitely going there. Super: You’re also into acting. Do you have a dream role? And dream costars? Cameron: I would love to be in a “Gladiator” movie with Russell Crowe. Super: Do you have plans of pursuing music? Cameron: I do have plans and I’m taking it slow, doing my thing. Super: Describe your personal style. Cameron: My personal style is very skater but now that I’m getting into fashion, I’m kind of incorporating fashion pieces into street wear. Super: What are you passionate about? Cameron: I’m really passionate about spending time with my family and friends. Super: What’s your favorite hashtag? Cameron: My favorite hashtag is probably #CamXPenshoppe. Super: Do you ever Google yourself? Cameron: I always lose my wallet. Sometimes when I try to buy something or if I need to get somewhere and they need to check my ID and I don’t have my license, I’d Google myself and show them that my age is really 22 on Google. Or I’d be like, ’Yo, ask Siri.” Because if you ask Siri how old is Cameron Dallas, it would say 22. Super: You’re a wiz at juggling social media. Any tips you’d like to share with everyone? Cameron: Do what you want to do. Don’t let people dictate what you want to do. Don’t feel like just because you used to post certain kinds of things it means you have to stick to that for the entirety of your career. Super: How do you handle your millions of followers? Cameron: First off, I’m grateful to have amazing fans and on top of that I have an amazing team that helps me fulfill all my duties as far as doing campaigns or posting content for my fans and giving back to them and making sure that I’m doing what I want to be doing. My team is awesome. My family and my friends and my fans, they really back me, they really support me. Super: Does your Penshoppe campaign mean we might get to see you in the Philippines? Cameron: Oh it means I’m going there for sure. That’s what it means. I have to go there. play_circle_filled Maxine Medina opens third Miss Universe pop-up store February 10, 2017 play_circle_filled Chavit details how Miss Universe in PH almost got cancelled February 08, 2017 play_circle_filled Chavit Singson answers Miss Universe questions February 08, 2017 play_circle_filled PH to host Miss Universe anew next year?

Britain's NFL star Ajayi is making tracks to next year's Super Bowl Jay Ajayi of the Miami Dolphins has been selected for the NFL's All-Star Game The 23-year-old from London is the biggest British star the sport has known Ajayi has become known as the Jay Train after emerging from obscurity   By Oliver Holt for the Mail on Sunday Published: 17:31 EST, 4 February 2017 | Updated: 19:13 EST, 4 February 2017 e-mail 6 shares 10 View comments A miniature train made of solid gold hung around the neck of the Miami Dolphins' star running back as he sat in a hotel at St Pancras Station, drank English breakfast tea and talked about how much beauty there has been in his struggle. This was not an extravagant homage to the railways. The Dolphins have not made it to Sunday's Super Bowl but Jay Ajayi had been selected for the NFL's All-Star Game — the Pro Bowl — and his gold train was a nod to a stellar season that has made him the biggest British star the sport has ever known. The Dolphins lost in the first round of the play-offs to the Pittsburgh Steelers but the Jay Train, as he has become known, emerged from obscurity to stun the sport with a series of astonishing rushing performances that put a man born in Hackney and who grew up in Chadwell Heath alongside some of the most famous names in the history of the game.  Jay Ajayi of the Miami Dolphins pictured ahead of playing in the NFL's All-Star Game A miniature train made of solid gold hangs around the neck of the British star Going into a regular-season game against the Steelers in October, Ajayi, 23, had rushed for a total of 304 yards in a troubled first 18 months of his NFL career. He had failed to land a starting spot and was left at home for the first game of the season because the Dolphins' coach took exception to his attitude to being a back-up. Then Ajayi ran for more than 200 yards against the Steelers. In the next game, against the Buffalo Bills, he ran for more than 200 yards again, becoming only the fourth player in NFL history to achieve the mark in consecutive games. In December, he did it again, recording another 200-yard game against the Bills. That feat also made Ajayi — who is a valued ambassador for the NFL in the UK — part of a famous quartet. Only three other players, Tiki Barber (2005, New York Giants), Earl Campbell (1980, Houston Oilers) and OJ Simpson (1973, Buffalo Bills), had ever rushed for more than 200 yards three times in one season.

Share this article Share Ajayi and the Dolphins fell short of the Super Bowl, which will be contested in Houston on Sunday between New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons. The dominant storyline is the return of Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady to the biggest stage of all — aiming to win a fifth Super Bowl — after he was suspended for four games at the start of this season for his part in the Deflategate scandal, when his team were alleged to have tampered with balls used in the 2015 AFC Championship Game. Ajayi, who will be a huge draw when he plays for the Dolphins against the New Orleans Saints at Wembley Stadium next season on October 1, smiles when he thinks about that. He will not be drawn into a Super Bowl prediction but he does know all about fighting for redemption and struggling against adversity. Ajayi, a British citizen, lived in Essex until he moved to the States when he was seven. 'I have a lot of happy memories of growing up in England,' said Ajayi.  NFL player Ajayi, who has risen to fame in the sport, pictured previously in Houston, Texas Ajayi, the 23-year-old from London, is the biggest British star the sport has known 'I remember a school field trip and we went on the train and we were going to see Fantasia at the IMAX theatre on the big screen. When we were going to church, we always went through Elephant and Castle and that name made an impression on me.' But after the move to America, he won a place at Boise State University and when he was a college player there, he was threatened with five days in jail for stealing tracksuit trousers from Walmart. Idaho is not known for its leniency but Ajayi responded the right way. 'When that happened, I was young and I had just moved to a new place,' he said. 'I wasn't really aware of how to be a mature person, so I made a youthful mistake. That was adversity I had to go through. It was my own fault so then I had to get my head down and make sure I worked and worked at that school. 'That's all I could do because I had put my back against the wall and so it was just about moving past that and making the best out of everything else I did from then on.' He recovered from his setback at the start of this season too. When he was left behind for the opening game against the Seattle Seahawks by coach Adam Gase, many wondered what the future held. Again, he responded well.  Ajayi, pictured in 2016, has become known as the Jay Train after emerging from obscurity Britain's NFL star Ajayi is making tracks towards next year's Super Bowl 'What I went through at the start of this season and the way I reacted to it makes it feel like I can persevere,' said Ajayi. 'No matter what bad things happen, I can still conquer them. No one wants to get left behind. Everyone wants to help the team win and that's how I felt. 'I wanted to help the team win and compete. After that, it was about putting my head down and going to work. In the future, it's not always going to be good. Some bad things happen. That's just life. You have to persevere. 'The season was fun because there was a struggle to get where I am now. There was a beauty in that struggle. There was a beauty in understanding where I came from and what I had to go through and the adversity and challenges and being able to persevere through that. 'I learned a lot about myself this season and it was good that I was able to have a good year and the team had a good year. But I want to build on this. I have been able to do something special but I have done it and now it's about moving past it and not celebrating it. I did it. Now what else can I do? I want to do more.' For now, the NFL is all about the Falcons and the Patriots and two of the most potent offensive units in the sport. But if Ajayi makes further steps forward next season, the Jay Train might just rumble all the way to next year's Super Bowl.    Super Bowl LI from Houston is live on Sunday night on BBC 1, Sky Sports 1 and BBC Radio 5Live, kick-off 11.30 p.m.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Super Bowl diary: Step aside Bill Belichick, Lady Gaga and...

(AMZN) to Build Its Own Air Cargo Hub in Kentucky The hub will bring 2,000 jobs to the state Feb 1, 2017, 1:52 pm EST  |  By William White, InvestorPlace Writer     Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is building its own air cargo hub in Kentucky. Source: ©iStock.com/killerbayer Amazon.com, Inc. will be located at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport in Hebron, Ken. The location will add 2,000 jobs to the company’s workforce in the state when it opens. AMZN already has 10,000 employees in Kentucky across its 11 fulfillment centers in the state. Amazon.com, Inc. says that the location in Hebron will act as a hub for the company’s cargo planes. It notes that the area has skilled workers and that it is close to one of the company’s fulfillment centers in the state. Amazon.com, Inc. has a lease agreement for 40 cargo planes. It now has 16 cargo planes in service. These planes make sure that Prime members get their items delivered to them fast. The cargo hub will have employees loading, unloading and sorting packages. “Amazon’s Prime Air hub promises to revolutionize the fulfillment industry worldwide, and Kentucky is excited to partner with them as they embark on this disruptive, transformative and exciting venture,” Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin said in a statement. “This new project will pay dividends to both the company and our state, and we are truly grateful for the jobs and economic impact it will bring to the commonwealth.” Amazon.com, Inc. isn’t the only company dedicated to making sure packages arrive on time. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) recently announced that ShippingPass is coming to an end. Instead, the retailer will be offering free two-day shipping for all online orders of $35 or more. This is likely an effort to pull customers away from AMZN. AMZN stock was up slightly as of Wednesday afternoon.

It began when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup truck with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 in Grand Forks, the AP reports. The driver tried to get away, reaching speeds of about 100mph before being stopped by tire spikes, according to the North Dakota Highway Patrol. The suspect jumped out and allegedly fired three shots at a trooper, who wasn't injured. Two others in the pickup were arrested and meth was found in the truck, authorities said. Meanwhile, the suspect, Daniel TwoHearts, ran into a neighborhood and jumped into an idling car with an infant inside it. Officers spotted that car on a county road about 20 miles away, again deployed road spikes, flattening the tires and recovering the infant unharmed, but TwoHearts got away again. After dawn Friday, another truck was reported missing, and was later found abandoned at the Walmart in town. Police finally caught up with TwoHearts Friday night in Devils Lake, about 80 miles from Grand Forks. He was allegedly barricaded in an apartment. Officers entered after hearing TwoHearts shoot himself. Despite it all, only TwoHearts was hurt during the ordeal. "People can relax," police Capt. John Barnett told the Devils Lake Journal. "It got a little tense for a while."   My Take on This Story Report a story error Show results without voting  |   8% Hilarious 10% Intriguing 14% Depressing 8% Brilliant 47% Scary 13% Ridiculous Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Email Story 40 comments Copyright 2017 Newser, LLC.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple has snapped out of the first sales slump in the iPhone's decade-long history, but the upturn doesn't mean that the pioneering company has broken out of its innovation funk. If anything, the numbers released Tuesday in Apple's fiscal first-quarter report served as the latest reminder of the company's growing dependence on the iPhone while fruitlessly trying to come up with another breakthrough product since its chief visionary, Steve Jobs, died in 2011. ___ A rare swing and miss from Under Armour in 4Q; shares plunge BALTIMORE (AP) -- Under Armour, typically a star on earnings day, suffered a rare miss in the fourth quarter, sending shares plunging 23 percent. The company's extended streak of soaring revenue growth going back years rose 12 percent, just over half what the Baltimore company has established as its norm. ___ Stocks battle to a mixed finish as drugmakers rally NEW YORK (AP) -- US stocks finish mixed as industrial companies and banks fall, but investors bid up stocks that pay big dividends, like utilities. Health care companies rally after a meeting between President Donald Trump and drug company executives. The Dow Jones industrial average falls as recent gainers like Goldman Sachs and Boeing decline. ___ At a moment of uncertainty, Fed likely to leave rates alone WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve is all but sure to leave interest rates alone when it ends a policy meeting Wednesday at a time of steady gains for the U.S. economy but also heightened uncertainty surrounding the new Trump administration. ___ CEO Jeff Bezos says Amazon backs suit opposing Trump order SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos says the Seattle-based company supports a lawsuit filed by Washington state's attorney general against President Donald Trump and the administration over Trump's executive order on immigration and refugees. Fellow Washington state-based companies Microsoft and Expedia are also supporting the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle on Monday. ___ Exxon reports big drop in 4Q profit, takes gas write-down DALLAS (AP) -- Exxon Mobil posted its smallest quarterly profit in more than 17 years as low oil and gas prices pushed the company to write down the value of some natural gas holdings in the United States. The 40 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit capped Exxon's weakest year since 1998. ___ Pfizer swings to 4Q profit after rough year, hikes 2017 view Drugmaker Pfizer Inc. is forecasting slightly higher sales and profit this year after a difficult 2016, though reduced spending on overhead and lawsuits helped it swing to a fourth-quarter profit, following a loss a year earlier. The biggest U.S. drugmaker still missed analysts' profit expectations, but it edged past revenue expectations. ___ US consumer confidence slips in January from 15-year high WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. consumer confidence slipped this month after surging to a 15-year high in December. The Conference Board says its consumer confidence index dropped to 111.8 in January from a December reading of 113.3, which had been the highest since August 2001. ___ Trump to sign order strengthening cybersecurity WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to improve the government's ability to protect its computer networks and fend off hackers. The move puts the Office of Management and Budget in charge of cybersecurity efforts within the executive branch and directs federal agency heads to develop their own protection plans. Such a review has become a familiar move for an incoming administration. This year, it follows allegations of election-season hacking by the Russian government. ___ Wal-Mart dumps its version of Amazon Prime for new path NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart is replacing a program that offered free shipping but had an annual fee with one that has a lower free shipping threshold and faster delivery. It's one of the first big moves by Walmart.com's CEO Mark Lore, whose company Jet.com Wal-Mart bought last year as it hopes to answer Amazon's powerful Prime membership success. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average sank 107.04 points, or 0.5 percent, to 19,864.09. The S&P 500 lost 2.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,278.87. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.07 points to 5,614.79. U.S. crude oil rose 18 cents to $52.81 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil prices, added 47 cents to $55.70 a barrel in London. Natural gas fell 12 cents, or 3.6 percent, to $3.12 per 1,000 cubic feet.

RedEye Your weekend plans. Delivered. News Nation & World Midwest Trump's policies strain decades-old ties binding a Mexican village to Waukegan For decades, the defining aspiration of residents of the Mexican village of Tonatico has been to leave for Waukegan, Illinois. Now, President Donald Trump's policies have strained those bonds. Joshua Partlow and Kari LydersenThe Washington Post At this time of year, Mexican traditions are on colorful display in this little town lined with cobblestone streets. Every night for weeks, candlelit processions honoring the local patron saint set the colonial plaza aglow. Fireworks erupt over the church bell tower as mariachis serenade the faithful. It is the American-ness of Tonatico that reveals itself more gradually. You see it in the man crossing the plaza wearing a Chicago Blackhawks jersey. You hear it in the voice of the deported student still struggling with Spanish. The tablets the waiters use to take orders at Restaurante Rebeca were purchased at a Best Buy in Illinois; the refrigerated loading bays at the guava exporting factory comply with U.S. biohazard regulations. One of the elementary schools that was named after the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata recently became Escuela Primaria Henry Ford. For decades, the defining aspiration in this town tucked in the hills two hours southwest of Mexico City has been to leave for the United States, particularly for Waukegan, Ill. About 6,000 people from Tonatico live in Waukegan, about half as many people as remain in their home town. President Donald Trump has pledged to build a border wall, deport millions of illegal immigrants and change the terms of trade with Mexico. His presidency, however, threatens to disrupt far more than that. The deeper relations between Mexico and the United States are the bonds of lives, the invisible exchange of culture between 30 million people of Mexican descent in America and their home towns. The growing fear among Mexicans in Waukegan about Trump's policies is felt just as keenly here, 2,100 miles away. "When Donald Trump won, I was, like, is this serious?" said Saray Rea, a 20-year-old student whose family moved back to Tonatico from Waukegan last year. Her father got laid off when a new owner at his company did not want to employ "illegals," she said, and her mother could not pay for the mouth surgery she needed without medical insurance. These days, her friends in Illinois post ugly things about immigrants on Facebook. "The U.S. is my home country. I thought people were different," she said. "And when he won, it really broke my heart." Tonatico to Waukegan 1,750 miles seperate Tonatico and Waukegan. 1,750 miles seperate Tonatico and Waukegan. Waukegan is a Rust Belt city with a defunct marine motor industry, contaminated Superfund sites and a polluting coal plant on the shores of Lake Michigan. Mexican immigrants have been moving there for decades and they consider themselves a revitalizing force, people who open small businesses and work hard. Many of their relatives in Mexico live off the money they send home. Tonaticans run a quinceañera dress shop, a hardware store, a bakery, an auto shop, a travel agency and at least six restaurants with names such as Antojitos Tonatico, El Sol de Tonatico, and Ostioneria Briza Azul. While the Mexicans are aware of the anger that some Americans have about lost jobs to immigrants, they say they contribute positively to the local economy. Two of the Acosta brothers run the Briza Azul: Mauricio is the chef; his younger brother Leo is the owner. Growing up in Tonatico, Leo used to notice the Mexicans back from Waukegan, with their nice tennis shoes, bicycles and cars. "As young people we'd look at them, and like everybody, I decided to come," he said. The business opened 11 years ago: seafood with a taste of Tonatico. Murals of octopus and lobster decorate the walls next to scenes of Tonatico and its famous thermal springs. They serve langostina "a la Doña Ana," after their mother's recipe, in a chile de arbol and peanut sauce. Their dishwasher, their waiters, their customers are all from Tonatico. All but one of the nine Acosta siblings live in the United States. The brothers now worry that Trump's threat of tariffs will make their ingredients - avocados from Michoacán, shrimp from Yucatán, chilies from central Mexico - more expensive. A crackdown on undocumented labor could reduce their workforce. A new sense of menace has invaded Mexican lives in Waukegan. At Leo's daughter's high school, "Whites Only" was recently scrawled on a bathroom stall door. At the courthouse where Leo's niece works, a white woman told her that she should separate the Latinos and African Americans from the files she was alphabetizing. "Because Trump won," the woman said, according to Leticia Rivera, Leo's wife. Marychel Figueroa, a 19-year-old sophomore at Marquette University who was in Tonatico for Christmas break visiting her grandparents, mentioned that some students avoid sitting next to her because her family is Mexican, even though she was born and raised in the United States. During a documentary about immigrants in one of her criminology classes, a student turned around and told her: "This is why we need more walls," she recalled. At Target near campus, where Figueroa works, she has noticed that Latinos are buying fewer expensive items - furniture, beds - out of fear of the future. "People are actually starting to take the initiative of selling their things and moving out and going back to their homeland," she said. Immigrants, advocates vow to fight Trump orders on wall, sanctuary cities Nereida Moreno and Gregory Pratt Striking a defiant tone, immigrants and their advocates in Chicago responded immediately to President Donald Trump's executive orders Wednesday to jump-start construction of a border wall with Mexico and strip funding for sanctuary cities.

"Our community is strong and united, and we will not live... (Nereida Moreno and Gregory Pratt) On inauguration morning, Marco Salcedo, the 47-year-old owner of Marco Salon in Waukegan, changed his Facebook profile to a black background. "My country is in mourning today," he wrote. Because of Trump's victory, Salcedo has considered moving back to Mexico, a country he barely knows anymore. He left Tonatico at age 16 to join his aunt, and became a U.S. citizen. "I'm not sure about the future now," he said. "People are afraid." "Did you bring your glasses?" Ricardo Acosta asked his small team gathered on the road next to the cornfield in Tonatico. "Your gloves?" His son - a slender, shy young man also named Ricardo - wrapped a red handkerchief around his face and pulled a blue cap down to his protective goggles. He started helping in the fields when he was 12. Now, at 19, he works six days a week for $9 a day. The job this morning was to feed dried corn stalks into a thresher and then bag the mulch, which would be used as fertilizer for tomatoes. The men trudged out to the acre-sized plot. They fired up the tractor and slid armfuls of stalks into the whining chipper. Within minutes, corn dust coated the younger Ricardo's goggles and every exposed part of his face. He coughed as he filled the sacks. The available work around Tonatico tends to be of this variety - manual labor in the fields. Most of the crops produced here - tomatoes, corn, cucumbers, onions, peppers, limes and guava - are consumed domestically, but some companies are expanding into exports.

(Greg Trotter, Robert Channick and Lauren Zumbach) One of them is a company called Frutos con Sabor a México ("Fruit with the Flavor of Mexico"). Its cinder-block warehouse - with its high-tech produce-sorting machinery from the Netherlands, refrigerated loading bays and wire ventilation screens to keep out vermin - has been designed with the U.S. market in mind. The company sells to Walmart and other supermarkets, said Cesar Samudio, a company manager. "Difficult times might be coming," Samudio said, referring to a possible trade war with the United States. For many youth of this town, the allure of the United States is as strong as ever. In December, 19-year-old Ricardo Acosta mailed his uncle, Alfredo Acosta, an application to work with him at a landscaping company in Waukegan. (The family is not related to the restauranteurs.) The company, which employs about 300 people, the majority Mexican, arranges for temporary work visas for some of its staff. Ricardo has not received an answer. Trump pledged to "buy American and hire American" during his inaugural address. His administration has warned that it would revise the temporary worker programs. "They say that Trump is not going to give any more visas. And the company where I work is nervous," said Alfredo Acosta, who has lived in the United States for 18 years and obtained his legal residency last year.

(Vikki Ortiz Healy) One evening, Ricardo rode his motorcycle up the winding road to the hill with the towering cross that overlooks Tonatico. He liked to come alone at dusk and watch the darkness settle and the lights twinkle on across the town. He opened a can of beer and thought about his future in silence. Ricardo's father once lived in Waukegan, working in landscaping. After less than a year, he returned to Tonatico, following a woman. The father knew the fields were fickle. The pay was meager. But to him, the vertigo of undocumented life felt too unsettling. "As an illegal, it's very difficult. You are always thinking the migra will catch you," he said. Ricardo wants to see for himself, to make his way in America like so many before him. From the hilltop, the brightest lights came from the church and the bullring. But he was looking north, past the town, to the dark mountains separating him from a country that each day feels more out of reach.

At right is White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP, Pablo Martinez Monsivais WASHINGTON – Donald Trump promises major changes on U.S. trade policy, including the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which could begin as early as spring. Canadian officials have their eye on key members of the president’s trade team: Wilbur Ross, Commerce secretary nominee Canadians will be dealing with him plenty. The 79-year-old billionaire will be central to NAFTA talks. Ross was seated by Trump’s side last week as he announced plans for a quick renegotiation. One Canadian who already knows Ross is Leo Gerard. The head of the United Steel Workers union, born in Sudbury, Ont., praises him for saving several U.S. steel mills. He recalls how Ross bought dying operations in Illinois and Ohio – they were either closed or closing, were in bankruptcy protection, and their former owners stripped them bare, slashing everything including pensions and health coverage. In 2002, Ross stepped in, and turned things around. He restructured the finances; restored most benefits; and fired about half the managers, Gerard recalls, then hired worker-friendly ones. RELATED: Why Canada—and its economy—has plenty to fear from Trump He even provided credit cards to some employees. ”He almost said to our members, ‘You guys know more about making steel than I do. So tell me what we need to do to get this place running’.“ One colleague compared Ross to a trauma surgeon: he’ll save your life, but chop off a leg. Gerard rejects that analogy. ”We’d already lost a leg. We were worried about losing the whole body… Wilbur helped us save the whole body.” Some Canadians preparing for upcoming trade talks speak of Ross in respectful tones. He’s considered more pragmatic than some others on the Trump team. He hasn’t said anything too critical of Canada. He has proposed adjusting the tax structure to benefit U.S. exporters. And he did tell lawmakers at his confirmation hearing that other countries will need to make some concessions: “I don’t intend to be pushed around.” But in the policy paper he co-wrote for Trump’s campaign, he barely mentioned Canada. He mentioned Mexico 10 times, China 33 times – and Canada just once, in passing. ”Wilbur knows the difference between Canada and Mexico, to be blunt,“ Gerard said. ”Canada’s not the problem with NAFTA.” Wilbur Ross, U.S. Commerce secretary nominee. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Peter Navarro, White House National Trade Council For a more vivid illustration of hostility to modern trade deals, look to Navarro’s book and documentary called, “Death By China.” The University of California professor co-authored Trump’s trade paper with Ross, and now heads the newly created National Trade Council. His China documentary features eye-catching images like a dagger stabbing a U.S. map, with blood spurting out of America. The film begins with shoppers thrilled over the Black Friday bargains on electronics. It then moves to hard-hit manufacturing towns, and argues that the cheap imported goods are killing America’s heartland. The documentary hears from Chinese political dissidents, labour leaders, businesspeople, and workers. It crams every imaginable complaint about China into its 79 minutes: worker abuses, low environmental standards, growing military threat, theft of corporate secrets from U.S. companies, currency manipulation, and poor product safety. Navarro tells viewers to sacrifice some bargains for the greater good: “(When) a consumer walks into a Walmart the first thing they have to do is be aware enough to look for the label,” Navarro says. “Then when… it says, ‘Made In China,’ I want them to think, ‘Hm, it might either break down, or it could kill me.’ That’s Number One. (Then)… ‘If I buy it, might cost me, or someone in my family, or my friends, their job. Lastly, ‘Hey, if I buy this, that money’s going to go over to help finance what is essentially the most rapid military buildup of a totalitarian regime since, when?’ The ’30s.” RELATED: What does Trump mean for Canadian taxes? Navarro has also criticized Germany on two fronts: for allegedly suppressing the Euro, and for using VAT tax export rebates as a back-door subsidy for Volkswagen, BMW and Porsche. “They’re sticking it to us,” he recently told CNBC. Robert Lighthizer, United States Trade Representative nominee Lighthizer has actually fought China – many times, over many years. He was co-counsel for the U.S. steel industry. That’s between government experiences bookending his career – he worked for Bob Dole in the U.S. Senate and Ronald Reagan as deputy trade representative in the 1970s and ’80s. Now, three decades later, he is entering Trump’s cabinet. He articulated trade-skeptical views in a 2008 piece for the New York Times titled, “Grand Old Protectionists.” He noted that free trade wasn’t a traditional conservative ideal. Rather, it was a liberal hobby-horse for most of American history, with a shift under the presidency of Dwight Eisenhower. He explained his former boss, Reagan, negotiated agreements to limit steel and auto imports. Lighthizer was involved in more than a dozen bilateral deals under Reagan. “Modern free traders, on the other hand, embrace their ideal with a passion that makes Robespierre seem prudent. They allow no room for practicality, nuance or flexibility. They embrace unbridled free trade, even as it helps China become a superpower.” Lighthizer criticized Chinese trade in a presentation to the U.S. Congress in 2010, on the 10th anniversary of China entering the World Trade Organization – an event he bemoaned as limiting U.S. options to stop abusive practices. He said the promised benefits never materialized – China remains undemocratic, it still disregards intellectual-property rights, and kills U.S. jobs. RELATED: On NAFTA, Canada seeks common ground, not confrontation He proposed a half-dozen actions: Aggressive U.S. lawsuits and use of anti-dumping and countervailing duties; launching currency-manipulation and intellectual-property cases at the WTO; apply emergency restrictions on imports, as allowed by international law; sue over consumer-safety and workplace violations; and threaten to withdraw the U.S. from certain WTO commitments. His former co-counsel on steel cases shares two thoughts about him. First, he’s a colourful character: “It will not be dull with Bob Lighthizer. No one’s going to fall asleep in meetings with him,” said Alan Wolff, a trade lawyer at Dentons in Washington. Second, like much of the Trump team, he wants to revive working-class, industrial jobs: “The best way to characterize them is they care deeply about the U.S. industrial base.” As for what’s in store for Canada, Wolff made a prediction: Many changes in NAFTA will be good for Canada.

The thought itself is enough to make one break into a sweat. But that’s exactly what happened a few decades ago, when our good old Fiat decided to act up. Just as we were trying to manoeuvre through a busy street, the gear stick broke into two. With no roadside assistance or helplines to fall back on, my dad quickly stuck a long screwdriver in place of the gear lever and drove us out of there. Little did I know at that point in time that, apart from some quick thinking on my father’s part, what I had just witnessed was a simple jugaad that had saved the day. Multiple meanings For the uninitiated, jugaad is a colloquial Hindi word that refers to the process of finding an unconventional, yet ingenious solution to a sticky problem. The word has come to be interpreted and used in multiple ways, depending on the situation one is caught in. So, whether it is creating a working alternative of an otherwise expensive or complicated piece of machinery with limited resources at hand, or finding clever ways of overcoming mundane, day-to-day issues that we face, the first solution offered is invariably a jugaad. Look at the weeks following the demonetisation drive in the country, where we witnessed jugaad in its Sunday best. From people hiring other people to stand in serpentine queues outside banks for them, to others who tried using their ‘contacts’ to get around the law, and doing everything else in between, to tide over the crunch. More often than not, we prefer making our own way, if we can’t find our way out. Take, for instance, the case of a teenager in Kerala inventing a pedal-powered washing machine in order to ease out life’s struggles, or that of others using washing machines to churn lassi. Yes, you read it right. In the 80s, small dhaba owners in rural Punjab often used top-loading washing machines to churn up large quantities of lassi in a jiffy. Jugaad is a way of life in India, and the jugaadu sentiment is so deeply embedded in our psyche that it comes naturally to us. Though, if one fully wants to comprehend the meaning of this sentiment, watching Delhi-based filmmaker Anandana Kapur’s award-winning documentary, The Great Indian Jugaad, makes for a good start. “What was initially intended to be a short film turned out to be a feature-length documentary,” says Kapur, as her film successfully portrays the myriad meanings and common perceptions of the word jugaad — both positive and negative. “The word is so multifarious in its connotations that I couldn’t help but give it a kind of encyclopaedic treatment, which brings out the comic, the ironic, as well as the satirical interpretations of the word in the film,” she adds. Her film introduces us to the jugaad, which is also the name given to a locally made low-cost motor vehicle — a rattletrap of an assembled pick-up truck, with a diesel water-pump for an engine, and various automobile parts taken from different scrapped vehicles. Popular in rural areas, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, it is put together “thok peeth ke”, as one regular passenger puts it, and is used for ferrying people, livestock and agricultural produce, sometimes all of this and more, all at the same time. Kapur’s film also introduces us to the inventor of a hybrid scooter, who proudly refers to his invention as a piece of jugaad that runs on renewable sources of energy. Then, there is the RTI activist who calls himself a jugaadu crusader, and uses his writing skills and an in-depth knowledge of the RTI Act to file petitions that elicit actions. During the making of the film, Kapur discovered that jugaad means different things to different people. While some of us consider jugaad to be a way of life, others consider it a shortcut on the road to making life more comfortable for themselves. Some see it as the act of getting things done ‘by hook or by crook’, while others see it as ‘innovation’, ‘corruption’, ‘careful calculation’, ‘plagiarism’, but most importantly, as a survival ‘skill’ in life. Everyone unanimously agrees that jugaad is everywhere and that we all use it irrespective of our education, upbringing or financial status. Interestingly, the idea of making the film struck Kapur while she was helping a friend put together a presentation on jugaad while applying to a business school in France. ‘Jugaad’ goes global The word jugaad has not only found its way into the Oxford dictionary, but has also got the academics, analysts and corporate honchos in the West enthused about it. A whole lot of credit for this goes to Navi Radjou, Dr Jaideep Prabhu and Dr Simone Ahuja, who have co-authored the book Jugaad Innovation – A frugal and flexible approach to innovation for the 21st century. In a nutshell, the authors see jugaad as a ‘highly effective business tool that can be formalised and can help companies innovate faster, better, and cheaper, in today’s hyper-competitive and volatile environment.’ Explaining the concept further, Radjou, a noted innovation and leadership strategist based in Silicon Valley, California, says, “Unlike the Western R&D model, which is time-consuming, costly, wasteful, and resource-intensive, jugaad is a frugal and eco-friendly innovation approach that relies on improvisation and making the most of the limited resources one has. By focusing on the real needs of the customers and eliminating superfluous features, jugaad innovation yields solutions that can be developed and marketed much faster, and can deliver greater value to customers at a lower cost.” A good example of this — as cited in the book — is Tata Motors, a company that practised frugal innovation in the first place, to give us the Nano, India’s first low-cost car. Then again, there is also the example of Kishore Biyani, CEO, Future Group, who used his own judgment and intuition to make Big Bazaar a success, rather than going through the time-consuming process of conducting market research, or relying on expensive management consultants who advised him to follow the Western approach to retailing — the Walmart model, which, unfortunately, didn’t yield the expected results. Jugaad Innovation is replete with case studies and success stories of corporations, both large and small, across the world, which have used this approach to accelerate innovation and growth. Companies like 3M, Apple, GE, IBM, PepsiCo, Philips and Siemens make this list, among others. Radjou adds, “A Western corporation such as the carmaker Renault-Nissan has been practising jugaad for several years and has applied it successfully to produce bestselling vehicles like the Kwid.” From global corporations to educational institutions worldwide, the concept of jugaad is creating a whole lot of buzz in top business schools and management circles. Radjou reveals that jugaad has made inroads into top US universities like UC Berkeley and Stanford. Incidentally, his co-author, Dr Jaideep Prabhu, teaches jugaad and frugal innovation in MBA and executive education courses at the Cambridge University. Radjou adds, “In France, jugaad is now a part of the management lexicon, and is embraced in elite French engineering and business schools.” During their research, Radjou and his team also discovered that the entrepreneurial spirit of jugaad is not just unique to India. It is widely practised across all emerging economies such as China, Africa and Brazil. For instance, in Kenya, they have invented a device that enables bicycle riders to charge their cellphones while pedalling. While in the Philippines, to deal with the high cost of electricity, Illac Diaz, a jugaad innovator, invented an eco-friendly solar bottle bulb (SLB), which is nothing more than a recycled plastic bottle containing bleach-processed water that refracts sunlight, producing the equivalent of a 55-watt light bulb. This ingenious solution costs only $1 and easily fits into the roofs of makeshift houses, bringing hope and light into the lives of underprivileged Filipino families living in shanty towns. Serial innovator India too has its fair share of jugaad innovators and grassroots entrepreneurs, but perhaps very few can match up to Dr Uddhab Kumar Bharali, who has been dubbed as the real life Phunsukh Wangdu on OMG! Yeh Mera India, a show on History Channel. “Innovation has become my profession,” says Bharali, whose jugaad mindset has pushed him to come up with 140 innovations till date, with many more in the pipeline. Some of his popular innovations include a passion fruit gel extractor, an areca nut peeling machine, a tobacco leaf cutter, a mini tea-processing plant, a garlic peeling machine, a sugarcane chips maker, a cassava peeler, a trench digger, an encapsulated paddy-sowing machine, an affordable incinerator, and a self-feeding and cleaning device for people without hands. All of these low-cost, eco-friendly solutions were created using only the available resources, to overcome challenging situations faced by the less privileged. For his efforts, Bharali has received a host of awards including the Shrishti Samman Master Innovator Award in 2007, the President’s Grassroots Innovation Award in 2009, and the Meritorious Invention Award in 2011 by the NRDC (National Research Development Corporation). His benchtop pomegranate de-seeder and detention chair for the mentally challenged have also won the engineering design contest organised by NASA Tech, Create the Future Design Contest, for the years 2012 and 2013. For an engineering college dropout, who also battled with huge financial constraints, Bharali sure has come a long way. Today, he is associated with prestigious educational institutions in the North East, and has also been conferred the Doctor of Science degree by Assam Agricultural College. To continue his passion for innovation, and to provide technical training to the underprivileged youth, Bharali has established a machine design and research centre in his hometown, North Lakhimpur in Assam, along with a philanthropic research centre for innovating useful gadgets for the differently abled. The maker movement By now, if you’re also itching to tinker with your jugaadu ideas and build stuff, you can start your journey at a makerspace near you. The concept of makerspaces is slowly becoming popular across the country. These are DIY facilities that provide you with the right equipment, mentorship, and of course, the space to exploit your creative talent to invent and innovate. Workbench Projects is one such space in Bengaluru, which co-founder Anupama Gowda describes as “a makerspace, fablab and public laboratory all rolled into one. It is a unique multi-disciplinary platform for the public to toy with ideas, tinker with tools and machines to prototype and build for the future.” “The makers represent the coming-of-age of our nation where ordinary people are empowered with the tools, techniques and community support to pursue their creative dreams,” says Craig M Dmello, co-founder at Think Happy Everyday (THE) Workshop, also based in Bengaluru. Elaborating on the set-up at THE, he says, “It’s a cross-disciplinary design-research initiative where innovators, designers, makers and the curious kinds can explore and pursue their interest, develop personal projects, conduct academic research, and start collaborative community programmes.” Speaking about the kind of support provided to its members, Gowda adds, “We provide training, along with project support staff ranging from generalists to on-demand facilitators who we invite on a case-to-case basis, ranging from highly skilled wood-working specialists to mechanics to patent lawyers and so on.” While makerspaces provide the much-needed platform to experiment and to create, they also cushion your falls and failures at times. But more importantly, they provide the environment and the opportunity for us to cultivate and hone our jugaad mindsets, to take things up several notches. As for a jugaadu ending to this article, let’s twist a quote, which has probably been misattributed to Einstein anyway: “Logic will get you from A to B, imagination will take you everywhere,” to which we say, “Logic might get you from A to B, but it is jugaad that will take you everywhere!”   Tweet Go to Top Videos 'PM Modi likes peeping into others' bathroom':...

(North Dakota Highway Patrol via AP) (Associated Press) By Associated Press By Associated Press February 4 REYNOLDS, N.D. — The Latest on the manhunt for a suspect accused of shooting at a North Dakota state trooper, stealing a car with a baby inside (all times local): 12:30 p.m. A North Dakota prosecutor says the suspect accused of shooting at a state trooper did not take hostages before shooting himself in an apartment. Ramsey County State’s Attorney Kari Agotness said in a statement Saturday that while other people were in the Devils Lake apartment with 23-year-old Daniel TwoHearts, “this was not a hostage situation.” Police had said TwoHearts barricaded himself in the apartment with two hostages. Police got the man and woman out and were negotiating with TwoHearts when he shot himself. TwoHearts was airlifted to a hospital. His condition is not known. The ordeal began Thursday night with an attempted traffic stop in Grand Forks. Authorities say TwoHearts fired at a trooper who was not hit and stole two cars, including one with a baby inside. ___ 12:45 a.m. Police say a crime spree by a man who fired at a state trooper is over after the suspect shot himself rather than surrender. Police Capt. John Barnett tells the Devils Lake Journal (http://bit.ly/2k6lU3F) that Daniel TwoHearts shot himself once. He says the wound did not appear to be fatal before he was airlifted to a hospital. Police say TwoHearts fired three shots at a trooper after road spikes stopped his pickup, then stole a car with a baby inside it. Police again used spikes to stop him, and recovered the baby unharmed as the man fled. Police say TwoHearts later stole another car, abandoned it, then took a man and woman hostage in the apartment where he ultimately shot himself Friday night. ___ 4:30 p.m. Authorities say a second vehicle believed stolen by a man who shot at a North Dakota state trooper has been found abandoned, but the suspect remains at large. The North Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday the stolen GMC Sierra was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Devils Lake. Law enforcement officials in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota are on the lookout for the 23-year-old man. He’s accused of shooting at a trooper, leading officers on a chase and stealing two cars, including one that had a baby inside. It began Thursday night when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks. The pickup driver fled but was later stopped near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. ___ 10:45 a.m. Authorities are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper in North Dakota and stealing a car with a baby inside.

Ramsey County State's Attorney Kari Agotness said in a statement Saturday that while other people were in the Devils Lake apartment with 23-year-old Daniel TwoHearts, "this was not a hostage situation." Police had said TwoHearts barricaded himself in the apartment with two hostages. Police got the man and woman out and were negotiating with TwoHearts when he shot himself. TwoHearts was airlifted to a hospital. His condition is not known. The ordeal began Thursday night with an attempted traffic stop in Grand Forks. Authorities say TwoHearts fired at a trooper who was not hit and stole two cars, including one with a baby inside. ——— 12:45 a.m. Police say a crime spree by a man who fired at a state trooper is over after the suspect shot himself rather than surrender. Police Capt. John Barnett tells the Devils Lake Journal (http://bit.ly/2k6lU3F) that Daniel TwoHearts shot himself once. He says the wound did not appear to be fatal before he was airlifted to a hospital. Police say TwoHearts fired three shots at a trooper after road spikes stopped his pickup, then stole a car with a baby inside it. Police again used spikes to stop him, and recovered the baby unharmed as the man fled. Police say TwoHearts later stole another car, abandoned it, then took a man and woman hostage in the apartment where he ultimately shot himself Friday night. ——— 4:30 p.m. Authorities say a second vehicle believed stolen by a man who shot at a North Dakota state trooper has been found abandoned, but the suspect remains at large. The North Dakota Highway Patrol said Friday the stolen GMC Sierra was found in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Devils Lake. Law enforcement officials in North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota are on the lookout for the 23-year-old man. He's accused of shooting at a trooper, leading officers on a chase and stealing two cars, including one that had a baby inside. It began Thursday night when a trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks. The pickup driver fled but was later stopped near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. ——— 10:45 a.m. Authorities are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper in North Dakota and stealing a car with a baby inside. A North Dakota Highway Patrol trooper tried to pull over a pickup with a loud exhaust on Interstate 29 at Grand Forks about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. The pickup driver fled. Officers put down tire spikes and stopped the truck near Hillsboro. Lt. Troy Hischer says the suspect exited the truck and fled after firing three shots at a trooper, who was not hit. Two others in the truck were arrested. Hischer says the suspect then stole an idling car with a baby inside from outside a residence in Hillsboro. He was stopped near Reynolds and fled. The baby was found safe inside. Authorities say he remains on the run after stealing another car in Reynolds. ——— 7:45 a.m. Authorities in eastern North Dakota are searching for a man accused of shooting at a state trooper and stealing a car with a baby inside. The North Dakota Highway Patrol says a trooper attempted to stop a pickup truck on Interstate 29 in Grand Forks for a loud exhaust about 9:30 p.m. Thursday. The driver took off and led officers on a 40-mile chase. The man got out of the vehicle near Hillsboro when officers put down tire spikes. The patrol says he fired shots at a trooper, who was not hit and did not return fire. Authorities say the driver ran to Hillsboro and stole a car with a baby inside. Officers caught up with the driver about 20 miles away. He fled into a field. The baby was safe in the car. 0 Shares Email Star Comments The Latest: Prosecutor: Suspect Did Not Take Hostages " What's Next in the Legal Battle Over Trump's Immigration Plan " Dylann Roof's Lawyers Look to Have Death Penalty Tossed " Powerful Quake Kills at Least 6 in Southern Philippines " Obama Hires Agency for Speaking Gigs, Lawyers for Book Deals " American Airlines Pilots Say CEO Should've Met With Trump " Detroit Tigers, Red Wings Owner Mike Ilitch Dies at Age 87 " Trump Revives Voter Fraud Claims in Lunch With Senators " NFL More Forceful on Texas 'Bathroom Bill' After Super Bowl " Residents Say 1st Atom Bomb Test Caused Cancer Cases " Museum Shuts Down Shia LaBeouf's Protest Project Over 'Safety Hazards' " Trump: 'Good Chemistry' With Japan’s Leader, 'Getting Along Very Well' With China " Inside Trump's Relationship With Japanese Prime Minister Abe " The US's One-China Policy Explained " Larry Birkhead on What Anna Nicole Smith Was Really Like " Anna Nicole Smith's Daughter 'Fearless Like Her Mom' " Olympic Ghost Town: Bills Due, Venues Empty After Rio Games " Sacrificing California Spillway May Avoid Emergency Releases " How This Polyamorous Couple Plans to Celebrate Valentine's Day " Ryan Gosling Was Prepared to 'Defend' Oscar-Nominated 'La La Land' " Dance Moves for Women Scientifically Proven to Be Sexy

Derricott has had multiple surgeries and experiences side effects stemming from a hormone treatment given her as a child. Photo by Nick Oxford/Kaiser Health News For years, Sharissa Derricott, 30, had no idea why her body seemed to be failing. At 21, a surgeon replaced her deteriorated jaw joint. She’s been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition. Her teeth are shedding enamel and cracking. None of it made sense to her until she discovered a community of women online who describe similar symptoms and have one thing in common: All had taken a drug called Lupron. Thousands of parents chose to inject their daughters with the drug, which was approved to shut down puberty in young girls but also is commonly used off-label to help short kids grow taller. The drug’s pediatric version comes with few warnings about long-term side effects. It is also used in adults to fight prostate cancer or relieve uterine pain and the Food and Drug Administration has warnings on the drug’s adult labels about a variety of side effects. More than 10,000 adverse event reports filed with the FDA reflect the experiences of women who’ve taken Lupron. The reports describe everything from brittle bones to faulty joints. In interviews and in online forums, women who took the drug as young girls or initiated a daughter’s treatment described harsh side effects that have been well-documented in adults. Women who used Lupron a decade or more ago to delay puberty or grow taller described the short-term side effects listed on the pediatric label: pain at the injection site, mood swings and headaches. Yet they also described conditions that usually affect people much later in life. A 20-year-old from South Carolina was diagnosed with osteopenia, a thinning of the bones, while a 25 year-old from Pennsylvania has osteoporosis and a cracked spine. A 26 year-old in Massachusetts needed a total hip replacement. A 25-year-old in Wisconsin, like Derricott, has chronic pain and degenerative disc disease. “It just feels like I’m being punished for basically being experimented on when I was a child,” said Derricott, of Lawton, Okla. “I’d hate for a child to be put on Lupron, get to my age and go through the things I have been through.” In the interviews with women who took Lupron to delay puberty or grow taller, most described depression and anxiety. Several recounted their struggles, or a daughter’s, with suicidal urges. One mother of a Lupron patient described seizures. Such complaints have recently come under scrutiny at the FDA, which regulates drug safety. “We are currently conducting a specific review of nervous system and psychiatric events in association with the use of GnRH agonists, [a class of drugs] including Lupron, in pediatric patients,” the FDA said in a statement in response to questions from Kaiser Health News and Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting. A jaw x-ray from one of Sharissa Derricott’s many surgeries sits on the table at her parents’ home in Lawton, Okla. Photo by Nick Oxford/Kaiser Health News The FDA is also reviewing deadly seizures stemming from the pediatric use of Lupron and other drugs in its class. While there are other drugs similar to Lupron, it is a market leader and thousands of women have joined Facebook groups or internet forums in recent years claiming that Lupron ruined their lives or left them crippled. But the FDA has yet to issue additional warnings about pediatric use, and unapproved uses of the drugs persist. Meanwhile, pediatricians and industry researchers are criticizing doctors for using Lupron to help kids with normally timed puberty grow taller, an “off-label” practice that was shown more than a decade ago to cause harm. Off-label prescribing is legal and common, but means doctors are using drugs in ways the FDA did not determine to be safe and effective. In 2009, an international consortium of pediatricians had warned against such use. Among them was a pediatric endocrinologist, Dr. Erica Eugster, whose research found that puberty-delaying drugs are widely used off label, even though the safety of such prescribing is unproven. The health problems described by more than a dozen women in interviews could illustrate long range effects of pediatric use and warrant further investigation. “That’s what you have to ask, ‘Is this the tide rising?’” said Dr. Alan Rogol, a University of Virginia Medical School professor emeritus in pediatrics who said he prescribed the medication for decades. “None of us can answer that.” AbbVie Inc., the company that now makes the drug, said Lupron safety studies were submitted to the FDA before it approved the medication for Central Precocious Puberty in 1993. The drug’s label defines the condition as the onset of sexual characteristics before age 8 in girls and before 9 in boys. “Uses beyond those contained in the approved label are considered unapproved uses,” company spokesman Morry Smulevitz said in an email. Federal records show that the FDA official who led the drug approval process two decades ago was troubled by the two studies he reviewed. In a 1993 letter obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, former FDA medical officer Dr. Alexander Fleming wrote in a memo for the drug approval file that it was “regrettable” that the panel approved the drug after minimal study. One study followed 22 children for just six months, Fleming said. He described the other study as a “free for all” review that made it difficult to determine what dose was best for children of different sizes. Still, he suggested long-term tracking of the drugs’ effects and favored approval “in the absence of any better approach.” The study Fleming referred to as the “free for all” concluded in 1992, according to a summary submitted to European authorities. Fleming had no further comment when contacted recently. A different drugmaker-sponsored study, completed long after Fleming’s letter, looked at children who had taken Lupron for precocious puberty from 1991 to 2009. The 2010 study, which was submitted to the FDA, reported that seven of 55 kids had suffered serious side effects, but said the only serious side effects possibly related to Lupron were the growth of a preexisting tumor, deteriorating vision and severe asthma exacerbation. Sharissa Derricott waits to renew her prescriptions in Lawton, Okla., to treat several conditions she says have plagued her since taking Lupron to slow her puberty at a young age. Photo by Nick Oxford/Kaiser Health News According to the National Institutes of Health repository of clinical research, which lists adverse effects discovered in studies, there are two serious side effects of Lupron that aren’t mentioned in the drugmaker’s 2010 study: a bone disorder and a disease-caused fracture, an omission which looks “puzzling” to Dr. Ned Feder, a staff scientist at the Project on Government Oversight. “It does seem to me that that is certainly a point of criticism,” Feder said. “What are they doing? Is this an accident?” Smulevitz and the author, Dr. Peter A. Lee of the Penn State College of Medicine, did not answer specific questions about the report. The 2010 study Lee wrote was sponsored by Abbott Laboratories, and is not published in a peer reviewed journal. Abbott, which was once part of a joint venture that made Lupron, said in a statement that Lupron and the rest of its pharmaceutical business were transferred to AbbVie in 2013. AbbVie paid the author, Dr. Lee, $157,066 from 2013 through 2015 for traveling and speaking about Lupron across the nation, according to publicly available Medicare data. Lee did not respond to questions about his financial relationship with the drug company. Smulevitz, the company spokesman, said AbbVie “regularly monitors and reports to [the] FDA (as well as other regulatory agencies) new safety information on an ongoing basis to ensure that our label contains accurate and up-to-date information to assist prescribers and patients.” He said prescribers are referred to other Lupron warning labels to review adverse events. The FDA, in its statement, said it continues to review post-marketing reports of Lupron and other drugs in its class, monitors adverse-event reports and informs the public of safety concerns. If the FDA reaches any conclusions, Derricott would like to know. She says she took Lupron from age 5 to 12 to shut down early puberty. At 30, she’s among the first patients who took the drug — even before it was approved for pediatric use. She says now that she’s had more surgeries than her 79-year-old father, and suffers from a blood disorder and bone and joint problems. “Excuse my language, but it’s hell,” she said.

At 30, she’s among the first patients who took the drug – even before it was approved for pediatric use. Photo by Nick Oxford/Kaiser Health News When drugs like Lupron were discovered in the 1980s, it was like a miracle to pediatric endocrinologists like Rogol. Lupron and drugs in its class were a solution to a rare but troubling problem: Toddler, preschool and kindergarten-age girls were developing breasts and unexpected body hair. The drug works in the brain to shut down estrogen flow, essentially halting the body’s progress toward puberty. Once the injections cease, the process of puberty resumes. Experts estimate that boys represent about 10 percent of the kids taking Lupron, many because of tumors or other conditions triggering early puberty. In the years since the drug was first approved for children, Lupron usage has come under broad review. Initially approved in 1989 to treat prostate cancer, Lupron works by cutting off the hormones that exacerbate conditions such as prostate cancer and excessive uterine growth. Its effect of chemically castrating men represented an advance over the option men faced previously — surgical castration. Obstetricians and urologists have relied on the drug for decades. A nonprofit representing 90 percent of the nation’s fertility clinics says many doctors use the drug off-label to prepare women for in-vitro fertilization. Yet, the Lupron label warns of birth defects in rodents and advises against using the drug when one is considering pregnancy. As with many drugs, side effects have long been a problem. More than 20,000 adverse-event reports have been filed with the FDA in the last decade. Women have reported to the FDA hundreds of cases of insomnia, depression, joint pain and more than 100 cases of blurred vision. About 900 reports cite side effects that children below age 13 have suffered, mostly within months of taking Lupron. Those reports frequently note injection-site pain but also include dozens of cases of bone problems, such as pain or disorders, and the inability to walk. Among men who take Lupron, its label warns of increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and sudden death. Drug labels are developed jointly by the FDA and the companies involved. Adverse event reports are effective at flagging simple conditions that doctors recognize as an immediate consequence of taking a drug, such as vomiting or nausea. They are less prone to be filed and less effective at identifying longer-range problems, according to critics of the FDA’s oversight of approved drugs. “As a parent, I kick myself,” says Jeanne Walsh, a Temecula, Calif., resident who filed an adverse event report years ago, as did several other mothers interviewed recently for this story because their children took Lupron. Walsh’s daughter took Lupron for precocious puberty and now struggles with fibromyalgia and has had jaw-joint surgery. “What was I thinking?” In 1999, the FDA examined 6,000 adverse-event reports about Lupron filed by doctors, patients and researchers. Although the FDA couldn’t locate its 1999 report on the matter, a court document that summarized the findings of the report said it found “high prevalence rates for serious side effects” including depression, joint pain and weakness, and noted similar effects in men and women with very different ailments suggested the drug was causing the problems rather than underlying medical conditions. The FDA made no major change, but reviewed the drug labels to determine whether the side effects were covered. The drug made headlines two years later. Justice Department officials announced a civil and criminal settlement with Lupron’s then-maker. Prosecutors said the Lupron sales team rewarded doctors prescribing the drug for prostate cancer with ski trips, golf outings and bribes. In a court document, one gynecologist said a salesperson told him he “could earn $100,000 annually” by treating the women in his practice with Lupron. The settlement resulted in a corporate guilty plea for conspiracy to violate prescribing laws and one of the largest fines at the time — $875 million.

After taking Lupron, she’s been diagnosed with degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition. Her teeth are shedding enamel and cracking. Photo by Nick Oxford/Kaiser Health News Lupron was back in the courtroom in 2008, when patient Karin Klein sued the drugmaker, which was previously TAP Pharmaceutical Products, Inc., a joint venture of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. and Abbott Laboratories, after she took the drug as a teen to treat endometriosis. Klein alleged that she was not adequately warned of the drug’s effects and after taking the drug as a teen for a uterine condition, developed degenerative disc disease, jaw-joint dysfunction and bone thinning, court records show. According to a court record in her case, a report by Dr. John Gueriguian, a former FDA medical officer serving as an expert witness for Klein, said the drug causes “irreversible side effects and permanent severely disabling health problems.” “When a drug’s risks outweigh the drug’s benefits, a drug should be banned and pulled from the market,” Gueriguian wrote. Reached recently, he said he had no further comment. Attorneys for the drugmaker said Klein’s problems were not caused by the drug. Klein lost the case before a Las Vegas jury and was denied appeals up to the Supreme Court over what her attorneys argued were unfair limits on the expert reviews, scientific studies and adverse-event reports that could be shown to jurors. Lupron, which is marketed globally, has been a highly successful pharmaceutical product. Its current maker, AbbVie, reported 2015 Lupron sales of $826 million. Perils Of Off-Label Use Brooklyn Harbin said she received Lupron after she started her menstrual cycle at age 10. The chance to slow her puberty had passed but she hoped to add a few inches to her 4-foot 9-inch frame before her body matured any further. According to medical research, doctors prescribe the puberty blocking drug to short kids to essentially give them more time to get taller, since puberty culminates with the body’s long bone growth ending. Medical researchers have repeatedly warned against such off-label usage. A 2003 study in the New England Journal of Medicine concluded that some kids on drugs like Lupron developed osteopenia and lost too much bone density during a three-year course of treatment to justify the therapy. In other words, the lifetime risk of breaking a bone outweighed the reward of growing a bit taller. Still, Harbin said she began getting shots of Lupron in 2006. Soon afterward, she said her physical problems began. At 10, after her 10th shot of Lupron, she said she collapsed during a Wal-Mart shopping trip with family. She could feel nothing from the knee down. Harbin said she spent six months in a wheelchair before she regained her strength and could walk again. She had to give up cheerleading, basketball, gymnastics and karate because of her low bone density. By seventh grade, she said she spent a month at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota learning to cope with chronic pain. FDA records obtained via a public records request show that her pediatric specialist reported that a pharmacy erroneously gave her grandmother an extended-release, 3-month formula of the medication, instead of a monthly dose at the same strength. It remains unclear whether the dosing error impacted her health. Harbin said she was diagnosed at 11 with osteopenia, a thinning of the bones milder than osteoporosis. Although her bone density returned to a normal range at 16, her chronic pain has forced her to reconcile her dreams with her physical limitations. “I felt like little pieces of my life were just taken away from me and no one wanted to own up to it,” said Harbin, who is now 20 and lives in South Carolina. “Suicide became very, very real for me.” Eugster, director of pediatric endocrinology at the Indiana University School of Medicine, has written that far too many doctors confronted with parents’ concerns about a short child reaching puberty too soon are inclined to “do something,” even though the safety of off-label prescribing “can’t be inferred to exist.” And the puberty-delaying drugs are expensive — $20,000 to $40,000 for two years of treatment, Eugster reported in The Journal of Pediatrics in 2015. In another 2015 study, Eugster reviewed the records for 260 kids prescribed Lupron or a similar drug and concluded that 27 percent of them didn’t meet the definition of Central Precocious Puberty. More than half who were treated off-label were prescribed the drug in the hope of increasing their height, according to the report in the journal Endocrine Practice. Another group of researchers also urged restraint in prescribing drugs to children to improve height in a 2011 article in The Journal of Pediatrics. Led by a pediatric radiology researcher, the research physicians found that even minor delays in puberty reduce children’s bone density, “stressing the need for caution in the use of treatments aimed at prolonging the growth period.” The FDA approval documents for pediatric Lupron say Central Precocious Puberty affects an estimated 2,000 U.S. children each year, something considered an “orphan disease” because of its rarity. Yet doctors wrote 24,000 prescriptions for the medication in 2015, at an average cost of $8,300 for a 3-month long-acting prescription of the drug, according to IMS Health, a medical research firm. Twice as many prescriptions were written for the drug in 2011, according to IMS Health, though that was before the long-acting dose was used more routinely. Living With Long Term Problems Valerie Ward, 25, who lives outside of Pittsburgh, said she took Lupron for precocious puberty, from age 9 to 12. Like Derricott, Ward said she sees a carousel of medical specialists for excruciating muscle and bone pain, depression, weakness and fatigue. The symptoms mystify each woman’s doctors. Yet they sound all too familiar to Chandler Marrs, a researcher who has studied Lupron’s side effects in adult women under treatment for uterine disorders. Marrs, an endocrine specialist who studies women’s health, said she was surprised by the severity and duration of Lupron’s side effects, so she posted a survey aimed at getting more information. With little funding to do outreach, more than 1,000 surveys came back. The women reported a wide range of symptoms: 30 percent cited severe joint pain, 29 percent, severe body aches; 26 percent, cracking teeth, and 20 percent reported osteoporosis. More than half reported moderate to life-threatening depression. Fifteen percent of the women rated their suicidal thoughts as life-threatening to severe. Marrs believes a uniting factor explains the diverse and severe range of symptoms. Lupron cuts off a woman’s estrogen, eliminating a key hormone called estradiol that regulates the energy centers of the cell, the mitochondria. She said the missed connection between the hormone and cellular powerhouse will hurt each woman where her body is most vulnerable. “If your mitochondria break down, your nerves start to break down, if your nerves start to break down, your muscles break down. It’s the cascade of effects,” said Marrs, chief executive of the Nevada-based Lucine Health Sciences research firm. At 20, Ward says she felt like her health was failing. She had muscle weakness so severe that she could barely lift her arms to wash her hair. Debilitating pain coursed through her body. Doctors puzzled over her blood disorder. She’s been hospitalized after feeling suicidal and depressed. Last year, at 25, she suffered a seizure that resulted in a cracked vertebra. “It was the most intense pain I felt in my entire life,” Ward said. Then came another diagnosis: osteoporosis. The condition would come as little surprise to anyone familiar with Lupron’s use in adults. Adult women using the drug to induce menopause after uterine disorders are warned on the drug’s adult label not to take an initial course longer than six months to avoid serious bone density loss. They are also encouraged to take hormonal “add-back” drugs to soften the side effects. A Journal of Clinical Oncology study published in 2005 of men who take Lupron for prostate cancer found that it “significantly increased” the risk of fractures, with prolonged use raising the risk. Yet the impact on kids’ bones is still up for debate. In interviews, several pediatric endocrinologists pointed to studies showing that kids’ bones do thin while they’re on Lupron, but then they bounce back to normal. One 2009 study by Italian researchers examining 66 girls found that bone density was significantly lower after treatment, but within about 10 years, returned to a level comparable to women who served as study controls. A German study concluded there was no harm to bones, even though seven of 41 women studied, or 17 percent, had osteopenia several years after their treatment ended, according to the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism. Other studies published in international medical journals reached different conclusions. Researchers in Taiwan found “a possible major side effect” when they studied 11 girls who started Lupron at around age 8 and continued treatment for about 5 years. When the women were about 20, they performed bone scans and found that 45 percent of the women had lower-than-average bone density and merited a diagnosis of osteopenia. Another study by researchers in Turkey concluded that treatment with Lupron for precocious puberty “may have adverse effect on bone health” due to severe vitamin D deficiencies. Their study, published by the West Indian Medical Journal, found that 13 children on Lupron for precocious puberty had serious vitamin short fallings, compared to two children in a control group. Canadian researchers also identified five children who developed the same bone problem within years of taking a puberty-delaying drug, according to a 2013 study in Hormone Research in Paediatrics, a medical journal. The children each suffered from slippage in the long bone of the leg, near the hip, due to “a lack of adequate sex hormone exposure at a ‘critical period’ of bone formation.” The FDA considers the drug’s impact on children’s bones an unanswered question, according to a statement: “The effects of bone density in children whose central precocious puberty is arrested with a GnRH agonist are considered ‘unknown’ as they have not been studied.” By and large, though, the U.S. doctors who dispense Lupron to children are not in a position to see problems that may emerge a decade later, said E. Kirk Neely, a Stanford professor and pediatric endocrinologist. He noted that studies done in Europe haven’t identified long-term joint dysfunction or depression as problems. “I’m concerned. There’s a very fundamental problem. We treat these kids, they disappear and we never see them again,” Neely said. “We don’t have good follow up, particularly in the U.S.” Whether Lupron is causing the women’s’ long-term problems, “the answer is I don’t know.” This story was published by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

A strong legacy business coupled with new growth opportunities could mean the coming year will be big. Rich Duprey (TMFCop) Feb 4, 2017 at 9:33AM The past year was an awesome one for American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOBC). Handgun sales jumped 40%, rifle sales were up 70%, and its new outdoors market increased 50%, albeit from a bunch of acquisitions. Yet when you look at its stock, investors found it lacking, remaining largely unchanged from where it started. AOBC data by YCharts That's because after the election of Donald Trump as president, the urgency to buy a gun before new, stricter laws were enacted evaporated. At the recent industry SHOT Show trade show, American Outdoor Brands said that adjusted firearms data in December tumbled more than 17% from the year-ago period, with handguns plunging 30%. Considering that firearms account for 88% of its revenues, can 2017 really be American Outdoor Brands best year ever? You betcha! Guns aren't going away Although it's true that gun sales were lower in December than they had been the previous year, breaking a 19-month streak of ever higher monthly numbers, sales were still higher than any other December without an incident of domestic terrorism. The month was only bested by December 2012 and December 2015, months notable for the tragic shootings in Sandy Hook and San Bernardino, California, respectively. It indicates there's still plenty of latent demand for firearms, and the likely reason is that personal safety has become a paramount issue for gun buyers. Image source: Getty Images. The most popular guns being bought today are those designed for concealed carry, small, lightweight weapons that still pack a wallop in firepower. And if the continuing series of protests and unrest are any indication, concerns for defense of self, family, and property will remain uppermost on people's minds. Gun sales may not run at the blistering pace they've been at, but it's likely they'll stay at elevated levels. The great outdoors Beyond just guns, though, American Outdoor Brands is transforming itself into a broader, more diversified manufacturer of products for the outdoor recreational industry. With a much larger target market -- some $30 billion to $35 billion, according to AOB's management, compared to $14 billion for firearms -- there's much more opportunity for growth. While there are a few, big-name retailers focused on servicing the market, including Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Dick's Sporting Goods, not to mention mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart or online retailers such as Amazon.com, it remains a very fragmented industry with some 12,000 independent retailers. Yet it's also an industry that is very complementary to its existing customer base and the new opportunities should give American Outdoor Brands a chance to cross-sell to them. Sights set on the future Very much in the same vein, and underscoring exactly what it's trying to achieve, acquisitions like its purchase of Crimson Trace create completely new lines of business, yet ones that don't diverge too far from the path it was originally on. Image source: Crimson Trace. With its buyout of the laser sight manufacturer, AOB created a new business segment: electro-optics. Crimson Trace has a decade-long record of growing revenues at a compounded rate of more than 10% annually, a key reason why it was purchased, but it's a natural extension of its firearms business. Laser sighting and tactical lighting are already items gun buyers are looking for (and Crimson Trace was already a long-term supplier of laser sighting systems for Smith & Wesson), but it also opens up new products for it such as various sights, aiming and ranging devices, magnifiers, and scopes for a variety of applications. A bright future A lot of these potential growth markets are long term in nature, and American Outdoor Brands admits as much. Yet they indicate a greater diversity of revenue streams, much less stock volatility, and a chance to move away from being just about guns. In a year that's supposedly going to see fewer gun purchases, a business model that de-emphasizes that segment of its operations while channeling more energy into a niche that is larger and still growing in popularity suggests 2017 will be American Outdoor Brands' best year yet.

She may have no official White House title. But Ivanka Trump is already proving that she is an unofficial power player. The first daughter has made clear that she wants to work on policy and support her father. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) No title perhaps, but Ivanka Trump is playing key role Last Modified: Saturday, February 04, 2017 8:27 AM By The Associated Press WASHINGTON -- She may have no official White House title. But Ivanka Trump already is proving that she is an unofficial power player. This week, the first daughter joined President Donald Trump at a policy meeting with business executives and accompanied him on a trip to Delaware's Dover Air Force Base Wednesday to honor the returning remains of a U.S. Navy SEAL killed in a raid in Yemen. She also hosted CEOs at her home to talk policy and used her influence behind the scenes at the White House. These efforts have only underscored questions about the role Ivanka Trump, 35, expects to play after resigning executive positions with the Trump Organization and her own lifestyle brand to move to Washington. For now, though, it's her husband who is officially working in the administration. "My father will be president, and hopefully, I can be there to support him and to support those causes I've cared about my whole professional career," Trump told ABC's "20/20" last month. Whatever Ivanka Trump does, it will likely be unprecedented. There are no models for a member of the first family with a prominent policy role on the outside — or a first daughter with this much influence on the inside. Ivanka Trump has sought to halt speculation that she will serve as a fill-in first lady, which has only been heightened by Melania Trump's decision to continue living in New York City, where son Barron goes to school. Ivanka Trump told "20/20" that "there is one first lady." But joining the president on the somber trip to Dover was the kind of duty that would typically fall to the president's spouse. "That's a typical scene you usually see played out with the president and the first lady, not the first daughter," said Katherine Jellison, who chairs the history department at Ohio University. Back in Washington, Ivanka Trump has continued her efforts to gather information about workplace policies for women. She hosted a dinner at her home in the tony Kalorama neighborhood for many of the business leaders attending a White House meeting, including the top executives at Wal-Mart, General Motors and Johnson & Johnson, according to people with knowledge of the event. They requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss a private dinner. Trump also weighed in this week on a policy matter behind the scenes. Along with Kushner, she discouraged a possible executive order that would have impacted LGBTQ workplace rights and supported a White House statement that went out pledging to leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, according to a person with knowledge of Ivanka Trump's role in the discussion, which was first reported by Politico. Trump also hit a few bumps this week — and learned about the bigger spotlight for the first family. She drew criticism on social media last weekend when she posted a picture of herself and husband Jared Kushner in formalwear a day after her father announced an executive order barring refugees from certain countries. A source close to Ivanka said she feels badly about what happened and regrets the post. Her self-named lifestyle brand also took a hit when Nordstrom announced it will stop selling Ivanka Trump clothing and accessories, creating some questions about the future of the brand elsewhere. The Seattle-based department store chain said the decision was based on the sales performance. Rosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, said in a statement that the brand "continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016." A brand spokesperson said Nordstrom did order both shoes and clothing for spring and moved forward with the purchase of clothing. Last month, Trump said she will take a "formal leave of absence" from her executive positions at the Trump Organization and her lifestyle brand — which offers shoes, clothes and messages of female empowerment. Her company will be run by the current president and a board of trustees. The process of unwinding those roles is complicated. The Trump Organization has not filed paperwork yet to remove Ivanka Trump from its liquor license for a company tied to the Trump Soho hotel in Manhattan, according to New York State Liquor Authority spokesman William Crowley. He said companies must update their licenses within 10 business days of any management changes, and that requires agency review and approval first, and that process has not even begun because the agency has not received a request yet. Alan Garten, chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, said Friday that all paperwork had been filed to separate Ivanka Trump from the businesses. He noted that it was a lengthy process, which took several weeks. He did not immediately answer questions about that specific liquor license.

Then again, perhaps it was the possibility of a major infrastructure construction program. Whatever the reason, TorcUp founder and CEO John Kovacs has noticed a significant change in his business since the start of 2017, a renewed confidence among his customers, mostly in the pipeline and energy industry. "We are already seeing it," Kovacs said, relating a call he had recently with one of his salespeople in Louisiana. Forks Township-based TorcUp makes hydraulic and pneumatic wrenches used primarily in the energy industry. In recent years, as oil prices dipped and U.S. oil and gas drilling slowed, his customers had begun renting rather than buying his equipment, uncertain about the future. In recent weeks, that has changed. "I had three quotes in the Louisiana territory alone," he said. "My phone calls are turning from rentals to purchases." Trump has made a promise to "unleash America's $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil and natural gas reserves" a key plank in his administration's America First Energy Plan. That seems to be benefiting TorcUp. Kovacs says he isn't political. He's waiting to see how much the Trump administration's trade polices help his company. He does a lot of business overseas, but TorcUp is constantly battling trademark and patent infringement in places such as China, Brazil and even the Middle East. When it comes to China, in particular, Kovacs said the playing field is grossly uneven. "My main focus is on fair trade," he said. "We export our products, and we design and I have patents here in the U.S. on the design of these tools. And they are counterfeited in China. They sell it to the U.S. and the tariff and duty is 5 percent." Yet when TorcUp sells its American made-and-sourced products in China, it faces a 35 percent tariff, he said. He'd like to see that playing field leveled a bit. Based on early indications from the Trump administration, companies such as TorcUp could get some help in the battle against foreign competitors in the U.S., said Tim Charlesworth, an attorney at Fitzpatrick Lentz and Bubba who specializes in international trade. Trump has talked about imposing a border tax on products coming into this country, he said, that would "make the imports more costly to U.S. companies," he said. It wouldn't do much to help companies like TorcUp sell their products in China, he said, because that country's tariffs wouldn't be reduced. China could also challenge any border tax by filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization. The $15 trillion U.S. economy is so diverse that changes in U.S. economic policy will have a wide range of effects on businesses, creating winners and losers depending on the industry, said Roland Kushner, Muhlenberg College economics professor. In the case of a border tax, companies such as TorcUp are likely to benefit, he said. Who loses out? Consumers who like buying inexpensive goods at places like Target and Wal-Mart. "In general, if import taxes go up, it will work through the economy and consumers will pay it, period," he said. "If companies have to pay more to bring goods into the country, they will pass some of those costs along." There's not a whole lot more the U.S. can do to police trademark infringement in other countries other than pressuring its trading partners to crack down, but Trump seems to be the kind of president who would ratchet up that pressure, Charlesworth said. Generally though, it's so early in the Trump presidency, the people and companies Charlesworth with whom deals in his practice are taking a wait-and-see approach to the new administration. "I'd say there is a mix of sentiments because we are still not sure how things are going to shake out," he said. That uncertainty can itself be an impediment to business investment, Kushner said. "Business owners want stability, they want to know what is going on," he said.

Tonatico is located in the state of Mexico, about a two-hour drive from Mexico City. (Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective for The Washington Post) TONATICO, Mexico — At this time of year, Mexican traditions are on colorful display in this little town lined with cobblestone streets. Every night for weeks, candlelit processions honoring the local patron saint set the colonial plaza aglow. Fireworks erupt over the church bell tower as mariachis serenade the faithful. It is the American-ness of Tonatico that reveals itself more gradually. You see it in the man crossing the plaza wearing a Chicago Blackhawks jersey. You hear it in the voice of the deported student still struggling with Spanish. The tablets the waiters use to take orders at Restaurante Rebeca were purchased at a Best Buy in Illinois; the refrigerated loading bays at the guava exporting factory comply with U.S. biohazard regulations. One of the elementary schools that was named after the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata recently became Escuela Primaria Henry Ford. For decades, the defining aspiration in this town tucked in the hills two hours southwest of Mexico City has been to leave for the United States, particularly for Waukegan, Ill., a suburb north of Chicago. About 6,000 people from Tonatico live in Waukegan, about half as many people as remain in their home town. A man lights a rocket during Tonatico’s annual fiesta. (Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective for The Washington Post) President Trump has pledged to build a border wall, deport millions of illegal immigrants and change the terms of trade with Mexico. His presidency, however, threatens to disrupt far more than that. The deeper relations between Mexico and the United States are the bonds of lives, the invisible exchange of culture between 30 million people of Mexican descent in America and their home towns. The growing fear among Mexicans in Waukegan about Trump’s policies is felt just as keenly here, 2,100 miles away. “When Donald Trump won, I was, like, is this serious?” said Saray Rea, a 20-year-old student whose family moved back to Tonatico from Waukegan last year. Her father got laid off when a new owner at his company did not want to employ “illegals,” she said, and her mother could not pay for the mouth surgery she needed without medical insurance. These days, her friends in Illinois post ugly things about immigrants on Facebook. “The U.S. is my home country. I thought people were different,” she said. “And when he won, it really broke my heart.” Tonaticans in Waukegan Waukegan is a Rust Belt city with a defunct marine motor industry, contaminated Superfund sites and a polluting coal plant on the shores of Lake Michigan. Mexican immigrants have been moving there for decades and they consider themselves a revitalizing force, people who open small businesses and work hard. Many of their relatives in Mexico live off the money they send home. Tonaticans run a quinceañera dress shop, a hardware store, a bakery, an auto shop, a travel agency and at least six restaurants with names such as Antojitos Tonatico, El Sol de Tonatico, and Ostioneria Briza Azul. While the Mexicans are aware of the anger that some Americans have about jobs lost to immigrants, they say they contribute positively to the local economy. Two of the Acosta brothers run the Briza Azul: Mauricio is the chef; his younger brother Leo is the owner. Growing up in Tonatico, Leo used to notice the Mexicans back from Waukegan, with their nice tennis shoes, bicycles and cars. “As young people we’d look at them, and like everybody, I decided to come,” he said. The business opened 11 years ago: seafood with a taste of Tonatico. Murals of octopus and lobster decorate the walls next to scenes of Tonatico and its famous thermal springs. They serve langostina “a la Doña Ana,” after their mother’s recipe, in a chile de arbol and peanut sauce. Their dishwasher, their waiters, their customers are all from Tonatico. All but one of the nine Acosta siblings live in the United States. The brothers now worry that Trump’s threat of tariffs will make their ingredients — avocados from Michoacán, shrimp from Yucatán, chilies from central Mexico — more expensive. A crackdown on undocumented labor could reduce their workforce. A new sense of menace has invaded Mexican lives in Waukegan. At Leo’s daughter’s high school, “Whites Only” was recently scrawled on a bathroom stall door. At the courthouse where Leo’s niece works, a white woman told her that she should separate the Latinos and African Americans from the files she was alphabetizing. “Because Trump won,” the woman said, according to Leticia Rivera, Leo’s wife. Marychel Figueroa, a 19-year-old sophomore at Marquette University who was in Tonatico for Christmas break visiting her grandparents, mentioned that some students avoid sitting next to her because her family is Mexican, even though she was born and raised in the United States. During a documentary about immigrants in one of her criminology classes, a student turned around and told her, “This is why we need more walls,” she recalled. At Target near campus, where Figueroa works, she has noticed that Latinos are buying fewer expensive items — furniture, beds — out of fear of the future. “People are actually starting to take the initiative of selling their things and moving out and going back to their homeland,” she said. On inauguration morning, Marco Salcedo, the 47-year-old owner of Marco Salon in Waukegan, changed his Facebook profile to a black background. “My country is in mourning today,” he wrote. Because of Trump’s victory, Salcedo has considered moving back to Mexico, a country he barely knows anymore. He left Tonatico at age 16 to join his aunt, and became a U.S. citizen. “I’m not sure about the future now,” he said. “People are afraid.” ‘Difficult times’ Ricardo Acosta, 19, center, and other men work in a cornfield near their house in La Vega, Mexico, near the town of Tonatico. Acosta wants to work in the United States with his uncle but fears it will be impossible under a Donald Trump presidency. (Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective for The Washington Post) “Did you bring your glasses?” Ricardo Acosta asked his small team gathered on the road next to the cornfield in Tonatico. “Your gloves?” His son — a slender, shy young man also named Ricardo — wrapped a red handkerchief around his face and pulled a blue cap down to his protective goggles. He started helping in the fields when he was 12. Now, at 19, he works six days a week for $9 a day. The job this morning was to feed dried corn stalks into a thresher and then bag the mulch, which would be used as fertilizer for tomatoes. The men trudged out to the acre-sized plot. They fired up the tractor and slid armfuls of stalks into the whining chipper. Within minutes, corn dust coated the younger Ricardo’s goggles and every exposed part of his face. He coughed as he filled the sacks. The available work around Tonatico tends to be of this variety — manual labor in the fields. Most of the crops produced here — tomatoes, corn, cucumbers, onions, peppers, limes and guava — are consumed domestically, but some companies are expanding into exports. One of them is a company called Frutos con Sabor a México (“Fruit with the Flavor of Mexico”). Its cinder-block warehouse — with its high-tech produce-sorting machinery from the Netherlands, refrigerated loading bays and wire ventilation screens to keep out vermin — has been designed with the U.S. market in mind. The company sells to Walmart and other supermarkets, said Cesar Samudio, a company manager. “Difficult times might be coming,” Samudio said, referring to a possible trade war with the United States. For many youths of this town, the allure of the United States is as strong as ever. In December, 19-year-old Ricardo Acosta mailed his uncle, Alfredo Acosta, an application to work with him at a landscaping company in Waukegan. (The family is not related to the restauranteurs.) The company, which employs about 300 people, the majority Mexican, arranges for temporary work visas for some of its staff. Ricardo has not received an answer. Trump pledged to “buy American and hire American” during his inaugural address. His administration has warned that it would revise the temporary worker programs. “They say that Trump is not going to give any more visas. And the company where I work is nervous,” said Alfredo Acosta, who has lived in the United States for 18 years and obtained legal residency last year. One evening, Ricardo rode his motorcycle up the winding road to the hill with the towering cross that overlooks Tonatico. He liked to come alone at dusk and watch the darkness settle and the lights twinkle on across the town. He opened a can of beer and thought about his future in silence. About 6,000 people from Tonatico live in Waukegan, Ill. The town in Mexico has seen a large amount of people emigrate to the United States. (Brett Gundlock/Boreal Collective for The Washington Post) Ricardo’s father once lived in Waukegan, working in landscaping. After less than a year, he returned to Tonatico, following a woman. The father knew the fields were fickle. The pay was meager. But to him, the vertigo of undocumented life felt too unsettling. “As an illegal, it’s very difficult. You are always thinking the migra will catch you,” he said. Ricardo wants to see for himself, to make his way in America like so many before him. From the hilltop, the brightest lights came from the church and the bullring. But he was looking north, past the town, to the dark mountains separating him from a country that each day feels more out of reach. Lydersen reported from Waukegan.

Even as a storm of popular protest grew, most of corporate America found itself playing a tense game of wait-and-see. A handful of tech executives, like Google's Sundar Pichai — himself an immigrant from India — were quick to criticize the order; Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz even pledged to hire 10,000 refugees. But most executives "sought safety in numbers," holding back until their rivals or peers made the first move. And when CEOs did speak out, "few took shots directly at Trump." Corporate leaders felt caught between a rock and a hard place, said Bess Levin at Vanity Fair. On the one hand, they don't want to stay silent and risk angering their employees or suffering consumer boycotts. But they also fear the "possibility of stock-tanking Twitter tirades from the president if they speak out." Trump's first two weeks in office have sent "fear rippling through corporate boardrooms from Silicon Valley to Wall Street," said Ben White at Politico. Although many executives remain hopeful that the first full-time businessman to become president will usher in the deregulation and lower corporate taxes that he promised on the campaign trail, they are alarmed by the new administration's "erratic approach to policy." Firms with complex, international supply chains have been startled by Trump's talk of new border tariffs, and exporters who had hoped for more market access in Asia "see those hopes fading" with the rapid abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. "And just about everyone is afraid of saying anything publicly that could provoke presidential ire." Some firms even appear to be recycling jobs announcements to get on Trump's good side, said James Peltz and Natalie Kitroeff at the Los Angeles Times. Since Election Day, companies like Walmart, Sprint, and General Motors have vowed to add or keep jobs in the U.S. Some of the announcements came after executives visited Trump Tower, "and the implication was clear: Trump's power of persuasion, or his threats to make the companies' futures more costly," had prompted big investments in domestic jobs. But in several cases, the added jobs had already been planned and even previously announced. That didn't stop executives from allowing Trump to take credit, hoping to "curry his favor." The politics of the travel ban are changing executives' calculus, however, said Spencer Jakab atThe Wall Street Journal. The companies that have spoken out most forcefully are those that are most affected, like tech companies that rely on foreigners with cutting-edge skills. But plenty of other industries — from retail to finance to Big Pharma — depend "heavily on overseas customers and also foreign government regulators," and they worry that perceived closeness to the White House and its more controversial policies could eventually "invite formal and informal retaliation" abroad. Still, plenty of CEOs remain optimistic, said Gillian White at The Atlantic. They're willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for a little while longer, "even if they can't be certain how it will all shake out." Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

Nordstrom announced Thursday night that it was dropping the brand created by and named after President Trump's daughter, but denied that it was a result of the #GrabYourWallet boycott campaign that put the company on blast, nbcnews reported. "We've said all along we make buying decisions based on performance. We've got thousands of brands — more than 2,000 offered on the site alone. Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business," a Thursday night statement from Nordstrom said, adding that "Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season." On Twitter, Nordstrom repeatedly responded to consumers who inquired about the Ivanka Trump brand and said they would not be shopping at Nordstrom until it ceased carrying Trump products. But, after the store announced it would stop carrying the Ivanka Trump line, it began to receive criticism on Twitter from customers who accused the store of playing politics. Customers supporting the Trump administration began tweeting at Nordstrom that they would now boycott the store because of its decision to drop the brand. A spokesperson for the Ivanka Trump brand said in a statement to NBC News that "Nordstrom did order both shoes and apparel for spring, and moved forward with purchase of apparel." The fashion website Refinery29 quoted a spokesperson for the brand as saying "They canceled the shoe order, kept the apparel order and moved the apparel from online into stores. It's there." Nordstrom did not immediately return a request for comment. According to the #GrabYourWallet boycott campaign's online list of Trump-supporting businesses, consumers could turn their ire towards any number of national chain stores next. The list of stores carrying Ivanka Trump products includes Macy's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Ross, Walmart, DSW, KMart, Sears, Century 21, and many more. The boycott list also includes companies that advertise on the TV show Celebrity Apprentice; companies whose CEOs reportedly raised campaign funds for Trump; and companies that offered official endorsements during the election. Ivanka Trump announced in January that she was taking a formal leave of absence from her company in order to move to D.C., where her husband Jared Kushner serves as an adviser on her father's cabinet. The Ivanka Trump brand is now run by Abigail Klem and a board of trustees. "When my father takes office as the 45th President of the United States of America, I will take a formal leave of absence from The Trump Organization and my eponymous apparel and accessories brand," Ivanka Trump wrote on Facebook. "I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company."           LATEST STORIES (9) 54 Women, Children from Lattakia Reunite with Their Families After over Three Years of Captivity Syrian Pro-Government Forces Repulse Multiple Terrorist Attacks on Their Positions in Northern Lattakia Syrian Army Takes Control of Another Village in Oil Rich Regions, East of Homs Millions of Iranians Show Massive Support for Revolutionary Causes (4) Iraqi Popular Forces Rescue Families Fleeing from ISIL in Western Mosul Syrian Army Repels Terrorists' Offensive near Harasta Syrian Warplanes Strike Terrorists' Positions in Homs Bahrainis Protest Killing of 3 Activists Trying to Flee Kingdom Syria: President Assad Receives 54 Families Freed After Prisoner Swap with Militants The Rise and Resilience of Islamic Revolution: Iran’s All for Fighting Injustice, Tyranny, and Oppression Millions of Iranians Show Massive Support for Revolution Causes (3) Bashar Assad: US’s Only Way to Defeat Terrorism in Syria Is Through Cooperation with Damascus Iranians Rally in Millions to Mark Anniversary of Revolution Victory Iranians Stage Nationwide Rallies to Mark Anniversary of 1979 Islamic Revolution (2) Syrian Army Repels Terrorists' Attacks on Gov't Positions in Lattakia 54 Women, Children from Lattakia Reunite with Their Families After over Three Years of Captivity TEHRAN (FNA)- 54 women and children returned home to Lattakia late on Thursday and reunited with their families after finally their three and a half years of suffering in terrorists' captivity was ended in a prisoners exchange deal with militants.

Hot Topics: Airport shuttle gap Theft of husband's ashes Johnnie St. Vrain: 'Work zone' Longmont leash law RTD's Northwest Rail News tips Longmont police notes: Drunk man causes issues in restaurant, hospital By Amelia Arvesen Staff Writer Posted:   02/03/2017 12:01:44 PM MST Updated:   02/03/2017 12:02:02 PM MST Longmont officers responded to an intoxicated man sleeping in a restaurant and refusing to leave at 5 p.m. Thursday in the 1600 block of Pace Street. Officers talked to the 27-year-old man and determined he was the subject of two previous police contacts within the last few hours, including one for urinating in public. The man asked to go to detox, but became combative and suicidal while police drove him. He continued to threaten officers, lunged at one officer and repeatedly threatened to harm medical staff. He was later taken to the Boulder County Jail. A Walmart employee at 2514 Main St. in Longmont reported damage to a gaming machine inside the store. The case is closed because there is no suspect information. Longmont police received a report of an alleged phone harassment Thursday. A man told police he was receiving threats through text messages from his ex-wife's new husband. All involved parties were identified, but there is insufficient probable cause for charges at this time. The case is closed.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint HOUSTON – Don’t get him wrong. Arizona Cardinals receiver and Minneapolis native Larry Fitzgerald Jr. wants to win Saturday night. After all, this is his second time in his 13-year career that he’s been a finalist for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award, which is considered the league’s highest honor off the field. “But even if I don’t win, I’m not going to be unhappy,” Fitzgerald said Friday after a fan forum event with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and fellow finalists Eli Manning of the Giants and Greg Olsen of the Panthers. “To be a finalist for the second time, I think it just shows that I’m making an impact and that other people realize that. That’s not what I’m doing it for, but I think it’s nice to be recognized for something that’s more meaningful than catching touchdowns.” Fitzgerald has several charitable causes he supports. No. 1 on the list is cancer research. His mother, Carol, died in 2003 after a battle with breast cancer. “There was never any time where it was, ‘I want to do [charitable work].’ It’s just the fabric of who I was [raised to be],” Fitzgerald said. “I’m just a person my parents raised me to be. My mother [Carol], she was very active in nonprofits when I was younger, and she would just have my brother [Marcus] and me with her. “A Saturday, she would say, ‘We’re going to go over to this AIDS walk or over to this breast cancer research fundraiser. That was just kind of what we did. Now, it’s like second nature. It taught us compassion. Now, if I go to a school and talk to the kids in Phoenix or Minneapolis, and the teacher comes to me and says, ‘I got 40 kids in my classroom and some of them don’t have backpacks to carry or utensils or pencils,’ I will go right to Wal-Mart and just load the truck up with everything they got and go back and just drop it on the front porch and leave.” Fitzgerald ranks third in NFL history in receptions (1,125), eighth in touchdown catches (104) and ninth in yards receiving (14,389). He’s 33 and just announced earlier this week that he has decided after careful consideration to play a 14th season in 2017. “I think I knew probably after watching that Cowboys [playoff] game,” Fitzgerald said. “Just sitting back watching, the fire was burning. I could feel it.” He likes Arizona’s talent level, how his body is healing at age 33 and motivation to end his career on a better note. “I can’t go out at 7-8-1,” he said. “That’s not how I want to do it.” mcraig@startribune.com 612-673-7011 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

St. Mike’s kitchen prepared its first meal Christmas week 2009. We happily served 35 Christmas dinners. We have grown with your help, support and attendance. We now serve 200 homebound meals a week. Meals are delivered twice a week and all of our drivers volunteer their time, gas and smiles. There are approximately 125 people who bless us with their presence weekly. Our patrons enjoy wonderful home cooked meals, which truly have the ingredient of love in every recipe. The many people who cook, serve and cleanup give their time and hearts to this ministry. St. Michael’s Kitchen also has volunteers who pick up food from Walmart, City Market, Carelli’s, The Memorial Hospital Cafeteria, KFC, and the Village Inn several times a week. The American Food Bank brings 8 to 10 pallets of food a month to the Kitchen. All of this food is used for meals, given to other organizations, and given to the home bound and other families. Because The Memorial Hospital has donated the use of the old walk-in refrigerator and freezer they have, no food ever goes to waste. This donation has served every organization as food is stored and then given as needed. St. Michael’s Kitchen runs completely by donations given by members of our community and our yearly fundraiser “The Empty Bowl.” We have been so fortunate, when meat is low, a rancher steps up and gives what they can. We also receive donations from Brother’s and Custom Quality Meat processing businesses. Thank you all for your past and continued support to St. Michael’s Kitchen.

(Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry)  A $12,000 diamond bracelet designed by the first daughter, along with more than a dozen other jewelry items, disappeared from the luxury retailer’s website Friday. Neiman Marcus later issued a release to Teen Vogue saying that the store would stop carrying the Ivanka Trump brand jewels due to “productivity.” In November, shortly after Donald Trump’s surprise election, Ivanka came under fire for promoting the line through a “60 Minutes” appearance about his new administration. This move further ignited opposition to her businesses, leading to decreasing sales and popularity, Teen Vogue said.

While Nordstrom issued a release saying the decision also was due to poor sales, the move comes after President Trump’s first two weeks in office, which were marked by a number of controversial decisions, including an executive order that targets refugees, immigrants and travelers from Muslim-dominated countries. Since October, Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom and nearly 100 other retailers have been the target of the viral grass-roots #GrabYourWallet boycott, co-founded by Bay Area brand strategist Shannon Coulter. The movement encourages shoppers to boycott products and retailers with ties to President Trump, his family and his donors. Other targeted retailers or companies include Macy’s, Walmart and Amazon. Coulter launched the boycott after the leak of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” recording of the former reality TV star-turned politician, boasting about grabbing women by the genitals.

Coulter also objected to the way Ivanka, formerly a vice president in her father’s Trump Organization and head of her #WomenWhoWork fashion and life-style brand, tried to provide cover for some of her father’s most objectionable tendencies during his campaign: saying crude, derogatory things about women, immigrants and people of color. In the #GrabYourWallet boycott, Coulter has also cited news reports that Ivanka, her father, and husband Jared Kushner, now a senior White House advisor, have potential conflicts of interest and may be using the presidency to enrich themselves, financially or otherwise.

Brendan Smialowski / AFP - Getty Images Ivanka Trump's fashion line won't be available at Nordstrom this upcoming season — and the decision to drop the brand has put the national department store chain at the center of a consumer tug-of-war. Nordstrom announced Thursday night that it was dropping the brand created by and named after President Trump's daughter, but denied that it was a result of the #GrabYourWallet boycott campaign that put the company on blast. "We've said all along we make buying decisions based on performance. We've got thousands of brands — more than 2,000 offered on the site alone. Reviewing their merit and making edits is part of the regular rhythm of our business," said a Thursday night statement from Nordstrom. "Each year we cut about 10 percent and refresh our assortment with about the same amount. In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season." Update: A week later, Donald J. Trump blasted Nordstrom on Twitter for the move. On Twitter, Nordstrom repeatedly responded to consumers who inquired about the Ivanka Trump brand and said they would not be shopping at Nordstrom until it ceased carrying Trump products. @GayleShare1 Hi, Gayle! Based on this brand’s performance, we did decide not to buy it for this season.— Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 3, 2017 But, after the store announced it would stop carrying the Ivanka Trump line, it began to receive criticism on Twitter from customers who accused the store of playing politics. Customers supporting the Trump administration began tweeting at Nordstrom that they would now boycott the store because of its decision to drop the brand. @Nordstrom so your NOT DOING Ivanka Trump fashion I WONT BE SHOPPING AT NORDSTROM EVER AGAIN! Folding to Alt-Left Nazi Libs has consequences— Demexit Sheila (@sissynsas) February 3, 2017 A spokesperson for the Ivanka Trump brand said in a statement to NBC News that "Nordstrom did order both shoes and apparel for spring, and moved forward with purchase of apparel." The fashion website Refinery29 quoted a spokesperson for the brand as saying "They canceled the shoe order, kept the apparel order and moved the apparel from online into stores. It's there." Nordstrom did not immediately return a request for comment. According to the #GrabYourWallet boycott campaign's online list of Trump-supporting businesses, consumers could turn their ire towards any number of national chain stores next. The list of stores carrying Ivanka Trump products includes Macy's, Bed Bath & Beyond, Ross, Walmart, DSW, KMart, Sears, Century 21, and many more. The boycott list also includes companies that advertise on the TV show Celebrity Apprentice; companies whose CEOs reportedly raised campaign funds for Trump; and companies that offered official endorsements during the election. Ivanka Trump announced in January that she was taking a formal leave of absence from her company in order to move to D.C., where her husband Jared Kushner serves as an adviser on her father's cabinet. The Ivanka Trump brand is now run by Abigail Klem and a board of trustees. "When my father takes office as the 45th President of the United States of America, I will take a formal leave of absence from The Trump Organization and my eponymous apparel and accessories brand," Ivanka Trump wrote on Facebook. "I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company."

Late Tax Refunds Could Mean Fewer People Watching Super Bowl On New TVs Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Late Tax Refunds Could Mean Fewer People Watching Super Bowl On New TVs Image courtesy of Phillip Pessar February 3, 2017 5:24 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup unintended consequences IRS internal revenue service earned income tax credit tax credits taxes The Internal Revenue Service recently announced that millions of tax refunds may be delayed this year as the agency tries to combat fraud. Some experts say this delay could have an unintended consequence: fewer new TVs tuned in to this Sunday’s Super Bowl. Americans don’t just buy new TVs in time for the Super Bowl because the Big Game looks better on a Big Screen. It’s also because people who have simple tax returns and all of their documents in order can have a refund check in their pocket by the end of January, and TV bargains timed for the Super Bowl make that a good time to buy one, even if you don’t like football or funny commercials. However, this year, the IRS is complying with a new law meant to prevent refund identity theft, and that means taxpayers, especially recipients of the earned income tax credit or the additional child tax credit, won’t be getting their refunds until the end of this month. The Wall Street Journal reports that retailers are even keeping this in mind when they design their promotions: Spokespeople for Walmart and Hhgregg confirmed that they’re adjusting their usual promotions around when tax refunds are actually expected to go out. Walmart plans to delay online marketing until later in February, and Hhgregg plans to promote financing options for people who are expecting refunds. Is it the sale or the prospect of having a new TV in time for the game that leads people to go shopping? Retailers will find out over the next 48 hours, and when those refunds finally do arrive.
