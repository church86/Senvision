REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski 1/2 left right A customer pushes a shopping cart at a Walmart store in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. November 23, 2016. REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski 2/2 By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO CHICAGO Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) for the first time will combine its own buying for products sold at its stores with purchases it makes for its website, sources said, a significant move to stamp out duplicate efforts as it consolidates buying operations to better fight Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O). Vendors contacted by Wal-Mart about the change told Reuters the store and online buying teams of the world's largest retailer currently operate independently. Wal-Mart has told some vendors it is seeking to make the buying process more efficient for itself and vendors, and improve coordination between its buying teams. It also wants to apply its bricks-and-mortar expertise in securing the lowest possible prices to its e-commerce business, according to the vendors, who spoke over the last few days. They declined to be identified for fear of disrupting business relations with Wal-Mart. The move is part of a broader push by Chief Executive Doug McMillon and new e-commerce chief Marc Lore to narrow the gap with Amazon and boost Wal-Mart's competitive standing in U.S. e-commerce. Lore, who joined Wal-Mart when it purchased the company he founded, Jet.com, last year, has been charged with revitalizing Wal-Mart's online business and has introduced changes such as free-two day shipping. The company has told vendors it plans to disclose the change at a meeting with suppliers later this week, the vendor sources said. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez on Monday would say only that the company wants to create "a more efficient process that accelerates how we bring the full assortment of products in stores to Walmart.com." He did not elaborate. The company expects Walmart.com's buying team to focus on expanding the online assortment, Lopez said. Going forward, Wal-Mart's store buying team based at Bentonville, Arkansas, headquarters will place combined store and Web orders with suppliers who sell on both platforms. Under the new system, an item available for sale in the store will also be approved for sale online, the sources added. "The way it operated until now was extremely inefficient for us and them," a large consumer goods supplier told Reuters. "For example, they would buy 5 million cases a year for stores and 500 cases (for) online and then make us go through a different buyer for online. It was a nuisance." Wal-Mart's buying team in San Bruno, California, will still deal with suppliers that make products that sell only on Walmart.com, the vendors said. Store suppliers who have items they sell exclusively online will also have to go through San Bruno, they added. The strategy is designed to leverage Wal-Mart's powerful Bentonville purchasing operation, where dozens of vendors have set up offices solely to facilitate sales to Wal-Mart. The move will also help Wal-Mart make items at its nearly 4,600 U.S. stores available online. Many store suppliers still do not sell online because of low sales volumes, the sources said. Wal-Mart has been trying to expand its online assortment. It grew from 8 million items at the start of 2016 to more than 20 million items at the end of last year. This compares with more than 300 million items available on Amazon. The joint buying operation is also designed to address the dichotomy in which suppliers who focused on demands from Wal-Mart's traditional store buyers paid less attention to their online counterparts. "It is hard to make their online buyers a priority. I would get to them when I had a chance," another large consumer products supplier said.

 Amazon's $10 bras are a shot at Walmart and Target — not Victoria's Secret Eugene Kim Feb. 13, 2017, 2:24 PM 17,112 facebook linkedin twitter email print Facebook/Victoria's Secret Amazon's rumored plan to start selling its own $10 bras was seen as a play against Victoria's Secret, one of the leading companies in the market, which typically sells bras for around $40. But according to a note published by Morgan Stanley, Amazon's pricing strategy suggests it's actually going after big box retailers, like Walmart and Target — not Victoria's Secret — with its budget bras. The note points out Walmart and Target already sell low-price intimate apparel, and yet, Victoria's Secret continues to own roughly 27% of the market. That means the people who shop at Victoria's Secret are unlikely to be swayed by low prices, and find value in other things, like service and product quality. Instead, Amazon's strategy looks almost the same as what Walmart or Target are doing. "Given Walmart and Target's similar price points to Amazon's supposed $10 offering (Walmart $8-15, Target $10-20, vs. Victoria's Secret's ~$35) as well as a similar ‘no to little service’ model, we suspect these retailers are likely to be more negatively impacted than Victoria's Secret should Amazon persuade consumers to start buying intimates on its site," the note said. Given big box retailers account for roughly 50% of the US intimate apparel market, Amazon is certainly tapping into a huge market. But at the same time, Morgan Stanley notes, intimate apparel products have to meet stringent fit requirements, high quality standards, and multiple style needs (bras typically come in 5+ cup sizes, 4+ band sizes, and 5-10 difference colors), making it a tough category to win. Intimates is also the second least popular apparel category on Amazon, according to Morgan Stanley's survey, which suggests that it's an uphill battle to sell bras online: Morgan Stanley Get the latest Walmart stock price here.

When they ran out of paper towels to sop up the grease, Abbey suggested they hang the bacon strips like laundry and let the grease collect below. Together, dad and daughter fashioned T-shaped racks out of wooden dowels and bits of plastic hangers, and attached them to a pink plastic plate. It worked. At the time, Jon, a former heavy truck salesman who had invented an aerodynamic truck wheel cover that flopped, was facing bankruptcy. He saw the bacon cooker as a way out of his financial ditch, and he saw Abbey’s story as a great marketing tool. After researching microwave-safe plastic, he found a factory in St. Croix Falls, WI, that would make the dish, which they named Makin Bacon. Jon struck a deal with Armour to promote the dishes on its bacon packaging, selling them for $6.99 to customers who sent in proof of two purchases. The dishes cost $2 each to produce. Meantime, after reading the book Guerilla Marketing by Jay Levinson, Jon sent samples of the bacon dish along with Abbey’s picture to every human interest writer and producer he could track down. Abbey told her story to Oprah, David Letterman and Maury Povich and Parade magazine named it the best new food product of 1994. Late that year the Flecks struck a deal with Walmart, which has since sold more than 2.7 million Makin Bacons. © A young Abbey Fleck, co-founder of Makin Bacon. A young Abbey Fleck, co-founder of Makin Bacon. Still, the Flecks kept their ambitions modest. In 2010 Jon took another crack at designing an aerodynamic wheel cover and this time he was successful, striking a deal with trucking giant Schneider. In 2016, Makin Bacon grossed $800,000 while the wheel cover brought in $2.2 million. Today, the little company, A de F Ltd., is owned entirely by the Fleck family, and has no employees besides Jon, 53, who lives outside Minneapolis. Abbey, now 33, and her husband Jeff Benson, pitch in part-time from Los Angeles. In 25 years, the Flecks have raised the price of the plate only once, at Walmart’s insistence. “We thought, why rock the boat? Why get greedy?” says Abbey. Jon notes that the price of plastic has fallen over time. Today, the Flecks sell the plate for $4 and Walmart retails it for $9.97. Shortly after agreeing to sell the plate at Walmart, the Flecks began offering Makin Bacon on Amazon through a third-party seller who took care of getting the plates from the factory to Amazon’s warehouses. Customer satisfaction stayed strong. Makin Bacon’s Amazon ratings were consistently in the high 90s, says Abbey. Then last fall, its Amazon score started to slip and the Flecks got a disconcerting email from an unhappy customer. “They said our dish melted, but we knew that was impossible,” says Abbey. By Christmas, the email complaints about plates melting in microwaves had turned into “a barrage,” she says, as Makin Bacon’s Amazon rating plunged into the 60s and sales started to dry up. According to the Flecks and to Jeff Rosenfeld, a lawyer they hired in January, Makin Bacon is the victim of an attack by Chinese counterfeiters that the Flecks fear will wipe out their business. In addition to decimating their Amazon sales, which quickly fell by 50%, the Flecks say the fake plates are hurting them at Walmart because customers who buy melting plates on Amazon think Walmart is carrying the same defective product. “It’s really frustrating and scary,” says Abbey. She and Jon ordered several of the fakes from Amazon and were startled to find that they appeared identical to their own product, with packaging that included Abbey’s picture, Makin Bacon’s bar code, and the Flecks’ contact information. “It’s even stamped ‘made in America,’ which it’s not,” she says. Amazon spokesman Erik Farleigh, who handles media relations for the company’s third-party sales, declined to comment on the Flecks’ specific claims, instead emailing a 300-word statement. “Amazon has zero tolerance for counterfeit,” it says. “We remove suspected counterfeit items as soon as we become aware of them, and we suspend or block bad actors suspected of engaging in illegal behavior or infringing others’ intellectual property rights.” Rosenfeld, the Flecks’ lawyer, says that Amazon’s policy complies with U.S. trademark law, which requires Amazon to block a seller once it knows the vendor is offering counterfeit merchandise. Amazon has no legal obligation to police products offered by vendors in advance of sales. “The case law fairly vigorously shields the marketplace,” he says. In Makin Bacon’s case, however, he says Amazon agreed in early February that it would sell Makin Bacon plates only from four third-party sellers authorized by Makin Bacon. But Jon Fleck says counterfeiters know how to keep sales going. Instead of labeling the product Makin Bacon, they call it by another name like “Bacon Cooker Tray Rack.” It looks identical to Makin Bacon’s dish, down to a Makin Bacon label stamped into the white plastic. He and Rosenfeld notify Amazon each time they see a new fake offered on the site and Amazon has blocked dozens of sellers. That doesn’t deter the counterfeiters, who simply sign up as new third-party sellers. Jon uses a piece of $10-a-month subscription software called Visual Ping that scans the Amazon page of Makin Bacon’s main third-party seller and alerts him when the “compare with similar items” number ticks up, alerting him that a new fake has been posted. But the fakes are so numerous, he says, he can’t keep up. “It’s a glorified whack-a mole game that is extremely expensive for small business,” he says. In the last month he’s paid more than $15,000 in legal fees and he spends at least an hour a day researching fakes and reporting them to Amazon. “Policing this yourself is laughable,” he says. Amazon spokesman Fairleigh wouldn’t comment on several CNBC stories that have reported a sharp increase in counterfeit products offered on Amazon at a time when the site’s third-party seller business has grown to represent fully half of Amazon sales. “Jeff Bezos believes in an open marketplace,” says Fairleigh. “Amazon can’t possibly stock every item. It’s good for local business and the economy when other sellers have success on Amazon.” But it can be devastating to a small company like Makin Bacon when counterfeiters attack. “The credibility of our product has been so substantially undermined,” says Jon, “to the point where we may not have a business going forward.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Monday, February 13, 2017 by: Jude Henry Tags: food, health, Health Ranger, nutrition (Natural News) Walmart might be one of the last places that many people would expect to find wholesome organic food. But in certain locations, the standard “Welcome to Walmart” greeting can now be altered a bit to introduce guests to a healthy eating experience. That’s because Ray Allen, star NBA player for the Miami Heat, and his wife, Shannon, have founded Grown, the healthy fast food restaurant that is opening a location in the Orlando, Florida Walmart Supercenter. No longer is “fast food” only associated with mystery meat, trans fats, artificial colors, monosodium glutamate (MSG), and tons of grease. This follows the opening of the first Grown locations at the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The popular Orlando restaurant has 69 seats plus a drive thru designed with customers’ speed and convenience in mind. They serve a delectable variety of menu items that consist of certified organic, local, gluten-free food. This includes slow-roasted grass-fed brisket and Love Greens juice (a powerhouse combination of cucumber, apple, celery, pineapple, ginger, spinach, kale, and parsley). Other juices, along with smoothies, entrees, soups. and salads are on the menu all day. GMOs, hormones, sugar, and preservatives are not on the menu. Sharon, along with Todd Kiley, a chef from Boston, developed the menu. Customers can pick up food like they would do with typical fast food but without all the serious health risks associated with the greasy, toxin-laden choices. Ray and Sharon started Grown out of a difficult situation. Their son had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, and they were looking for healthy options that were also quick for busy families. There were unhealthy options at every turn, but this was just not an option for someone like their son. They showed great creativity and initiative in deciding to take matters into their own hands, rather than being passive and waiting around for someone else to open a healthy restaurant. High-volume seller has tremendous power and influence It might come as a surprise to many people when they discover that Walmart is actually the second-biggest seller of organic food in the United States. So it is already a place people go to pick up healthy food. What’s unique is that in addition to buying this type of food that they take home and prepare in their kitchens, shoppers can purchase ready-made food at Grown in the same way they would buy unhealthy fast food. Also, because Walmart is such a high-volume seller of food, they have the power to push down prices of organic, healthy food. This dramatically changes the food-buying climate for consumers and makes healthy eating more affordable. This is especially significant, given that many people say they would like to eat healthier and buy more organic food, but the high prices prevent them from doing so. More restaurants like this are needed Allen deserves kudos for promoting the same food that helps him excel on the basketball court. As discussed by The Health Ranger recently, other star athletes like Tom Brady fuel their high performance by following healthy diets consisting of bountiful organic food such as vegetables, superfoods, and healthy protein. Let’s hope the trend of opening healthy fast food restaurants takes hold and more locations of Grown open at additional Walmart stores and at other spots in various areas. For that matter, it would be great if other restaurants of this type develop throughout the United States. People are always looking for healthy options that are also convenient and affordable. Restaurants like Grown fill that need.

Many RILA member companies have corporate clean energy goals, and according to the survey, Alabama is the most difficult state in the country to meet those goals.  Alabama's cumulative score on the index was 1.82. The next-lowest score was a 13.60, given to both Idaho and Wyoming. Alaska scored a 15.56.  "Retailers are at the forefront of the growing trend to procure clean energy to power their operations," Adam Siegel, Senior Vice President of Research, Innovation and Sustainability at RILA said in a news release. "This index will help them focus on the states that are conducive to doing business. "We urge state governments to look hard at steps they can take to promote customer choice for renewable energy so that they can open the doors to new investments." The top-ranked state was Iowa, which got a 74.73. The Hawkeye State got more than 31 percent of its electricity from wind farms in 2015, and Iowa utilities continue to build more wind projects. One Iowa power company has pledged to get 100 percent of its power from renewable sources.  (Retail Industry Leaders Association)   Andrew Rector, a market analyst for technology firm Clean Edge and one of the lead contributors of the report, said the index weighted equally the policies in place in each state and the deployment of renewable projects in the state. Alabama ranks low compared to other states in terms of installed solar and wind capacity, and Rector said Alabama was missing several policy factors that can help grow solar and wind power. "They don't really hit on some of the things that we took into account, things like allowance of [power purchase agreements] for distributed generation, as well as leases or community renewables, or things like that," Rector said. "That's kind of where Alabama stands and why they ended up where they are in the rankings." Solar power purchase agreements or PPAs, allow third-party developers to pay for the upfront costs of a solar installation on a customer's property. The developer then receives payments from the customer for energy generated from the system, typically at a lower rate than the local utility would charge. The customer would also receive credits from the utility for excess electricity generated by the panels that was sold back to the grid. PPAs let the developers make the large upfront investments and make their money back over time, while saving the utility customer money immediately. The developers are usually responsible for the maintenance and performance of the system, making it much easier for the home or business owner. Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said the company was not asked to participate in the survey, and that the authors did not account for all the programs the utility has in place concerning renewable energy and only awarded points for specific types of programs.  "Based on their selective criteria, we don't think we would ever score very high," Sznajderman said.  The utility has made deals with Walmart to build a 72 megawatt solar facility in Chambers County, and with the U.S. Army to build solar arrays at Anniston Army Depot and Fort Rucker.  "We do have customer choice for certain large commercial and industrial customers, who can choose to purchase their power from us or from rural electric cooperatives," Sznajderman said. "Also, we do have a green tariff and have a large customer on that tariff right now." The report identifies so-called green tariffs -- rate structures that allow certain customers to purchase all or part of their electricity from locally generated renewable sources -- as a key factor in allowing companies to meet their clean energy goals. Some customers prefer the green tariff option to purchasing renewable energy certificates, which may go to subsidize wind farms in Oklahoma, but don't necessarily encourage development of local renewable resources.  According to the World Resources Institute, five states now have green tariff policy framework in place, with three more debating the idea. New Mexico's green tariff policy was seen as a key in attracting a Facebook data center to the state last year. The report cites Alabama Power's deal with Walmart, but as a direct utility purchase rather than a green tariff, because it was a one-time deal and not a lasting framework that other companies can use to easily create similar projects.  "Generally, where they are offered, [green tariffs] are broadly available to large [commercial and industrial] customers, utilize a company's existing relationship with its utility, and offer predictability and replicability to customers," the report states.  Sznajderman also said the report seems to give credit to Northeastern states that have higher energy costs overall, making renewables more competitive, and that it favors net metering, which he said "more states are moving away from because it unfairly shifts costs for renewables to the broader customer base and can raise costs for customers." A spokesman for the Energy Institute of Alabama, a policy group created to examine energy issues in the state, said the group has not reviewed the report in detail, but EIA chairman Seth Hammett issued a brief statement by email on Alabama's last place finish.  "It certainly merits serious consideration," said Hammett, who previously served as Alabama Speaker of the House and as chief of staff for Gov. Robert Bentley. "But we always have to take into account the importance of cost and affordability to the consumer." Corey Tyree -- a senior policy analyst at EIA and director of energy and environment, analytics and strategic growth for Southern Research -- said cost is a significant factor in determining how much renewables are utilized in a state.  "Of the top 20 states in the report, 14 of those states have higher electricity prices than Alabama," Tyree said. "And another four of those states (IA, TX, OR, and OK) have relatively strong solar and/or wind resources available. "The desire of individual states to put policies in place that keep costs low for consumers by taking advantage of their local resources is admirable. Like those states, Alabama consumers should expect solar power generating capacity in our state to grow if prices continue to fall and consumer demand increases as suggested by the CCEPI report." Alabama clean energy group disappointed, not surprised at survey For Daniel Tait -- CEO of non-profit group Energy Alabama, which advocates for renewable energy policies within the state -- the index results were disappointing but not surprising.  "We already knew this in terms of Alabama's performance relative to most of the rest of the country, even the Southeast," Tait said. "The Southeast is lagging behind the rest of the country but we're like the worst of the worst." Tait said the state's lack of policies allowing third-party ownership of solar panels or solar leasing options hurts efforts at business development and recruiting. "We're just kind of standing in our way," he said. "If a company wants to go solar, for example, and participate in these types of projects, they have to work really, really hard here and they're just going to go to a state somewhere else where it's going to be a much easier pathway for them to make these types of investments." Alabama was one of just four states to receive zero points in the index for allowing PPAs, along with Florida, Arkansas, and Kentucky. PPAs have shown to be effective and popular in other states. Colorado began allowing PPAs in 2010 and by 2012, 75 percent of new residential solar installations were completed through a PPA. Texas gets almost 2 percent of its total electricity generation from PPA-funded wind farms, with deals involving Google, Dow Chemical, Mars, and Walmart. "These are the market mechanisms we need to have to encourage investment in Alabama," Tait said. "That's what it boils down to and we don't have any of them." Tait said that instituting policies to address third party solar ownership or leases were not subsidies, but simply would provide a framework for businesses to make deals that work for them.  "We're not asking for subsidies, we're not asking for some favorable benefit, but companies -- and individuals for that matter -- want the ability to choose something different," he said "If they decide to go down that route, they should be allowed to." Another factor identified by Rector and Tait as hurting Alabama's renewable capacity was the fixed fee for solar deployment charged by Alabama Power. The state's largest utility charges its residential and commercial customers a monthly fee of $5 per kilowatt based on the size of their solar array.  It is the highest such fixed fee cited in the report. Alabama Power has said the fee, called the capacity reservation charge, covers the costs incurred by the utility for having power available as back-up for those customers when their solar panels aren't producing.  Alabama Power has developed and is developing a number of large solar projects, including the Walmart project and projects at military bases. Sznajderman said the company has received and is reviewing proposals for "about 200" additional renewable energy projects. But each project must be individually negotiated with Alabama Power and then approved by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which has approved a handful of solar projects, often without a ringing endorsement of their benefits. The PSC voted to approve the solar projects at Alabama's Army bases amidst fears "that our vindictive, liberal president would probably try to punish Alabama," if they voted no, according to commissioner Chip Beeker. That vote took place in 2015 before Donald Trump succeeded Barack Obama as president.  Tait said a different policy environment would allow smaller entities to take advantage of renewable energy.   "The policies are written in such a way that if you are a company such as Walmart or Microsoft, someone of that magnitude, we'll make sure there's a way to do it, but only in that one specific circumstance," Tait said. "That means you have to go direct through the utility and sign a direct contract with the utility. "While that's a good idea, and that fits the needs for some customers, corporate buyers of renewable energy is a huge market, and we need more than one way to service that market." The index comes as solar energy sector continues to experience strong growth in jobs and emissions-free energy output throughout the rest of the country.  According to advocacy group The Solar Foundation's 2016 Solar Jobs Census, the solar industry now employs 260,000 people nationwide, more than twice the number employed in coal mining operations and roughly equal to the number working in natural gas extraction.  The report found the solar industry grew by 51,000 jobs in 2016, accounting for 2 percent of all job growth in the country that year.  Alabama ranked 49th of 51 in the Solar Foundation's list of per capita solar jobs by state (including Washington D.C.), ahead of only Alaska and Arkansas. *UPDATED at 11:27 a.m. with additional comments from the Energy Institute of Alabama.  About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

(KRQE) – An offensive joke, bordering on a hate crime appeared at an Alamogordo Walmart for families to see. A customer took big letters meant for decorating and turned them into a message of hate. Ericka Smith saw a one worded message as she was strolling through the aisle of the Walmart Super-center. “I went to the crafts section and I was looking at the letters there, and I just noticed that it spelled out the word,” she said. KRQE News reached out to the Alamogordo Walmart to see what was being done. They told us their lost prevention department is looking into the security footage to see if they can find out who is responsible. Alamogordo Police said Walmart never informed them of the possible hate crime and they didn’t know about it until we told them. “We don’t approve of it and we condemn anybody putting out that type of, what I construe as garbage out for people to see,” said Deputy Chief Roger Schoolcraft. People we spoke with today said they’re just as disgusted by the display of hate. “I don’t think that’s right at all. Not one bit,” said Clarence Gatan. “Seems to be a lot of race issues. It’s just sad that our kids have to see that stuff,” said Raul Padilla. As for Ericka Smith, she said she’s upset things like this still happen, and has one message for the person responsible. “There’s a lot of hate in the world right now, and you just don’t need to be spreading that kind of stuff right now, it just needs to be more positive,” she said. At this time Alamogordo Police are not investigating the case. Share this: Tweet Email Print More Share on Tumblr Like this: Like Loading...

By Jeremy Bowman On 2/12/17 at 3:10 PM Close Donald Trump Signs Executive Order To Build Mexico Border Wall This article originally appeared on the Motley Fool. When Donald Trump was elected president, stocks rose as investor optimism grew that a united Republican government could deliver pro-business reforms such as tax cuts and reductions in regulations. Win an iPhone 7 Sign up to our daily newsletter for your chance to win. <p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> However, in his first week in office, Trump pushed forward the idea of a 20 percent tariff on goods imported from Mexico. Protectionism is generally anathema to Wall Street and the big business community, but seems to be a core component to Trump's economic policy. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said recently that the president had discussed the border tax with Congressional allies and would soon put forth a proposal. However, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle attacked the move, and Spicer stepped back from the idea, saying it was just one of many ways the country could make Mexico pay for the border wall Trump wants to build. At this point, it's unclear if the tax will be implemented, but Trump seems intent on fulfilling many of his campaign promises, which seem to include a trade war with Mexico in the form of stricter border controls, import taxes, and pressure on American companies to not outsource jobs. People passes by a sign welcoming a Wal-Mart store in Monterrey, Mexico, August 10, 2016. Reuters Even if the tax does not get enacted, the news has already had an effect as Mexicans have begun boycotting American companies and products. Let's take a look at a few of the companies that could be most affected.  1. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.  The nation's largest Mexican food chain may not have a direct relationship with Mexico, but it's still affected by economic policies around Mexico in one definitive way. Our southern neighbor is our biggest exporter of fruits and vegetables, accounting for nearly half of the fresh produce we import. Among popular fruits and vegetables that are widely imported from Mexico are mangoes, tomatoes, and, of course, avocados. Mexico is the world's biggest producer and exporter of avocados, and the U.S. imports two-thirds of the trendy fruit consumed here, almost all of which comes from Mexico. Chipotle would be one of the businesses most affected by rising avocado prices, which are already high as demand has built for the fruit. The company does not break out components of its food costs, but it spends about a third of its revenue on food. While commodity prices for meat and dairy have mostly fallen recently, management has complained about rising avocado prices. In its preliminary earnings report, the company said avocado dented profits, and an import tax would likely do the same. Though it may only push up food costs by as much as 100 basis points, Chipotle needs all the help it can get at a time when it's still struggling to recover from the 2015 E. coli outbreak. 2. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  Outside the U.S., no country is more important to Wal-Mart than Mexico. About one-fifth of the company's stores are located south of the border, and Wal-Mart's imports rely on many products imported from Mexico. The company was the subject of bribery investigations in Mexico a few years ago, and seems to be a principal target of the boycott being pushed against some Mexican companies. With 2,379 stores, Wal-Mart is only the largest retail chain in Mexico, but animosity seemed to be building against it, as seen on  Twitter  under the hashtag #Adios WalMart.  Groceries also make up the majority of Wal-Mart's sales, and agricultural trade across the border is strong. Mexico would likely implement a border tax, testing Wal-Mart's North American supply chain and causing higher prices. 3. Constellation Brands Finally, the company that would most be affected by an import tariff is Constellation Brands, an alcohol distributor that owns the U.S. rights to distribute Corona and Modelo beers, which are made in Mexico. Constellation Brands fell about 4% after Spicer announced the import tax, and the issue attracted attention from even Senator Lindsey Graham.   Before the Trump administration made that announcement, Constellation CEO Rob Sands had already put a plan in place so that the company wouldn't have to raise prices if an import tax passed. It's planning on buying more of its supplies in the U.S., such as natural gas and packaging, helping to offset the costs of the import tax. The company has even considered moving some production back to the US.; those plans are critical now. Corona and other beers imported from Mexico have been a fast-growing segment for the company, and make up more than half of its revenue. If the tax passes, Constellation shares could take a big hit.

A conversation about tech M&A trends and Trump Posted Feb 12, 2017 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Can you trust crypto-token crowdfunding? In recent years some very big brands outside the tech space have been stepping in to acquire technology companies as the pressure to keep up with consumer-powered digital trends touches more industries, from automobile makers to traditional retailers. And with a new U.S. president in office, there are signs M&A activity could accelerate further this year, given Trump’s talk of torching business regulation to encourage more deal-making.  TechCrunch talked to John Stiffler, senior M&A director at business and technology consulting firm West Monroe Partners, to get his take. What sorts of clients does West Monroe Partners work with on M&As? Stiffler: On the M&A side we help both private equity and corporate strategics in the middle market space buy and sell really pretty much any type of business from an industry perspective but the big three where we spend most of our time would be manufacturing & distribution, healthcare and high tech. High tech could be anything from businesses that have products in the cloud, platform as a service, or infrastructure as a service. Or something that might be a little bit more mainstream, in terms of shrunk-wrapped software, that kind of thing. That’s macro level. We do probably 300, 350 transactions or so a year, both for private equity and strategics. We represent probably about 30 to 35 per cent of the firm’s revenue. The rest of the firm’s revenue comes from things outside M&A. What are the factors you see encouraging non-tech companies to acquire startups? Stiffler: The tech space is such a competitive space, generally speaking, and in some of the stuff that we’ve seen is it’s a little bit of plugging technology gaps that the large corporation, mid-market facing or frankly even larger than that, just can’t build on its own quickly enough. The point is that if I’ve got the need to compete with an Amazon, for example, how do I do that without having to go hire my own tech team?  Start up my own application platform etc. Maybe I can buy some of that and supplement my team, or in fact maybe just completely buy it and integrate in. One of the examples would be last year… on the Wal-Mart side there was a good acquisition, if you will: Jet. Wal-Mart wanted to be able to compete with Amazon. Instead of actually trying to crank out their own set of applications they just bought Jet. So the premise is that as tech services are becoming so much more prevalent and dominant for consumers, there’s more of an urgency for the non-tech players to be getting into this space in a big way — which is then driving more M&A activity? Stiffler: Yes, well said. Do you have any data to quantify growth in this type of M&A activity? Stiffler: I don’t have any specific data… A lot of it really is just based on what we see. As I said, 65 per cent of our business comes from things outside of M&A and oftentimes we’re consulting for these businesses that are considering how to get better in terms of competition. And in many cases it shows up as ‘hey why don’t we just wait to buy technology assets’. And so because we don’t track that, per se, I don’t have any specific metrics. Are there particular tech areas of special interest to the sectors your firm focuses on for M&A? Stiffler: Generally this whole idea of getting technology into a space where you can reach the consumer more rapidly or that you can provide a service that’s easier for the user/customer to use is key. The Wal-Mart acquisition of Jet is one. Interesting stuff too. If you look at Ford, GM, they’re buying all kinds of things like that again. And in some cases in the automobile industry it’s how do I stay concurrent with the consumer of the automobile such that they want to have all these technology based component in their vehicle as well as how they manage their vehicle. So you buy a car today, you can get access to the car via the web. You can do all kinds of good things like that. Big, behemoth companies like that don’t necessary have some of those capabilities built in. So a lot of it is to be more relevant to the consumer. To be first to market so to speak with certain technologies that the consumer might want, and so on. That’s generally driving a lot of it. A lot of it also that we’ve seen is just general operational efficiencies. So take the consumer/end-user out of it, how do we become more efficient as a business in the technology space, such that we can replace aging systems that cost a tremendous amount of money to maintain. Or for that matter we don’t have the right resources to really maintain those systems anymore, so we need to get into more mainstream technologies. So it’s all the legacy based stuff as well, that comes into play here. Have you heard of any deals in play where a non-tech firm is really eyeing up a tech company? Stiffler: Nothing that I could probably speak to with any authority at this point. There are inklings of certain things that are out there — but nothing that would be, I guess, quotable. There have been Disney-Netflix M&A rumors for a while now… Stiffler: Yeah… That [rumor] comes to mind, of course. There’s some interesting things. How do you see the Trump administration affecting M&A activity? Stiffler: If you look at some of the regulatory/other things that might happen as a result of Trump jumping into office, there’s going to be some interesting play from that. He’s been pro-biz for all of his campaign. He did oppose the AT&T-Time Warner merger. There’s probably a good deal of optimism that he’s probably going to relax a bit on his stance, all round, allowing these kinds of things to happen. So the pro-stance and the Department of Justice and some of the antitrust things that they were looking at under Obama I think we’ll see… that under that pro-business stance, large-scale deals will likely become more feasible. That’s generally speaking what the industry might be saying. And what we’re hearing from some of our private equity investors who are looking at buying and merging businesses — now this obviously isn’t a corporation, these are private businesses, or businesses going from public to private, there’s not as much regulation if you will in that — but we see those guys being more bullish on opportunities to take advantage of that. So the punchline is I think it’s going to be an easier time for large corporations to do some of the things that may have been difficult over the last eight years. I think we’ll see a little more activity in the private sector as a result of just a very favorable deal climate. So faster deal-making if Trump is removing barriers for business. But might there not be concerns down the line of problems emerging later, i.e. due to a lack of due diligence as regulations are pared back? Stiffler: I haven’t heard that. In the conversations that I’ve had with my private equity clients, there’s just been a lot of healthy optimism about what things will look like this year. I haven’t heard that there’ll be some push back this year. What might Trump’s moves towards deregulation do for tech company valuations — might they be pushed up? Stiffler: There’s so many things that are driving tech company valuations up, there are just so many opportunities with some of the businesses that are available, or not available and are hot commodities for people to pursue, but some of those have to do with generally just the market, the industry at large if you will.  But I think if we look at his relaxing certain regulatory based things, if the markets continue to do well financially, if the lending climate continues to be strong, with low interest rates and he puts pressure in that space to continue to keep the economy humming, you’re going to see the deals stuff continue quite robust. Because with the strong credit market, and rates low, and debt readily available, you’ll continue to see lots of really, really good activities. In the meantime corporate strategics still have a tremendous amount of cash and they need to put it to work, and what you’ll see is those businesses will continue to put upward pressure on deal valuations because they usually… don’t have the short term issues of needing to buy and sell such that they can return values to shareholders immediately — like private equity looks like — they can actually hold onto businesses indefinitely, so they can actually spend a little bit more, typically, than the private equity client can so they’ll drive up deal valuations as well. So there are some signs that there might be more acceleration for tech valuation this year? Stiffler: I would say so. All the things that we see and hear, and some of the stuff that I’ve read… is saying that for sure. But we’re certainly seeing it in the market, at least at this point. What are your general M&A predictions for this year across the sectors you work in? Stiffler: I think that in the healthcare space we’re going to continue to see a tremendous amount of activity, it’s still so fragmented from a tech perspective. I talk about things all the way from clinical trial management, where there’s just such a mess of fragmentation in that space, and people that can bring together some really interesting capabilities for the pharma-based businesses probably will have first mover advantage, so I think that there’s going to be a lot of work in the healthcare space. Not just clinical, but if you look at taking a number of smaller businesses that might be regional practices, like some kind of a provider model, and bringing that into more of a national practice, the whole thing around what may or may not happen to Obamacare may have an effect on some of the things that folks are doing but generally speaking I think healthcare’s going to be very robust. There’s going to be quite a bit of effort in the high tech space. A lot of the Silicon Valley based companies and companies like that will continue to be very, very busy on the acquisition side, I think, just because of the volatility and the need to accelerate. So I think it’s a healthy outlook for those two spaces. Manufacturing and distribution will continue to bump along but the first two I expect to see quite a bit of work in that space.

Lockwood , Robbie Neiswanger This article was published February 12, 2017 at 5:21 a.m. PHOTO BY AP / REBECCA BLACKWELL Cars leave the General Motors assembly plant in Villa de Reyes, Mexico, last month. Automakers have joined with retailers to oppose a tax on goods imported to the United States. Comments (4) aAFont Size Michael Pakko, chief economist at the Institute for Economic Advancement at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs U.S. Rep. Steve Womack of Rogers Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon WASHINGTON -- A U.S. House Republican proposal that would tax retailers for the products they import and sell in the United States is still in the early stages. But the idea of a border adjustment tax as part of a broader tax package has retailers like Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dillard's Inc. concerned enough to band together to fend off what they believe would have a significant impact on their bottom lines and their consumers. Americans for Affordable Products formed earlier this month to spotlight the potential of the proposal, which has raised plenty of questions even among Republicans in Congress. The Affordable Products group now boasts 150 members. And, although the retail industry has taken the lead in the lobbying efforts against a border tax, the coalition includes a wider scope of companies and organizations that could be affected by such a tax. Nike Inc., Target Corp., Best Buy, Walgreens Co. and J.C. Penney Co. are also among retailers that have signed on as part of the coalition. Industry groups like the National Retail Federation, the American Apparel & Footwear Association and the Retail Industry Leaders Association are participating as well. Other industry organizations and companies -- like the American International Automobile Dealers Association and Toyota Motor North America Inc. -- have also pledged their support. "No issue has galvanized the [retail] industry like this one has over the course of the last decade," said Brian Dodge, the senior executive vice president of public affairs with the Retail Industry Leaders Association. "We are hearing from companies who don't historically engage meaningfully in public policy who are asking who to talk to and how to communicate their concerns. "The industry is activating itself against this proposal in a way that I've never seen it done before." Economists and analysts believe retailers -- and other importers in industries like oil, energy and automotive -- have reason to be concerned as Republicans contemplate sweeping changes. A border adjustment tax is part of a broader tax change plan that is being discussed by House Republicans, although no bill has been drafted. At the core of the proposal is a plan to change and lower the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Michael Pakko, chief economist at the Institute for Economic Advancement at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said change is needed. Corporate tax changes also have the support of retailers who have the "highest corporate tax rates of any industry," according to the National Retail Federation. But the industry is not in favor of a 20 percent tax on imports -- the so-called border adjustment -- that is being mentioned to offset the lost revenue from a lower corporate tax rate. If enacted, estimates indicate that would generate more than $1 trillion over the next decade. "On the surface, it appears to be a tool for managing or manipulating trade in a sense that it would tax imports and leave exports untaxed," Pakko said. "In that sense, it encourages exports and discourages imports, and serves as sort of a trade barrier. At least, on the surface." Pakko also said, in theory, a relative status quo would remain for businesses under the proposal because the dollar would strengthen, lowering the cost of imported products. Companies that export items would benefit from lower taxes while their products would be more expensive overseas. Proponents of the House Republican proposal -- which include General Electric, the Boeing Co. and other members of the recently formed American Made Coalition -- believe the plan will level the playing field, helping U.S. manufacturers compete with products made overseas. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said in a statement that the main goal of the tax change blueprint is to "improve the lives of all Americans." "That's why we are working to ensure that our tax code no longer favors Chinese steel over American steel, Mexican beef and autos over American beef and autos, and foreign oil over American oil," Brady said. "One of the best ways to protect the American dream is to tax imports and exports equally in our country. It's time to end the 'Made in America' export tax." But opponents argue that there's no guarantee that the playing field would be level with the border adjustment tax, which would lead to added costs for companies that import products. Edward Jones retail analyst Brian Yarbrough said if the dollar doesn't strengthen enough to offset the tax under the proposal, there's no doubt it would have an impact on retailers. "Bottom line, for most retailers that source foreign goods, it's going to be a negative impact," Yarbrough said. "How much is that negative impact? It depends on a lot of moving factors." Yarbrough said the tax burden would likely shift to consumers, resulting in price increases for goods like clothes, shoes, toys, gas and produce. According to the American Apparel & Footwear Association, 98.4 percent of the shoes and 97.3 percent of the clothes sold in the United States were imported in 2016. The National Retail Federation estimates that a border adjustment tax would cost American households up to $1,700 in the first year alone and could threaten millions of jobs. "It's absolutely damaging to the consumer," Yarbrough said. "At the end of the day you're basically shifting the tax burden from corporations to the consumer. Because now that the corporations are going to pay a lower tax rate, the companies that are impacted are most likely going to raise prices. The consumer is most likely not going to win in this environment." Members of the all-Republican Arkansas congressional delegation aren't rushing to support the proposal. "I'm still trying to learn more about it and understand it," said U.S. Rep. Bruce Westerman of Hot Springs. "That's one that we're going to have to analyze a little bit more and get some more facts and data about." U.S. Rep. Steve Womack of Rogers said he wants to see a tax system that is "more simple and fair," and that lowers corporate tax rates, but he isn't sure whether the border adjustment tax should be included in the package. "I have some concerns about border adjustability because of the potential it has for raising consumer prices on a lot of things that American consumers use on a daily basis -- everything from gasoline to bananas," he said. The lawmaker said the law may have unintended consequences. "We've got to be very, very careful in our approach," Womack said. In a written statement, U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford of Jonesboro said it's premature to weigh in on the issue. "Until I at least see draft language for the border adjustment tax and the rest of the tax reform plan, it's purely speculative to render [judgment]. However, when we do have a plan to review, my bottom line will be whether or not the reform package will have a positive impact on economic growth and quality of life in the 1st District," he said. U.S. Rep. French Hill of Little Rock is undecided on the matter. "This is a complicated issue, and Congressman Hill is thoroughly reviewing and studying it before he makes a decision one way or another," said the lawmaker's spokesman, Mike Siegel. On the other side of the Capitol, U.S. Sen. John Boozman of Rogers is still studying the proposal. "He's been looking at it. He's heard from folks, and he does have some concerns, in terms of what he has learned about it so far," said the legislator's spokesman, Patrick Creamer. U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Dardanelle also has reservations about the proposal. "Sen. Cotton is deeply concerned by the border-tax proposal. It could significantly increase the cost of groceries, clothing, toys and other items, and hurt Arkansas families trying to make ends meet. He will work with his colleagues to make sure that the final tax-cut package reflects the interests of hardworking Arkansans," said Caroline Rabbitt, the senator's spokesman. Wal-Mart officials declined to comment about the border adjustment tax and its potential impact on the company, but Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon was in Washington, D.C., earlier this month as part of President Donald Trump's business council. McMillon said in a statement after the meeting that job creation and the economy were part of the "constructive and candid" conversation. McMillon also said he was looking forward to continued discussions and that the retailer has long believed it was "always better to be engaged in trying to shape solutions than sitting on the sidelines." Economists and analysts believe that there won't be a change adopted anytime soon, but the stakes are high as businesses lobby on both sides of the issue. Kathy Deck, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Arkansas, said recently that if a border adjustment tax is enacted, it would present an enormous strategic challenge as well as a substantial shift for retailers and businesses like Wal-Mart. "We don't know what the final proposal will look like," Deck said. "But we do know it would cause companies to fundamentally rethink how they source, how they replenish and how they price."

 Whole Foods' dream transformed into its worst nightmare Hayley Peterson Feb. 12, 2017, 4:55 PM 136,511 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mallory Schlossberg/Business Insider Whole Foods was a pioneer in organic food in the US decades before such food was popular, betting on the idea that people would pay a premium for the label. The idea paid off: Sales of organic food more than tripled from 2005 to 2015, to $43.3 billion from $13.8 billion, according to the Organic Trade Association. Whole Foods' business should be booming as a result. But customers are abandoning the supermarket chain, as retailers including Kroger and Walmart ramp up their organic food offerings to meet growing demand. "The more conventional mainstream supermarkets have upped their game," Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. "We're going to do the best job that we can to keep our core customers from migrating back over to those guys." Whole Foods' longtime dream — that organic food would eventually appeal to everyone — has become its worst nightmare. The company's same-store sales have declined in each of the past six quarters. The chain saw a 2.4% decline in that metric during its most recent quarter, with transactions — which is used to measure traffic — falling by 3.9%. We saw several "sale" signs during a recent store visit to Whole Foods. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Whole Foods is now battling a wide range of competitors including specialty grocers like Sprouts Farmers Market as well as traditional grocers like Kroger, big-box retailers like Walmart and Target, and discount grocers like Aldi. "We were ignored for most of our history. Nobody paid any attention to us," Mackey said on the call with analysts. "But we continued to expand and grow and we got more and more successful, and then the conventional supermarkets ... began to pay more attention." Traditional grocers have been offering "good enough" alternatives to Whole Foods, and the company has watched its sales decline as a result — particularly on the weekends, he said. "Many of our stores where people used to drive long distances on the weekends and do big shops, we're seeing a little bit of a decline on that," Mackey said. Kroger started expanding its private-label Simple Truth organic food brand several years ago, and it now devotes multiple aisles in its stores to organic and natural foods. Walmart also now devotes a section of its fresh-produce department to featuring organic and locally sourced products. It has been rapidly growing its Neighborhood Markets stores, as well, which are much smaller than its Supercenters and focus solely on groceries and pharmacy. A Walmart Neighborhood Market. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The German chain Aldi, which is even cheaper than Walmart, invested heavily in organic food last year by expanding organic food brands, removing some artificial ingredients from its products, and adding more gluten-free items. This year, Aldi is spending $1.6 billion to redesign 1,300 of its US stores to feature softer lighting and bigger produce sections. The new stores look a lot like Whole Foods' new chain of stores, called 365 by Whole Foods Market, which the company launched last year to better compete with the increasingly crowded market for low-cost organic goods. The stores are cheaper to build than Whole Foods' traditional stores, so it has more flexibility in pricing. An Aldi produce section.

Lawsuit Claims Walmart’s Private Label Craft Beer Is “Wholesale Fiction” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Lawsuit Claims Walmart’s Private Label Craft Beer Is “Wholesale Fiction” February 13, 2017 3:54 pm EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk beer goggles beer craft beer walmart lawsuits legal craft breweries It can be hard to tell if that craft beer on the grocery shelf comes from the vats of a small, independent brewer, or if it is the product of a commercial vat. That’s the crux of a new class-action seeking lawsuit that claims Walmart is deceiving consumers with its private label “craft” beer brands in an effort to inflate prices. A beer drinker’s lawsuit [PDF] filed in the Hamilton Count, OH court of Common Pleas claims that calling the beverages — made in collaboration with Trouble Brewing under the names Cat’s Away IPA, After Party Pale Ale, Round Midnight Belgian White, and Red Flag Amber — craft beer is a “wholesale fiction,” because they’re actually mass-produced. According to the complaint, Trouble Brewing “doesn’t really exist,” echoing a recent Washington Post article that pointed out the applicant listed on filings with the Treasury Department’s Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) is ‘Winery Exchange Inc.’, which has since turned into WX Brands. “WX Brands ‘develops exclusive brands of wine, beer and spirits for retailers around the world’ according to its website,” the lawsuit notes. “But under the ‘brewery address’ section of the TTB filings, Genesee Brewing’s business office in Rochester, NY, is listed instead. Genesee is owed [sic] by another company that brews Costa Rican lager among other industrial brands. Upon information and belief, Genesee produces well over the prescribe amount that would be considered ‘small.’” The complaint also points to the Brewers Association definition of a craft brewer as “small, independent, and traditional,” and a business that produces less than six million barrels of beer annually; is less than 25% owned or controlled by a non-craft brewer; and that makes beer using only traditional or innovative brewing ingredients. Walmart’s line of beers “is a wholesale fiction created by the defendant … designed to deceive customers into purchasing the craft beer at a higher, inflated price,” the lawsuit claims. “Defendant stocks its craft beer next to other ‘craft beers’ for sale in its stores, rather than with other mass produced beers, such as Budweiser, Miller, or Coors products,” the complaint reads. “Again, by placing the craft beer on its shelves with other ‘craft beers’, defendant is further perpetuating the myth that it’s a craft beer.” The lead plaintiff is seeking to represent a class of Ohio residents who have bought the beer in question, as well as compensatory and punitive damages for violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, fraud, and unjust enrichment, and an injunction preventing further false and misleading advertisements regarding the beer.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next AURORA, Colo. – Police identified Monday two people they believe stole a car belonging to a Walmart employee who tried to stop the theft by leaping on her car’s hood. Police say the victim was using her keys to open boxes during her shift at an Aurora Walmart in January. The two suspects found the victim’s keys when she set them aside as she continued working, police said via a Facebook post. The victim rushed to the parking lot when she realized her keys were stolen. Police say she tried to stop the suspected thieves by jumping on the hood of her car as the couple attempted their getaway. She eventually jumped off and was not harmed. The suspects are also accused of using the victim’s credit cards that were inside the stolen car. The car was later retrieved. Aurora Police posted images of the suspects on its Facebook page in hopes of identifying them. The post was later updated with information that investigators know who the suspects are, but they are not releasing their names at this time. --------- Sign up for Denver7 email alerts to stay informed about breaking news and daily headlines.

The move from the company comes after the Walmart-owned retail giant introduced ready meals based on the firm's diet plan. Asda introduced its Slimzone range of 13 frozen meals and meat products last month, the Derby Telegraph reports. And the supermarket chain, which operates a huge store in Estover, claims the products are free to enjoy in terms of calorie intake when following the Slimming World Extra Easy eating plan. Slimming World has its own range of products in Iceland, though, and has now taken action to ask Asda to remove Slimming World trade marks from the range. The firm believes the supermarket is using them "unlawfully". Read next: Slimming World's greatest slimmers of the last year A statement from Slimming World said: "After careful consideration and on the advice of our legal team, Slimming World has this week taken action to ask Asda to remove our trade marks from their range of Slimzone meals. "We believe that Asda are unlawfully using our much loved and much respected name and trade marks on their meals (that's Slimming World, Extra Easy and Free), and are trading on the back of our brand's reputation, which we've built and nurtured over 47 years. "We've worked hard over the years to earn the trust and confidence of our Consultants, our members and the UK and Irish public – and maintaining that trust and confidence is at the heart of our decision. "At the same time, we have decided that we won't be adding the Slimzone products to our official nutrition database." Read next: Sickness and vomiting bug sweeps through primary school The statement adds: "We are unable to give an accurate value for them and by our calculations from the very limited information we've been able to obtain, a number of the meals could not be designated Free. "Although we asked Asda to let us have a more detailed breakdown of the ingredients used, they have not supplied those details and we have put on hold any decision about whether or not to include the meals in our official database. "We know that this news will be frustrating to some members and we are truly sorry for the disappointment it will cause. The situation is beyond our control. "The case is now in the hands of a judge and we won't be able to comment further on the meals themselves until we know the outcome of the case." Read next: Are you ready for the new car tax rules that are coming into force? When Asda launched the Slimzone range it said it had identified a gap in the market to "make it both easier and cheaper for customers who want to keep themselves on track with a controlled weight loss programme". It is selling the frozen ready meals and products for £2.50 each – 50p cheaper than Slimming World's own brand in Iceland. Asked for a response to Slimming World's legal action, an Asda spokeswoman said: "Our customers have told us that saving money and leading a healthy lifestyle is a priority and that is why we developed our Slimzone range for them. "We're confident in Slimzone and our customers seem to love it too. "We've shared a full list of ingredients for the Slimzone meals to help our customers make up their own minds."

More from Most Innovative Companies Why Chobani Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why Related Companies Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why The Home Depot Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Why Resy Is One Of The Most Innovative Companies Of 2017 Claire Dodson 02.13.17 6:00 AM Target The idea of a massive store that looks the same in every region is a thing of the past, at least for Target. In its place is a highly curated version tailored for dense urban areas. "How do we keep our store experience relevant?" asks Mark Schindele, Target’s SVP of properties. "We customize, we evolve, and we understand our guests." In 2017, Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores, double the number it opened in 2016. The company’s first small-store effort, City Target, which launched in six locations in 2012, averaged about 100,000 square feet, still too big a footprint for major cities. The company faced a challenge: how to condense even more while providing customers with a total Target experience. Flex formats shrink the size to as little as 12,000 square feet and tailor merchandise to specific neighborhoods. They also dropped the special moniker: All Targets, regardless of the size or shape, would be known as Target. Target will roll out 28 new flexible-format stores in 2017.[Illustration: Laura Breiling] Manhattan got its first flex-format Target in October, in the Tribeca neighborhood, which has been flooded with stylish young families. The two-story outpost emphasizes apparel, toddler, and baby sections. (It’s also the only Target so far to include a Chobani yogurt café in place of the now-standard Starbucks.) Target, which once stood for consistency and endless choice, now wants to be adaptable, streamlined, and quick—the company can research a new site and have doors open within a year. "We look at what needs aren’t being met by a neighborhood," Schindele says. "And then we meet them." Milestones: Target recently hired former Walmart exec Shekar Natarajan to fill the new role of SVP of network planning and operational design. He is tasked with harnessing tech to speed up Target’s supply chain. Challenges: Walmart attempted a similar curated-retail experiment with its Express stores but couldn’t nail the formula. It closed 102 of its smaller format locations in 2016. Buzz: Positive Moleskine's celebrated Timepage calendar app will work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017.[Photo: Celine Grouard for Fast Company] Moleskine The success of Moleskine’s classic notebooks in a digital age has been compared to the resurgence of vinyl records or Polaroid cameras. But Moleskine knows that its future hinges on its ability to work in tandem with digital technology. A year ago, Moleskine released its Smart Writing Set, a pen and notebook that converts handwritten notes seamlessly from the page to an app. The company is now taking that idea a step further, leveraging its celebrated Timepage calendar app to work in conjunction with a new physical planner set to be released in 2017. Users can take a snapshot of the day’s to-dos, which the software will recognize and integrate with Timepage. Eventually, the tech could operate like the Smart Writing Set. "We don’t see analog and digital as antagonistic dimensions in the lives of real people," says CEO Arrigo Berni. To that end, Moleskine continues to ramp up its physical presence. In addition to opening 40 new retail stores by the end of 2018, the company is working on building out its Moleskine Cafés, which it built in Milan in 2016 and in the Geneva airport in 2015. Inspired by the café littéraires of the 17th century, these storefronts are part art gallery and part meeting space, and they also sell Moleskine products. In addition, Moleskine is expanding the company’s limited-edition notebook selection, which features characters from Hello Kitty, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC, Game of Thrones, Toy Story, and more. Moleskine, being Moleskine, manages to give them a chic spin. "There’s an emphasis on design and creativity with everything we do," Berni says. "As a brand, we stand for the possibility of expressing yourself in all different forms." Milestones: Belgian vehicle importer D’Ieteren acquired Moleskine in 2016, giving it a new valuation of almost $600 million. Challenges: The brand will have to preserve its creative cachet as it grows so that it doesn’t lose its cult following—as when Starbucks lost the coffee diehards. Buzz: Positive Nokia Milestones: The Nokia brand is returning to phones after being licensed to HMD Global. The $26 Nokia 150 has a monthlong battery and doesn’t look too far off from the Nokia you loved in the mid-aughts. Challenges: Nokia/HMD is entering into an especially crowded Android marketplace, where many companies don’t ever reach profitability. In addition, the Google Play Store is currently not available in China, which is the new Nokia 6 smartphone’s first market. Buzz: Negative Nestlé Milestones: Scientists at Nestlé figured out how to cut sugar in choc-olate by 40%, by making it dissolve quicker to trick the taste buds. Products will roll out in 2018, with gradually reduced sugar so consumers don’t no­­tice a difference. Challenges: Eighty-three percent of Nestlé’s revenue comes from its slow-growing food and beverage divisions, compared to rival Unilever’s 43% in those sectors. Buzz: Positive First Solar Milestones: The solar energy systems maker is accelerating production of its cost-efficient Series 6 module by a year (it will begin in 2018) and scrapping a planned Series 5 edition. Challenges: The move is part of a restructuring that laid off more than 25% of its workforce in an effort to better compete in an overstocked market and recoup lost profits. Buzz: Neutral Blippar Milestones: Augmented-reality pioneer Blippar has added real-time recognition to its app, letting users scan more than 70,000 faces and pull up related info. It’s like Shazam for public figures. Challenges: Blippar must contend with heightened competition from open-AR apps like Vuforia Studio Enterprise, which simplifies AR for businesses. Buzz: Positive Zaha Hadid Architects is set to build the world’s first all-wood stadium.[Photo: courtesy of MIR] Zaha Hadid Architects Milestones: The London-based architecture firm is set to build the world’s first all-wood stadium for the Forest Green Rovers soccer team in Stroud, England. The sustainable structure will have the lowest amount of embodied carbon of any stadium worldwide. Challenges: Principal Patrik Schumacher recently came under fire for calling for the privatization of public spaces. The firm condemned the remarks, saying they were not consistent with the late Zaha Hadid’s way of thinking. Buzz: Negative Boeing Milestones: Boeing has reorganized its military and commercial support into a new unit, Boeing Global Services, and has hired former GE Aviation exec Kevin McAllister to lead its commercial airline business. Challenges: In December, Donald Trump tweeted that the order for Boeing’s new Air Force One should be canceled due to what he claimed was a $4 billion cost, causing its stock to slip 1.6%. Buzz: Neutral McDonald’s Milestones: McDonald’s is selling its operations in China to state-owned Citic. The move allows McDonald’s to reap franchise fees while Citic uses its expertise to better target Chinese customers. Challenges: The cost of labor is going up, and the chain’s revenue is still struggling to recover after drops in 2014 and 2015. It’s hard to keep McDonald’s franchisees happy when innovations like new digital kiosks come with a price tag of nearly $60,000 apiece. Buzz: Neutral Rent the Runway Milestones: In December, the clothing rental company raised a $60 million round of funding and became profitable with $100 million in 2016 revenue. It also launched its first flagship store in New York: 5,000 square feet with personal stylists and store associates who tap into user data to personalize the shopping experience. Challenges: Rent the Runway has partnered with Neiman Marcus to open RTR boutiques inside its department stores, which could be risky with Neiman Marcus’s recent revenue struggles, down 4.1% in 2016’s fourth quarter.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Walmart released a statement about the incident Monday. "Keeping our customers and associates safe is among our top priorities, and this weekend’s incident had nothing to do with our store. Since this is an ongoing investigation, we must refer all questions to local law enforcement." Police believe someone opened fire in the parking lot. Police are reviewing security camera footage from Walmart, as they continue to investigate exactly what happened, and why. At this time they believe two or more people were involved in the shooting after an altercation. Police say they also responded to the 2200 block of Memorial Parkway, just a mile down the road from the Walmart where they found a gun shot victim. Police tell WHNT News 19 the gun shot victim was at Walmart and involved in the altercation. Right now police are still investigating, and currently have no suspects in custody.

 Whole Foods' dream transformed into its worst nightmare Hayley Peterson Feb. 12, 2017, 4:55 PM 136,514 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mallory Schlossberg/Business Insider Whole Foods was a pioneer in organic food in the US decades before such food was popular, betting on the idea that people would pay a premium for the label. The idea paid off: Sales of organic food more than tripled from 2005 to 2015, to $43.3 billion from $13.8 billion, according to the Organic Trade Association. Whole Foods' business should be booming as a result. But customers are abandoning the supermarket chain, as retailers including Kroger and Walmart ramp up their organic food offerings to meet growing demand. "The more conventional mainstream supermarkets have upped their game," Whole Foods CEO John Mackey said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. "We're going to do the best job that we can to keep our core customers from migrating back over to those guys." Whole Foods' longtime dream — that organic food would eventually appeal to everyone — has become its worst nightmare. The company's same-store sales have declined in each of the past six quarters. The chain saw a 2.4% decline in that metric during its most recent quarter, with transactions — which is used to measure traffic — falling by 3.9%. We saw several "sale" signs during a recent store visit to Whole Foods. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Whole Foods is now battling a wide range of competitors including specialty grocers like Sprouts Farmers Market as well as traditional grocers like Kroger, big-box retailers like Walmart and Target, and discount grocers like Aldi. "We were ignored for most of our history. Nobody paid any attention to us," Mackey said on the call with analysts. "But we continued to expand and grow and we got more and more successful, and then the conventional supermarkets ... began to pay more attention." Traditional grocers have been offering "good enough" alternatives to Whole Foods, and the company has watched its sales decline as a result — particularly on the weekends, he said. "Many of our stores where people used to drive long distances on the weekends and do big shops, we're seeing a little bit of a decline on that," Mackey said. Kroger started expanding its private-label Simple Truth organic food brand several years ago, and it now devotes multiple aisles in its stores to organic and natural foods. Walmart also now devotes a section of its fresh-produce department to featuring organic and locally sourced products. It has been rapidly growing its Neighborhood Markets stores, as well, which are much smaller than its Supercenters and focus solely on groceries and pharmacy. A Walmart Neighborhood Market. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The German chain Aldi, which is even cheaper than Walmart, invested heavily in organic food last year by expanding organic food brands, removing some artificial ingredients from its products, and adding more gluten-free items. This year, Aldi is spending $1.6 billion to redesign 1,300 of its US stores to feature softer lighting and bigger produce sections. The new stores look a lot like Whole Foods' new chain of stores, called 365 by Whole Foods Market, which the company launched last year to better compete with the increasingly crowded market for low-cost organic goods. The stores are cheaper to build than Whole Foods' traditional stores, so it has more flexibility in pricing. An Aldi produce section.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Feb 12, 2017 at 2:03PM Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has taken another step forward in its quest to challenge Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for e-commerce supremacy. The world's largest retailer ditched its Amazon Prime-wannabe, Shipping Pass, which offered free three-day shipping for an annual fee of $49, and is instead offering free two-day shipping on all orders of $35 or more.  It's a better deal for customers, as a majority of orders on the company's website are for more than $35, and Wal-Mart's success has historically come from offering rock-bottom prices without hurdles such as a membership fee, offering a different kind of value from Amazon Prime. Wal-Mart's own warehouse chain, Sam's Club, has always lagged behind Costco Wholesale. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart is making more than 2 million items eligible for free two-day shipping, but that's much less than Amazon, which has over 50 million items available for free two-day shipping to Prime members. Wal-Mart's $35 minimum, however, is lower than Amazon's $50 minimum for non-Prime members, which does not promise two-day delivery -- though deliveries now often come in two days anyway, as the company's distribution network has vastly expanded in recent years. Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce CEO, Marc Lore, who came to the company with the Jet.com acquisition last year, touted the move, saying in a press release: "I couldn't be more excited. We are moving at the speed of a start-up. Two-day free shipping is the first of many moves we will be making to enhance the customer experience and accelerate growth." With a nod to Amazon, Lore added, "In today's world of e-commerce, two-day free shipping is table stakes. It no longer makes sense to charge for it." Will it be enough? Wal-Mart's free two-day shipping offer is certainly a step in the right direction, as was its acquisition last summer of Jet.com, the company Lore founded. But there's also evidence that Amazon is stretching its lead over the retail giant. Amazon's North American e-commerce sales jumped 22% in the fourth quarter, reaching $80 billion for the full year, and the company grabbed 53% of all e-commerce sales growth in the country last year, according to Slice Intelligence. That figure shows how dominant Amazon has become, taking more than half of new e-commerce sales in the country, which added $16 billion to its revenue last year. Retail giants like Wal-Mart and its competitors, as well as smaller e-commerce providers, are left to fight over the remaining growth. Amazon continues to tighten the screws on its rivals, adding more members to Prime, and spreading Prime Now and Fresh to new cities. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, Amazon now has 65 million Prime members, or slightly more than half of total U.S. households. Wal-Mart's new two-day free shipping offer is unlikely to appeal to current Prime members, who have already coughed up the $99 annual fee to get free shipping and benefits including video streaming and access to the Kindle Lending Library. But Wal-Mart can start by making a bid for non-Prime shoppers, who may currently be even more profitable to Amazon -- the company is running a wide shipping deficit, with net shipping costs totaling $7.2 billion last year. Shipping costs are growing faster than shipping revenue, evidence that membership fees from Prime are not keeping up with shipping costs. Price vs. convenience Wal-Mart can start by pressing its price advantage over Amazon. After all, the world's largest retailer reached the top of the food chain by promising everyday low prices that drove the mom-and-pop stores that couldn't compete out of business. Amazon stole some of that thunder as it also focused on rock-bottom prices during its early days, but the company has increasingly pivoted to competing on convenience over price, as its Prime membership program has come to dominate its domestic operations. Amazon still retains a reputation as a low-cost provider, however, because it tends to discount the most popular items, but charge full price on less popular ones. In fact, the common perception that Amazon is less expensive than Wal-Mart is incorrect. Wal-Mart needs to undo this perception through savvy marketing and aggressive pricing. Since it's significantly more profitable than Amazon, both in dollars and margin, it has the ability to slash prices even further to regain its reputation as the price leader. In fiscal 2016, Wal-Mart U.S.'s operating margin was 6.4%, compared to 3% last year for Amazon's North American e-commerce division. From there, Wal-Mart needs to further leverage its Jet.com acquisition, making its "smart basket" technology -- an algorithm that lowers prices based on things the customer can control, like the number of items in their order -- available for all of its customers. I'd expect an announcement on that later this year, and many more such advances in the first full year of the Wal-Mart/Jet partnership. Lore has proven his e-commerce start-up mettle twice before, and hinted at further advances. Still, Amazon continues to move at light-speed, opening up new fulfillment centers and unveiling innovations like the cashier-less Amazon Go store. Catching Amazon won't be easy, but Wal-Mart still has several advantages. With Lore's help, the company should be able to unlock them. Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images) Millennials are very focused on instant gratification. This may not sound like something worthy of a news flash. But this statement accurately depicts marketers’ usage of entertainment-oriented messages to drive sales. These tactics include using in-game/gaming consoles, virtual reality (VR), and other immersive environments to increase engagement, stimulate trial, and garner brand affinity. Millennials are at the forefront of driving food preferences. From healthy eating to discovering the latest foodie options. Since Millennials like to be in the know, they are constantly on their social media sites checking out the latest recommendations and must-go-to spots. Just look at movie theaters. Gone is the stale popcorn with the flat pop. Now, moviegoers sit in a state-of-the-art environment with crafted food options, not to mention the lounge chairs and the bar to get that specialty drink. Many public spaces are being reimagined to create a socially integrated community. Retailers, in particular, are using technology for self-check outs and pop-up stores along major city thoroughfares to heighten awareness of new product launches. Big Box retailers are re-imagining themselves and creating smaller footprints to encourage a “neighborhood” niche feel. Just look at Walmart as an example. Marketers have to really consider the consumers first. Cities are using parking apps so ease tempers from consumers having to go feed the meter. Chicago is using river-front space for retail. Now you can sit at a boutique cafe and enjoy coffee or tea with a river view of yachts sailing by. It’s an example of how public spaces are being reimagined to serve consumers. So, what does all this mean for marketers? Marketers have to really consider the consumers first. Seek behavioral research to help guide you on what are their potential needs. Advertising messages are not just messages now. They are also a form of entertainment. Look at your portfolio of owned media and your store front to determine the best way to transform your business into the type of environment that Millennials will want to patronize. Be sure to blend mobile experiences into your mix and realize that traditional selling models are now a thing of the past.

By Timothy O'Brien, Bloomberg View Posted Feb. 12, 2017, at 10:17 a.m. We can all thank Melania Trump for giving us a clearer sense of what she and her family are looking for from their stay in the White House. In court papers Melania filed Monday as part of a libel lawsuit against the parent company of the Daily Mail, she said that the British tabloid and website, by falsely reporting that she had once worked as a prostitute, caused the first lady to miss “major business opportunities” and “multimillion-dollar relationships.” Melania’s role as first lady to President Donald Trump would have offered her a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to cash in on such deals, the lawsuit noted, but the reputational damage done had disrupted those plans. Amid a little swirl of social media attention for the case, Melania’s spokespeople said that reporters and others had misinterpreted the language in the suit and that the first lady had “no intention” of trying to profit from her White House role. Fortunately for another Trump, the president’s daughter Ivanka, nothing yet seems to have unwound similar opportunities afforded by being a member of one of the world’s most famous families, with regular access to two of the world’s most powerful men (her father and her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president). Shortly after Trump was elected, Ivanka’s eponymous accessories company drew criticism for aggressively marketing jewelry she had sported during a “60 Minutes” interview about her and her father’s White House plans. More recently, Ivanka has stated that she would part ways with the Trump Organization and her own business by moving to Washington and taking a “leave of absence” from the companies. But as ProPublica reported last week, she has yet to make public documentation proving that she has formally left her businesses. Meanwhile, she has invited titans of industry for dinner at her Washington home, where the guests included the chief executive of Wal-Mart. Ivanka’s clothing line is sold in Wal-Mart stores, and Wal-Mart has an interest, inevitably, in a number of decisions that the Trump White House will make, including corporate tax rates, trade agreements and labor regulations. Ivanka seems to be blissfully unaware that any of this might appear, at a minimum, unseemly. On Wednesday morning, she tweeted a photograph of herself attending a White House meeting with her father’s business advisory council, a panel of prominent corporate executives assigned to give her father guidance. The taint of possible self-dealing that clings, vaguely, to Ivanka’s comings-and-goings is a step more pronounced with Kushner. Privy to innermost White House decisions, he has yet to effectively distance himself from the Kushner family’s real-estate operations: He simply moved his assets into a trust controlled by a less-than-disinterested party, his mother. And then we come to the Trump patriarch himself, who freely mingles his family’s business interests and the authority of the presidency. Just Wednesday morning, he defended Ivanka’s wallet and lit into Nordstrom because the retailer recently dropped his daughter’s clothing line due to weak sales, tweeting: “My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” Trump’s tweets are just mood music in this discussion, though. Of greater note is that the president still hasn’t released his tax returns or truly separated himself from the Trump Organization’s business affairs. By these decisions, Trump, who isn’t subject to federal conflicts-of-interest laws, has ignored decades of Oval Office tradition meant to reassure the public that the president — unlike Melania — isn’t looking for “multi-million-dollar relationships” in the White House. For students of good government, Melania’s lawsuit does have an upside: the discovery process. Since she is seeking at least $150 million in damages stemming from missed business opportunities, the lawyers representing the Daily Mail should eventually avail themselves of their discovery powers to secure each and every email, communique and document about White House business prospects that the Trump parents and children discussed. They should also subpoena the Trump family’s tax returns and banking records while they’re at it. If President Trump isn’t inclined to release his tax returns or be more transparent about his business dealings, then maybe the courts can help him along.

An analyst says the cost is higher than thought. by John L. Stanton Close icon John L. Stanton From an economic standpoint, the Philadelphia beverage tax is a lose-lose situation - for consumers and city grocery stores. One month into the new law, the effect on both is greater than many anticipated. Consider the impact on consumers. Mobile consumers have the ability to drive to nearby suburbs and buy their beverages without paying the tax, as well as their other groceries. They'll save a little money, but take on the hassle of driving, spending money on gasoline, and adding to traffic. Proponents of the soda tax have suggested that after some period of time consumers will adjust and go back to shopping in their usual city store. I strongly disagree. From my research and years in the food industry, I've learned that food shopping tends to be habitual. Once consumers get into the habit of going to a particular location, they will often continue to shop there. And, already it has been reported anecdotally that sales in city stores are down and sales in suburb stores near the borders have risen slightly. Consumers, who can travel, will. Wawa has claimed that people will drive miles to save a penny on gas. Look at how Wal-Mart changed the shopping paradigm. People travel miles to shop at Wal-Mart - because they believe they will save money. A few pennies saved makes a big difference. So, who is hurt the most? The consumers who can't afford to travel outside the city to buy their untaxed beverages and groceries. Many argue that the amount of the tax is not that significant. That may be true for a well-to-do professional, but for those living paycheck to paycheck, it can be significant. The supermarket industry knows that very small differences in prices can lead some consumers to shop around - why else would their weekly circulars be filled with reductions on food prices, often at smaller margins than the increase this tax introduces? It is very unlikely that grocery store owners will ameliorate the effect of the tax on the thousands of items included by spreading the tax increase across other categories. This may not be Economics 101, but it is basic food marketing. The manufacturers of untaxed product would strenuously object to raising their prices because a product in another category has a price increase due to a tax. One may argue that the grocer is free to set prices, but the manufacturer of the non-taxed products can decide to do significantly less promotion in those city stores. Most grocery stores rely on such promotions, so it would be a serious impediment for the city grocers. In fact, a grocer who would even consider "spreading out the increased costs across other items" would face significant costs in making these price changes, and most likely have to charge even more across the store to recoup the cost of the changes. Another argument was that the grocers will absorb the tax themselves and not pass it on - this is also highly unlikely. First, the profit margins are already extremely low in the supermarket business, and this could have a significant impact on the ability to stay in business. A number of city supermarkets have closed in the last few years. This new tax has the potential to exacerbate the situation and make city food shopping more difficult. The impact might be lessened, say, if a different sector of the food business were subject to the tax, but the beverage category is one of the largest - and most important in the store. In a typical supermarket, a product like Pepsi might appear in up to 10 different places in the store. Second, there is an issue of trust and transparency. Supermarket owners want to be transparent when it comes to prices, and should know the reason why prices are higher. For the supermarket, it's beneficial for consumers to know that the increase was due to taxes and not just the store raising prices. As time goes on, a discriminatory tax like the beverage tax will continue to make life more expensive for city shoppers and more complicated for mobile city dwellers. It will make city supermarkets less competitive with suburban stores and potentially lead to their ultimate demise. What seems like a small tax can have the potential for big consequences - none of them good. John L.

The surveillance footage, released by the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday, shows Michael Foster, 43, tackling Clarence Daniels from behind as he was walking into a Brandon, Fla. Wal-Mart on Tuesday. Foster followed Daniels into the store after seeing him exiting his vehicle with a gun holstered under his shirt — which was perfectly legal for the 62-year-old Daniels to do since he holds a concealed weapon license. Nevertheless, Foster tackled Daniels from behind as he entered the store, and put him in a chokehold before taking him to the ground. Witnesses said that Foster yelled out that Daniels had a gun. They also said that Daniels yelled out that he had a license for it. Foster called 911 only after he tackled accosted Daniels. He was arrested and charged with battery.

Ashley Williams, a singing telegram performer, was recently hired by Demetre White after he saw a flyer for her services.  He wanted to surprise a woman he admires and has been friends with for two years and ask her to be his girlfriend. The two planned for the surprise to happen at Walmart in Decatur on Saturday, February 11. As Davis walked into the store for a quick shopping trip, some of White's family greeted her along with Williams.  As the ladies walked around the store, Williams sang "Stand By Me" accompanied by the music on a portable speaker. During the walk, people held balloons and different signs saying "Will, You, Be and My..." White was waiting at the exit with balloons and another sign across his chest, "Girlfriend." Davis gave him a big hug and kiss. We'll call that a yes! We wish the two of them lots of happiness. As this new couple is spending their first Valentine's Day together in the River City, millions of people are watching their viral story! "As soon as I walked in, the music started playing and my heart dropped," recalled Quita Davis. White wanted to ask Quita Davis to be his girlfriend. He had the idea, the location, and knew of a singing telegram performer. "He was like I want to do something for my, shes not my girlfriend yet, we've been talking for two years and I really like her. I think I found my queen," singing telegram performer Ashley Williams recalled. Davis recalled that when White asked her to meet him at Walmart, "I still had no idea what was going on until I hit the corner and saw him. I thought it was a prank to be honest." "Even after it was done, we were both like that was amazing," recalled Williams. "I didn't realize that five million people would think it's amazing too!" Davis said it's a grocery shopping trip she'll never forget. It's a moment that took her completely by surprise, and that's why five million people have seen her in her pajamas. "Clearly I had no idea what was going on," said Davis. "I would've put some clothes on and some shoes instead of slippers." "He was like 'but I love her' so I had to thank him for just including me in that whole process," said Williams. "Do you believe this is my first valentine ever? Ever!" said Davis. "He just wanted me to be his girlfriend and now something so beautiful and personal got to be shared with the world. I'm in love with this man!" Not only has this created a big memory and mark on social media, but it's also increased Ashley Williams singing business, Send a Song Today. So, everyone is having a sweet Valentine's Day. 34.556565 -86.995953 Filed in: Decatur Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email Popular Police: Victim identified in deadly wreck on I-565 near County Line Road Burger King selling ‘Adults Meal’ for Valentine’s Day Police investigate shooting at Sparkman Walmart ‘It was insane’: Maid of honor turns Florida wedding into nightmare Latest News Give from the Heart, Donate Blood today Woman feared for her life when ex-husband escaped from Decatur Work Release The citrus spritzer works…but does that mean it’s a deal?

The Obama administration’s Federal Communications Commission established net neutrality by reclassifying high-speed internet as a regulated phone-like telecommunications service, as opposed to a mostly unregulated information service. The re-classification was cheered by advocates for a free and open internet. But now Trump’s new FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a former Verizon attorney, is pushing to repeal the net neutrality reform by rolling back that re-classification — and he’s getting help not only from a legion of telecom lobbyists, but from civil rights groups. In a little-noticed joint letter released last week, the NAACP, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, OCA (formerly known as the Organization for Chinese Americans), the National Urban League, and other civil rights organizations sharply criticized the “jurisdictional and classification problems that plagued the last FCC” — a reference to the legal mechanism used by the Obama administration to accomplish net neutrality. Instead of classifying broadband as a public utility, the letter states, open internet rules should be written by statute. What does that mean? It means the Republican-led Congress should take control of the process — the precise approach that is favored by industry. None of the civil rights groups that signed the joint letter responded to a request for comment. It’s not the first time civil rights group have engaged in lobbying debates seemingly unrelated to their core missions, but in favor of their corporate donors. At a time when OCA received major funding from Southwest Airlines, the group filed a regulatory letter on behalf of the airline in support of Southwest’s bid to open flights at Houston airport. The NAACP, after receiving financial backing from Wal-Mart, helped the retail chain during its contentious bid to open stores in New York City. Telecom issues, however, are a particular specialty. Last week’s letter was organized by the Multicultural Media, Telecom & Internet Council (MMTC), a group funded by the telecom industry that has previously encouraged civil rights groups to oppose net neutrality. MMTC in previous years reported receiving about a third of its budget from industry-sponsored events; its annual summit, which was held last week, was made possible by $100,000 sponsorships from Comcast and AT&T, as well as a $75,000 sponsorships from Charter Communications and Verizon. MMTC, which acts on the needs of telecom lobbyists, has been accused of “astroturf lobbying” by creating the appearance of grassroots support for the industry. The civil rights group opposed to net neutrality have employed several arguments against the proposal. In one filing made in 2010, the NAACP signed onto an argument from MMTC that net neutrality reforms were a waste of resources because the FCC should focus on “more pressing racial discrimination and exclusionary hiring and promotion practices of certain Silicon Valley high-tech companies.” In a separate filing in 2014, MMTC and the NAACP argued that reclassification would threaten the “fragile state of minority engagement in the digital ecosystem.” While advocating against net neutrality, the organizations on the joint letter have raked in money from the telecom industry. The NAACP, which signed letters opposing net neutrality both times the rule was proposed by the Obama administration, has named AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast as corporate fundraising partners. After the NAACP endorsed Comcast’s merger with NBC, Comcast disclosed that the NAACP was one of the the recipients of $1.8 billion in funds doled out to various community groups. The Asian-American groups on the letter, including OCA and Americans Advancing Justice, have similar ties to the largest telecom firms. Verizon, AT&T, Comcast, and the National Cable & Telecommunications Association, a trade group for the telecom industry, are listed as members of the “Corporate Alliance” of donors funding AAJC. Comcast and Verizon sponsored OCA’s annual gala last year. The National Urban League received $1.2 million from Verizon in 2014 alone. As the Center for Public Integrity reported, senior officials from AT&T, Verizon and Comcast have held positions on the National Urban League’s board. Net neutrality activists are crying foul. “Net neutrality is based on a communications law that guarantees vital nondiscrimination rights,” said Jessica J. González, the deputy director and senior counsel of Free Press. “This joint statement may seem innocuous but it actually endangers the communications rights that have empowered people of color to tell our own stories, organize for racial justice and earn a living online.” “The Congress that tried to destroy net neutrality once would only weaken it with legislation that fails to adequately protect those it is meant to serve,” says Malkia Cyril, the executive director of the Center for Media Justice. She noted that the civil rights groups that signed the letter are now calling for putting the future of the internet “into the hands of a GOP Congress that just appointed white supremacist Jeff Sessions to be attorney general.” Activists have expressed alarm at the pace at which Commissioner Pai has already axed reforms enacted by the Obama administration. In his first days  as chairman, Pai rolled back an attempt to regulate overly expensive prison phone rates, got rid of the proposal to allow more competition for the cable box market, and blocked nine companies from providing low-income families with discounted high-speed internet services. Observers believe net neutrality is next. But Kim Keenan, the president of MMTC, the group that organized the joint letter, has showered Pai with praise. “He is really focused on closing the digital divide. As an advocate, I feel so much pride that that it is a priority for his chairmanship,” Keenan told Multichannel News, a trade outlet.

By Om Malik   February 13, 2017 A familiar technology is transforming our interactions with the digital world, and Snapchat’s parent company wants to lead the way.CreditPHOTOGRAPH BY J. EMILIO FLORES / THE NEW YORK TIMES / REDUX Ever since Snapchat—sorry, Snap Inc.—filed for its initial public offering, last week, it has been all that anyone in Silicon Valley can talk about. In the documentation that it sent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Los Angeles-based company reported that it had achieved a sixfold increase in revenue in 2016, and that its hundred and fifty-eight million daily users were generating more than 2.5 billion Snaps per day. When Snap goes public, in March, it may be valued at as much as twenty-five billion dollars. Much of the tech-world buzz centered, as it has for months, on the question of the company’s future potential, given that larger and more established platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have already proved themselves adept at mimicking Snapchat’s features. As the S.E.C. filing acknowledges, “We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business.” But hidden in the opening pages of that filing is a more interesting declaration. It appears in emphatic black lettering against Snapchat’s signature yellow: “Snap Inc. is a camera company.” Technically speaking, Snap is a camera company, and has been for a number of months. In September, it announced the launch of Spectacles, camera-equipped sunglasses that allow you to record a ten-second video by tapping a button near your left eyebrow. (For the moment, Spectacles are sold exclusively in itinerant vending machines called Snapbots.) But the company’s vision of the future appears to be more expansive than that. “In the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones,” it writes. The personal devices of the past decade have already made the camera more central to our lives than ever before; it has evolved into a multipurpose tool, a visual sensor, as useful for recording a lunch receipt as for capturing a dazzling landscape. (And don’t forget the screenshot, which has partly usurped the functions of the old-fashioned notebook.) At the same time, the huge demand for smartphones has forced developers to make their cameras better and better, with ripple effects well beyond the industry. Action cameras, drones, low-orbit satellites—many have directly benefitted from this arms race. Cameras can look down from on high and predict crop yields, traffic in Walmart parking lots, and travel patterns on Labor Day weekend. On the ground, they form the foundation of autonomous-driving systems. Snap is betting that the cameras we carry in our pockets could be even more powerful. In its S.E.C. filing, the company contends that “images created by smartphone cameras contain more context and richer information than other forms of input like text entered on a keyboard.” Snap, of course, is not the first company to recognize that its users’ experience of the world is increasingly mediated through cameras. Consider WeChat, a free messaging app developed by the Chinese giant Tencent. The service, which has hundreds of millions of customers, allows people to use their smartphones to read the data hidden in QR codes. By scanning the codes with their cameras, WeChatters can buy food, call up Web sites, and make payments. According to Allen Zhang, WeChat’s founder, the technology constitutes a “third hand for humans.” Indeed, several years ago, at a time when barely anyone used QR codes, he described them in language similar to Snap’s. “The entry point for PC Internet is the search box,” he said. “The entry point for mobile Internet is the QR code.” Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that earlier this month Snap began expanding the use of QR codes on its platform. And, as Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen and Sarah Frier reported a couple of weeks ago, Snap was at one point in talks with Google to introduce a feature that would have allowed Snapchatters to perform Internet searches merely by pointing their phones at objects in the real world. That search feature never came to fruition, but it’s a useful indicator of where the mobile Internet is headed. QR codes have always been a kind of half-measure, a useful but inelegant transitional technology; the ultimate goal is augmented reality. Last Tuesday, Pinterest offered a small glimpse of this future in the form of an experimental feature called Lens. “Sometimes you spot something out in the world that looks interesting, but when you try to search for it online later, words fail you,” the company explained in a blog post. Lens allows you to perform a visual search—for clothing, furnishings, recipes, and so on—using your smartphone camera. It’s a self-evident-enough idea, but the reason Lens and other A.R. technologies are being introduced only now is that software is finally capable of supporting them. In the past couple of years, companies including Microsoft, Facebook, and Google have used vast repositories of photos available on the Internet to build intelligent systems that can accurately identify everything from dogs to babies to flowers. The more training data—that is, images—these systems have, the more accurate they become over time. If and when Snapchat makes its foray into A.R., it will have those 2.5 billion user images a day to learn from. The possibilities that come with thinking about the camera as a portal into the realm of information and services are attractive not only to Snap but also to every other big player in the tech world. Facebook, for instance, has slowly been enhancing the visual capabilities of its Messenger. If you show Google Assistant a pair of Nike Air Maxes, it can not only identify the shoes but also bring up related styles and direct you to a place where they are sold. Tim Cook, the C.E.O. of Apple, is high on A.R., too. At a technology conference last fall, Cook predicted that in the near future “a significant portion of the population of developed countries, and eventually all countries, will have A.R. experiences every day, almost like eating three meals a day. It will become that much a part of you.” Until fairly recently, that might have seemed like pure Silicon Valley hype. The early entrants into the world of A.R., as with its cousin virtual reality, were disappointing: the phones were too weak, the networks were too slow, and the applications were too nerdy. But now the technological pieces are in place, and a whole generation—much of which is on Snapchat—has come to consider the camera almost a third arm. Yes, Snap is a camera company. It’s just that the camera isn’t a camera anymore. Om Malik is a technology writer, the founder of GigaOm, and a partner at TrueVentures, a venture firm based in Palo Alto, California.

Iglesias | Miami Herald | TNS Foreign nationals at the Krome detention center, where those with criminal records and deportation orders are often held. By Francis Wilkinson, Bloomberg View Posted Feb. 13, 2017, at 1:46 p.m. Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, 35, a mother of two American children, was arrested last week in Phoenix and deported to Mexico, which she left as a 14-year-old to travel illegally to the United States. There was no public-safety rationale for her removal. But the president who defrauded students, cheated contractors and shattered democratic norms on his way to the White House is apparently a stickler for following rules. The deportation, over protests, was another shot in the federal government’s new war on immigrant communities. Its reverberations extend far beyond the 20 metro areas, including Phoenix, that are home to the majority of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Guadalupes can be found in unexpected places. Worthington, Minnesota, is a prairie town of 13,000 near the southwest corner of the state, just north of the Iowa line. It has a thriving little downtown spotted with restaurants and stores, and, from June to October, an open-air farmer’s market in the old Campbell Soup Co. parking lot. City administrator Steve Robinson, a Worthington native, said that his 1978 graduating high school class had about 260 people. “Thinking back,” he said in a phone interview, “I believe there were four non-Caucasian classmates.” Immigrants began coming to Worthington from around the globe in the late 1980s, when the local pork-processing plant was expanding. The cultural transition often was excruciating. Natives, Robinson said, “were afraid to go to the grocery store because they were afraid they were going to be attacked.” Crime in Worthington is lower than in most comparable towns within a 150-mile radius, and myths about the dangers of immigrants are “really starting to wane,” Robinson said. It helps that immigrant businesses have revitalized a sinking downtown that seemed destined for destruction after a Wal-Mart opened nearby. Today, the local JBS plant employs more than 2,000 people processing more than 20,000 hogs daily. Other businesses, including local farms, livestock transporters, veterinarians and Worthington’s downtown merchants, all benefit from the plant’s economic impact. Not everyone in Worthington is in the U.S. legally. In 2006, federal immigration agents raided the pork plant (then owned by Swift Co.) as part of a nationwide crackdown and arrested more than 200 workers there. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports greater restrictions on immigration, estimated in 2009 that almost one-quarter of Swift plant workers nationwide were undocumented immigrants. (Some undocumented workers use stolen Social Security numbers to obtain work; many companies pretend not to know.) The pro-immigration Migration Policy Institute, working from U.S. Census data, estimates that, nationally, about 13 percent of the workforce in the meat-processing sector is unauthorized. Worthington is not a sanctuary city. It lacks the resources of Los Angeles or San Francisco. “We don’t care what your immigration status is,” Robinson said. “We will, however, cooperate with immigration officials.” If the feds come for local undocumented immigrants, there’s little place for them to hide. The city works with community groups to counsel local immigrants on how to deal with law enforcement. “We have done demonstrations to show people how to behave during a routine traffic stop,” Robinson said. “Many come from countries where the police have been the bad guys.” The 2006 raid unleashed a wave of fear through the town. The plant lost workers. The town lost residents. But the trauma didn’t stop Worthington’s transformation into a cultural polyglot. President Donald Trump’s multi-faceted campaign against immigrants is likewise futile. Deportations and immigration bans can impose misery on families and friends. They can compromise businesses, communities and local economies. But they won’t make America white again. “First, the racial minority population is growing more from natural increase than immigration,” Brookings Institution demographer William Frey said in an email. “Second, the white population will start declining after the year 2025.” Robinson said more than 50 languages are now spoken in Worthington. Its diversity is a product not of coastal cosmopolitanism, but of low wages paid for hard work. The town’s political leadership still is all white. But it probably won’t be for long. Asked if there were anything Trump’s immigration policies might do to alter Worthington’s trajectory, Robinson didn’t hesitate to answer: “Not at all.” Francis Wilkinson writes editorials on politics and U.S. domestic policy for Bloomberg View. He was executive editor of the Week.   SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« A small start for revitalizing rural Maine: ‘The belief that it is possible.’ Next story:Want a raise?

Cross Feb 13, 2017, 11:53 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Feb. 13, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Red Cross has launched a massive disaster response in northern California, where at least 188,000 people have been ordered to evacuate over the past 24 hours due to the potentially catastrophic failure of a spillway which is part of the Oroville Dam system. "The Red Cross has shelters open now and more relief supplies and disaster workers are on the way to provide assistance for people in harm's way," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, disaster operations and logistics for the Red Cross. "This is a potentially catastrophic situation – affecting thousands of people and homes – and our first priority is making sure people have a safe place to stay. We will be in the community to offer comfort and support for as long as needed." As many as 2,200 residents were in Red Cross and community shelters as of Monday morning, and the Red Cross is preparing to shelter and feed thousands more in the upcoming days. The evacuation orders came Sunday night in Butte and Yuba counties, Yuba City and Marysville, as damage was discovered to the Oroville spillway. The Oroville Dam is the tallest dam in the United States, and is a critical piece of the state's water system. The dam currently remains intact, but the emergency spillway is compromised. The governor of California has declared a state of emergency and substantial search and rescue help is being deployed, including the California National Guard and Highway Patrol, along with swift water rescue teams. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP: Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and open shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps. MAKE A DONATION We are thankful to those who would like to donate items for people evacuated in California – but the Red Cross is not equipped to manage, support, and distribute donated items.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News The Next Million Dollar Recipe The secret weapon behind the hottest-selling, most innovative food products in a fiercely competitive market BELLEVUE, Wash. – Feb. 13, 2017 – — How do the most successful food product manufacturers today spearhead innovation in a highly competitive retail market? They know someone you should. Gail Kurpgeweit is a Commercial Recipe Developer and Consultant to the foodservice industry, specializing in new product development. Her clients enjoy tremendous success from the sale of her creations, but one client’s story is particularly impressive. A Bellevue, Washington-based baked goods manufacturer purchased a portfolio of custom all-natural, non-GMO, gluten-free recipes that have been selling extraordinarily well in retail stores across the U.S. including Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, Kroger Foods, Jewel-Osco and more. The demand has been so hot for this line of products, the cookies recently launched as a “Family Pack” in Costco stores across Washington, California and Texas, where they are selling out quickly. Ms. Kurpgeweit, a Caterer based in Issaquah, Washington, also creates recipes and formulas for one of the fastest-growing segments of the foodservice industry: Meal prep and prepared-meal delivery companies. Whether the format is ingredients-only for DIY meal prep, or fully-prepared fresh or frozen meals, the most successful meal preparation and delivery services in the U.S. depend on Ms. Kurpgeweit’s creations to keep their menus fresh and exciting while increasing customer retention. Home cooks can also enjoy Ms. Kurpgeweit’s recipes through her blogs and in an upcoming cookbook entitled “Frozen & Fabulous” expected to publish in early 2018, which teaches advanced freezer meal preparation, including sous vide techniques. Some recipes are available now on her website at www.FrozenandFabulous.com, where customers can also link to Gail’s exclusive freezer-to-oven meal prep containers currently available on Amazon. For more information regarding this topic, contact Gail Kurpgeweit via her catering company, Taste of Amazing, by email at gail@tasteofamazing.com or via her website at www.gailkurpgeweit.com.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 13 February 2017 by Military News Red Cross Opens Shelters and Prepares for Massive Response to Possible Oroville Dam Failure WASHINGTON, Feb. 13, 2017 — The American Red Cross has launched a massive disaster response in northern California, where at least 188,000 people have been ordered to evacuate over the past 24 hours due to the potentially catastrophic collapse of the Oroville Dam. “The Red Cross has shelters open now and more relief supplies and disaster workers are on the way to provide assistance for people in harm’s way,” said Brad Kieserman, vice president, disaster operations and logistics for the Red Cross. “This is a potentially catastrophic situation – affecting thousands of people and homes – and our first priority is making sure people have a safe place to stay. We will be in the community to offer comfort and support for as long as needed.” As many as 2,200 residents were in Red Cross and community shelters as of Monday morning, and the Red Cross is preparing to shelter and feed thousands more in the upcoming days. The evacuation orders came Sunday night in Butte and Yuba counties, Yuba City and Marysville, as damage was discovered to the Oroville Dam, the nation’s highest dam. The dam currently remains intact, but the emergency spillway is eroding. The governor of California has declared a state of emergency and substantial search and rescue help is being deployed, including the California National Guard and Highway Patrol, along with swift water rescue teams. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP: Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and open shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

"The Red Cross has shelters open now and more relief supplies and disaster workers are on the way to provide assistance for people in harm's way," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, disaster operations and logistics for the Red Cross. "This is a potentially catastrophic situation – affecting thousands of people and homes – and our first priority is making sure people have a safe place to stay. We will be in the community to offer comfort and support for as long as needed." As many as 2,200 residents were in Red Cross and community shelters as of Monday morning, and the Red Cross is preparing to shelter and feed thousands more in the upcoming days. The evacuation orders came Sunday night in Butte and Yuba counties, Yuba City and Marysville, as damage was discovered to the Oroville Dam, the nation's highest dam. The dam currently remains intact, but the emergency spillway is eroding. The governor of California has declared a state of emergency and substantial search and rescue help is being deployed, including the California National Guard and Highway Patrol, along with swift water rescue teams. DOWNLOAD EMERGENCY APP : Everyone should download the Red Cross Emergency App to have safety information available on their mobile device, including emergency weather alerts, safety information and open shelter locations. Red Cross apps are available in smartphone app stores by searching for the American Red Cross or going to redcross.org/apps.

Online marketplaces are selling gift cards from all sorts of places, such as Walmart, Target and even Sunglass Hut. They make money by buying these leftover giftcards from people and then reselling them. Sometimes, however, you can save a few bucks by buying these gift cards at a discount. The discounts usually range from 5-10 percent, which can add up when making a big purchase. However, there are a few places where you can buy giftcards and get a savings of 30-50 percent. Tuesday morning on WMC Action News 5, we will share with you the websites which have the best savings and the brands which you can really save on.  That’s Tuesday morning starting at 4:30 a.m. with weather and traffic every 7 minutes.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds subscribe Site Archive Simpson: A column without any politics at all Monday Feb 13, 2017 at 1:53 AM Dave Simpson / Opinion columnist TURNABOUT: A mere year ago, it was nothing but wine and roses. Puppy dogs. The smell of freshly-baked bread. Money in the bank, and six-pack abs. Perfection. Total vindication. Proof positive of unquestioned galactic superiority. Confetti descending from the rafters. The football team I root for every year was the undisputed champion. Best in the world, the solar system, and our neck of the Milky Way. Top of the heap. That day, there was nothing in the history of mankind better than being a fan of the football team for which I root. That was then. This, sadly, is now. There is a new best and undisputed champion of the solar system, as of Sunday. The wine and roses, puppy dogs, the freshly-baked bread, and the six-pack abs now reside in New England. Some folks can’t even remember last year’s greatest team in the history of mankind. Our big day is discarded, forgotten, and perfection in every way is a mere memory. Enjoy your moment in the sun, Patriot fans. Because — take it from a Bronco fan — even after proving your total galactic superiority, the garbage still has to go out when the chicken wrapper starts to smell bad, old joints still ache in the morning, and tax time is almost upon us. Even for the fans of world champions. Your team winning the Super Bowl is kind of like scoring the closest-in parking space at Walmart. It’s nice, maybe even worth mentioning at dinner, but it’s a fleeting victory. They do this Super Bowl deal every year, and chances are the confetti will be falling on some other best team in the history of the universe in a mere 12 months. THIS IS CRAZY: I catch myself trying to score the closest-in parking space every day when I go to exercise, and I’m curiously happy when the space closest to the door is available. I pay good money to trot on a treadmill for a half hour, then ride on an exercise bike for an hour, sweating copiously in the name of fitness and good health. But, subconsciously, I can’t stand the thought of walking an extra 25 yards across the parking lot. Go figure. I MISS IDOL: I don’t know about you, but I miss “American Idol.” Every year at this time, a couple evenings a week, The Wife and I would sit down in front of the TV and watch “American Idol.” She was a fan from the beginning, but I was a late adopter. I couldn’t carry a tune in a bucket, so I don’t think it was necessarily the singing that attracted me. No, it was the incredible enthusiasm of those thousands of young people, risking probable defeat and sometimes humiliation, to make a dream come true. In a world full of young people all too often hardened by skepticism, cynicism, and even anger at perceived promises not fulfilled, it was wonderful to see youngsters so head-over-heels excited to pursue a nearly-impossible dream. Cold February nights aren’t the same without “Idol.” SAY AGAIN?: A relative used the term “husband ears” recently when telling The Wife about her husband perhaps not hanging with eager anticipation upon her every word. This reminded me of the old guy at exercise who sometimes wears a t-shirt that says, “My wife says I don’t pay attention to her. Or something like that...” The challenge of hanging with eager anticipation upon a spouse’s every word can be difficult after, in our case, over 30 years. We’ve both heard each others’ favorite stories hundreds of times. (My favorite: The property taxes on my land in the mountains came to $7.28 a year before I built my cabin. The punch line: “And they let me pay it in two installments!”) I love that story, but if The Wife is around, I can’t tell it, because I can see her lips moving, and her eyes rolling, when I get to the punch line. What with ears that don’t hear like they used to, and loved ones who sometimes mumble, and the proclivity to retell golden oldie stories, I think it’s overly simplistic to chalk this phenomenon up solely to “Spouse Ears.” Contact Dave Simpson at davesimpson145@hotmail.com About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Site Services Wedding Form Anniversary Form Engagement Form Birthday Form Archives Photo Reprints Contact Us Birth Form Classified Advertising Form For Advertising Market Place Boats Magazine Cars Classifieds Coupons Homes Garage Sale Form Community Info Village of Morton Morton Park District Morton Economic Development Council Morton Chamber of Commerce Morton District 709 Morton Public Library Communities Chillicothe Times-Bulletin East Peoria Times-Courier Woodford Times Washington Times-Reporter Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

They know someone you should. Gail Kurpgeweit is a Commercial Recipe Developer and Consultant to the foodservice industry, specializing in new product development. Her clients enjoy tremendous success from the sale of her creations, but one client's story is particularly impressive. A Bellevue, Washington-based baked goods manufacturer purchased a portfolio of custom all-natural, non-GMO, gluten-free recipes that have been selling extraordinarily well in retail stores across the U.S. including Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Walmart, Kroger Foods, Jewel-Osco and more. The demand has been so hot for this line of products, the cookies recently launched as a "Family Pack" in Costco stores across Washington, California and Texas, where they are selling out quickly. Ms. Kurpgeweit, a Caterer based in Issaquah, Washington, also creates recipes and formulas for one of the fastest-growing segments of the foodservice industry: Meal prep and prepared-meal delivery companies. Whether the format is ingredients-only for DIY meal prep, or fully-prepared fresh or frozen meals, the most successful meal preparation and delivery services in the U.S. depend on Ms. Kurpgeweit's creations to keep their menus fresh and exciting while increasing customer retention. Home cooks can also enjoy Ms. Kurpgeweit's recipes through her blogs and in an upcoming cookbook entitled "Frozen & Fabulous" expected to publish in early 2018, which teaches advanced freezer meal preparation, including sous vide techniques.

Keith Owsley was selected to fill the vacancy on Friday afternoon. He comes from a corporate HR background, working around the country. "Keith has all the ingredients and a lot of experience," Mayor Steve Holt said. "He has worked for Wal-Mart in corporate HR and was with Lowe's in corporate HR. He has a number of years at the university level." Owsley will be on the job Monday, Feb. 20. He grew up in east Tennessee and holds degrees in psychology and personnel science from the University of Tennessee. The human resources job came open in October 2016 when Alanna Sullivan left to take a job in the private sector. Dan Barger, chief general fund accountant, has been the acting human resources director. Holt said Sullivan left before he took office at the October runoff election, and filling the opening was one of his first priorities. Most recently, Owsley had been working for Wal-Mart in Birmingham, Holt said. He has lived in Killen for three years and was commuting to and from work, he said. "He wanted a local job, and he was the right person at the right time for us," Holt said. "He fell in love with our area and wanted to stay here." About 90 people applied for the job, he said. "He has interviewed with the department heads, and he has met with the HR staff. We've gotten a good response from everybody," Holt said.

Photo: Gene Page/AMC/© 2016 AMC Film Holdings LLC. All Rights Reserved. The Walking Dead Rock in the Road Season 7 Episode 9 Editor's Rating 4 stars Prev Next Complete Series Coverage After a first half that began with a stunner and ended on a snooze, the back eight of season seven kicks off with a welcome end to the wussification of The Walking Dead. Gone is the sweaty, subservient Rick who preaches go along to get along; back is the sweaty, pissed off Rick who cocks his head, invades your personal space, and stares a hole in your skull while he convinces you it’s time to stand up and fight. Daryl’s found himself again, too, projecting that combination of toughness and vulnerability that just isn’t possible while wearing Walmart sweatpants. Along with the rest of the A-towners, they set out to recruit allies in their upcoming rebellion against Negan and his oppressive gang of bikers/iron-burn victims. Smartly, rather than drag out the recruitment process too long, Rick and company cover a lot of ground posthaste. The result? A surprising amount of progress toward uniting the clans, a mystery with Father Gabe, a twist ending, and one of the best zombie slaughter scenes ever. The opener was a typical bit of TWD misdirection: a slow, silent creep in the darkness with Father Gabe as he abandons his post on the wall, cleans out the pantry, and drives out of town. Only much later do we learn that no one knew Gabe was cutting out with a carload of canned goods and tools. There’s a notebook with strange numbers and a sketch of what looks like Lucille. He leaves his Bible behind. What’s it all mean? No idea. More important question: Would anyone but Rick miss him if Gabe’s gone for good? Doubtful. Thankfully, we shift immediately to see Rick in full recruitment mode at Hilltop, where Gregory is behaving in a rather Trumpian way, calling off a trade agreement and bitching about refugees. If the G-man had access to social media, he would have tweeted, “Asked so-called leaders Ricky & Margaret who will train cannon fodder 4 their war. RHETORICAL!” The meeting ends as Rosita channels the Sarge and calls Daniel a “walking ballsack” as all the world nods in agreement. Hey, who needs that weasel’s help when they have … Enid? She introduces Birdie, who herself introduces a bunch of eager Hilltoppers who owe their lives to Mags and are ready for revolution. Not a total victory, but it’s a start. Daryl also presents a battle plan that’s more Beavis & Butt-head than Sun Tzu — they need explosives or fire, he says. Um, sure Daryl. Plenty of those lying around. Next stop on the Please Stand By Me World Tour is The Kingdom, or as Rick says, “the Kingdom?” Jesus somehow forgets to mention King Ezekiel has a large pet tiger, and also, Jerry. (“It pleases him indeed!” Missed you, Jerry!) Zeke’s doing his usual Medieval Times routine, tossing off lines like “What plans have you, Rick Grimes of Alexandria?” and “I invite you all to sup with us.” You can almost hear Rick’s thoughts as he somehow keeps a straight face: Man, this is total batshit, but we could really use a dude with a tiger and guys with body armor on horseback and a minstrel who knows “Life in a Northern Town” on acoustic guitar. Rick’s pitch takes an odd turn when he recalls a story his mother told him about a rock in the road and a family who lost some beer and a little girl who dug it out to find gold buried underneath. (Not now, Jerry!) I think the true lesson here is that if a king plants a rock in the middle of the road as a test, even though it’s going to wreck horses and jugs of beer and the fingers of a child, then that king is a real dick. Zeke, however, seems to vibe on the message of great rewards coming to those who take a brave, perhaps bloody stand in the name of righteous change. But Morgan expresses doubt — he’s still hung up on taking lives, even though he saved Carol from certain death by killing that Savior. Morgan really wasted his “Get Out of Self-Imposed Jail Free” card on Carol, who’s still out there creeping in the woods, alone but not as far enough away as she should be if she were serious about being left alone. Don’t squander your pomegranates on her mopey ass, Zeke. The King wimps out in the end, but Richard is all in. (Alas, something tells me our poor man’s Gerard Butler will not survive this war.) Zeke does a solid by giving Daryl asylum, which comes in handy when the Saviors realize he’s missing and turn A-town upside down. Yet the most shocking showdown of the night goes down when Sasha tries to make small talk with Rosita, who replies with the shade of a thousand black holes: “What the hell are you telling me for? We both had sex with the same dead guy. Doesn’t make us friends.” Whoa! Didn’t they recently exchange a knowing look not that long ago that suggested they were all good? Maybe Rosita is just salty because every guy she sleeps or flirts with ends up butchered by Negan. Speaking of Neags, he makes a cameo via walkie talkie as the A-towners head home and hear his eulogy for Fat Joey. (“Things will not be the same now that he’s dead. Without Fat Joey, Skinny Joey is just … Joey. So it’s a goddamn tragedy.”) Then, wouldn’t ya know it, the gang discovers an elaborate herd trap rigged by the Saviors that just happens to fulfill Daryl’s shopping list: a steel cable rigged with dynamite and RPGs. Somehow Rosita has bomb-disarming skills (are we ever going to get her backstory?) and so the clock starts ticking. While they scramble to load up without blowing up, the Saviors are headed to A-town in search of Daryl as a massive herd of fleshbags is closing in. The payoff is epic: a mass walker slaughter as Rick and Michonne turn two cars and a steel cable into a zombie John Deere, mowing down hundreds of undead. That victory isn’t enough to make Rick smile, of course. Even with all those boomsticks, he knows they’re still too low on manpower and firepower to take on the Saviors. Hey Tara, perhaps it’s time to mention all the single ladies you met? The ones with the guns and sniper skills? Making matters worse, a visit from the Saviors ends with mass property damage and an ominous warning: Negan’s mustachioed henchman suggests that if they ever find Daryl, Rick should “keep that hatchet handy … and it won’t turn out the way it did for your boy.” Day-um. One-armed Daryl would have a tough time riding that hog and loading a crossbow. For some reason, Aaron risks his relationship and everyone risks their lives looking for AWOL Gabe at zombie lake. Rick spots a track, then — boom! — a band of camo-wearing, arms-bearing no-nonsense types surround them, guns drawn. For a second, I thought they were the women of Oceanside, but there are dudes in this posse. Instead of sweating some more, Rick smiles, finally. These aren’t enemies in his mind — they’re recruits. Imagine how tickled he’ll be when he meets the gals with guns and that nasty little brat who spit at Tara?

Julie Jacobson/Associated Press People representing opposing positions hold up signs during a demonstration at Battery Park organized by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society to mark a National Day of Jewish Action for Refugees on Sunday in New York. By Liz Robbins and Caitlin Dickerson / The New York Times NEW YORK — Federal immigration officials arrested more than 600 people across at least 11 states last week, law enforcement officials said Sunday. It remained unclear whether the actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were part of continuing operations to round up unauthorized immigrants with criminal convictions or a ramping-up of deportations by the Trump administration. President Donald Trump proclaimed on Twitter early Sunday: “The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!” But Gillian Christensen, acting press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said, “The focus of these targeted enforcement operations is consistent with the routine, targeted arrests carried out by ICE’s Fugitive Operations Teams on a daily basis.” The contradiction heightened a swelling fear among immigrants and their advocates. Immigration advocates said many immigrants are now afraid to send their children to school and afraid to go to church or work or the hospital. Panicked rumors spread as quickly as the truth. For supporters of Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, the new and broader approach was welcome news. “The main thing is to send the message that the immigration laws are actually being enforced again,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for tighter controls on immigration. Forty people were detained in the New York City area. At least in that area (including Long Island), fewer people were arrested than during an Obama administration enforcement sweep in August, when 58 people were arrested. The New York operation was planned one week ago and was part of a national action that was planned several weeks ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said. “New York was late to the game,” said an agency official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because details about who had been detained were still being learned. The official said the arrests had not been impromptu and had been planned around individuals’ routines, adding that a fuller account would be available today. “All these people are in violation of some sort of immigration law,” the official said, adding that some of their convictions included rape and aggravated assault. “We’re not going out to Wal-Mart to check papers — we know who we are going out to seek.” The Obama administration was especially active in deporting unauthorized immigrants, most notably in 2012, when 409,849 people were deported. In 2015, Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the arrests of more than 2,000 people nationwide in one week, targeting criminals. And the Obama administration was still sweeping up low-priority immigrants last summer. Nevertheless, Steven Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition, said last week’s action was worrisome because it seemed to be only the beginning. “It really doesn’t matter if it’s business as usual from ICE’s perspective — at some point, we know that they will start to ramp up enforcement activity,” Mr. Choi said in an interview. He added that a Jan. 25 executive order from the president about ensuring public safety included the bolstering of the immigration force. Mr. Trump’s executive order also vastly expanded the group of immigrants considered priorities for deportation, including those without criminal records. When asked if the recent operations had incorporated the new priorities, a Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because operations were continuing, said, “The president has been clear in saying that DHS should be focused on removing individuals who pose a threat to public safety, who have been charged with criminal offenses, who have committed multiple immigration violations or who have been deported and re-entered the country illegally.” Immigration officials earlier in the weekend acknowledged that authorities had cast a wider net than they would have last year, as the result of Mr. Trump’s executive order. The Trump administration is facing a series of legal challenges to that order, and on Thursday lost a court battle over a separate executive order to temporarily ban entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries, as well as by refugees. A top White House aide not only praised the surge in deportations Sunday but also renewed support for Mr. Trump’s embattled immigration order. Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s chief policy adviser, said the president will do “whatever we need to do, consistent with the law, to keep this country safe.” About 160 foreign nationals were recently arrested in six counties in the Los Angeles area, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials. An additional 200 were arrested last week in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. And about 200 were arrested across Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Wisconsin. Among those arrested were a Salvadoran gang member and a Brazilian drug trafficker, officials said. At least some of the rumors circulating on social media over the weekend proved to be false, including reports of raids in Jackson Heights, Queens, and in Huntington Station on Long Island. Similarly, immigration advocates in Kansas City, Mo., were on alert after hearing rumors that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents planned to arrest people who were on their way to worship Sunday. “Absolutely not!” Ms. Christensen, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, said. “That is completely false and an example of the many kinds of irresponsible, baseless fearmongering we’ve been seeing.” Through a statement from his spokeswoman, Rosemary Boeglin, Mayor Bill de Blasio tried to reassure New York City’s immigrants Sunday. “New Yorkers should rest assured that city officials, including the NYPD, will never ask about your immigration status, and the NYPD will never become immigration enforcement agents,” Ms. Boeglin said. New York is a sanctuary city, which means that it generally does not comply with requests by immigration authorities to hold unauthorized immigrants who have committed low-level crimes. Mr. Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding for such cities. On Long Island, activity by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had not yet reached the level of the large-scale enforcement seen under the George W. Bush administration. In one week in 2007, 170 people were arrested in Nassau and Suffolk counties, said Pat Young, program director of the Central American Refugee Center on Long Island. “At least so far, it’s important to know that in the New York area, we haven’t had checkpoints; we haven’t had sweeps,” he said. “They are taking place at homes.” Mr. Young said the “contradictory messages” of the president’s Twitter post and the immigration agency’s statements had stirred additional anxiety in the immigrant community.

Feb 12, 2017, 20:00 ET Share this article KELOWNA, British Columbia, February 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Marapharm Ventures Inc. (OTCQB: MRPHF) subsidiary, Marapharm WA has entered into an agreement to purchase 13.6 acres of industrial, highway frontage property located a few minutes south of the Canadian border for $4.2 million US. The transaction should close on or before February 28, 2017. Previously, on June 16, 2016, the Company announced that it had concluded a deal for a lease of a 30,000 square foot building and an option to purchase 13.6 acres of industrial property located in Whatcom County, Washington State. Further, on August 17, 2016, Marapharm announced that Marapharm WA had closed on the purchase of the assets of a 30,000 square foot operating tier 3 marijuana cultivation and processing facility, located in Washington State and on September 27, 2016 and November 1, 2016 provided updates with regard to the Washington operations. Marapharm has been making lease payments on the property and has chosen to act on the option to purchase the land. The 13.6 acres is appropriately zoned for Washington States I-502 marijuana cultivation and processing requirements. There are currently multiple buildings on the property, including the 30,000 square foot building with marijuana cultivation and processing licenses, a 9,190 square foot truck wash building, a 7,200 square foot mechanic shop, a 2208 square foot office building and large sheds. Wal-Mart presently uses an area of the property for truck and trailer parking. There is ample room for further development. To view the property, go to http://www.marapharm.com and look at the images under Marapharm Washington. "Marapharm WA plans to develop the property for cultivation, processing and research purposes, with the intention of creating a Cannabis Campus. We will continue to renovate the buildings which are presently in use, as well as, develop and build new structures as required. Since legalization, sales of marijuana products in Washington are more than $1 billion and taxes for the State are more than $250 million. This is a booming sector."Linda Sampson, Marapharm CEO.

The move from the Derbyshire-based company comes after the Walmart-owned retail giant introduced ready meals based on the firm's diet plan. Asda introduced its Slimzone range of 13 frozen meals and meat products last month, the Derby Telegraph reports. And the supermarket chain, which operates multiple stores in Birmingham and across the West Midlands, claims the products are free to enjoy in terms of calorie intake when following the Slimming World Extra Easy eating plan. Slimming World has its own range of products in Iceland, though, and has now taken action to ask Asda to remove Slimming World trade marks from the range. The firm believes the supermarket is using them "unlawfully". Read More Revealed: The cupboard or the fridge? Where foods REALLY belong A statement from Slimming World said: "After careful consideration and on the advice of our legal team, Slimming World has this week taken action to ask Asda to remove our trade marks from their range of Slimzone meals. "We believe that Asda are unlawfully using our much loved and much respected name and trade marks on their meals (that's Slimming World, Extra Easy and Free), and are trading on the back of our brand's reputation, which we've built and nurtured over 47 years. "We've worked hard over the years to earn the trust and confidence of our Consultants, our members and the UK and Irish public – and maintaining that trust and confidence is at the heart of our decision. "At the same time, we have decided that we won't be adding the Slimzone products to our official nutrition database." The Asda Slimzone range The statement adds: "We are unable to give an accurate value for them and by our calculations from the very limited information we've been able to obtain, a number of the meals could not be designated Free. "Although we asked Asda to let us have a more detailed breakdown of the ingredients used, they have not supplied those details and we have put on hold any decision about whether or not to include the meals in our official database. "We know that this news will be frustrating to some members and we are truly sorry for the disappointment it will cause. "The situation is beyond our control. "The case is now in the hands of a judge and we won't be able to comment further on the meals themselves until we know the outcome of the case." Read More Best online supermarket deals in Birmingham: How to save money at Asda, Tesco and Morrisons When Asda launched the Slimzone range it said it had identified a gap in the market to "make it both easier and cheaper for customers who want to keep themselves on track with a controlled weight loss programme". It is selling the frozen ready meals and products for £2.50 each – 50p cheaper than Slimming World's own brand in Iceland. Asked for a response to Slimming World's legal action, an Asda spokeswoman said: "Our customers have told us that saving money and leading a healthy lifestyle is a priority and that is why we developed our Slimzone range for them. "We're confident in Slimzone and our customers seem to love it too. "We've shared a full list of ingredients for the Slimzone meals to help our customers make up their own minds."

The victim told police she was using her car keys to open boxes, then set them down as she stocked shelves on Jan. 25. Police said she noticed a man and a woman watching her work. At some point, she went to use her keys again and realized they were gone. Fearing the keys had been stolen by the man and woman, she went to the parking lot and saw them driving away in her vehicle. The woman ran to the vehicle and jumped on the hood, police said. The driver nearly hit two other vehicles and the victim jumped off the car, police said. The woman was not injured. The stolen vehicle was recovered later that day in Aurora. However, the woman had left her purse in her vehicle while she was working. One of the suspects used a credit card to make purchases at the Target store in Glendale, police said.

Though that didn’t work out, we kept in touch and eventually, I ended up joining his company in India.” That company was NPM Technologies and Louis is currently the marketing consultant there. It has been almost three years and he is more than happy that his job landed him a place in the roller coaster ride called India. “I come from a small town and Bengaluru was the first big city in my life. For the first one year, I was constantly amazed — both by the good and the bad things.” While traffic, rash driving and pollution are the cons that he lists out, Louis is more garrulous when it comes to voicing his love for the city. “One of the things that impressed me was the number of small shops one can see on the streets. Back home, we have a Walmart and that’s it. There is no space for smaller shops. So the spirit of entrepreneurship I saw here amazed me.” Apart from that, Louis likes the younger crowd seen here and the enthusiasm they bring with them. “Whenever I go out and meet new people, we always have so many interesting conversations. I get the impression that the youngsters are genuinely interested in solving the problems that plague India.” Expressing his belief that Bengaluru was doing quite well for a big city with the resulting associated issues, Louis says that he is also a fan of the vibrant night life and many cultural performances one can experience here. “There is always something to do. You can never get bored here,” he says. But the lure of the hometown is omnipresent and he makes it a point to spend at least one month at home every year, with his parents and siblings. “They are what I miss the most about home. All of them are in the same place and get to hang out together,” he says and adds, “I also miss the peace and quiet of my town. It is a small place with few people; I can walk for half an hour without seeing anyone. There is a easy access to nature; something that is lacking in overcrowded India with its constant ruckus in the background.” But other than that, he doesn’t have any complaints about the time spent here, except for the turbulent few weeks of demonetisation in November last year. “I don’t have a bank account here due to some visa regulations. So my salary gets deposited to my account in Canada and I withdraw large sums at one go,” he says. “When you take into account factors like bank fee, ATM fee, currency conversion charges and so on, it makes sense to withdraw lump sum amounts. So when that cap of Rs 2000 was imposed, I went without money for a long period of time. My girlfriend was pretty much paying all the bills,” he says with a laugh. But all that is a matter of the past and now life is back to normal. Weekends are eagerly awaited luxuries that are spent with friends and colleagues. “I hang out with my two Canadian colleagues. Or I go watch a movie with my girl, grab a drink or simply just take a leisurely stroll in one of the numerous parks in the city,” says Louis, who says his favourite spots in Bengaluru include the microbreweries. “I especially like ‘Windmills Craftworks’ in Whitefield; it is worth the long drive to the place. I also like ‘The Biere Club’ and ‘Arbor Brewing Company’ here.” Ask him about the food and Louis says he is more than happy with the offerings here. “Bengaluru has all types of food you could possibly want to eat. Never has it happened that there was a specific food craving that I couldn’t fulfil. And there are a variety of options for different budgets as well.” So were there no teething troubles (pun intended)? “There were. I knew nothing about Indian food before I came here, except for ‘Butter chicken’, but I adjusted to the spice levels and curries very quickly. In fact, the first one year I was here, I went out to eat almost all the time. But that has changed now. My girlfriend (who is from Pune, by the way) cooks at home and I just love that food,” he says with a satisfied laugh.   Tweet Go to Top Videos Beauty in the Sky: Aero India begins...

Arkansas will join 38 other states and the District of Columbia where Amazon has relented after years of resisting efforts to collect taxes in states where it doesn't have a physical presence, according to The Associated Press, Amazon spokeswoman Jill Kerr made the announcement and declined to elaborate on the move. Russellville Mayor Randy Horton said it was not only good news, but wonderful news and would give the city some relief. The City Council approved the 2017 budget of $12.44 million with the difference between anticipated revenues and expenses projected at less than $80. "Awesome," Finance Director Jerry McKaughan said. "That will be a big plus for the city, I can promise you. We won't see anything until June. It will be interesting to see how that plays out." It's too soon to know how much additional tax revenues it will mean for Russellville, but state lawmakers said Amazon's decision could generate as much as $32 to $100 million annually for the state. McKaughan provided one example. "If Russellville gets $1 million in retail sales over Amazon, 5 percent of that is $50,000 in tax revenues," McKaughan said, adding local shoppers spend $7 million a month in Russellville." Horton and McKaughan have followed proposed bills in the state House and Senate that would force Amazon and other online companies that do not have a physical presence in Arkansas to begin collecting sales tax. The House passed a bill 52-46 that would require online companies to tell Arkansas customers they owe the state sales tax and provide a list to finance officials of purchases made by residents. Republican state Sen. Jake Files told the AP that he planned to move forward with his proposal, because it's still needed to recover funds from other out-of-state companies. "I think it's a good move for fairness, but it doesn't complete the fairness circle," he said. His measure is modeled after a 2016 law in South Dakota, where officials last month said Amazon agreed to begin collecting state and local sales taxes on purchases. The state House bill is modeled after a Colorado law that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand last year. Both proposals had the backing of Bentonville-based Wal-Mart but faced opposition from conservative groups such as Americans for Tax Reform. To avoid collecting taxes, Amazon historically relied on a 1992 Supreme Court decision that banned states from forcing out-of-state retailers to collect taxes where they don't have a physical presence, according to the AP. But the company collected sales taxes this winter in at least 10 states where it hadn't previously. Oklahoma announced last week that Amazon would begin collecting sales taxes starting next month. The decision could raise hopes about Arkansas' finances. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told several state agencies last week to prepare for possible budget cuts after finance officials said the state's revenue was $57 million below forecast. Hutchinson has also said that he'd like any additional revenue from online sales to go toward further cutting Arkansas' income tax. Hutchinson last month signed into law a measure that cut the state's income tax by $50 million and formed a task force to recommend further cuts before the 2019 legislative session," according to the AP. "The announcement from Amazon to start the sales tax collection for Arkansas in March is laudable and good news for the state," Hutchinson said Friday. "This step by Amazon has been voluntary and reflects the new landscape in which retailers recognize the practicality and fairness of sales tax being treated equally between online sales and in person store sales. This decision also shifts the responsibility of sales tax payment from the customer to the retailer at the time of checkout -- providing further clarity and efficiency to the current and often misunderstood Arkansas law. "As everyone knows, lowering our state's income tax rate has been a priority of mine from day one. This strengthened revenue stream will allow us to continue to make progress in cutting the income tax rate, making Arkansas more competitive with our surrounding states, and putting money back into the pockets of hardworking Arkansans." Horton said following a City Council meeting last week that online sales increased eight percent two years ago and probably 8-12 percent last year. "We're guessing that's probably costing the city $400,000 a year, $450,000," Horton said. "It's also happening on the one-cent county sales tax that we get 42 percent of. "Our budget concerns are legitimate. This could do us a lot of good and give us time to hopefully bring on more retail. If all of our plans and all of the stuff we're trying to get finished comes through, that will bide us a little bit more time." Horton said the city last week requested a price quote on a special census from the U.S. Census Bureau. Students at Arkansas Tech University are counted at their home towns during the regular census every 10 years, and a special census could mean more state turnback funds. "That could add 8,000 or so people to the credit we get for the census," the mayor noted. "That could give us another $100,000 to $150,000 for the General Fund. We work constantly on that budget thing. We watch it really, really close. "There's just no breathing room in our budget. Every city in Arkansas is having issues with the same thing."

 How Amazon’s payments service could solve its biggest weakness against PayPal Eugene Kim Feb. 12, 2017, 10:30 AM 5,890 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon CEO Jeff BezosGetty/Drew Angerer Amazon has tried for years to grow Amazon Payments, but the results have been mixed so far. The service, which allows customers to make online purchases using the information stored in their Amazon accounts, saw 33 million users last year, up 43% year-over-year, while doubling its total payment volume. But despite its growth, Amazon Payments is still not available at some of the largest online retailers, including Walmart or Target, giving up a huge chunk of the market to other payment vendors, like PayPal (which now has roughly 200 million users). Amazon's biggest weakness against other standalone payment providers is that big online retailers see Amazon as a competitor and fear they might be sharing important sales data by adopting its payments service. It's why a lot of merchants are still hesitant about Amazon Payments, despite the  roughly 300 million accounts stored in Amazon.com. So what can Amazon do to expand its payments service? According to Andreessen Horowitz's investor Alex Rampell, that fear of Amazon monitoring data is likely not going to go away anytime soon, even though Amazon denies those accusations. That means Amazon will have to become more creative with its approach. “Amazon Payments has tremendous amount of potential. But it has to be a little more innovative to make it more attractive and more compelling to consumers," Rampell told Business Insider. Rampell, who's also cofounded payment service startup Affirm with PayPal cofounder Max Levchin, gave the following suggestions for Amazon Payments to get to the next level: Go for the long-tail: Instead of targeting the top 100 online merchants, partner with the next million online retailers, who don't view Amazon as a foe but a friend. In most cases, they're likely already sellers on Amazon's marketplace, making it easier to partner up. He sees companies like Uber or Instacart as good possibilities too, because they're not direct competitors. "A lot of the top 100 merchants, I don’t expect them to add amazon anytime soon. The next million is where Amazon should do well," Rampell said. Leverage Amazon's retail service: Create a distributed shopping cart by offering discounts if the customer pays through Amazon Payments and spends a certain amount on Amazon.com. For example, the Gogo in-flight wifi service could give a $5 discount to Amazon Payment users, only if they also spend $100 on Amazon.com. "This is a cool example of what they could do both as a retailer and effectively as a payment company," Rampell said. Efficiently served market Most investors seem to agree Amazon Payments has huge upside. The 300 million or so Amazon accounts is a huge market to tap in to. In fact, RBC Capital's analyst Mark Mahaney previously called it an "underappreciated" part of Amazon, pointing out that it already owns a sizeable enough market share to potentially become the next big revenue driver for the company. But Mahaney is not convinced Amazon is ready to double down in Payments, and may decide instead to invest in other areas, like its grocery delivery or shipping logistics businesses. It's perhaps why we still haven't heard much about it, despite Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos having told the team to "move faster" nearly three years ago. "The one challenge here to whether this really becomes the fourth pillar for Amazon is that it’s already a reasonably efficiently served market," Mahaney said.

Wrong! Last year, Ivanka Trump’s company alerted fashion writers to promote her $10,800 bracelet. CBS News i By TIMOTHY L. O’BRIEN tobrien46@bloomberg.net LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story We can all thank Melania Trump for giving us a clearer sense of what she and her family are looking for from their stay in the White House. In court papers the first lady filed on Monday as part of a libel lawsuit against the parent company of the Daily Mail, she said that the British tabloid and website, by falsely reporting that she had once worked as a prostitute, caused the her to miss “major business opportunities” and “multimillion-dollar relationships.” The lawsuit, first reported by the New York Post on Tuesday evening, said Trump’s missed deals would have involved such products as “apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, haircare, skincare and fragrance.” Melania Trump’s role as first lady to President Donald Trump would have offered her a “once-in-a-lifetime” opportunity to cash in on such deals, the lawsuit noted, but the reputational damage done by the Daily Mail had disrupted those plans. Amid a little swirl of social media attention for the case, her spokespeople said that reporters and others had misinterpreted the language in the suit and that the first lady had “no intention” of trying to profit from her White House role. Fortunately for another Trump, the president’s daughter Ivanka, nothing yet seems to have unwound similar opportunities afforded by being a member of one of the world’s most famous families, with regular access to two of the world’s most powerful men (her father and her husband, Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to the president). Shortly after Donald Trump was elected, Ivanka’s eponymous accessories company drew criticism for aggressively marketing jewelry she had sported during a “60 Minutes” interview about her and her father’s White House plans. More recently, Ivanka has stated that she would part ways with the Trump Organization and her own business by moving to Washington and taking a “leave of absence” from the companies. But as ProPublica reported last week, she has yet to make public documentation proving that she has formally left her businesses. Meanwhile, she has invited titans of industry for dinner at her Washington home, where the guests included the chief executive of Walmart. Ivanka’s clothing line is sold in Walmart stores, and Walmart has an interest, inevitably, in a number of decisions that the Trump White House will make, including corporate tax rates, trade agreements and labor regulations. The taint of possible self-dealing that clings, vaguely, to Ivanka’s comings and goings is a step more pronounced with her husband, Jared Kushner. Privy to innermost White House decisions, he has yet to effectively distance himself from the Kushner family’s real-estate operations (he simply moved his assets into a trust controlled by a less-than-disinterested party, his mother). And then we come to the Trump patriarch himself, who hasn’t released his tax returns or truly separated himself from the Trump Organization’s business affairs. By these decisions, Trump, who isn’t subject to federal conflicts-of-interest laws, has ignored decades of Oval Office tradition meant to reassure the public that the president — unlike his wife — isn’t looking for “multimillion-dollar relationships” in the White House. For students of good government, Melania Trump’s lawsuit does have an upside: the discovery process. Since she is seeking at least $150 million in damages stemming from missed business opportunities, the lawyers representing the Daily Mail should eventually avail themselves of their discovery powers to secure each and every email, communique and document about White House business prospects that the Trump parents and children discussed. They should also subpoena the Trump family’s tax returns and banking records while they’re at it. If President Trump isn’t inclined to release his tax returns or be more transparent about his business dealings, then maybe the courts can help him along. Timothy L.

The Shadow knows!” Jerome Freitas, a retired state Department of Transportation worker who is now better known as “Da Shadow,” since 2004 has been meeting with government representatives about problems he has discovered or that have been reported to him, and reporting the county’s responses. Lihue Why is the “no parking” restriction on Rice Street during rush hour not enforced? Especially in front of the Salvation Army and Kauai Beer Company. The Kauai Police Department enforces all traffic laws to the best of its ability. If the public feels there are particular areas of concern, the department will happily work with the community to increase enforcement where needed. Who is responsible for clearing the vacant lot between Walmart and Wilcox Hospital? Does the county have the authority to require a landowner to clean their vacant lot for health and safety reasons? This property is owned by the Harry & Jeanette Weinberg Foundation. The owners would be responsible for any landscaping maintenance on this property. Yellow caution tape has been used to replace some of the chains that border the Japanese Garden on the Historic County Building lawn and the chains have not been replaced for months. Can the yellow caution tape be removed and replaced with permanent chains? Yes, the Parks and Recreation Department will repair these chains. What is the status of the Kapaia Swinging Bridge? Over the years, the county has worked closely with the Kapaia Foundation to determine the best course of action for the Kapaia Swinging Bridge. We are currently working on transferring the bridge to the foundation, to allow this organization to be the stewards of this site. Islandwide Who is responsible for trimming trees that are growing from private property onto county property? Private property owners are responsible for maintaining their own landscaping. Kapaa When will the concrete blocks at the location of the former Kapaa Police Substation be removed? The county will remove the concrete footings to the old Kapaa Substation by the end of this month. ••• Jerome Freitas can be reached at theshadow96751@gmail.com or 635-3528.

I just ran into a hole about basketball size on the side of the road as I passed an oncoming car. Drivers are forced to drive in the middle of the road because the side of the road is so unsafe and unstable, full of potholes and crumbling away. It has been this way for years with patches that last only a short while. It is getting to be a dangerous road. A neighbor had a bad accident after losing control and hitting a tree.

By Erin Keane / Salon February 11, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: lev radin / Shutterstock.com Ivanka Trump is not having a great February. Despite scrambling to the press to take credit for the scuttling of a barbarous anti-LGBT executive order that had been floating around President Donald Trump’s offices, waiting for just the right devastating smirk from Anderson Cooper to find a hospitable berth in the president’s damaged mind, Ivanka’s personal and professional brand took a major hit when Nordstrom announced it would not continue to carry her apparel line. The anti-Trump boycott movement Grab Your Wallet took credit, and Nordstrom levied the only sick burn a Trump can truly feel: “Low sales.” Having your allegedly prestigious brand dumped by Nordstrom and, as is now the case for her jewelry line, Neiman Marcus, is not good for a woman of Ivanka’s stature. But — for now — she’s still stocked in Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s and Lord and Taylor, perfectly respectable runners-up, as well as Amazon and its subsidiary Zappos. She could keep making money off her sensible flats for years to come. But discount marts T.J. Maxx and Marshall’s ordering their employees to chuck her wares into the gen pop racks? That’s a flat rejection from a safety sorority. And when Belk, a Southern department store chain that could not be more synonymous with Red State Hair, 86-ed the Ivanka line, things really got real in the land of lady-business wear. Sad! There’s no such thing as divorcing your politics from your consumption — every rural American who saw their Main Street devoured by a Walmart knows this. The only thing I know about the Woolworth’s brand is that four African-American college kids in ties sat down at its lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960 and demanded their humanity be recognized in the only way a capitalist system can and will. That lunch counter sit-in spawned a wave of similar ones across the South, and associated boycotts cost the company about $1.6 million in today’s dollars. The desegregation of lunch counters followed. In America, money talks. (Unfortunately, it also tweets in all-caps.) That women might think twice about buying an Ivanka outfit right now is not surprising. I once recoiled physically from a pair of shoes because they were “designed” by a celebrity whose image I did not see aligning with my own, a decision with a mere $79.95 and my own dumb pride, not the tacit approval of an authoritarian regime, hanging in its balance. Ivanka’s lifestyle brand, designed to be so non-controversial and non-threatening that it might as well not even exist, has now become synonymous with an administration seemingly hell-bent on discriminating against our most vulnerable, helping sick people die faster, and maybe starting World War III before anyone manages to change the password on the president’s phone. Who wants to cop to wearing that look? Trumpsters are fighting back online, but few of the Ivanka defenders appear to be legitimately dedicated customers, and not only because they’re secretly teen boys from Macedonia. Ivanka has a problem because no there there to defend — her designs lack distinction. As long as Banana Republic doesn’t hire Sean Spicer as its spokesmodel, cubicle-crawling America will be able to clothe itself for the work week if her line disappears tomorrow. Ivanka’s wearables are economically vulnerable because they are needed by none, and now coveted by few. Take the Ivanka Trump Soho Solutions Work Tote with Battery Charging Pack. It comes in three colors of leather; it’s fine. Looking at one online, it appears to be polished, professional and functional, and if the stitching is decent and the hardware can stand up to a year’s worth of weekday wear, it’s not a bad buy. It’s also utterly generic. This bag says nothing about its owner except “I want people in the office to stop mistaking me for an intern.” Say what you want about Kellyanne Conway’s bonkers style, but at least she has some. Up until now, this has been the core strength of Ivanka Trump™ — and I don’t just mean the business strategy that makes her Hettie heels indistinguishable from every other knock-off Aquazzura at the mall. While Daddy Trump received his rage-love injections on the Cheeto Circus Rally Circuit, Ivanka’s job was to act as a blank canvas — or a blush crepe sheath, at least — upon which the female and non-caveman electorate could project their last-ditch hopes for reasonable human leadership. What Ivanka and her father likely didn’t bank on was that her utility to Daddy’s more reluctant supporters — the superficial proof that he hadn’t screwed up every last thing he ever touched in his life — was dependent on her continuing to shine professionally and personally through the storm of excrement swirling around his Oval Office. The shit has hit the proverbial cap-sleeved blouse now, and #WomenWhoWork are apparently not having it. What Ivanka must realize is that she isn’t really selling floral knit shells and A-line dresses anymore, at least not to the #BuyIvanka crowd. She’s selling them a proxy to her father, and they’re supporting her with a MAGA chorus of janky memes, not shoe receipts. The funny thing about products designed to appeal to everyone is that they are either bulletproof, by virtue of defining or redefining the standard — Starbucks, Coca-Cola, Target, Netflix, Budweiser, Taylor Swift — or they remain third-tier and if they disappear, nobody really cares or notices. You can’t convince Americans to boycott things they love without a strong reason, and you can’t make them be loyal consumers of crap they don’t want. The proof is in the latte foam: All of those brands I just mentioned, with the exception of Ms. Swift, have been the targets of recent conservative boycott threats. No Jesus on the cups? No guns in the store? Hiring refugees? #PourOutStarbucks! Allowing people to choose their own restrooms? #FlushTarget! A show called “Dear White People?” #CancelNetflix! A Super Bowl commercial celebrating many languages and ethnicities? #SiegPepsi! Has Coke apologized to Nazis? Are Starbucks employees trained to bless your Glock? Did Target set aside special potties “For Ted Cruz Only?” Not exactly. Forget the pointless “Hamilton” boycott — it’s not a boycott if you just can’t get tickets — the day a critical mass of suburban white people skip their Starbucks fixes to make a rhetorical point about things that have very little bearing on their overall health and happiness is the day that old guys in Make America Great Again hats say “no thanks” to a cold Bud because the company ran an ad celebrating a German dude’s financial success. Posturing online is one thing, but Macedonian teens run on Fanta, that “Iron Fist” trailer looks sick, and female Republicans in the Nordstrom demographic would probably rather vote for Hillary Clinton than cut up their charge cards forever over a wrap dress that looks like every other wrap dress on the racks. Ivanka 0, American Women emoji-100. As my colleague D. Watkins might say, congratulations, Ivanka, you played yourself. Humans might gravitate to material success and power, but they have no motivation to fight — or in the case of Americans, even mildly inconvenience themselves — for something that has no center. Ivanka believes in her own exceptionalism to the point of thinking that the actions of her father’s administration wouldn’t tarnish her, but an influential subset of American consumer now sees through the tasteful fabrics which don’t quite disguise the ugly reality. When you lie down with dogs, Ivanka, don’t be surprised when their fleas stick around.   Erin Keane is Salon's managing editor.             Share on Facebook Share         Share on Twitter Tweet Report typos and corrections to [email protected] '.         Comments Stay Ahead of the Rest Sign Up for AlterNet's Daily Newsletter EMAIL: + sign up for additional lists [x] Select additional lists by selecting the checkboxes below before clicking Subscribe: Rights & Liberties Education Drugs Economy Environment Labor Food World Politics Investigation Personal Health Water Media Stay Ahead of the Rest Sign Up for AlterNet's Daily Newsletter + select additional lists [x] Select additional lists by selecting the checkboxes below before clicking Subscribe: Rights & Liberties Education Drugs Economy Environment Labor Food World Politics Investigation Personal Health Water Media Enviro Newswire Enviro Newswire presented by   Best of the week Most Read Most Emailed Most Discussed On Reddit On Digg Robert Reich: The White House Mess Exposes Donald Trump's Long Con Robert Reich / RobertReich.org Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 07:11 Why Stephen Miller Comes Off as a D*ck Kali Holloway / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 19:52 Colbert Hilariously Roasts White House Adviser Stephen Miller's Lies Alexandra Rosenmann / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 04:28 'Morning Joe' Warns Trump Administration Could Be on the Brink of 'Total Meltdown' Alexandra Rosenmann / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Wed, 02/15/2017 - 07:04 Trump Flailing: The Story Behind the Story of Mike Flynn's Fall Jefferson Morley / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 06:09 'Morning Joe' Slams Trump Over Flynn Resignation: The Intel Community Has Struck Back Alexandra Rosenmann / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 07:12 Benjamin Netanyahu Is in Bed with the Trump Administration—Almost Literally Ben Norton / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 16:25 The 10 Most Galling Republican Responses to the Michael Flynn Scandal (So Far) Alexandra Rosenmann / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 11:54 Shadier Side to Trudeau's Sunny Ways Jordy Cummings / Le Monde diplomatique Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 07:54 Oliver Stone Delivers American Critique for the Ages During Berlin Award Ceremony Alexandra Rosenmann / AlterNet Displayed Publishing Date: Tue, 02/14/2017 - 08:10 Today's Top Stories Election 2016 A United States of Hate Has Exploded Under Trump Culture 15 Tips for Defeating the Trumps in Your Own Life There Is a Growing Movement Across the Legal Community to Plan a Nationwide Walkout Against Trump Trump Weaves a Bizarre Blend of Zionism and Fascism in Making a New Mideast Policy Human Rights Trump Wants to Bring Back Torture—For Thousands of Americans, It Never Went Away The Right Wing As White House Spirals Into Crisis, What Will Congress Do?

David (SMDC/ARSTRAT)February 13, 2017 Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Reddit Share on LinkedIn Share via Email 1 / 1 Show Caption + Hide Caption – Dr. Claudette Owens serves as the director of the Future Warfare Center Operations Directorate, U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command. (Photo Credit: Carrie E. David (SMDCARSTRAT)) VIEW ORIGINAL HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- Heroes come in many forms. Some create inventions that have revolutionized the United States and even the world. Some wear uniforms and protect America and its people. Another kind is the everyday hero. This type of hero seems to tackle all of life's challenges with kindness, understanding, and a smile and improve every situation. Dr. Claudette Owens is such a hero. She has served more than three decades as a Department of the Army civilian; raised three children through more than 30 years of marriage; serves multiple pastor roles at her church; experienced both overt and more subtle racism firsthand; and still focuses on loving and lifting others up. "Life is always bigger than us," Owens said. "We're not put here for ourselves. We're put here for everything and everybody else." Owens was born during the Civil Rights Movement in New Orleans, and raised in Southern Alabama's Frisco City by her adopted parents, Osia and Inez Carmichael. Her love of learning began early. She would accompany her mother on substitute teacher duty, and the young learner was reading by the age of 3. What also began early was her love of space and science. "I was the kid growing up during the space age, and I can remember standing out on my parents' back porch steps looking up at the sky like they did in (the movie Hidden Figures) trying to see if I could see the astronauts as they were going to the moon," Owens said. She became an accomplished student, doing so well that she received a full scholarship to the University of Alabama. However, a recruiter from Alabama A&M visited her town and discussed the advantages of Historically Black Colleges and Universities with her and what the up-and-coming city of Huntsville could offer. That conversation changed the course of her life. While working on her bachelor's degree in engineering at Alabama A&M, Owens met her future husband, Dr. Edward L. Owens. Married 34 years with three boys and three grandchildren, they pastor a Baptist church in Decatur together. Her husband is the senior pastor and Owens is the worship arts and music pastor and the family ministries pastor. After earning her degree in engineering technology, Owens started her career at the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center as a part-time technician, but instead of working in a lab, she delivered mail, though she is not sure why. "I used to cry, because people I had graduated with were going in the building with their briefcases going to do engineering work. I had to carry mail, and I was so hurt," Owens said. She soon moved to a co-op position while working on her second bachelor's degree in electrical computer engineering at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and in 1987 she found herself faced with job offers from AMRDEC, NASA and the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command. "I remember God saying, you could go back over there (AMRDEC). You know what's there. You could go with NASA, but all of them at NASA -- we were all the same age; we were all going to be fighting over promotions," Owens said. "Or you can go to SMDC." In May 1987, she joined the command working on advanced technology and became among the first young black female engineers at USASMDC/ARSTRAT. "I got to work on a lot of the technology that is now being used in a lot of our systems we have," Owens said. "My direct supervisor was Doyce Satterfield, and he said to me 'Well, we're working advanced technology, and I can see you're a young lady with a very bright mind. So, I've got two high goals we're going to set. 1) You're going to take my job one day. And 2) you're going to get your PhD.' The job I had at (Decision Support Directorate), that was his position, and he and his wife were at Alabama A&M when I marched across the stage to get my PhD in physics." Owens said one of the first, and favorite, projects she worked was virtual reality technology at SMDC's Advanced Research Center. Another passion about cyberspace and cybersecurity stemmed from her networks and communication security background. She even created a tiger team to coordinate efforts between the command's Future Warfare Center and Technical Center. The Tactical Operations Center, she said, is one of her most memorable programs. She said that they used to take demos to conferences, and a former colleague, Norven Goddard, had started working on a new one in 2001 that he had taken to a conference shortly before 9-11. Following 9-11, senior Army leaders called SMDC. Owens and her supervisors retrieved the TOC blueprints and shortly after, the TOC went into operation defending the National Capital Region. "That was probably the first time I ever got to see the reality of what we do and the importance of it," Owens said. "I knew about the missiles, but I'm not on the battlefield, so I didn't really get to see except for on the news what the Soldiers were exposed to, but this I got a chance to see." Owens currently serves as the director of SMDC's Future Warfare Center Operations Directorate, but whatever challenge she tackles, Owens said, she wants to be relevant and value-added. In addition to her scientific contributions, Owens is a frequent contributor during the command's special observances often sharing personal stories and uplifting messages. Sometimes she shares memories of growing up in segregated Jim Crow South Alabama, and sometimes she shares modern versions of a more subtle but pervasive type of racism. Owens recounted a recent situation where a woman in Walmart grabbed her purse and pulled it closer when Owens walked by. "I know as human beings we tend to demonize things that we don't understand. She didn't know me. If she had known me, she never would have done that. And some things are never going to change for some people, but we can't put everybody in the same box," Owens said. "Sometimes we see something go wrong with one culture or one person, and we immediately demonize the whole thing. "When we look at somebody and we demonize the whole thing, that's wrong. Even when my own people give their thoughts of the Civil Rights Movement, all you have to do is go back and look at the history -- there were black faces, white faces, Jewish faces, Baptist faces, Catholic faces, women -- everybody was a part of that, just like they're doing now. Yes, they were marching against some injustices that were done by the white race, but there were also white people who supported the civil rights movement and helped make sure that those injustices were undone," Owens said. "That's what we have to remember, that there's a balance. You can't demonize." Owens said she loves people and she extends a measure of grace and understanding to all she encounters. "I just want everybody to understand, African Americans are great people," Owens said. "We all fall short. We all make mistakes, but if we just start to, as Dr. King said, look at the person, look at the individual, look at the character. "That's what I teach my people at church: get the whole story. Part of the truth is still a whole lie."

The contrast between the two leaders on this issue could not be more stark. Trudeau is a progressive leader who understands that women are not a minority, but a critical part of any strong leadership team. When he took office in 2015, he named 15 women and 15 men to his Cabinet, intentionally creating an even split.   At the time, a reporter asked him why the gender balance was so important. “Because it’s 2015,” Trudeau explained. His answer, lengthier than “duh,” but more charming, quickly went viral. Trump’s Cabinet, meanwhile, harkens back to 1980. Of 22 appointees, four are women. Only two are high enough in the pecking order to even make it into the presidential line of succession: Betsy Devos was so grossly unqualified as education secretary that she almost didn’t gain the approval of the Republican-dominated Senate. Elaine Chao has real experience and was simple to recruit as transportation secretary ― she’s married to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). It’s as if Trump doesn’t even know where to find qualified women, Avivah Wittenberg-Cox noted in a recent piece for the Harvard Business Review. She runs a consulting company that helps big companies with gender equality. At Monday’s meeting, Trump tried to portray himself as a great supporter of women at work. It was “pinkwashing” ― paying lip service to gender equality while doing little to foster it ― at a new extreme. “Women, as you know, and I can say that from my past life, I had so many women executives, they were phenomenal, phenomenal, and really helped me, and it was really fantastic,” Trump said. “They play a tremendously important role, women in our economy.” You need only look at Trump’s Cabinet and inner circle to understand what he really thinks about women. “If he were truly enlightened leader who gets that women bring value, his team in the White House would reflect that,” Wittenberg-Cox told The Huffington Post. Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Trump and some of his men: Chief of staff Reince Priebus, Vice President Mike Pence, senior advisor Steve Bannon, Communications Director Sean Spicer and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. There are no women in Trump’s inner Cabinet ― the secretaries of defense, state, treasury and the attorney general are all white guys. A situation like that was last seen under Ronald Reagan.  Barack Obama appointed eight women to his Cabinet in his first term. Like Trump, George W. Bush appointed only four women in his first term, but to slightly higher-level positions. Bush’s choice of Colin Powell for secretary of state also increased diversity on this team by a hair. Trump and Reagan both nominated a single black person to their Cabinets ― both to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Wittenberg-Cox categorizes Trump as a “plodding leader” who doesn’t value women as independent players, but instead slots them into positions where they take on supportive, traditionally female roles.  The woman closest to the president (and not a relative), senior counsellor Kellyanne Conway, illustrates this well: She is sort of like a “babysitter/shrink/bear tamer,” Wittenberg-Cox said. Conway has a support role, not central to defense or security. She’s not in the Cabinet. At the highest levels of corporate America, you’ll often see a similar trend. Men dominate, taking most mission-critical roles. Women pepper the outer spheres of the circle. You’ll see women heading up human resources, or the legal department, or the diversity and inclusion team. More frustrating, a lot of these companies engage in pinkwashing. Walmart, which suffers from a lack of women in critical roles, sent its CEO to the White House talk about women in the workplace earlier this month. Audi, which has no women on its global management board, ran a Super Bowl ad about gender pay equality. This was more common 10 or 20 years ago, Wittenberg-Cox said, but has changed as more companies realize that women help strengthen the bottom line. If a majority of your customers are women, you need women on your team as a practical necessity. Plus, well, it’s 2017. Not at the White House. Look at Trump’s female Cabinet nominees. Two women are in the “outer cabinet.” Devos at the Education Department is 15th in line to succeed the president. Transportation Secretary Chao, one of the most experienced members of Trump’s administration, is 13th in the order of succession.  As ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley is not part of the line of succession. Nor is Linda McMahon, a billionaire who Trump named administrator of the Small Business Administration. None of these positions are core to the presidency or part of Trump’s most urgent agenda, which appears focused on security and the economy. None of Trump’s female appointees joined him at Monday’s roundtable discussion. Instead, Trump brought his daughter Ivanka, who seems to have taken on the unofficial role as spokesperson for all women in the Trump administration ― a supportive daughter just doing her part.   Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?

More than 600 people were arrested in at least 11 states, The New York Times reported. Related Headlines Here is every executive order Trump has signed Those detained included nearly 200 people apprehended in the Carolinas and Georgia, more than 150 in southern California and about 40 in New York, according to ICE officials. Trump took credit for the raids on Sunday, writing on Twitter that "the crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise."   The crackdown on illegal criminals is merely the keeping of my campaign promise. Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017   A Salvadoran gang member and a Brazilian drug trafficker were among those apprehended, The Associated Press reported. However, ICE officials told multiple news agencies that the immigration operations were planned before Trump took office. An ICE official who spoke to The New York Times on the condition of anonymity told the newspaper that the state's operation was "part of a national action that was planned several weeks ago," and focused on specific people. "All these people are in violation of some sort of immigration law," the unidentified official told The New York Times. "We're not going out to Walmart to check papers — we know who we are going out to seek." David Marin, ICE's field office director for enforcement and removal operations in greater Los Angeles, told the AP that the California operation was in its planning stages "before the administration came out with their executive orders." Trump signed a sweeping executive order in his first days in office that expanded on the groups of illegal immigrants whose deportations would take priority and to bolster the number of agents on the southern border. © 2017 Cox Media Group.

Photo Credit: Newsday/Alejandra Villa advertisement | advertise on newsday THE BOTTOM LINE Deportations and immigration bans can impose misery on families and friends. They can compromise businesses, communities and local economies. But they won’t make America white again. Guadalupe García de Rayos, 35, a mother of two American children, was arrested last week in Phoenix, Arizona, and deported to Mexico, which she left as a 14-year-old to travel illegally to the U.S. There was no public-safety rationale for her removal. But the president who defrauded students, cheated contractors and shattered democratic norms on his way to the White House is apparently a stickler for following rules. The deportation, over protests, was another shot in the federal government’s new war on immigrant communities. Its reverberations extend far beyond the 20 metro areas, including Phoenix, that are home to the majority of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Guadalupes can be found in unexpected places. Most Popular Editorial: Trump right to restart quest for peace Opinion: Two great political parties at risk Opinion: Trump takes on the bumble bee Opinion: Opening eyes to black male reality Opinion: In defense of long distance relationships Worthington, Minnesota, is a prairie town of 13,000 near the southwest corner of the state, just north of the Iowa line. It has a thriving little downtown spotted with restaurants and stores, and, from June to October, an open-air farmer’s market in the old Campbell Soup Company parking lot. OpinionOpinion: I’m a deplorable and glad I voted for Trump Along 10th Street, running through the center of the commercial district, the Top Asian Food and Deli features Asian, Spanish and African groceries, along with money-wiring services. Next door is El Mexicano #3, another grocery. Next to that is the El Mexicano restaurant, which is down the street from El Azteca and El Taco. City administrator Steve Robinson, a Worthington native, said that his 1978 graduating high school class had about 260 people. “Thinking back,” he said in a phone interview, “I believe there were four non-Caucasian classmates.” Immigrants began coming to Worthington from around the globe in the late 1980s, when the local pork-processing plant was expanding. The cultural transition was often excruciating. Natives, Robinson said, “were afraid to go to the grocery store because they were afraid they were going to be attacked.” advertisement | advertise on newsday Crime in Worthington is lower than in most comparable towns within a 150-mile radius, and myths about the dangers of immigrants are “really starting to wane,” Robinson said. It helps that immigrant businesses have revitalized a sinking downtown that seemed destined for destruction after a Walmart opened nearby. Today, the local JBS plant employs more than 2,000 people processing more than 20,000 hogs daily. Other businesses, including local farms, livestock transporters, veterinarians and Worthington’s downtown merchants, all benefit from the plant’s economic impact. OpinionDonald Trump editorial cartoons Not everyone in Worthington is in the U.S. legally. In 2006, federal immigration agents raided the pork plant (then owned by Swift Co.) as part of a nationwide crackdown and arrested more than 200 workers there. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports greater restrictions on immigration, estimated in 2009 that almost one-quarter of Swift plant workers nationwide were undocumented immigrants. (Some undocumented workers use stolen Social Security numbers to obtain work; many companies pretend not to know.) The pro-immigration Migration Policy Institute, working from U.S. Census data, estimates that, nationally, about 13 percent of the workforce in the meat-processing sector is unauthorized. Tweets from @sguzik/newsday-editorial-board Worthington is not a sanctuary city. It lacks the resources of Los Angeles or San Francisco. “We don’t care what your immigration status is,” Robinson said. “We will, however, cooperate with immigration officials.” If the feds come for local undocumented immigrants, there’s little place for them to hide. The city works with community groups to counsel local immigrants on how to deal with law-enforcement authorities. “We have done demonstrations to show people how to behave during a routine traffic stop,” Robinson said. “Many come from countries where the police have been the bad guys.” The 2006 raid unleashed a wave of fear through the town. The plant lost workers. The town lost residents. But the trauma didn’t stop Worthington’s transformation into a cultural polyglot. President Donald Trump’s multi-faceted campaign against immigrants is likewise futile. Deportations and immigration bans can impose misery on families and friends. They can compromise businesses, communities and local economies. But they won’t make America white again. “First, the racial minority population is growing more from natural increase than immigration,” said Brookings Institution demographer William Frey in an e-mail. “Second, the white population will start declining after the year 2025.” advertisement | advertise on newsday Robinson said more than 50 languages are now spoken in Worthington. Its diversity is a product not of coastal cosmopolitanism but of low wages paid for hard work. The town’s political leadership is still all white. But it probably won’t be for long. Asked if there were anything Trump’s immigration policies might do to alter Worthington’s trajectory, Robinson didn’t hesitate to answer: “Not at all.” Wilkinson writes editorials on politics and U.S. domestic policy for Bloomberg View.

Sign up Now. As in crazy short, in a very short period of time we have two very different companies looking at two very different ways to eliminate traffic. Tesla wants to tunnel under the ground to avoid traffic, while Uber wants to fly overhead. Transportation has been a tad static for the last 40 years or so, and that apparently is about to change big time, as some folks even are reconsidering lighter-than-air transport. This is just the start. There are amazing efforts cropping up all over the U.S., suggesting that we may be building a lot of things that truly are magical. I'll share my thoughts on this coming industrial revolution and close with my product of the week: a very advanced, almost pocketable drone that is small enough for inside and powerful enough to fly outside. The Death of Innovation Both transportation and advancement have a mixed history. At the beginning of the 20th century, we moved from horses to cars. Ford even created one of the most reliable airliners in the world and was well down the path toward creating a flying car. During the Great Depression, perhaps in response to an increase in regulations, advancements in personal transportation seemed to slow and become far more linear. Yes, cars in the 1960s were better than those in the 1930s -- but given that we'd come from horses, the speed of advancement was far slower. Air travel seemed to peak with the brief creation of supersonic transports, which proved uneconomical and unsafe. The current U.S. president, Donald Trump, is looking into why the next Airforce One is basically a plane that was designed back when Ronald Reagan was president and was considered obsolete in many ways even then. Largely because of fuel shortages and regulations (sound, environmental, safety) we hit a wall in the 1970s in all forms of transportation. Trains in the U.S. are kind of an international embarrassment, given that we once were the leader in rail technology. I still remember the $9M that California put into studies to determine that the monorail Walt Disney wanted to build to the airport, which was budgeted to cost just $3M, would be unprofitable. It was that kind of regulatory insanity that likely killed what once was the most innovative industry in the U.S. It seemed that after we made it to the moon, we just stopped pushing the envelope -- but that now seems to be changing, a lot. Innovation Is Coming Back?! I think what is going on, in part, is that a new breed is transforming the workforce -- people who haven't had it drummed into them that they couldn't do something different. They're not just filling entry positions, either. A large number of successful startups have come from trailblazers like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos who, rather than asking "why?" effectively are asking "why not?" It is fascinating that their ideas are all over the map. We suddenly are making advancements both above and below the ground. We are applying ever more intelligence to everything from toys to cars. The result is the emergence of what some are calling the "new industrial revolution." It is very difficult to see just how unprecedented this level of change is while we're in the middle of it. Consider this: In the 1990s Amazon started out as a bookseller in a garage in Seattle. Now it scares the crap out of Walmart. Google didn't even exist until 1998, but it now is arguably the most powerful company in the world. And then there is Facebook. Still, traditional industries like transportation were left alone until recently -- that is, until Tesla popped in, made GM's electric car efforts look foolish, and spun the auto market on its head. Now, giant car companies all over the world are working to catch up, and Musk isn't just running a car company. He has a solar energy company and a rocket ship company as well. Seriously, he has a rocket ship company, and he isn't alone -- Jeff Bezos has one too. Wrapping Up: Thinking out of the Box What's happening is that folks like Bezos and Musk are forcing other CEOs to step their game up a lot. For instance, Michael Dell decided to build one of the most powerful tech companies in the world and make it private. He's another guy who seems to be asking "why not?" and now his catch phrase is "go big or go home." It kind of makes you wonder what he'll do next. Nvidia basically is building artificial brains in a box, and even Microsoft is attempting to alter the way we view reality. This is the kind of competition that drives amazing change -- and new above ground and underground transportation systems are just the start. It isn't just transportation that is going nuts -- it's everything from the way we order and get products, to how we build them, to how we view and interact with the world -- and even which world we live on. (Yes, we are going to Mars.) This already has been an amazing decade, but what is even more amazing is that we likely are in the slow startup phase. What comes next will even be more amazing. Did I mention drone swarms?!? I think we should call this "the birth of magic," because what we'll be able to do in a few short years will seem like magic to those of us living today. I can hardly wait. Apparently I am building a drone air force. My latest acquisition is the Zerotech Dobby Pocket Drone. At $400 for a small drone, this is no cheap date -- but what makes it different is that is has the necessary hover sensors and a full 4K streaming camera. The small form factor of this drone and the fact that you can fold up the arms to make it pocketable (jacket pocket, that is -- this won't go in your pants) make it a unique offering for a fully featured drone. Zerotech Dobby Pocket Drone This is an indoor/outdoor offering, in that it is stable and easy enough to fly indoors (once you get the hang of it) but powerful enough to deal with wind, so you can fly it outside. If you set it up properly, it has core features like hover and automatic return home. Like most current generation mid-range drones, it uses WiFi and your phone or tablet for navigation. Like all small drones, battery life can be an issue, so you'll want several spare batteries, which charge off a USB-C cellphone charger. It has GPS positioning, so it knows where it is. It has a fixed camera -- not a gimbal camera -- so you don't get the stability of a fully professional product. However, those tend to be big and far harder to transport -- I know, I have two. In the end, if you want a good transportable mid-range drone that you can carry easily, the Zerotech Dobby Pocket Drone is my recommendation, and it's my product of the week.

Cheryl McMullen | Feb 13, 2017 Quest Resource Holdings Corp., a Colony, Texas-based waste management company owns no trucks, landfills or processing plants, but instead handles waste through subcontractors. Its focus is on developing strategies for businesses to reduce waste. The company provides businesses with management programs to reuse, recycle, and dispose of a wide variety of waste streams and recyclables with clients ranging from grocery stores and fleet companies to restaurants and manufacturers. Quest, through its subsidiaries, Quest Resource Management Group and Earth911, designs and manages waste programs and delivers digital resources for content and data for reducing waste. With an emphasis on reuse, recycling and proper disposal management, the programs are designed for regional and national customers to have a single point of contact for managing a variety of waste streams and recyclables. Quest also operates environmentally-based social media and online data platforms that contain information and instructions necessary to empower consumers and consumer product companies to recycle or properly dispose of household products and materials. Most recently, Quest set its sights on the construction and demolition industry. In January, Quest announced its new suite of construction site services handling C&D waste. Its new job site recycling and general requirement services combined with existing LEED project management and certification offerings provide a healthy program at each stage of the construction process. According to the U.S. Census Bureau of the Department of Commerce, private and public construction spending reached $1.18 billion for the first 11 months of 2016, the highest level since April 2006. The increase in spending on these construction sites, the company said, correlates with an increase in demand for project services, including site waste management.  “We have received numerous requests for services in the construction and demolition marketplace,” Quest CEO Ray Hatch says. “As a solution provider, we saw the need for a more streamlined process for construction project managers juggling multiple vendors to manage a variety of waste streams and other services on each job site. We are confident that our solutions will free up a considerable amount of time for managers on the job site.” The company says it is well positioned to capture a significant market share due to its national footprint experience, and cloud based service and reporting platform. Its new offerings are designed to enable clients to control cost, access waste disposal alternatives, streamline logistics and increase efficiencies both regionally and nationally. “We help construction site managers and construction executives make impactful, data-based business decisions,” Hatch says. The company provides a single source for job site and green building needs, and allows construction managers to focus on their building project goals, while Quest receives incoming requests, schedules and manages services, and provides LEED credit tracking and sustainability reporting. Quest’s construction offerings include temporary offices, storage containers, toilets and hand washing stations, water tanks and dumpsters. C&D waste and recycling services include solutions for materials such as wood, concrete, roofing, drywall, metal, plastic and blast media recycling as well as hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Last June, Quest’s subsidiary, Earth911.com, launched an enhanced recycling directory and a redesigned iRecycle App to make it easier for consumers to recycle materials. The company also offers a recycling directory, found at Search.Earth911.com. The recently redesigned site has made the tool more intuitive to search, with an improved user interface and a better back-end experience for recycling location owners. Food waste is another avenue the company has explored for growth. In addition to working with Walmart, in 2015, the company began work with natural and organic grocer Sprouts Farmers Market in California. Sprouts was expanding its food waste diversion services, bringing a comprehensive organics-recycling program to all of its California stores. The goal was announced ahead of mandatory state commercial organics recycling regulations requiring the retailer to recycle food waste by Jan. 1, 2017. With Quest the stores entered into a program that reduces food waste by diverting produce, dairy, bakery, bulk, deli and juice bar products that can't be sold or donated. It converts the waste into nutritional animal feed additives or compost, helping to prevent greenhouse gas emissions and reduce landfill waste. In addition to the solid waste and recycling programs for Sprouts’ stores, Quest developed custom online and in-store training to help educate and engage store associates to ensure the program’s success. The idea is to help as many businesses with as many waste streams as possible to grow Quest’s business and reduce waste on a national scale.

Pounds / Hearst Connecticut Media File Buy this photo Stratford-Bridgeport busing battle over magnet schools 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Bridgeport’s decision to charge out-of-district students at its magnet schools may strand Stratford students waiting for a bus ride to class. That’s according to letters sent to Stratford parents from Bridgeport — and from Stratford school officials this past week. Stratford officials notified parents last week they would no longer bus students to any tuition-charging magnet school. Stratford’s bill would be $576,000 for some 192 students. On Monday, Bridgeport fired back, saying it has and will continue to provide the transportation to students attending Discovery and Fairchild Wheeler magnet schools. “Since the inception of the magnet schools, Bridgeport has arranged and paid for the transportation of enrolled students from neighboring districts,” states a letter, which Bridgeport officials wanted distributed to Stratford magnet school students Monday. The letter goes on to say Stratford school officials sent out incorrect information. Bridgeport decided last spring to take advantage of a state law that allowed it to charge tuition to sending districts for its magnet schools. Some 18 school districts who together send 606 students to the city’s inter-district magnet schools are affected. More Information Not everyone on board Bridgeport decided last spring to take advantage of a state law that allowed it to charge tuition to sending districts for its magnet schools. Some 18 districts, which together send 606 students to the city’s inter-district magnet schools, are affected. At $3,000 a student, Bridgeport hopes to collect some $1.7 million in tuition, but districts are pushing back. At $3,000 a student, Bridgeport hopes to collect some $1.7 million in tuition. Many have vowed to fight, including Stratford, which has hired attorney Norm Pattis to look into the legality of the charge. Shelton school officials recently indicated they simply will not pay the $351,000 the district is expected to owe for students headed to Bridgeport magnet schools. Trumbull, meanwhile, included its $288,000 assessment in the budget proposal forwarded to the mayor. Also facing hefty bills are Milford, which is being charged $165,000; Fairfield, which was sent a $225,000 bill; and Monroe, to be assessed $93,000. Both Milford and Fairfield have factored the added cost into their 2017-18 budget plans. Parking lot bus stop The Bridgeport letter to Stratford students attending its magnet schools is signed by the city’s interim schools superintendent, Aresta Johnson. “I encourage you to consider the magnet schools as options for your children with the understanding that parents are not responsible for arranging transportation,” Johnson wrote. The letter Stratford parents received last week from Stratford officials says that — effective the 2017-18 school year — the town’s school district will no longer provide transportation to tuition-charging magnet schools. “This includes Discovery, Six to Six and Fairchild Wheeler Magnet Schools in Bridgeport,” said the letter, signed by Stratford education board Chairman James Feehan. Until now, Stratford students attending Bridgeport magnet schools have been picked up from their neighborhoods by Stratford school buses and dropped off — not at the magnet schools — but at Stratford or Bunnell High Schools. Bridgeport buses then collect those students to take them to their magnet schools. Next year, Stratford officials say its buses will no longer pick up city magnet school students on the first leg of the journey — and the town will also bar Bridgeport buses from picking up students at Stratford schools. “We have suggested Walmart and Hawley Lane shopping plazas as viable alternatives for pick up and drop off,” Clarence Zachary, chief operating officer for Stratford Schools said. “These changes will take effect next school year.” A polarizing issue Stratford officials also say they plan to stop bus service for Six to Six, a regional magnet school run not by Bridgeport, but by Cooperative Educational Services. It will keep bus service — at least half way — for the Regional Center for the Arts, a part-time program run by CES. Stratford will give kids a lift to their high schools but not to RCA, which is an afternoon program. Zachary said his district has yet to discuss the matter with CES. Under state law, districts can’t keep students from opting for magnet schools. Stratford officials have indicated they won’t stand in the way but won’t make it easy. The district has indicated it won’t let magnet school recruiters into their buildings and won’t make the magnet school option very noticeable on the district website.

Hotels know that online marketing is crucial, yet they take a back seat on innovation. NB: This is an analysis by Vikram Singh, CEO of Evision. Most of the hotel owners/managers I’ve met have been hesitant to do much more than hire an outside agency to handle all things digital. Properties lack the time, budget, knowledge or even interest to get more involved. There is nothing wrong with this – it’s often a frantically busy sector to operate in. Yet change is in the air again; online marketing for hotels continues to evolve at pace. So even if you’re not one of those typical hands-off agency clients, there are some questions you need to ask the people you have hired to generate revenue for your hotel through your most profitable channel: your website. Here are the seven questions you need to ask to determine how well your digital revenue is being managed. 1. Who is doing the actual marketing work for my hotel? This is the #1 question you need to ask. Is there a smart, experienced digital marketer looking at your campaign stats and strategy, or is your work being processed by interns in cubicles, or worse… by an automated system with no human oversight. The large hotel marketing agencies use a factory style approach, which means that the account managers are handling several accounts. Your account manager is not conducting market research or studying your campaign stats. They are juggling hundreds of emails, chasing down questions and responses, and coordinating conference calls. Meanwhile, an army of task-oriented mass marketing drones report to them; their job is to execute the exact same “strategy” and tasks for every client. (Picture the factory floor of T- 800 in Terminator. Scary.) Other than sounding pretty depressing, why does it matter so much to your bottom line? Because mass production cannot produce personalized strategies, and therefore can’t help you compete in today’s marketplace. Personalization has penetrated digital marketing in all industries. Only a thinking person who is setting up a custom strategy and implementing it for you can help you win. I can’t lay all the blame for this trend on the agencies. Hotels have demanded lower and lower prices, while giving less and less attention to what the agencies are doing. They practically forced the agencies to compete on price, which requires automation and economies of scale. A classic “be careful what you wish for” situation. Now it’s time to decide how important your online revenue is to you. If you’re ready to take an interest, start by making sure that you another are not just another cog in the nameless wheel of online hotel marketing. Pay a little more if you have to. But keep going back to question #1 – make sure you know what you’re paying for. 2. Are you using any proprietary technology developed by your agency? If the answer is yes, this is a huge red flag for your online marketing future. There is no gentler way to put this: proprietary software developed by an agency kills innovation. Anything an agency designs and invests money in developing is always going to be focused on making the life of the agency simpler and more profitable. (See #1 above re: agency survival.) Agency software, such as its own content management system (CMS) or digital marketing system (DMS), is not going to help you be an outlier when it comes to online revenue optimization. It is no secret that I am a huge supporter of WordPress and Google Analytics. As a hotelier looking to truly make a profit, you should be too! Set your priorities right. Build your own revenue, and not just the profitability of your online marketing agency. This is what your hired them to do…remember? 3. How many clients do you have? Here is how to translate their answer into the level of attention your hotel marketing campaign will get: 10-15 – You have a decent chance of getting to work directly with marketing professionals. 15-50 – You have a slight chance of getting some personal attention. 50-100 – “Your hotel sounds familiar. Who are you again?” 100-500 – You are just an account number. No one knows anything about your actual hotel. 500-1000 – “Hello, this is Sam, your 14th new Account Manager. Thanks for continuing to send in your monthly check. We don’t have time to talk to you, so don’t even try calling.” >1,000 – “Hello Client 98765, we have been acquired by a billion dollar company and we really don’t care what happens to you.” More clients = more employees = more layers = more automation = more mass produced marketing = lower revenue for your hotel. 4. How many clients do you have in my hotel’s market? Online marketing has a vast reach worldwide. In order for you to reach your full hotel marketing potential, your geographical location has to be a key factor. If your hotel marketing agency has even or or two other hotel accounts in the exact same market…guess what? The same team that is servicing your account is also working on your competitor’s websites, promotions, packages, PPC and SEO initiatives. That means that everything that has worked for you (specials, packages, promotions, etc.) is going to be used to benefit your direct competitor as well. This “communal” marketing costs you profitability. There are plenty of fish in the sea, but your hotel marketing catch of the day is going to be shared with every other hotel that your agency is servicing in your location. (Yes, sounds fishy, doesn’t it?) 5. Have you done anything other than hotels? Working in multiple industries provides great learning experience. Throughout my hotel career, I took on interesting and challenging work from diverse sectors like health care, board games, web hosting, etc. If the people working on your account have never looked beyond the hotel industry (and perhaps never beyond their own agency), then you know that they are not going to bring anything exciting to the table. Industry experience is great. But it’s disturbing to me that hotels are so much more willing to be a nameless, faceless client with an “established” agency rather then give an industry outsider a chance to help them make more money online. Choosing not to ever work with someone who has outside experience is going to be your loss entirely. I know hotel marketing sounds really complicated, but in fact it’s not. It’s okay to consider letting a specialist from another industry help you out or bring your fresh ideas. Don’t fall for the “do you speak hotel sector language” trap. The language your agency needs to be fluent in is marketing. Besides, if they “speak your language,” remember that they are recycling the same marketing hype to everyone in your industry. 6. Are you a full-service agency? If the answer is yes, then most likely you are dealing with the Wal-Mart of hotel marketing agencies. Generally, a company’s core competence cannot stretch beyond a few specialties. So how do you think they’re pulling it off? Agencies often inflate and add services based on the latest buzz in the market. I have seen overnight additions of “Metasearch marketing”, “Social media marketing”, and “Millennial marketing” on so many agency websites. Every new travel buzzword is promptly packaged into the “full service” offered by hotel marketing agencies. Why don’t the hotels realize that they’re really not getting anything special? Because so many in-house hotel marketing professionals are not only outsourcing the strategy and the work, but they are also being lazy about having to talk with more than one person! C’mon! It’s only your must important revenue channel, right? Show it some respect and get yourself A-Team specialists in different fields, versus the average-performing C- and D-Team players that are conveniently housed under one roof. 7. How big (and how responsive) is your team? This is the age of rolling out initiatives. Large teams do not translate into effective deployments. I have seen many examples where a three- to five-person team skated circles around big agencies. The bigger the ship, the harder it is for them to maneuver when the online market changes. Anyone who has ever dealt with a utilities company knows exactly why there is a phenomenon called “too big to care”. Working with layers upon layers is always going to slow you down. Time, money and online revenue wait for no one. Speed is key, and your hotel marketing has a need…a need for speed. Conclusion Google and online travel agencies are gearing up for the next level of products: more ways for them to make a direct connection with your potential hotel guest. Also, with the cost of guest acquisition going up for hotels worldwide, it’s crunch time for owners and their marketing budgets. Basically, it’s time to start doing actual marketing versus having it served to you on a platter by a behemoth agency. Big agencies thrive in meetings, conference calls, and monthly reports…basically processes that streamline their lives and give you the illusion of work being done. Remember: Processes equals revenue for them, but not so much for you. It’s time to focus on quality work from quality people. I recommend that you start by revisiting the budget restrictions you have set for online marketing. Consider how much more revenue you stand to make if you invest a little more in the right people, the right strategies, and the latest technologies. It can’t just be about the number in your expense column. It has to be about winning over your market, your guests, and your rightful share of the revenue pie. Make it about the future. Make it about getting promoted because you took the hotel into the next age of online marketing, and up to a new level of online revenue. Don’t make it about fear of getting fired for spending a little more than you did the year before. Because the future is already here. And in this industry, you can still be one of the first to arrive NB: This is an analysis by Vikram Singh, CEO of Evision.

Even more so today with how digital channels are so well integrated. Reply 4 days ago   Anil Varghese Good to read about performance marketing for hotel marketing agencies – it’s the need of the hour. However, given the ‘types’ of agencies in the market, generalizing is best avoided. After running a digital hotel marketing agency for past 2 years, here’s my take on few points: 1. It doesn’t matter ‘who’ runs the campaign – provided the strategy, content and calendar have been pre-approved by the hotel management. I know there are many hotels unaware about campaigns being run, but those are an ‘indifferent’ bunch altogether. 3. This might be a case with larger agencies. Working with 28 hotels, we are very eager to support every client call, because every support opportunity brings us closer to understand the client requirement and deliver on expectations. 4. This is the classic dilemma which agencies running ‘campaign-only’ face! We openly work with multiple hotels in the same market (different locations though) and hotels still sign up that because our *deliverable* to each hotel is ‘booking growth’, and not search rankings or social follower counts. 6. Though we are not one, my counter question is – what’s wrong with being a full-service agency? Hotels expect a vendor to offer as many allied services under one invoice. It makes monitoring easier and quicker, and lowers cost when compared with managing multiple vendors. Agree 100% on packaging the latest ‘buzzwords’ in full service 🙂 Reply 2 years ago   Francisco I specially love “it’s time to start doing actual marketing”… sometimes is hard to explain, and fully understand. I’ve been seeing big “versus” between Performance Marketing vs Brand Marketing that make no sense to me. Excellent article Vikram Reply 2 years ago   Richard Walsh Great article Vikram!

"This political uncertainty and economic uncertainty creates challenges to doing deals," the Peter J. Solomon Co. co-head of global retail told CNBC's "Squawk Box." "If you're levered and you're staring down the barrel of border tax adjustment, you won't do it. You'll pause." And great leverage is scarce among retailers, according to Leonhardt, who is also the managing director in Solomon's mergers and acquisitions group. "The debt markets don't like the retail sector, with the exception of home improvement, home furnishings," she said. "There are some sectors that they'll underwrite. But they've been very conservative and very selective in retail." That creates headwinds for retailers, which could be pushed to seek leverage in the face of higher costs on imports imposed by President Donald Trump's proposed tax. Most major U.S. retailers stock their shelves with imported products. Leonhardt said that if implemented, the tax would create winners and losers and could prove disastrous. "It's really sectors that have low margin[s] that are going to be negatively and disproportionately impacted. So ... that's mass market retailers like Wal-Mart, it's chain retailers, it's grocery store retailers and it's footwear and apparel," Leonhardt said. "But on the other hand, higher-margin businesses like tech and pharma would be much less impacted. So this is clearly bad for the retail industry," she said. As for Trump's recent tiff with Nordstrom over the department store's discontinuation of his daughter's brand, Leonhardt urged retailers not to get involved for the sake of the business. "I think brands and retailers are being pulled into these partisan arguments, and it's frightening. And if you're a retailer or brand, stay away from it. That's my advice – as far as you can," she said. "Because customers are hard to get. They're hard, they are expensive to acquire, and you don't want to lose them."

Marty Brown’s appearance on America’s Got Talent in 2013, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZIIkhcqPUk, has garnered 9.6 million views worldwide. The publicity of the reality tv show has caused a resurgence in his country music career.  As Howard Stern said of Marty, „You are an undiscovered treasure.” Marty Brown has produced a new country music video for the new radio single, Country Girls, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6B0phjry3KE.  Emphasizing the lyrics, „Country girls are like country roads.  They’re full of curves and they’re hard to hold,” Marty’s video utilizes the rural setting of Franklin, Kentucky, where he currently resides, and his hometown of Owensboro (Maceo), Kentucky where the CEO of Rural King flew in to supervise and personally take Marty up in one of the company helicopters.  The country music video features the Rural King store located in Owensboro, Kentucky, and his wife, Shellie Brown, who tricked him into performing on America’s Got Talent. American Singer-Songwriter, Marty Brown, is no stranger to country music.  He began the first of the WalMart tours, being personally endorsed by Sam Walton in the early 1990’s.  He released 3 albums on MCA Records in the 90’s and had 8 videos in heavy rotation on CMT.  He hung up his hat as an artist in the 90’s after writing the country classic, I’m from the Country and I Like It That Way, for Tracy Byrd.  The song has had over 10 million radio plays and remains in rotation on most country radio stations as a staple of country music. Marty’s new single, Country Girls, is comparative to the music of classic country artist, George Strait, and is as current as country music singer, Chris Stapleton.  Marty Brown’s lead guitar player, Darran Smith, formerly one of Tim McGraw’s Dance Hall Doctors, has put together an all-star band to play behind the country crooner, Marty Brown.  Marty’s website, www.martybrownmusic.com, will keep you updated for all shows and tv performances.

By Paul Wright February 13, 2017 14:51 GMT Jeff Lytle with wife, Rhoda, who he is alleged to have planned to have murdered for the life insuranceFacebook/Jeff Lytle A US father's alleged attempt to hire a hitman to murder his wife and four-year-old daughter has been foiled – after he accidentally texted his former boss the plan instead. Jeff Lytle, 42, of Monroe, Washington, is accused of trying to split $1.5m (£1.2m, €1.4m) in life insurance with a would-be assassin in a botched plot to murder his family members and make it look like a "robbery gone wrong" or an accident. His plan was foiled after text messages intended for the hitman, named as "Shayne", were instead sent to his former employer by mistake, court documents seen by local news channel KIRO 7. The text messages are alleged to have said: "Hey Shayne hows it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I'm going to take you up on that offer." "... life insurance is worth 1 million and if you want a bonus you can kill [JL]. Her life insurance is 500K. "... if you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it a accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00." "I'll split everything with the insurance 50/50." Monroe police arrested Lytle at his home on Wednesday (8 February) after his former boss called the police. He was charged with two counts of criminal solicitation for murder in the first degree. When interviewed by officers, Lytle allegedly told them he had no intention of going ahead with the murder plot and had only written the messages to "vent". He said his young daughter may have sent them by mistake. His wife has been named on social media as Rhoda Mee Funtanilla Lytle, with her Facebook page showing photos of the smiling couple playing with their young daughter. Lytle, who reportedly filed for bankruptcy in 2003, is being held in Snohomish County jail on a $1m bond.

Photo by Maya Srikrishnan Serena CEO Flavio Olivieri, executive director Migual Angel Torres and San Diego developer Gabriel Andres Garzo discuss plans for a large development in Tijuana, where Garzo wants to include a Serena Senior Care assisted-living facility for senior San Diegans. Partner Voices Interested in Housing narrative? Follow By Maya Srikrishnan | February 13, 2017 Serena Senior Care started out as a domestic service in 2007 – it would send nurses and other assistance to the homes of the elderly in Baja California. Many of its clients were Americans who had decided to retire in Mexico, where they could afford a beach-front home. Various estimates and surveys over the past several years put the number of American retirees in Mexico anywhere between 300,000 and 1 million. Soon, said Serena’s Chairman Flavio Olivieri, Serena’s clients and their families started asking for something more – a facility where they could stay and receive the care they needed once they weren’t fit enough to stay in their own homes. “They began to ask us for a permanent place,” Olivieri said in Spanish.

In 2008, Serena opened its first assisted-living facility, which houses people with disabilities or other illnesses who can’t or don’t want to live independently, in northern Rosarito. Roughly 75 percent of the clientele in that facility are American, estimates Serena executive director Miguel Angel Torres, and the facility is at the forefront of what could become a growing trend in Southern California senior care. San Diego’s high housing costs don’t just impact our ability to rent our own apartments or purchase our own homes. They also raise the costs of assisted-living facilities, nursing homes and other care facilities. Baja is already a source of affordable housing for the San Diego region. Its lower health care, labor and real estate costs and proximity to the U.S. makes catering to California’s seniors a no-brainer business investment to many. Even Seattle-based company Leisure Care, one of the largest private retirement and assistant-living companies in the U.S., expanded to Baja California a few years ago. A comparison of Serena’s costs to similar facilities in San Diego, using data from the Genworth 2016 Cost Care Survey, shows the significant savings in opting to move to Mexico that can range anywhere from 61 percent to 240 percent. The cost of these facilities often varies between clients, depending on the type of room and the level of service they need. For example, larger, private rooms with private bathrooms tend to be more expensive, and residents with full blown dementia or Alzheimer’s would require a higher level of care and thus cost more. An assisted-facility room in San Diego costs roughly $2,360 per month on average, according to the data. Serena costs roughly $1,466 on average. For nursing home-level care, which usually entails more medical care and assistance, Serena costs roughly $2,368 a month on average and in San Diego the average cost is $5,875. Higher-quality rooms and care can be easier to provide in Baja because costs are lower, said Torres in Spanish. “Here everyone can have their own room, and the majority do,” he said. “In many places in the U.S., they have more people in each room to keep costs down.” Another facility, Casa Baja Assisted Living in Rosarito, touts similar cost differences, saying it costs half the price of a comparable U.S. facility. El Mirador Assisted Living Facility in Tijuana says you can rent there for 60 percent the cost you would have to pay in the U.S. San Diego developer Gabriel Andres Garzo is working on a mixed-use development right on the edge of the border in Tijuana, and said he hopes to put a Serena facility in it – specifically for Americans. “If you’re looking at the data, there are people who won’t be able to afford to retire or age gracefully in San Diego or Southern California,” Garzo said. Once the Otay II Port of Entry is completed, Garzo said people could get from his development to Chula Vista in 15 minutes. That’s going to be appealing for Americans retiring on the Mexican side of the border and their families, he said. But Garzo said there is still one major hurdle for these facilities really taking off in Mexico: health insurance. “If Medicare reimbursements are ever accepted in Baja, that would be the tipping point,” Garzo said. Even in California, clients of most assisted-living facilities pay out of pocket – that is, the facilities don’t accept insurance. So even in Baja, where the cost is significantly lower, the lowest-income seniors likely won’t be able to afford care facilities. In San Diego, if some facilities have empty beds, they will opt to take Supplemental Security Income, cash provided by the Social Security Administration to aged and disabled people who have little to no income to provide for basic needs, like food, clothing and shelter. That income won’t match the going rate for many beds, so accepting it only tends to happen if a facility is having trouble filling a spot. Retirees can receive Social Security benefits while in Mexico, so there is nothing stopping them from using that income there. But using Medicare, the government health insurance provided to all Americans over the age of 65, isn’t an option – meaning that if an American senior in Mexico needs medical care, they either have to pay out of pocket or cross the border back to the U.S. Frank Carrillo, CEO of SIMNSA, which provides cross-border health care to thousands of working people in the region for employers like Walmart, says there isn’t a great option to provide insurance for American seniors who live across the border. “Mexico happens to be one of the favorite retirement places for the baby boomers,” Carrillo said. Carrillo said American retirees who live or want to live abroad have been lobbying for years to expand Medicare to Mexico, but he has doubts about it being successful under the Trump administration. Seniors who live in Mexico, whether they are in an assisted-living facility or not, have a few different options for accessing health care. Those who have more money saved up or families that can support them could pay for smaller procedures out of pocket in Mexico, where health care, in general, is more affordable. Some seniors have family or advocates who can help them cross the border for check-ups or to pick up medication when necessary. But for seniors in frail condition who may need emergency care, the inability to use Medicare could be problematic, said Christina Selder, co-founder and principal investigator at Consumer Advocates for RCFE Reform, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and quality care of seniors in assisted-living facilities in San Diego. The senior would likely have to pay out of pocket or could potentially use a Medicare supplement, called MediGap, that would pay for emergency medical care only in Mexico. Selder and Christine Murphy, the executive director of CARR, are also concerned about the market leading the pack when it comes to senior care facilities in Mexico. That’s how it started in San Diego –facilities popped up because there was a market for people who couldn’t live on their own, but weren’t in bad enough shape to be taken by a nursing home. But the market was ahead of any regulatory effort, leading to a wide range in facility quality that, in the worst extremes, cost residents’ lives. “There are a lot of moving parts with assisted-living facilities,” Murphy said. “It’s not just housing, even though it’s treated as such.” “There’s this push that assisted living is a less expensive alternative to nursing homes,” Selder said. “That’s true. It costs less, but these are still medically needy people, and you have to look at whether the cost savings is also a sacrifice in the quality of care.” That’s something Olivieri, Torres and Garzo say they don’t take lightly. Torres said Serena’s Rosarito facility – and another in Tijuana that caters more to Mexican residents – both have permits from Cofepris, a branch of the country’s Department of Health, and undergo inspections from the local government as well. Serena also uses trained nurses who are overseen by geriatricians. Garzo said the concerns of advocates is why he’s trying to work with a company like Serena that already has experience taking care of seniors. “We have the location, we can provide the infrastructure and the environment, but we’re not going to pretend we’re going to provide the actual care,” he said. “Health caregivers are important, but they’re not the ones you should ask to find a location and put together the deal.” This article relates to: Must Reads, Land Use, Nonprofits/Community, Housing, Health Care Written by Maya Srikrishnan Maya Srikrishnan is a reporter for Voice of San Diego.

Each year he reports guarded progress, not unlike Tijuana's rachitic and surreal transportation system… And transportation appears to be one of the bigger challenges in building old-folks homes for gringos. Getting to Serena isn't too bad, so long as you don't miss the turning off the Old Road; visiting Granny at El Mirador is considerably more daunting (at least there are predatory taxis that are willing to help!). But Mr Garzo's plans seem to put the old folks out in the boonies, where even the students can't get transportation to school, creating an isolation for the inmates that is only belied by the distance on a map. How do Garzo and Serena intend to accommodate family visits? Mark Giffin subscribermember 5pts Anyone that has faced senior parent issues knows how costly this can be. The "keeping seniors in their homes" is no longer a viable option once the need for a caregiver arises. If you go through an agency the Cost is between $21 to $25 an hour. If you hire directly its between $15-18 an hr. With the aging baby boomers the need for assisted living and skilled nursing is going to explode.  The need for these facilities is there.  It is not "what" could become a growing trend in Southern California senior care. It "is" going to be a growing trend.

All elementary schools in the Tulsa Public Schools district started offering free breakfast and lunch to all students at the start of the school year. Tulsa Public Schools At all elementary and middle schools and some high schools in the Houston Independent School District — 220 in all — every student begins the day with a free breakfast right in the classroom. The result: fewer absences and discipline problems and an increase in math scores, according to the district’s former superintendent Terry Grier. Houston, the nation’s seventh largest school district, where three out of four students live in poverty, also offers free lunch to all students at 186 schools, without requiring applications to qualify. The potential stigma of receiving a free meal is eliminated, and so is much of the paperwork burden on school staff, according to advocacy groups fighting poverty-related hunger. These programs and others are expansions of traditional school breakfast and lunch. And while schools in Texas and other states have been quick to adopt them – at little or no cost to districts – participation in Oklahoma is one of the lowest in the nation. In 17 states, more than half of eligible school districts provided universal free lunch in the 2015-16 school year, including in major districts like Dallas and New Orleans. In Oklahoma, 15 percent of districts did, ranking the state fifth lowest in the country, according to a report by Food Research & Advocacy Center and another national nonprofit. The money left on the table is significant. Oklahoma schools forfeited $17 million in federal funds last year, reports Hunger Free Oklahoma, an advocacy group that formed in December. “If Houston can do it, as big as Houston is and as many schools as Houston has, (any district) can certainly do it,” said Bill Ludwig, a regional administrator for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees school meal programs. The need in Oklahoma is also significant. Nearly one in four Oklahoma children lack consistent access to food, a study by nonprofit Feeding America shows. (Food insecurity is defined by the USDA as lack of access, at times, to enough food for an active and healthy lifestyle and limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods.) Students who are hungry can’t focus on learning, educators say. So when schools are held accountable for academic performance, they must first fulfill students’ basic needs, said Randy Harris, superintendent of Wagoner Public Schools. “If we see that void and we can pick up the slack, and we’re not losing any money in doing it, then we’re just providing another benefit,” Harris said. Skipping Meals Traditional breakfast and lunch programs are already in place at nearly all Oklahoma schools, with free or reduced prices for low-income students. But the USDA found half of eligible kids nationally were skipping breakfast at school, due to late buses or social stigma, especially among middle and high school students. There are barriers to lunch, too, including the cost, especially for students who may not qualify for free or reduced prices but whose families’ finances are still tight. So the agency launched the Community Eligibility Provision as part of the Healthy, Hungry-Free Kids Act of 2010. The program allows high-poverty schools to offer breakfast and lunch to all students at no charge, and it eliminates the meal application process. Schools, groups of schools or districts qualify if at least 40 percent of students live in households that receive assistance through programs like food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or are identified as homeless, migrant or in foster care. Schools are reimbursed for meals based on this percentage of students. The USDA made the program available nationwide in 2015-16, and more than 18,000 schools participated, according to the Food Research & Action Center. But that year in Oklahoma, only 15 percent of school districts participated — the fifth lowest rate in the nation. Of the state’s highest poverty schools, the percentage improved slightly to 21 percent. A complement to that program is the USDA’s “Breakfast in the Classroom,” which takes the morning meal out of the cafeteria and into classrooms. Students grab breakfast off a cart in the hallway and eat at their desks for the first few minutes of class while the teacher begins the day’s lesson. Schools that have implemented Breakfast in the Classroom say participation goes up, and behavior problems go down, the USDA reports. Attendance, too, improves. Feeding kids in the summer is where Oklahoma fares the worst. Through another program, the Summer Food Service Program, the state fed 6.4 children in the summer of 2015 for every 100 who received meals during the school year, ranking last among states and the District of Columbia, the Food Research & Action Center reported. An additional after-school meal program, which pairs a supper meal and snacks with extracurricular activities or tutoring, is also underutilized in Oklahoma schools and is targeted for expansion. Districts with a significant population of low-income students are eligible for expanded meal programs, such as Breakfast in the Classroom. Shown is Tammera Williams (left) and Ella Quintanar (right) at Remington Elementary in Tulsa. Credit Tulsa Public Schools Educating Schools  Schools give many reasons for not adopting these programs, but often the reasons are based on misconceptions or logistical issues that schools in other cities overcome, said Ludwig, of the USDA. The primary reason for not expanding meal programs is that school officials believe if they don’t collect meal applications, their district won’t be eligible for Title 1 funds, which are federal funds for low-income schools. But the USDA says that isn’t true. Another concern is that schools don’t have enough low-income students to break even on the federal reimbursements. But the programs can be structured in various ways, allowing schools to cover all expenses or even net a gain. Other reasons include not understanding the programs or not wanting to offer universal free meals in some of their schools but not others, Ludwig said. For breakfast in the classroom, some district officials said it would be too difficult to collect the trash or distribute the meals, or they were concerned about spills. For help, schools with start-up costs can apply for grants, such as a $7.5 million grant the Walmart Foundation made available in October for schools to expand their breakfast programs. No Oklahoma school has applied yet. Joy Hofmeister, state superintendent of public instruction, said the department is stepping up its efforts to educate schools about meal expansion opportunities, and the topic will be part of Engage OK, the department’s summer education conference. “We have some of the greatest needs, and yet we are seeing participation lag at some of the lowest levels of the country,” Hofmeister said. “I’m aware of the problem, and we have spearheaded making certain we work with districts to remove barriers.” There are signs expansion programs are picking up steam. Oklahoma City Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, reported more than 50 schools on Community Eligibility Provision in 2015-16. In 28 schools, students either receive breakfast in the classroom or have a grab-and-go breakfast available. Tulsa Public Schools rolled out free breakfast and lunch for all students at all elementary schools this school year, expanding Oklahoma’s participation by 24,000 students. But there are 515 school districts in the state, and the remoteness of some rural districts makes expanding some programs difficult, particularly in the summer. A Parent’s Perspective Oklahoma Watch is a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that produces in-depth and investigative content on public-policy issues facing the state. More at oklahomawatch.org. For parents like Virginia Dockter-Rollins, the meals school provides her two daughters, Tammera and Alison, are vital. Her daughters are in kindergarten and first grade at Remington Elementary in Tulsa, and they eat breakfast and lunch at school every day. “I’m making $11 an hour and I can barely keep a roof over our heads, food on the table, the bills paid,” said Docter-Rollins. Her husband is disabled, and she works as a security guard. Advocates working to address hunger in Oklahoma are especially alarmed by the trend of schools implementing four-day weeks. The extra-long weekend for many kids means waiting another day between nutritious meals. “We are tasked with meeting kids where they are … Their needs are not just textbooks and teachers,” Hofmeister said.

[Photo: Flickr user mathiaswasik] More from POV Why We Need Scientists On Social Media, Now More Than Ever Gender Equality Isn’t Political—See Utah For Proof How Trump Can Save NASA By Keeping It Grounded Ineke Mushovic 02.13.17 5:00 AM This story reflects the views of this author, but not necessarily the editorial position of Fast Company. Late last month, a leaked draft of an executive order from the Trump Administration hinted that the Oval Office was considering granting federal contractors a sweeping license to fire or refuse to hire lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people on the basis of religious belief. Two days later, amid intense public backlash, the White House said it had shelved the order. But it was a clear signal that Trump and his allies considered compromising LGBT Americans' civil rights, and still might do so, despite overwhelming evidence that policies allowing businesses to discriminate are bad for those very businesses. So now companies face a test: As the government backs away from protecting LGBT workers, will their employers continue to step up and do so instead? Discrimination Has No Winners So far, there's reason for measured optimism. States that have passed anti-LGBT laws in recent years, like North Carolina, have suffered fierce blowback. By one estimate, HB2 has cost the state between $77 million and $201 million in tourism and tax revenue alone. It also cost Governor Pat McCrory his job. As a result, politicians and business leaders see North Carolina and McCrory as a cautionary tale. In fact, the NCAA now requires potential host cities and counties to fill out a questionnaire that includes this question: "Does your city, county/parish, and/or state have provisions that allow for refusal of accommodations or service to any person?" By one estimate, [North Carolina's anti-LGBT bill] HB2 has cost the state between $77 million and $201 million in tourism and tax revenue alone. While nondiscrimination laws may spook legislators, companies large and small agree that diversity is good for business. Good managers and entrepreneurs all know what gets results: Create a shared vision, build a great team, create an open atmosphere for creativity, and attract and retain great employees. And business owners know that they're most successful when they serve the public—and that means all of the public. According to an April 2015 poll conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research for the political think tank the Center for American Progress, two-thirds of small business owners said companies shouldn't be able to deny goods or services to LGBT customers based on the owner's religious beliefs. And 59% of small business owners opposed laws allowing individuals, associations, or businesses to legally refuse service to anyone because of their own faith. Today, many corporations are putting these beliefs into practice by drawing up policies to protect their LGBT employees. According to the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index (CEI), 82% of Fortune 500 companies have explicit nondiscrimination policies covering sexual orientation and gender identity. And with transgender issues in the spotlight, many businesses are focusing on ways to support their transgender employees in particular. It actually isn't that difficult: Update nondiscrimination policies. Make sure whatever protections your company has in place when it comes to gender, race, and sexual orientation also explicitly include gender identity. Provide inclusive health care for employees. 50% of Fortune 500 and 73% of CEI businesses offer transgender-inclusive health care coverage. Offer to educate. 86% of CEI-rated businesses have training programs that specifically include gender identity in the workplace. Adopt guidelines to support inclusion. 387 major businesses have adopted gender-transition guidelines for employees and their teams, so there's already no shortage of examples for best practices (this organization has some useful resources). Fighting Discrimination Doesn't Have To Be Political Many of these inclusive businesses aren’t located in blue-state bubbles. According to the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index, five of the top 10 Fortune 500 companies with high scores for equality—including Chevron, General Motors, Ford, and Walmart—are headquartered in states with few legal protections for LGBT people. Many of these inclusive businesses aren’t located in blue-state bubbles. Nor are companies moving forward alone; they’re putting their money where their mouths are and urging governments to keep up. When businesses in Tennessee, Georgia, and Texas learned of discriminatory legislation in their states, they were among the first voices to reject that legislation. In response to a sweeping anti-LGBT bill, SB 6, the Texas Competes coalition of more than 1,200 businesses came forward to support LGBT protections. The group is now warning that Texas could lose up to $1 billion if the state passes the measure. Tennessee Thrives, another coalition of businesses like the Hospital Corporation of America, FedEx, Jack Daniels, and Country Music Television, is calling on the state to oppose a proposed law that would allow mental health counselors to refuse patients treatment based on the therapist's religious or personal beliefs. And last year, the outcry against Georgia’s proposed bill, HB 757, which would have given faith-based organizations in Georgia the option to deny services to LGBT people, came from giants like Salesforce, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, Intel, and Home Depot. All urged the governor to veto the bill. And he listened. We're about to learn whether the business consensus in favor of diversity can win over state and government officials who oppose it. That seems like it should be a no-brainer, but it won’t be easy. A newly released report by my organization, the Movement Equality Project, finds that the majority of states don't have laws protecting transgender people from discrimination in the workplace, housing, and public places. When our communities create level playing fields where everyone has the chance to thrive, that isn't "getting political"—it's the American dream. And several states, like North Carolina, have recently passed anti-LGBT laws that support letting businesses turn away customers and even fire LGBT employees. More are now considering bills that would limit bathroom access for transgender people and make it impossible for them to update identity documents, among other restrictions. But while state legislators and federal bureaucrats spend time worrying about who's using which bathroom, businesses can and must affirm what they already know works. By standing firmly against anti-transgender discrimination in the public sphere and creating a positive, transgender-inclusive environment in the workplace, companies can protect both their employees and their profits. Because ultimately, this isn’t just about the bottom line. When workers are judged on their skills and creativity, and not how they identify or whom they love, everyone wins. When our communities create level playing fields where everyone has the chance to thrive, that isn't "getting political"—it's the American dream, and it’s good business.

Renewed hopes about the US government applying policies to boost growth and inflation, after President Donald Trump promised a "phenomenal" tax reform, was behind dollar's strength. The American currency advance was uneven across the board, with the Pound and the Aussie the most reluctant to give up. The EUR on the other hand, is among the most vulnerable, given the ongoing political woes in the region, with upcoming elections in Germany and France, a possible referendum in Italy, and Greece's bailout on "shaky ground," according to the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. The week with probably start in slow motion, with no major data scheduled in Europe and America. That said, political headlines could continue to affect currencies one way or the other. From a technical point of view, the EUR/USD pair´s daily chart shows that, after reaching the 50% retracement of the November/January decline, the pair is back below the 38.2% retracement of the same decline and poised to test the next Fibonacci support at 1.0565. Technical indicators in the mentioned time frame head sharply lower within negative territory, whilst the price is below its 20 and 100 DMAs, this last with a strong downward slope around 1.0700. In the shorter term, and according to the 4 hours chart, technical readings also favor the downside, as a bearish 20 SMA kept capping the upside, currently around 1.0660, whilst the Momentum indicator turned south after failing to overcome its mid-line, and the RSI indicator consolidates around 38. Support levels: 1.0620 1.0590 1.0565 Resistance levels: 1.0660 1.0710 1.0750 USD/JPY The USD/JPY pair closed the week with modest gains around 113.20, down on Friday after failing to regain the 114.00 level. Risk appetite was not enough to fuel the pair, with bulls probably disappointed by the outcome of the Abe-Trump meeting, as both leaders shook hands and praise one another, but said nothing about a possible trade deal or on how the relationship between the two countries will continue. Despite Wall Street closed at record highs for a second consecutive day on hopes for an upcoming tax cut and recovering US Treasury yields, the USD/JPY pair closed the week with a lower low and a lower high, somehow suggesting that yen's rally is not yet over. Risk aversion may re-surge with the weekly opening, as over the weekend, North Korea fired an unidentified ballistic missile, triggering condemnatory comments from both, Abe and Trump, with the first saying that missile tests "can absolutely not be tolerated." Technically, the daily chart shows that the pair was unable to break below a bullish 100 DMA, currently at 111.85, while the 38.2% retracement of the latest bullish run stands at 111.95, providing a major support for the upcoming days. In the same chart, however, technical indicators have lost upward strength right below their mid-lines, and the RSI is slowly turning south, leaning the scale towards the downside. In the 4 hours chart, the price is struggling with a bearish 100 SMA, while the RSI indicator pulled back from overbought readings, now heading lower around 54, whilst the Momentum indicator maintains its bullish strength near overbought readings. Support levels: 112.85 112.40 111.90 Resistance levels: 113.60 114.00 114.55 GBP/USD The GBP/USD pair closed the week flat a few pips below the 1.2500 threshold, hit by dollar's strength by the end of the week and in spite of strong UK data. Industrial and manufacturing production more than doubled expectations in December, with the first up 1.1% and the second 2.1% when compared to the previous month. The year-on-year figures came in at 4.3% and 4.0% respectively, while previous month's reading were revised higher. Also, the goods trade balance for the same month showed a deficit of £-10.89B, better than the expected £-11.500B or previous £-11.55B, whilst the NIESR GDP estimate for the three months to January came in at 0.7%, beating expectations and above previous. Adding strong macroeconomic figures to the Brexit bill passing smooth through the Parliament, seems Pound's declines are set to be limited. Technically, the daily chart shows that the pair is right below a bullish 20 DMA, whilst technical indicators head modestly lower within neutral territory. The chart also shows that the pair bounced strongly from the 38.2% retracement of its latest bullish run at 1.2430 a key support for the upcoming days. In the 4 hours chart, the price is trading below horizontal moving averages, with the 200 EMA a few pips above the mentioned Fibonacci support, while technical indicators are also standing within neutral readings, with a modest bearish potential. Support levels: 1.2470 1.2430 1.2390 Resistance levels: 1.2535 1.2585 1.2620 GOLD Gold prices extended their gains this past week, with spot reaching a fresh three-month high of $1,244.67 a troy ounce, to close the week at 1,234.01, down on Thursday amid re-surging risk appetite. Despite broad dollar's strength, demand for gold remained high, amid reduced hopes of three rate hikes coming from the FED this year, with speculators foreseeing the most, two hikes one in June and one in December. Gold prices will depend much on the upcoming Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen semi-annual testimony before congress, with a hawkish stance probably taking gold down. From a technical point of view, the upside is still favored given that in the daily chart, the price is well above a bullish 20 DMA that crossed above a bearish 100 DMA, whilst technical indicators have advanced within positive territory, with the Momentum indicator heading north at fresh monthly highs. In the 4 hours chart, however, the price is right below a horizontal 20 SMA, the Momentum indicator retreats from its 100 level within bearish territory, whilst the RSI indicator lacks strength around 55, suggesting a break above Friday's high of 1,237.10 is required to confirm further gains. Support levels: 1,230.00 1,219.40 1,210.10 Resistance levels: 1,237.10 1,244.70 1,255.15 WTI CRUDE West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures advanced for a second consecutive day, with the commodity setting a couple of cents above 53.00. WTI set a daily high of $53.20 a barrel, still underpinned by Wednesday's news, showing an unexpected draw in US gasoline stockpiles that suggest rising demand for the commodity. Despite a large build in crude inventories, the commodity advanced for a second consecutive day, although the price continues developing within the range set mid December. Technically, the daily chart shows that the price is now around a flat 20 SMA, whilst technical indicators have turned flat around their mid-lines, indicating a limited upward scope. In the 4 hours chart, the price advanced beyond a still bearish 20 SMA, but is currently struggling with the 100 and 200 SMAs, both flat, whilst the Momentum indicator heads higher above its 100 level and the RSI remains flat around 54, in line with the longer term view. Support levels: 52.50 51.80 51.10 Resistance levels: 53.20 53.65 54.20 DJIA US equities extended their Thursday's rally, with all of the three major indexes closing the day at all-time highs. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 96 points or 0.48% to end at 20,269.37, while the S&P gained 0.36% to 2,316.10. The Nasdaq Composite settled at 5,734.13, up by 18 points. Stocks rallied on Trump's promises of an upcoming tax reform, and a recovery in oil prices that lifted the energy sector. Within the Dow, Caterpillar led gainers, up by 2.50%, followed by NIKE that added 1.65% and Boeing, up by 1.19%. On the losing side, Coca-Cola topped losers' list, down 1.62%, followed by Wal-Mart Stores that shed 1.53%. From a technical point of view, the upside is favored given that in the daily chart the Dow is well above a modestly bullish 20 SMA, whilst the RSI indicator heads higher around 70, with the Momentum indicator, however, diverging, neutral around its 100 line. In the 4 hours chart, the bias is firmly bullish with the index well above a bullish 20 SMA, the Momentum indicator heading north near overbought readings and the RSI hovering around 72. Support levels: 20,228 20,157 20,090 Resistance levels: 20,297 20,350 20,415 FTSE 100 London shares got a boost from China last Friday as a better-than-expected trade surplus in the country sent mining-related equities higher, helping the FTSE 100 to add 29 points and close at 7,258.75. A weaker Pound also lifted the mood among local traders. Rio Tinto was the best performer, up 5.63%, followed by Antofagasta that gained 4.65% and Anglo American that added 4.40%. Reckitt Benckiser was the worst performer, down 2.96%, followed by Royal Bank of Scotland that lost 1.80%. The index closed at its highest in three weeks, and technical readings in the daily chart support additional gains, given that the benchmark has extended above a still flat 20 SMA, but indicators maintain bullish slopes within positive territory. In the 4 hours chart, the 20 SMA advanced to converge with the 100 SMA at 7,208, providing a strong dynamic support, while the RSI indicator consolidates at 71 and the Momentum indicator turned higher within positive territory, in line with the longer term perspective. Support levels: 7,208 7,163 7,128 Resistance levels: 7,275 7,326 7,354 DAX European equities closed marginally higher on Friday, with the German DAX finishing at 11,666.97, up 24 points. Despite staring the day with a strong footing, shares failed to extend the risk-appetite rally triggered by the US president on Thursday, but remained afloat on strong earnings reports released earlier in the week, and positive trade data coming from China. In Germany, banks were among the worst performers, with Commerzbank down 2.37%, leading losers' list, and Deutsche Bank down 1.35%. ThyssenKrupp was the best performer by adding 2.35%, followed by Heidelberg Cement that closed 1.58% higher. Technically, the pair presents a modest upward potential in the daily chart, as it´s just holding at the upper end of its latest range, and a few points above a flat 20 SMA, whilst technical indicator in the mentioned time frame barely aim higher within neutral territory. In the 4 hours chart, the index settled above all of its moving averages, but the 20 and 100 SMAs lack clear directional strength, whilst technical indicators have turned lower within positive territory, limiting chances of a steeper recovery as long as the benchmark is unable to advance beyond 11,720, Friday's high and the immediate resistance.

In modern retail, apparel brings in the highest margins and the brand, which is to be launched tomorrow, would help Spencer's report post-tax profits by next year. The listing of Spencer's would follow a restructuring of CESC under which the retail business is housed. "Moving forward, we are taking a fresh approach to our apparel business by launching a new control brand that will evolve all aspects of the category – in-trend design, merchandise, pricing, marketing and in-store presentation – to ultimately create a 100% end-to-end brand environment that will increase customer loyalty and differentiate Spencer's from our competition," an internal presentation on the 2BMe brand launch said. "Spencer's will now focus on apparel as well apart from food. The brand would be announced on Tuesday by Shashwat. We will expand the brand, but sensibly. Apparel contributes much higher margin than food. That should add margins and we are optimistic of its performance as we go forward," said Sanjiv Goenka, chairman RP-Sanjiv Goenka group. This follows a complete overhaul of the management of Spencer's being overseen by Sanjiv Goenka's son Shashwat. "More and more senior-level people are joining Spencer's. There's a change in the way we recruited; we are now going for the best (people in the industry) and we are demanding very high performance from them. We have now much more youthful way of management. Vipin Bhandari (formerly Hypercity CEO) and Rahul Nayak, director - operations at Star Bazaar have joined us," Goenka told DNA Money. Others who have joined Spencer's are vice president - marketing Nitu Jaiswal, who was earlier head of marketing at Walmart India and Sandeep Gautam, executive director – HR, from Bharti Walmart, Spencer's officials said. "There has been a lot of changes in strategy as well as cost-cutting affected, all of which has resulted in topline and bottomline improvements. We are getting set for company-level profit at the net level," Goenka said. These steps have helped Spencer's post six months of consistent positive Ebitda with revenue per square foot touching Rs 1,741, which Goenka claimed is way higher than the industry best. Spencer's is now preparing for offering its shares to public. "Spencer's is ripe for listing," he said.

Click ahead to learn all about the benefits of a lip mask, and how you can get a plumped up pout for Valentine’s Day. Emma Stone, 28, has been killing it on the red carpet this awards season. The actress has been switching up her lipstick with every new gown, going from a deep burgundy at the London screening of La La Land to a pale pink at the SAG Awards. But no matter what the lipstick shade, Emma’s lips have remained moisturized and slightly pouty. The secret behind her conditioned lips? That funny looking lip-shaped sheet mask she hilariously posed in while goofing off with her makeup artist Rachel Goodwin. Getting her prepped for the Golden Globes last month, Rachel started by having Emma apply the Tony Moly Kiss Kiss Lovely Lip Patch, $5.68 at Walmart. PICS — See All Of Emma Stone’s Glam Moments The South Korean brand has become popular in the States for bringing us Korea’s biggest beauty and skincare trends (think sheet masks and cushion compacts), all at an affordable price. Tony Moly’s lip patch brings the same concept of using a sheet mask to hydrate and plump your face to the lips with their vitamin C-packed lip-shaped sheets. Infused with bearberry leaf extract, blackberry extract, blueberry extract, and strawberry extract, in 20-30 minutes, they leave your lips feeling smooth and looking full. While Tony Moly now makes honey and mint-scented lip patches, other brands have developed similar products like Patchology’s FlashPatch Lip Gels, $50.

Sections Deseret NewsU.S. & World U.S. & World Foreign workers in Hawaii may be catching seafood illegally By Margie Mason and Martha Mendoza Associated Press Published: Feb. 10, 2017 3:15 p.m. Updated: Feb. 10, 2017 3:18 p.m. 2 Comments HONOLULU — Hawaii authorities may have been violating their own state laws for years by issuing commercial fishing licenses to thousands of foreign workers who were refused entry into the country, The Associated Press has found. About 700 of these men are currently confined to vessels in Honolulu without visas, some making less than $1 an hour. They work without most basic labor protections just a few miles from Waikiki's white sand beaches, catching premium tuna and swordfish sold at some of America's most upscale grocery stores, hotels and restaurants. The AP found that under state law, these workers — who make up most of the crew in a fleet catching $110 million worth of seafood annually — may not be allowed to fish at all. A recent industry-sponsored assessment of crew members' treatment and living conditions found no human trafficking, but raised concerns that workers could be vulnerable to exploitation and said they have little recourse about paying fees or incurring debt in order to hold their jobs. "There exists no system of grievance mechanisms for crew to voice concerns over pay," according to the report. In this unique fishing arrangement facilitated by both federal and state officials, Hawaii's boat owners pay brokers up to $10,000 to bring each crew member from impoverished Southeast Asian and Pacific island nations. The men aren't allowed to arrive at Honolulu's airport because they lack visas, so they are instead flown to other countries and put on U.S.-owned fishing boats for long sails back to Hawaii. Before the men start working, they need a state commercial fishing license. In order to get it, Hawaii requires that they must be "lawfully admitted" to the U.S. Here's the hitch: When they arrive, they are met at the dock by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents who ban them from entering the country by stamping "refused" on their landing permits, which voids them. So instead of being "lawfully admitted," they are now barred by law from setting foot on U.S. soil. "Try taking a check to your bank that says 'void' on it and telling them, 'Oh, but they wrote the check to me,'" said Hawaii attorney Lance Collins, who advocates for the workers. Nonetheless, a written opinion by Hawaii Attorney General Douglas Chin said the Department of Land and Natural Resources provides the landing permits as proof the fishermen are "lawfully admitted." U.S. Customs sees it differently. "NO. They cannot be admitted," spokesman Frank Falcon wrote in an email, adding that the stamp means they can't even enter the U.S. temporarily. In rare cases including medical emergencies, Customs can parole the men to go ashore. Foreign crews on boats and aircraft, including cruise ship workers and flight attendants, fill out landing permits when they arrive in the U.S. Customs takes those applications and decides whether to allow each individual to temporarily enter the country. When landing permits are stamped refused, that serves as proof that authorities have been alerted that foreigners without visas are on arriving vessels or planes, and triggers an order for captains to detain them on board. Chin's office did not respond to AP's queries about the refusal stamp. However, Land and Natural Resources department spokesman Dan Dennison said in an email that the attorney general advised his agency to continue issuing fishing licenses to the foreign workers despite the fact that Customs says the men are not "lawfully admitted." The Hawaii Longline Association, which represents boat owners, says the men are legally hired for legitimate work on the fleet's 141 active vessels. And while the conditions and pay are often below U.S. standards, the jobs are typically better than the bleak opportunities the men have at home, mostly in the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia and the tiny Pacific island of Kiribati. Under federal law, U.S. citizens must make up 75 percent of the crew on most American commercial fishing boats. An AP investigation last year revealed Hawaii's fleet relies on a federal loophole allowing the foreign fishermen to work. In a hearing prompted by the AP report, Land and Natural Resources department administrator Bruce Anderson was asked why he issues commercial fishing licenses to foreign workers who can't enter the state. He said the crewman's landing permit "says in essence that the individual has the right to fish in U.S. waters but cannot step ashore." He did not mention that all the permits were stamped "refused." Democratic state Rep. Kaniela Ing, chairman of the Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs committee, has queried Chin and other state officials at length about why the men cannot leave their boats. Ing said state officials failed to disclose the refusal stamp to him when he asked to see the landing permits. "It always seemed paradoxical that the proof of lawful entry was a landing form, but the crew members weren't allowed to land or leave the boat," he said, after the AP told him about the stamp. "We just didn't have the smoking gun evidence to point to why, and now we do." Critics say the fishing licenses could be just one of several ways the state is breaking its own laws: —The lowest-paid fishermen have contracts promising $300 a month, well below the state's wage minimums. The Labor Department says it doesn't intervene because the workers fall under federal, not state, jurisdiction. But department head Linda Chu Takayama also said she's awaiting further legal guidance. — Chin, the attorney general, said in his written opinion that employers in Hawaii typically cannot withhold wages, but some fishermen told the AP they are paid only after returning home when their one- or two-year contracts end. — Chin said telling consumers "that fish had been caught by local fishermen" may violate the state's deceptive practice laws if misinformation likely affects their shopping choices. The Hawaii Seafood Council claims the catch is "produced by Hawaii's hard-working fishermen." Council Program Manager John Kaneko did not respond to the AP. Federal law also is in question: U.S. Customs requires captains to detain the men on board and hold their passports because they are banned from entering the country. That potentially goes against U.S. human-trafficking laws saying bosses who possess workers' identification documents can face up to five years in prison. The foreign fishermen's catch is sold everywhere from Costco to Sam's Club and upscale restaurants across the U.S., including Trump International Hotel Waikiki. Whole Foods announced it would suspend buying seafood from the fleet after the AP's initial report, while Costco says it is monitoring the situation. The Trump hotel and Wal-Mart, which owns Sam's Club, did not provide an immediate response. The story also exposed dangerous, unsanitary conditions and at least two instances of human trafficking. It prompted new commitments from boat owners to protect the crew members' welfare. After a follow-up briefing on Capitol Hill, several members of Congress expressed "grave concerns" about working conditions in a letter to the Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Hawaii Seafood Council's survey of 207 fishermen identified a series of potential problems, particularly involving recruiting and payment of the foreign crew. Some fishermen had contracts requiring that part of their salaries or identification papers be withheld until they returned home. Others had signed agreements that said they had to pay for replacement workers if they broke their contracts, or faced $5,000 fines for absconding — equivalent to a year's salary for some. However, the assessment also found some fishermen had excellent relationships with their captains. All said they were being paid in cash, and none expressed concerns about forced labor or human trafficking. No one complained about access to food, but the report described one labor agent as saying that she had men on a boat who had not been paid for two months and that she bought groceries for fishermen at times when their boats ran out. The industry has implemented a new universal crew contract that requires owners to pay all recruiting fees and gives the fishermen their salaries within four days of landing. A draft Code of Conduct seeks to safeguard workers' rights. But there are no wage minimums as initially promised by Hawaii Longline Association president Sean Martin. The Honolulu Fish Auction now does business only with boats whose workers have signed those agreements. Martin declined to be interviewed, but he and other industry leaders have condemned labor abuses. They have said the workers are happy to have the jobs and typically do not complain, with many renewing their contracts and even recruiting relatives. Still, little has changed, with foreign crews typically spending three weeks a month at sea, working up to 20 hours a day, usually for far less than American fishermen nationwide, who average $2,500 a month. Their situation has been widely accepted as legal. The AP investigation is part of an ongoing global look at labor abuses in the fishing industry, stretching from Southeast Asia to America's own waters. In 2015, the AP reported on fishermen locked in a cage and others buried under fake names on the remote Indonesian island village of Benjina. Their catch was traced to the United States, leading to more than 2,000 slaves being freed. But thousands more remain trapped worldwide in a murky industry where work takes place far from shore and often without oversight. In Hawaii, most vessels dock at piers 17 and 38, which are guarded and patrolled, but some go as far as the West Coast. And, although technically not allowed, they do venture onto the piers briefly to socialize and use restrooms. Last year, Customs said six fishermen were deported after wandering away from their boats in Honolulu, some to visit friends on other vessels, others sneaking away for a drink. In 2010, two Indonesian fishermen who fled their boat in San Francisco alleging abuse were granted visas as victims of human trafficking and are now suing their former boat owner. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said agents checking out a number of leads related to possible human trafficking in the fleet have "identified instances where crew members were contending with less than ideal working conditions," but found no situations meeting the legal threshold to bring criminal charges. Federal marine observers, who live with the men for weeks at a time at sea, said some fishermen have good working conditions while others are sometimes mistreated, not given proper health care, provided unclean drinking water and fed bait and rice. Many are forced to use buckets as toilets on board. 2 comments on this story Others in the community also have concerns. Uli Kozak, an Indonesian language professor at the University of Hawaii who has long exchanged home-cooked meals for fresh fish, said the workers sometimes ask for vegetables because of shortages on board. He said some captains have banned men from speaking their native language on boats. There's "a lot of verbal abuse, even physical abuse, being slapped in the face," Kozak said. "I have come across cases where people said, 'If I had ever known that it would be as bad as this, I would have never taken that job.'"

A Washington state man allegedly foiled his own murder-for-hire plot when he accidentally sent a message with details of the planned killing to his former boss. Snowhomish County cops arrested Jeff Lytle, 42, on Wednesday. His bail was set at $1 million after probable cause was found on two counts of criminal solicitation for first-degree murder domestic-violence. “Hey Shayne hows it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I’m going to take you up on that offer,” Lytle is accused of writing in a text message obtained by KIRO7. SEX OFFENDER CHARGED IN MURDER OF COLLEGE STUDENT “—life insurance is worth 1 million and if you want a bonus you can kill [Lytle’s 4-year-old daughter]. Her life insurance is 500K. –if you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it a accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00. “I’ll split everything with the insurance 50/50.” Lytle, who lives in Monroe, told authorities the texts were only written to “vent,” he did not mean to actually send them and perhaps his daughter had mistakenly sent the texts, according to court documents viewed by KIRO7. Lytle also said “Shayne” was not a real person and he was not attempting to solicit anyone to kill his wife and daughter, The Seattle Times reported. Lytle’s wife told police the couple had been married for seven years and were in the midst of financial difficulties since Lytle was out of work, according to The Seattle Times.

It’s a big, fat blatant con job that costs the average American about $131, according to CNN. Some people, like my sister, Kelsey, are able to enjoy and appreciate it, revel in the holiday’s tenets and fundamental principle. And that’s great for them. I wish I could do the same, but there’s just too much about Valentine’s Day that stirs up feelings of unrestrained cynicism and suspicion. It’s not the principle that’s bothersome, but rather the insincerity distilled within. The basis of Valentine’s Day, which is supposedly love, is something that deserves more than plastic and candy. It’s more than a Hallmark card, or $131 worth of dead flowers and chocolate. Love helps to mute the deafening minutiae and repetition of everyday life. It lends weight and meaning to human interaction. Love comforts and soothes us, tucks us in and lulls us into grinning, drooling fools bathing in the solace of its embrace. It’s wonderful. Whether it’s young, stupid and utterly senseless infatuation, that feeling of newness and excitement, or the familiarity and absolute understanding found in the smile of the man or woman with whom you’ve grown old, there is unquestionably something magic about all of it. That magic can be found in the precise moment you admit that everything about you, from your odor to your opinions, everything that makes you who you are, all of it belongs to somebody else. It’s voodoo, and it starts with the admission that you are, in every way, someone’s. And they’re yours. That lack of ego, or whatever it may be, is what makes love feel good, that’s what gets us high. Because it’s scary and it’s dangerous and it’s simultaneously divine and diabolical. Forgive the hippie-dippery. Much like just about everything else, however, it’s all about perspective. You can choose to ignore the magic, find someone that you can tolerate and get started on manufacturing a family, which is, unfortunately, far too common if you ask me. And probably the main reason that antidepressants and reality television are as popular as they are. Or you can make the right choice and look for the feeling we all know is out there. That high we talked about. Romance isn’t found at Walmart or Rite Aid. That’s convenience, laziness. And, trust me, I’ve done my Valentine’s Day shopping at both establishments, so no offense, but we all know it’s true. Romance isn’t a gift or a gesture, although it may be found within one of those things. Romance is a choice to believe in magic. It’s the decision to put on those rosy goggles that expose the heroic and marvelous deeds that happen every day, the pageantry and chivalry, the colorful and fantastic stuff they make musicals about. Moderation is key, though. Life is no fairy tale, but there’s gotta be a little bit of magic. If it weren’t for that, how would we make it through? So, how about let’s change things a little bit. Let’s bring the romance back to Valentine’s Day. Let’s get a little mushy and do something unique for the people that like the way we smell. They deserve it.

"Today's Home is the interior design center of what we would consider custom design," said Jeff Lenchner, the company president. "Even in 1953, my parents' mission statement was high-quality, high-end furnishings with interior design assistance." The Lenchner family made a leap of faith in 1953 by establishing the home furnishings business in the Pittsburgh-area town of Ross at a time when the area was mostly cow pasture. But founders Sig and Audrey Lenchner knew the north corridor was bound to grow. "Even in those days, there was talk about a super highway that was going north. It was not called [Interstate] 279 North yet. And they knew all of that growth most likely was going to go north because the land was available," said Jeff Lenchner, a son who took over the furniture company when his parents passed away. What started as a mom-and-pop shop with two employees has grown to four operating companies with 60 employees. But that makes it sound too easy. Business boomed for about 20 years. When Pittsburgh's steel industry faltered in the early 1970s, the region began losing numerous other major corporations whose employees bought high-end furniture. "That was an incredibly challenging period for my parents," Lenchner said. And it wouldn't be the last one. Today's Home eventually grew to three locations and the operating companies, Today's Home, Designer Furniture Outlet, TH Trade Contract and TH Trade Design. A national economic downturn in 2000 -- the dot-com bust -- prompted the company to create its first operating company, Designer Furniture Outlet, which sells furniture at marked down prices, similar to the model used by Marshall's and TJ Maxx. Frugal was hip. It became less acceptable to shop at pricey stores. Big Box chains like Wal-Mart, Costco and Target were gaining traction with affluent shoppers. "The high-end changed completely and we had to change our business model literally to survive because it was no longer fashionable to buy custom furniture," Lenchner said. "People wanted to save money." The company weathered the slump from 1999 to around 2002. Then Hurricane Ivan came along in 2004 and threatened to crush the business. That storm dumped close to 10 feet of water into the company's distribution center. Delivery trucks, which are 26 feet tall, were underwater. "And in our distribution center, which was 100 feet high, we always kept customer's special orders on the first level," Lenchner said. "We lost 100 customers' special ordered furniture during that flood." The company didn't have flood insurance; didn't even know it was on a flood plain. "We managed to get through that, then started to get our feet stable again and the great economic recession hit just four years later when there was a little stability," Lenchner said. The recession washed out 60 percent of the company's peer group around the country, he said. Today's Home stayed afloat, partly because of its model to provide design assistance and partly because it kept diversifying. In 2008, the company created TH Trade Contract, which sells furniture to businesses in the corporate, health, hospitality and education segment. Clients include country clubs, offices, law firms and funeral parlors. Two years later, Today's Home started TH Trade Design, which is a trade showroom for 265 independent furniture designers who buy furniture at a discount and resell. "There are hundreds of independent designers that work with residential customers, but need a trade showroom to procure orders," Lenchner said. "Independents really don't want to deal with warehousing, accounts receivables and accounts payable." The management is now in its third generation.

SHARE A sales tax hike and event center would combat stagnation By Guest Columnist Saturday, February 11, 2017 As a new mother of an amazing, vibrant and energetic boy; a local restaurateur; a real estate broker, an active volunteer in community organizations, I remain foremost a proud Grand Junction native. I smile every time I drive by St. Mary’s hospital and look at my son and say, “That is where you and mom came from!” With this background, let me explain why I support a quarter percent (.0025) sales tax increase (25 pennies on every $100) to fund the proposed multipurpose event center — even though when I first heard of the event center, like many, I almost fell off my chair. Sixty-two million dollars! Is this the right decision for Grand Junction; my family; my neighbors; and you?  We all want Grand Junction to be a vibrant community with opportunities for us and our children. We can continue the status quo, with a sales tax less than all neighboring communities, or we can collectively commit to a small increased sales tax and pay for the economic progress we need.  Don’t forget, non-city residents pay a large share of the city sales tax. We all want to enjoy great parks, good municipal services and programs for people of all ages. However, one must distinguish “quality of life projects from a “money generator” project. Both types of projects are important but they are not interchangeable or easy to compare. The event center is a “money generator,” both by operating income but more significantly, by generating added revenue for private businesses which will then pay more sales tax to the city. The resulting increased revenue can then be spent on “quality of life projects.” Community support of an expertly managed event center can spur a stagnant local economy into a growing economy. Absent a growing economy,  parks, streets, police, roads and a rec center are annually on the “chopping block” during the city budgeting process. We can stomp our feet until we are blue in the face; but, if the local economy is stagnant, everyone’s preferred “quality of life project” will go nowhere. Do we want the city’s quality of life to slowly decline? Without “money generator” projects, communities cut quality of life projects, then cut police, fire, roads and other services.  We cannot allow current economic stagnation to slowly harm all that makes our city livable. Why doesn’t the city still enjoy its past prosperity? First, the energy market declined, an event we cannot control.  Second, Grand Junction is no longer the sole regional shopping hub. Target, Walmart, Home Depot, and other big box stores are now the norm in surrounding communities. Our city must face 2017 and beyond by looking forward; not pretending all will be right by preserving the status quo. The city, however, will always be a geographic “hub” for a 125-mile radius. With a growing medical industry, CMU and an event center, the city has the potential to secure its position as the business, social and recreational hub. Let us start acting the part of “THE city (not just “a city”) on the Western Slope.  The vity must increase the amount of sales on which taxes are generated. We also need to increase the number of visitors who pay a large portion of city sales taxes. An event center will bring visitors for conventions and entertainment; those guests will spend money and pay sales taxes, helping us all. I cannot think of another project that has such a direct and immediate impact on economic development, both in private development, as a result of the event center and direct new spending into our community.  Nearly three decades ago, Grand Junction set a sales tax rate at 2.75 percent. That’s right, we have not increased our sales tax since 1988. Fruita’s tax is 3 percent; Montrose is 3.3 percent; Rifle is 4.25 percent; Glenwood Springs is 3.6 percent and Denver is 3.65 percent. Grand Junction can afford a quarter-cent increase; we cannot afford to continue a tax rate lower than what our neighboring cities require us to pay when we visit them. Per an independent financial feasibility and impact study completed by a nationally recognized company, a downtown event center will generate $30 million dollars of direct new spending at our local businesses, shops, gas stations and restaurants.  Passage of an increase to the currently low sales tax will construct an event center, remodel Two Rivers and result in construction of one new hotel, probably two. Such expectations are not just “pie in the sky dreams,” but a plan the city and existing hotel owners will implement. Now consider the downtowns located in Midwestern “Rust Belt” cities. These towns did not adjust to changing times; their city officials stood by as prosperity slipped away. We can do better; we must do better. We must decide if each of us can annually afford a few dollars of added sales taxes which, collectively, will allow us to take action and turn “stagnation” into steady growth. We should choose optimism and foresight over the status quo. Grand Junction deserves it.  In a subsequent column, I will outline how the event center will act as an “income generator” thus advancing an optimistic future. ■ Jodi Niernberg and her husband own Bin 707 Foodbar in downtown Grand Junction. COMMENTS Page 1 of 1 By Steve Phillips - Sunday, February 12, 2017 Of course this would be an outstanding project.  A rec center is also a great project but it seems in this extremely conservative environment there are few people who will take the risk to be somewhat progressive in providing amenities for the community when they might need to pay a minimum fee to enhance the community.  That includes politicians who will not go out on a limb and take a chance of trying something that isn’t bust and boom! You would think people would look around and see the tremendous progress funding and building has done for CMU and all the stink initially about the stadium press box, or updated athletic facilities but really they are all a great model of some progressive moves to enhance the community.

But when it comes to buying them, the choices – and the trade-offs – can be overwhelming. Consumer Reports surveyed more than 91,000 readers and also shopped for glasses themselves, online and in walk-in stores, to discover the pros and cons of different vendors. Here’s what they learned: Doctors’ offices and independent eyeglass shops. Nearly 40 percent of survey respondents bought their glasses from one of these sources. They gave these sellers high marks for lens and frame fitting, employee knowledge and follow-up service. But frames and lenses tended to cost more than elsewhere: Readers shelled out a median of around $400, two to three times what you might pay online or at a discount store. Major eyewear chains. Since they have many locations, buying eyeglasses at eyeglass chains can be convenient. Consumer Reports’ readers reported good follow-up service from most chains, too. But in other areas, survey ratings varied depending on the company. Warby Parker and Zenni Optical. Each of these stores sells only its own brand of glasses. Warby Parker retails both online and in brick-and-mortar locations in 18 states, the District of Columbia and Ontario, Canada. In the seven years since it launched, Warby Parker has become a major player, offering glasses with single-vision lenses for $95, including an anti-reflective coating. But if you order progressive lenses, those prices can rocket to nearly $300 – far more than the prices Consumer Reports found at some other retailers. As for all-online retailer Zenni Optical, you can try on frames only virtually, by uploading a photo of yourself. And it, too, has a 30-day warranty. Still, Zenni’s frames with basic single-vision lenses start at less than $10, and upgrading to progressives begins at just $28. Survey respondents who bought from Zenni spent a median of just $69 for a complete pair of glasses, making them the survey’s lowest-cost retailer. Large discount chains. Costco and Wal-Mart are low-cost one-stop spots for buying eyeglasses where you can do everything from having your eyes examined to getting your finished glasses adjusted for fit. Frames can be inexpensive at these stores. At Wal-Mart and Sam’s Club, Consumer Reports found basic, plastic progressive lenses for as little as $79. Costco charges $130 for high-definition progressive lenses, which, as with all Costco lenses, include an anti-reflective coating. That’s about half what you’d pay at many walk-in stores. But if you need basic, plastic single-vision lenses, you can pay as little as $29 at Wal-Mart, about half as much as at Costco. Online retailers. While only about 5 percent of respondents bought their glasses online, nearly twice as many browsed online before purchasing at a walk-in store. Even if you don’t plan to buy from a website, the price information you get might help you negotiate your way to a discount from a walk-in store.

Woman films herself urinating on Koran before setting it on fire In the message, the father unveiled the alleged plan to kill his wife, Rhoda Mee, and daughter and then pocket the £1.2 million insurance payout he would receive, Kiro 7 reports. The 42-year-old even allegedly promised to split the sum with the hitman and provided details on how he might disguise the killing. When interviewed by police, Lytle, of Monroe, Washington, said that his four-year-old daughter might have sent the messages. Police arrested Lytle last week after reading the text, which allegedly started: ‘Hey Shayne hows it going? You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I’m going to take you up on that offer.’ The father has now been arrested with bail set at $1 million (Picture: Google maps) The news station it added: ‘Life insurance is worth one million and if you want a bonus you can kill [daughter].

Lampert, whose hedge fund has forwarded millions in funding to keep Sears afloat, has long pledged to turn the company’s fortunes around and that the retailer would find ways capitalize on its best known brands, as well as its vast holdings of land. VINCENT LAFORET , VINCENT LAFORET NYT By FROM STAFF AND NEWS REPORTS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Sears’s shares soared 30 percent Friday after its chief executive reiterated plans to restructure the ailing retailer by shaving $1 billion in annual expenses. CEO and Chairman Edward Lampert said Sears may sell more locations, cut more jobs and put more of its famous brands on the block. Shares of Sears Holdings Corp., which are already down 40 percent this year, soared 30 percent at Friday’s opening bell. Shares were trading down nearly 4 percent midday Monday to $6.70. The company, which also owns Kmart, in January announced it would close of 150 of its 1,500 stores. It did not announce new store closures Friday, but said it would “actively manage our real estate portfolio to identify additional opportunities.” Few of the closures impacted Southern California, where only a Kmart at 3001 Iowa Ave. in Riverside was slated to shutter. In its news release Friday the company also said it would “actively manage our real estate portfolio to identify additional opportunities for reconfiguration and reduction of capital operations.” Sears owns much of its retail real estate, which analysts have speculated is worth more than the brand itself. “Sears has been having difficulties for quite an extended period of time,” said Greg Stoffel, a retail analyst based in Newport Beach. “At the end of the day, most of the stores don’t do decent volume in sales. The real estate holdings have more value than operating the stores as stores. They’ve been on a downward spiral for at least 20 years.” If Sears does sell its stores, particularly in Southern California, Stoffel said the malls would most likely have first dibs at purchasing the storefronts. “The trend is to add other uses in that space that make the center more of a destination than it currently is,” Stoffel said. “That could be adding entertainment or experience oriented stores that bring in new customers.” The company declined to comment which stores were company owned and which locations were leased. According to Stoffel, Sears owns the Kmart locations in Anaheim and Costa Mesa and the Sears stores in Costa Mesa, Brea, Westminster and Buena Park. Big department stores have recently closed at the Laguna Hills Mall, MainPlace Mall and the Irvine Spectrum Center. The Macy’s at the Irvine Spectrum Center closed, leaving a huge whole. Instead of filling it with a department store, the mall will add many smaller stores. In 2016, the former Macy’s Men’s and Home store at MainPlace Mall in Santa Ana became home to a 24-Hour Fitness Super Sport, Lucille’s, Panini Café, Ashley Furniture and Round One Bowling & Amusement. Laguna Hills Mall recentlly said goodbye to Sears and is renovating to add luxury apartments, a movie theater, park and indoor and outdoor shops, as it becomes Five Lagunas. If Sears does shed its Orange County locations, Stoffel anticipates the Brea Mall and South Coast Plaza locations becoming a handful of stores while the Bunea Park and Westminster Mall location would likely focus at least part of the space on entertainment. Selling Kenmore Part of Sears’ restructuring may also include selling two of its brands -- Kenmore appliances and DieHard car batteries -- after striking a deal last month to sell its popular tool brand Craftsman. Job cuts may also be on the way as it streamlines its organization structure, but the company did not release any details. Sears had about 178,000 employees in the U.S. last year. From November to January, which includes the holiday shopping season, Sears expects sales to have fallen 10.3 percent at its established stores. That’s better than the drop of 13.1 percent that Wall Street had expected, according to FactSet. “We believe the actions outlined today will reduce our overall cash funding requirements and ensure that Sears Holdings becomes a more agile and competitive retailer with a clear path toward profitability,” CEO and Chairman Edward Lampert said in a company release. Lampert, whose hedge fund has forwarded millions in funding to keep Sears afloat, has long pledged to turn the company’s fortunes around and that the retailer would find ways capitalize on its best known brands, as well as its vast holdings of land. Lampert, a billionaire hedge fund manager, combined Sears and Kmart in 2005, about two years after he helped bring Kmart out of bankruptcy. But the retail landscape has undergone seismic shifts since then. While Amazon.com had been up and running for almost a decade at that time, the titanic disruption in retail went into full force around the time of the recession a few y ears later. But Sears’ troubles go further than that, having to compete on appliance sales with Home Depot and to match the cut-rate prices at huge chains like Wal-Mart. And old rivals have made it tougher. J.C. Penney has brought back to its floors major appliances more than 30 years after abandoning the sale of refrigerators and stoves. Sears has ramped up online services, but it’s having a hard time disguising its age. Stores are in need of a major redo. Sears rose $1.64 to $7.18 in early trading.

TrendsViral Jeff Lytle, 42, wrote a message apparently intended for a hitman named ‘Shayne’ asking him to kill his family for a $1.5 million life insurance policy, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office cited by KIRO 7. Read more Murder rate rises at fastest pace since 1970s, remains near historic lows ‒ report "Hey Shayne how’s it going. You remember you said that you would help me kill my wife. I'm going to take you up on that offer," the text message read, according to court documents. Lytle also allegedly told the hitman that there would be a bonus if he killed his daughter as her life policy is valued at $500,000. However, the message, which also discussed splitting the money 50/50, was accidentally sent to Lytle’s former boss, who quickly contacted police. Monroe police arrested Lytle at his home for investigation of two counts of criminal solicitation for murder in the first degree. Lytle appeared in court in Snohomish County on Thursday afternoon where his bail was set at $1 million. The accused claims, however, there was no foiled murder plot and that he wrote the texts to "vent" but never intended to send them. He told investigators that his child may have sent the message. © Jeff Lytle / Facebook The text also indicated that the murders should be made to look like either a robbery or an accident, with one reportedly reading: “If you can make it look like a robbery gone wrong or make it an accident she works at Walmart she gets off at 11:00.” Investigators have applied for a warrant to search Lytle’s phone and property for documents related to the family’s life insurance plans.

In the past year, dozens of companies, including GM, Japan Airlines, Hilton, and Pfizer, have launched initiatives using IBM’s intelligence. Watson owes its ubiquity to the dozens of new AI tools, including emotional analysis and image recognition, that it offers developers. "Our mission is to let people own their own AI," says David Kenny, general manager of IBM Watson. 1.

Arkansas Children’s Northwest is scheduled to open in January 2018. Comments aAFont Size SPRINGDALE -- Major developments are on schedule for completion in a burgeoning district that has the potential for more growth. Multiple large construction projects are underway along South 56th Street between Don Tyson Parkway and Sunset Avenue, near Arvest Ballpark, including Sam's Club and Arkansas Children's Northwest. Sam's Club is on track to open in late May, said Bill Rogers, vice president of communications and special projects for the Springdale Chamber of Commerce. "Once that development comes online in late May, it really is the next major domino to fall in the development of west Springdale," Rogers said. The city's Planning Commission approved development plans Tuesday for an office building on the northwest corner of South 56th Street and Don Tyson. Sterling Park Anders, the owner and developer of the two-story, 16,000-square-foot office building, said the area between Don Tyson and Sunset has a great future. "I love that location and can't speak highly enough on how Springdale is handling that area," Anders said. "I would expect there will be more built out there. I think that entire corridor up and down through there is fabulous. With the Children's Hospital being there, it's good as well." Increased business development will mean more money for the city. Springdale was home to a Sam's Club from 1987 to mid-2007 before a new store opened in Fayetteville. Losing Sam's caused a major revenue loss for the city, said Wyman Morgan, administrative and financial services director for the city. "The 1-cent sales tax at the Sam's store was generating at least $1 million a year," he said, adding city officials are extremely happy it's returning. "We think it will draw more into the area. We've had to deal with less sales tax per capita than the other three major cities up here, and this will help us gain on that competing advantage." [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news updates and daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] Developing area Mayor Doug Sprouse said a 2012 voter-approved $71 million bond issue paid for development of the Don Tyson Parkway interchange and improvements to South 56th Street, which transformed the street from a two-lane road next to ditches into a four-lane street with a curb, sidewalks and two roundabouts. "It was a complete overhaul," Sprouse said. The improvements were made with an eye to the future, he said. "We knew that the Don Tyson Parkway and 56th Street were an infrastructure priority and would help spur development in the overlay district, which is basically the area from 412 to Don Tyson Parkway and from I-49 to the western city limits," Sprouse said. Patsy Christie, director of the city's planning department, said the city hasn't received plans for anything else in the area, but Rogers said it is an attractive area to potential developers. "We talk with developers on a weekly basis," Rogers said. "We're constantly fielding inquiries, reaching out to potential developers to make sure they are aware of the opportunity that's here." The area between Don Tyson and U.S. 412 is shaping up into an enticing business district, Rogers said. Washington County property records show roughly 833 acres of undeveloped land in the area bordered by Sunset Avenue and Don Tyson Parkway on the north and south and 1-49 and Arkansas 112 to the east and west. "When Arvest Ballpark was built, the only access to the ballpark was a two-lane road from Highway 412 West. That was before the completion of the new I-49 interchange at Don Tyson Parkway," Rogers said. "When you combine that new access to the area with improving 56th Street to a four-lane boulevard, west Springdale now has a transportation infrastructure that can support not only the current growth, but the future growth." The new interchange and the improvements to 56th Street were critical in attracting Sam's and the Children's Hospital, Rogers said. Major projects The exterior of the 139,000-square-foot Sam's Club is complete and work continues on the interior and parking lot, said Mark Byrd, club manager. Many factors went into selecting South 56th Street as the location for the new Sam's Club, said Dianna Gee, senior manager of corporate communications for Sam's Club. "That one (location) is high traffic and off the interstate," Gee said. "It's also based on the need of the community, where we can serve the most members." The new Sam's will feature several innovations, including Scan & Go, a mobile app that allows customers to scan items while they shop and pay on their phone, enabling them to bypass the checkout line and show their digital receipt to an associate when exiting, Gee said. The store has applied for a license to sell beer and wine, Gee said. The site will have a gasoline station, Byrd said. Sam's has initial plans for eight surrounding spaces to be leased to businesses around the club, Rogers said. "They'll get the Sam's Club built before additional developments come in," Rogers said. "The same thing happened with the Walmart Supercenter on Elm Springs Road. It opened before McDonald's was open." The Children's Hospital is on schedule to open in early 2018, Rogers said. The hospital has generated $58.3 million in donations toward development so far, said Jennifer Cobb, director of communications and annual gift channels. The 230,000-square-foot hospital is being built on 37 acres between Arvest Ballpark and I-49. It will have room for 24 inpatient beds, an emergency department, five operating rooms and an outpatient clinic. Hospital officials say it will be an easier access point to the estimated 200,000 children the hospital serves in the 11-counties in the northwest corner of the state. It's expected to cost $427.7 million in construction, technology, equipment and operating expenses over the next five years and to create 250 new jobs.

PHOTO: AFP PublishedFeb 13, 2017, 2:15 pm SGT More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Purchase Article Permalink: http://str.sg/4eUX Copy Martin Khor PETALING JAYA (THE STAR/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A new and deadly form of protectionism is being considered by United States leaders, and it could have devastating effects on the exports and investments of developing countries like Malaysia, as well as destabilising the world economy. The plan, known as a border adjustment tax, would have the effect of taxing imports of goods and services that enter the United States, while also providing a subsidy for US exports which would be exempted from the tax. The proponents' aim is to drastically reduce imports while promoting exports, and thus reduce the huge trade deficit in the US. It fits in with US President Donald Trump's goals to make America great again, to buy American and hire Americans. On the other hand, if adopted, it would depress the competitiveness or viability of other countries' goods. The prices of their exports to the US will have to rise due to the tax effect, depressing their demand and, in the worst case, making them unsaleable. And companies from the US that invested in developing countries because of cheaper costs and then export to the US may find their business affected because their products will cost more. Some will think of relocating back to the US, and investors will be discouraged from opening new factories in developing countries. The border adjustment tax is part of a tax reform bill being drafted by the Republican Party, with Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House of Representatives, being the chief advocate. Trump originally criticised the plan for being "too complicated" but is reportedly now considering it seriously. The proposal has generated tremendous controversy in the US, but also enjoys strong support and some version is expected to be tabled. Originally, Trump favoured the simple imposition of a tariff on products from selected countries, especially China and Mexico. But it is too blatantly protectionist and would surely trigger swift retaliation. The tax works like this. Firstly, as part of the overhaul of the corporate tax system, the expenses of a company on imported goods and services can no longer be deducted from a company's taxable income. The corporate tax rate would be reduced from the present 35 per cent to 20 per cent. The effect is that a 20 per cent tax would be applied to the companies' imports. On the other hand, the new plan allows a firm to deduct revenue from its exports from its taxable income. This would allow the firm to increase its after-tax profit. At the macro level, with imports reduced and exports increased, the US can cut its trade deficit, which is a major aim of the plan. The US is a major export market for many developing countries. It is Malaysia's third largest export market, in 2016 accounting for RM80 billion (S$26 billion) or 10 per cent of total exports An equivalent of 20 per cent tax on these products may render some firms that use or sell them less profitable; and if the prices are forced upwards they may lose competitiveness to substitute products or similar locally made products. American industrial companies are also investors in many developing countries. The tax plan, if implemented, would reduce the incentives for some of these companies for being located abroad as the parent company can no longer claim tax deductions for the goods imported from their subsidiary companies overseas. According to a report in The Star (Feb 6, 2017), speculation on industries relocating to the US is sparking concerns in Malaysia. Major US factories in Malaysia producing electronics would be under watch. Also, electronic and electrical as well as garment companies in Malaysia, which are mainly sub-contractors for multinational companies, may be affected should they decide to bring back manufacturing jobs to the US. The plan is bound to generate outrage from its trading partners in both South and North. They may take cases against the US at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), which is likely to rule against the Americans. The new tax deduction system discriminates against imports, thus violating the WTO rules of non-discrimination. The exemption of income tax for export sales would most likely be assessed as an export subsidy prohibited by the WTO subsidy agreement. However, it can take three to four years for a case in the WTO to be finally settled. Meanwhile, the US can continue with its laws and practices and reap the benefits. Another possibility is that Trump may make good his threat to leave the WTO if important cases go against it. That would cause a major crisis for multilateral trade. There are many critics of the plan. Larry Summers, a former US Treasury Secretary, warns that the tax change will worsen inequality, place punitive burdens on import-intensive sectors and companies, and harm the global economy. The tax plan is expected to cause a 15-20 per cent rise in the US dollar. "This would do huge damage to dollar debtors all over the world and provoke financial crises in some emerging markets," according to Summers. US retail companies like Walmart are strongly against it, and an influential Republican, Steven Forbes, owner of Forbes magazine, has called the plan "insane". It is not yet clear what Trump's final position will be. If he finds it too difficult to use, because of the effect on some American companies and sectors, he might opt for the simpler use of tariffs. In any case, whether tariffs or border taxes, policy makers and companies and employees in developing countries should pay attention to the trade policies being cooked up in Washington and voice their opinions. Otherwise they may wake up to a world where their products are blocked from the US, the world's largest market, and where the companies that were once so happy to make money in their countries suddenly pack up and return home. The writer is executive director of the South Centre, an independent inter-governmental think-tank of developing countries based in Geneva.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 13 February 2017 | MYT 2:30 PM Why Trump can’t bully China by kenneth rogoff But some would argue that beneath the chaos and bluster, there is an economic rationale to the Trump administration’s disorderly retreat from globalization. CAMBRIDGE: As US President Donald Trump proceeds to destabilise the post-war global economic order, much of the world is collectively holding its breath.  Commentators search for words to describe his assault on conventional norms of leadership and tolerance in a modern liberal democracy.  The mainstream media, faced with a president who might sometimes be badly uninformed and yet really believes what he is saying, hesitate to label conspicuously false statements as lies.  But some would argue that beneath the chaos and bluster, there is an economic rationale to the Trump administration’s disorderly retreat from globalization.  According to this view, the US has been duped into enabling China’s ascendency, and one day Americans will come to regret it. We economists tend to view abdication of US world leadership as a historic mistake.  It is important to acknowledge that the roots of the anti-globalization movement in the United States run much deeper than disenfranchised blue-collar workers.  For example, some economists opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a 12-country trade deal that would have covered 40% of the global economy) on the questionable grounds that it would have harmed American workers.  It fact, the TPP would have opened Japan far more than it would have affected the US. Rejecting it only opens the door to Chinese economic dominance across the Pacific.  US populists, perhaps inspired by the writings of Thomas Piketty, seem unimpressed by the fact that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in China and India into the global middle class.  The liberal view of Asia’s rise is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place, where a person’s economic fate does not depend quite so much on where they happen to have been born.  But a more cynical view permeates populist logic, namely that in its excessive adherence to globalism, the US has sown the seeds of its own political and economic destruction.  Trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality; here is someone who thinks he can do something about it. The aim is not just to “bring home” American jobs, but to create a system that will extend US dominance.  “We should focus on our own” is the mantra of Trump and others. Unfortunately, with this attitude, it is hard to see how America can maintain the world order that has benefited it so much for so many decades.  And make no mistake: America has been the big winner. No other large country is nearly as rich, and the US middle class is still very well off by global standards.  Yes, Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right.  He might have mentioned, however, that Denmark is a relatively homogeneous country of 5.6 million people that has very low tolerance for immigration.  For better or for worse, the globalization train has long since left the station, and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naive.  Whatever might have been done differently before US President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972 is no longer possible.  The fate of China, and its role in the world, is now in the hands of the Chinese and their leaders. If the Trump administration thinks it can reset the clock by starting a trade war with China, it is as likely to accelerate China’s economic and military development as it is to slow it down.  So far, the Trump administration has only sparred with China, concentrating its early anti-trade rhetoric on Mexico.  Although the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump reviles, has likely had only modest effects on US trade and jobs, he has attempted to humiliate Mexicans insisting that they pay for his border wall, as if Mexico were a US colony.  The US is ill-advised to destabilize its Latin American neighbors. In the near term, Mexican institutions should prove quite robust; but in the long run, Trumpism, by encouraging anti-American sentiment, will undermine leaders otherwise sympathetic to US interests.  If the Trump administration tries such crude tactics with China, it will be in for a rude surprise. China has financial weapons, including trillions of dollars of US debt.  A disruption of trade with China could lead to massive price increases in the low-cost stores – for example, Wal-Mart and Target – on which many Americans rely.  Moreover, huge swaths of Asia, from Taiwan to India, are vulnerable to Chinese aggression. For the moment, China’s military is relatively weak and would likely lose a conventional war with the US; but this situation is rapidly evolving, and China may soon have its own aircraft carriers and other more advanced military capabilities.  The US cannot “win” a trade war with China, and any victory will be Pyrrhic. The US needs to negotiate hard with China to protect its friends in Asia and deal with the rogue state of North Korea.  And the best way to get the good deals Trump says he seeks is to pursue a more open trade policy with China, not a destructive trade war.  Kenneth Rogoff, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University and recipient of the 2011 Deutsche Bank Prize in Financial Economics, was the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund from 2001 to 2003.

The liberal view of Asia’s rise is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place, where a person’s economic fate does not depend quite so much on where they happen to have been born. But a more cynical view permeates populist logic, namely that in its excessive adherence to globalism, the United States has sown the seeds of its own political and economic destruction. Trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality; here is someone who thinks he can do something about it. The aim is not just to “bring home” American jobs, but also to create a system that will extend US dominance.

Sign up for more newsletters here “We should focus on our own” is the mantra of Trump and others. Unfortunately, with this attitude, it is hard to see how America can maintain the world order that has benefited it so much for so many decades. And make no mistake: America has been the big winner. No other large country is nearly as rich, and the US middle class is still very well off by global standards. View Story The balance sheet on ‘America First’ There is one truth in Trump’s ideas but several dangerous myths. Yes, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right. He might have mentioned, however, that Denmark is a relatively homogeneous country of 5.6 million people that has very low tolerance for immigration. For better or for worse, the globalization train has long since left the station, and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naive. Whatever might have been done differently before President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972 is no longer possible. The fate of China, and its role in the world, is now in the hands of the Chinese and their leaders. If the Trump administration thinks it can reset the clock by starting a trade war with China, it is as likely to accelerate China’s economic and military development as it is to slow it down. Advertisement So far, the Trump administration has only sparred with China, concentrating its early anti-trade rhetoric on Mexico. Although the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump reviles, has likely had only modest effects on US trade and jobs, he has attempted to humiliate Mexicans, insisting that they pay for his border wall, as if Mexico were a US colony. The United States is ill-advised to destabilize its Latin American neighbors. In the near term, Mexican institutions should prove quite robust; but in the long run, Trumpism, by encouraging anti-American sentiment, will undermine leaders otherwise sympathetic to US interests. If the Trump administration tries such crude tactics with China, it will be in for a rude surprise. China has financial weapons, including trillions of dollars of US debt. A disruption of trade with China could lead to massive price increases in the low-cost stores — for example, Walmart and Target — on which many Americans rely. Moreover, huge swaths of Asia, from Taiwan to India, are vulnerable to Chinese aggression. For the moment, China’s military is relatively weak and would probably lose a conventional war with the United States; but this situation is rapidly evolving, and China may soon have its own aircraft carriers and other more advanced military capabilities. The United States cannot “win” a trade war with China, and any victory will be Pyrrhic. The United States needs to negotiate hard with China to protect its friends in Asia and deal with the rogue state of North Korea. And the best way to get the good deals Trump says he seeks is to pursue a more open trade policy with China, not a destructive trade war.

But the current back seat driver could grab the wheel for at least two days in the coming week, when Fed Chair Janet Yellen testifies before Senate and House committees on the economy and Fed policy. "Certainly investors are paying close attention and given the fact the VIX (.VIX) is … at some crazy low number, it's possible we see a volatility pop," said Jack Ablin, CIO of BMO Private Bank. The VIX, the CBOE's volatility index, was at a low reading of 10 on Friday, indicating to some a high level of market complacency, as stocks leap to record highs. "Just like last year, they [the Fed] started the year with a forecast where were going to have four rate hikes, and we got one. I think the same thing this year. Her rhetoric could be construed as hawkish but with very little action," said Ablin. On Wall Street, traders are waiting to hear if Yellen signals that the Fed is on track to raise interest rates three times this year, as it forecasts, and the timing of when it might next move. Analysts also expect to hear pointed questions aimed at the Fed's own policies and what Yellen thinks about potential new tax policy, fiscal stimulus, banking deregulation and efforts to exert new supervision over the Fed itself. Ablin expects Yellen to be circumspect, given the scrutiny of the Fed and unknowns about the shape and timing of Washington policy. "I actually think Trump and Yellen are on the same page. I think they want the same thing. 'Let the economy run hot and drag your feet raising rates.' I don't see a lot of controversy. The controversy could be around the independence of the Fed and [Sen.] Rand Paul wanting to audit the Fed," he said. There are also a few important economic reports in the week ahead, with CPI inflation data and retail sales Wednesday. There are some major earnings including PepsiCo (PEP), Cisco, Kraft Heinz (KHC) and AIG. Trump, of course, will stay a top focus, as he has since before his first day in office. In the past week, he shook markets out of their doldrums by promising Thursday he would provide details on tax reform in the next two to three weeks. That launched a stock market rally that took major indexes to record highs, put a bid under the dollar and drove bond yields higher. It also turned the market focus back to the programs that helped propel stocks higher since the election — not the recent controversies around immigration, trade and his daughter's clothing line. "I think we'll just wait for the tax stuff to come out and we'll wait for other stuff. I still think the market could go up in the meantime. I think the equity market is now the new Nielsen ratings for Trump," said Ablin. "That's his barometer … between tweets and remarks." Trump meets with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday, after spending the weekend with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In the past week, Trump also made conciliatory comments to China's President Xi Jinping about the country's One China Policy regarding Taiwan. That reduced some market concern that Trump will steer the U.S. into a trade war with China. Key stock indexes in the past week all closed at record highs. The Dow (.DJI) gained 1 percent for the week, ending at 20,269. The S&P 500 (.SPX) was up 0.8 percent at 2,316, and the Nasdaq (.IXIC) was at 5,734, up 1.2 percent for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was fairly active during the week, at 2.40 percent Friday after touching a low of around 2.32 percent Wednesday. Gold futures for April, rallying most of the week, sold off in the final two U.S. sessions but ended up 1.2 percent at $1,235.90 per ounce. Oil bottomed hard mid-week on worries of oversupply but bounced back to end the week flat, with West Texas Intermediate futures for March at $53.86 per barrel. As for the Fed, the markets have been at odds with the Fed's forecast and its own expectations. Wall Street is skeptical the Fed can hike three times this year, and targets more like two rate hikes. "[Yellen's] always a market moving event, but I feel like basically there's no upside, there's no reason for her to come out and use this as an opportunity to launch the Fed's pace, or trajectory for the Fed's balance sheet. It's too early," said George Goncalves, head of rates strategy at Nomura. Besides rate hikes, the Fed has been discussing the future of its program of replacing securities on its balance sheet as they mature. That is not seen as an immediate issue for the Fed, but it has gotten the market's attention since the Fed signaled it was discussing it several months ago. There also has been a debate within the bond market over whether the Fed could signal that it could raise rates at its March meeting, seen as unlikely by most Fed watchers. Expectations for March were further dampened when the Fed gave no indication in its Feb. 1 statement that it was ready to move, and the weak wage growth in the January jobs report lessened expectations for inflation — and Fed rate hikes. Goncalves said Yellen would not want to be boxed in by pointing to any time frame for a hike, thought the markets expect a June move. "If the outlook is so rosy and so robust and they're feeling they are behind the curve, they could ramp up three hikes in the second half of the year. March is not going to be an insurance hike to start the process for 2017. You just don't do that to get the ball rolling. You do it when you have more confidence in the outlook … It's all about confidence. Not confidence around [Trump], just confidence about what's going to be delivered on the government side," he said. The Trump tax plan will also remain top of mind for markets, and there now is a wait-and-see on what he will propose — a similar plan to the House Republicans, which includes a border adjustment tax, or something else. The controversial border-adjustment tax would be a key way to pay for the corporate tax cut, which under Speaker Paul Ryan's plan would take the corporate rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. It basically taxes imports at a 20 percent rate but there would be no tax on exports. "There's just uneasiness in the senate over this. This is going to be a roller coaster ride," said Daniel Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas. The House plan proposes a one-time repatriation of the $2 trillion in corporate cash stashed overseas, full expensing of capital equipment and a limit on deductability of interest. But without the border adjusted tax, or destination tax, the plan would not carry a tax rate as low as 20 percent. Many S&P companies already have tax rates in the low 20s percent. Congress is lining up on both sides of the border-adjustment tax, and so are companies, with industrial companies like GE and Caterpillar (CAT) in favor of it and retailers, like Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT) against it. "It's like 'Hunger Games' for tax lobbyists now," said Clifton. "If you're negatively impacted by the border tax, you're pushing the net interest deductibility." Limiting interest deductibility would be a negative for financial firms. Clifton said the market may not get what it's looking for in Trump's tax plan. "This is: They promise something big, but it's not meaty," Clifton said.

Sachs Trump and the Doomsday Clock E-Mail Share via e-mail To Add a message Your e-mail Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Comments Print The Boston Globe Tweet Share Daniel Hertzberg for The Boston Globe By Jeffrey D. Sachs   February 12, 2017 The most chilling concern about Donald Trump is the worldwide fear that he puts our very survival at risk. This is not loose talk or partisanship. It was recently expressed by the most thoughtful experts who monitor the risks to our survival: The Science and Security Board of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who are the keepers of the Doomsday Clock. These experts have just told the world it is “Two and a half minutes to midnight,” where midnight signifies the end of civilization. This is the closest to doom since 1953, when both the United States and Russia first possessed thermonuclear weapons capable of destroying the world. Let’s not panic. Instead, let’s think, plan, and act. As President John F. Kennedy famously declared, “Our problems are manmade — therefore, they can be solved by man.” The problem of Donald Trump can be solved too, by the institutions of American democracy and the international rule of law. Advertisement The Doomsday Clock was created 70 years ago, in the early days of the Cold War and the nuclear weapons race between the United States and the Soviet Union. For the first time in human history, mankind possessed the means of causing not only great carnage and suffering, but also the very destruction of humanity. The early generation of atomic scientists recognized the profound and unprecedented dangers of the new weapons and sought to warn the world. In the first edition of the clock, in 1947, they set the it to seven minutes before midnight, nuclear Armageddon. As the Cold War intensified, and atomic bombs gave way to vastly more powerful thermonuclear bombs, the minute hand moved five minutes closer to midnight. When JFK came into office he powerfully expressed the existential paradox of modernity. “For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life.” We never came closer to the end than in the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, when mistakes by both the United States and the Soviet Union led the world to the very brink of nuclear war. In 1963, brilliant diplomacy by Kennedy, supported by the moral leadership of Pope John XXIII and the bold statesmanship of Nikita Khrushchev, led to the signing of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Humanity was spared. The minute hand of the Doomsday Clock moved back to 12 minutes before midnight, a margin of safety. Get Arguable with Jeff Jacoby in your inbox: Our conservative columnist offers a weekly take on everything from politics to pet peeves. Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here With America’s escalation of the Vietnam War under Lyndon Johnson, the minute hand began to move once again toward midnight, while Richard Nixon’s “detente” with the Soviet Union again reduced the tensions and put the minute hand back to 12 minutes before midnight. Then tensions escalated with Ronald Reagan’s new arms buildup, until Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev launched the process of political and economic reform, perestroika, that culminated in the end of the Cold War and the end of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. Humanity had, it seemed, reached a moment of relative safety; the minute hand stood at 17 minutes before midnight that year. View Story The cancer on the Trump presidency Trump’s Russia connection and his abundant business conflicts cannot be ignored. Yet if ever a historic opportunity for safety was squandered, this was it. Every US president since then — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama — has contributed to a decline of global safety, with the minute-hand moving from 17 minutes before midnight to just three minutes before midnight last year, even before Donald Trump became president. And after just a few days in office, Trump has contributed to another 30-second jump of the minute-hand toward midnight. What went wrong between 1991 and now? Two grave mistakes. The first was the failure to capitalize on the end of the Cold War by establishing a trustworthy relationship between the United States and Russia. While most Americans would blame Vladimir Putin for that, they should follow the Gospel advice of Jesus: “You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.” Instead of working with Russia after 1991, the United States unilaterally asserted its military power, expanding NATO toward Russia’s borders and invading several countries in the Middle East. The Cold War was revived, not ended. Advertisement The second mistake was to turn a blind eye to the second existential threat: human-induced global warming. While the threat from nuclear weapons was easy enough to perceive (though also easy to forget day to day), the existential threat from human-induced climate change was far more difficult. To understand it requires at least a basic awareness of quantum physics, the Earth’s physical dynamics, and Earth’s climate and economic history. Our presidents and Congress have lacked that. They understand money from lobbyists — oil and gas companies — not quantum physics. There are dire risks of our continued burning of coal, oil, and gas. When these fossil fuels are burned, they emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has the special quantum-mechanical property that it absorbs infrared radiation and thereby acts as a kind of atmospheric “greenhouse” for Earth, causing the planet to warm. This is of course clear to atmospheric chemists but not to most politicians. The science and Earth history also make clear that we are recklessly gambling with future survival. The ocean level could rise by 20 feet or more as a result of even slight further increases in temperature. Only a fool would say that since such an outcome is not completely certain, we should simply continue to burn fossil fuels at the maximum rate. After just a few days as president, Trump induced the atomic scientists to move the minute-hand another 30 seconds toward midnight. They explained their unprecedented move as follows: “The board’s decision to move the clock less than a full minute — something it has never before done — reflects a simple reality: As this statement is issued, Donald Trump has been the US president only a matter of days. Many of his Cabinet nominations are not yet confirmed by the Senate or installed in government, and he has had little time to take official action. Just the same, words matter, and President Trump has had plenty to say over the last year. Both his statements and his actions as president-elect have broken with historical precedent in unsettling ways.’’ They then cite Trump’s recklessness both toward nuclear weapons and climate change. On nuclear weapons, Trump has casually suggested that Japan and Korea should become nuclear powers; that a new nuclear-arms race is welcome; and that the use of nuclear weapons (e.g., in regard to ISIS) is not “off the table.” Yes, for every statement such as these, there are equal and opposite statements as well. There is, in short, casualness, inconsistency, and incoherence. On climate change, the inconsistencies are not the problem; denial is. Trump has completely turned his administration’s environmental policies over to the oil and gas industry. The State Department is now in the hands of ExxonMobil; the Environmental Protection Agency is in the hands of politicians like Scott Pruitt, long financed by the fossil-fuel industry. The word on Capitol Hill is simple: The mega-billionaire Koch brothers, who own the nation’s largest private fossil-fuel company, own Congress, or at least the Republican side. Trump is a bully whose bluster is designed to intimidate and wrong-foot a foe, and in Trump’s worldview, just about everybody is a foe. As he has famously explained, in an attitude inherited from his father, there are “killers” and there are “losers.” The bluster is designed to put Killer Trump ahead of the losers. The key to survival in the Trump era is to look past the bluster, face down the bullying, and prevent Trump’s poorly controlled emotions from guiding the policies of the United States on these life-and-death issues. Despite the bravado of the flood of executive orders, most of them are mere statements of intent, not legally binding instruments. The courts will have their say; and the regulatory agencies must follow rigorous procedures to change existing regulations, all of which are subject to court review and congressional supervision. This is not to say that bullies do not get their way; they can. But bullies only get their way when others back down. Trump’s recklessness can be checked in five ways. First, the courts will scrutinize these poorly prepared and ill-considered executive orders; many will be quashed. The Muslim ban on entry to the United States is now on hold, perhaps never to be implemented. Every one of Trump’s early executive orders is likely to face court challenges and prolonged litigation. Second, it will just take a few patriotic Republican senators joining with the Democrats to put a stop to Trump’s mad rush of recklessness. Will Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham, Susan Collins, Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski, or Ron Paul, among others, really stand by if Trump acts recklessly brings us to the brink of nuclear war? Or would these and other senators allow the corruption and greed of the Senate to gut the Paris Climate Agreement? Of course, that’s possible, but these senators have children and grandchildren too, and most are not as stupid as their party’s official position on climate change. Third, Trump is rapidly uniting the world — against the United States. Within just two weeks of office, Trump had the European Union president listing the Trump administration alongside Russia, China, and the Middle East as threats to the European Union. China’s President Xi Jinping has offered to take up the internationalist mantle that Trump is so eager to relinquish. Almost all of the world is also united in urging the handful of nuclear-weapons countries to honor their solemn obligations, under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, to take concrete steps toward nuclear disarmament, and not to instigate a renewed and dangerous arms race. Fourth, while consumers have little sway over nuclear weapons, they have considerable sway over climate change. America’s brand names need to be put on notice: If you cower to the Koch Brothers, American Petroleum Institute, and Chamber of Commerce, you will pay a price. General Electric, are you with us or against us on saving the planet? How about you, Pepsi, Walmart, IBM, Walt Disney, GM, and other companies on Trump’s “strategic and policy forum”? Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has already walked out of the forum because of Trump’s Muslim travel ban. For those who remain, the millennial generation of consumers will soon walk out on you if you are accomplices to Trump’s attempt to gut the treaty agreements restricting global warming and the domestic regulations to implement them. Fifth, of course, is electoral politics. In moments of pessimism, it may seem that Trump will trample American democracy, thereby preventing a course correction in 2020 or earlier. Yet Trump is no Caesar or Augustus, and America is no republican Rome on the verge of succumbing to dictatorship. No doubt Trump can do great damage; our institutional checks and balances have been gravely weakened by decades of rule by the military-industrial-intelligence complex. Presidents indeed have the power to launch wars, even secret ones run by the CIA and special ops units that can kill vast numbers of innocents. Yet the first days of Trump’s mayhem show that the American people, and our political institutions, are not ready to accede to bullies. I’m counting on the millennials to lead the way. Jeffrey D.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 February 2017 by Military News 2 Billion-Dollar Marijuana Stocks That Could Soar Even Higher You could have made plenty of money investing in the right marijuana stocks last year. Most, however, are small companies without much of a track record. Investing in these stocks is highly speculative, to say the least. A few of these companies, though, have grown large enough to reach market caps of $1 billion or more. GW Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: GWPH) claims a market cap of nearly $3 billion, while Canopy Growth Corporation ‘s(NASDAQOTH: TWMJF) stands right at $1 billion. Here’s why these two billion-dollar marijuana stocks could soar even higher in 2017. Image source: Getty Images. Enthusiastic about Epidiolex One press release was all it took to catapult GW Pharmaceuticals’ market cap above the magic billion-dollar mark. On March 14, 2016, the biotech announced great results from its first late-stage clinical study of its lead cannabinoid drug Epidiolex in treating Dravet syndrome. Children with the severe form of epilepsy in the study who took Epidiolex were much less likely to experience convulsive seizures than were children on placebo. That was just the beginning for GW Pharmaceuticals. The company announced results from another late-stage study in June, this time for Epidiolex in treating Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a rare and severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy. GW’s cannabinoid drug again helped dramatically reduce seizures. Results from a second study of Epidiolex in treating LGS caused GW Pharmaceuticals’ market cap to jump above $3 billion. Those results, announced in September, showed significant reduction in seizures for children taking a low dose of the drug (10 mg/kg/day) and a higher dose (20 mg/kg/day). Based on these three successful clinical studies, GW Pharmaceuticals is moving forward with filing for regulatory approval of Epidiolex in the United States. The company expects to submit a new drug application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2017. Winning FDA approval would no doubt send GW Pharmaceuticals’ shares even higher. Assuming the company does obtain that approval, the U.S. commercial launch for Epidiolex should come sometime in 2018. GW will have to wait on scheduling of the drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency before marketing Epidiolex. The company hopes Epidiolex will be placed into Schedule 4, which applies to all drugs with low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence. Rapping presence Canopy Growth Corporation is one of the largest providers of medical marijuana in Canada. The company is best known for its Tweed brand of marijuana. For most of last year, Canopy Growth’s market cap hovered around the $300 million level. That changed on Oct. 6, 2016, when the company announced the Canadian commercial launch of the Leafs by Snoop marijuana brand with famous rapper Snoop Dogg. Canopy Growth’s market cap surged over the next couple of months, surpassing $1 billion by the middle of November. Since then, the stock has given up some of its gains. The company’s valuation is just below $1 billion. Canopy Growth first forged a deal with Snoop Dogg in February 2016. Snoop’s company, LBC Holdings, received cash, royalties, and shares of Canopy Growth as part of the deal. The Leafs by Snoop brand was already on the market in Colorado, but the agreement allowed Canopy Growth to bring it to the Canadian market for the first time. The Canadian government currently requires authorization by a healthcare practitioner for a person to legally obtain marijuana. Canopy Growth is one of several companies licensed by the government to provide medical marijuana. However, Canada could potentially legalize marijuana in the coming months. Should restrictions on marijuana be lifted, Canopy Growth’s partnership with Snoop Dogg could give it a leg up in gaining market share. Big risks GW Pharmaceuticals and Canopy Growth Corporation carry some of the largest market caps among marijuana stocks, but they’re not without significant risks. For GW Pharmaceuticals, the first hurdle to overcome is winning FDA approval. Assuming the company gains that approval, it must successfully launch Epidiolex, including persuading payers to cover the drug. For Canopy Growth, the primary risk is that the Canadian government chooses against legalization of marijuana. Even if laws are changed, there’s always a risk that other competitors will be more successful. Probably the biggest risk for both of these marijuana stocks, though, is that their valuation becomes greater than their financial prospects warrant. This problem isn’t as great for GW Pharmaceuticals, in my view. I think Epidiolex, if approved, could generate peak annual sales of at least $1 billion — enough to easily justify GW’s stock going higher than current levels. Canopy Growth, on the other hand, made less than $12 million in revenue in the six months ending Sept. 30, 2016. Even if we assumed tremendous sales growth this year, a market cap near $1 billion is tough to defend for this stock. That doesn’t mean Canopy Growth’s shares won’t go higher. I wouldn’t be surprised if they did.

The supermarket chain will spend $1.6 billion to spruce up its US stores while keeping prices down, reports Bloomberg. The effort is targeted at big grocers like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, even though the latter is technically a corporate cousin. The German chain also plans to open 650 new stores across the US, in order to have about 2,000 by the end of next year, per Consumerist. A favorite of millennials because of its low prices, Aldi has already renovated 300 stores by adding sleeker displays, windows that allow more natural light, higher ceilings, and a wider first aisle. The company also plans to add more organic produce, fresh meat, and alcohol options. The company says the facelift delivers on "customers’ desire for a modern and convenient shopping experience with a focus on fresh items." Business Insider points out that Aldi's new look is quite similar to the wide aisles and soft lights of 365, the low-cost chain Whole Food started to compete with the likes of Aldi. Despite the progress, Aldi faces faces a tough battle in its goal to have 60 million monthly shoppers by 2020, up from 40 million now. Grocery industry sales are essentially flat, projected to rise only .2% this year and 1% or less over the next five years, per Bloomberg. Supermarkets are increasingly feeling the heat of low-cost, all-around sellers like Walmart and Amazon. "For the typical US grocery store, there’s just too much square footage right now," one analyst tells Bloomberg.

Username Feb 12, 2017 1:33 PM CST I used to go to Germany for work a lot and there was an Aldi halfway between the office and the S-Bahn station. To this day no realizes that all those great food and alcohol souvenirs that they loved so much all came from Aldi. I still have some bottles kicking around. I think I'll pour myself some Kirschwasser and watch the snow come down.

Photo - Reuters file   Sharelines Why Trump can’t bully China #Why Trump can’t bully China As US President Donald Trump proceeds to destabilize the post-war global economic order, much of the world is collectively holding its breath. Commentators search for words to describe his assault on conventional norms of leadership and tolerance in a modern liberal democracy. The mainstream media, faced with a president who might sometimes be badly uninformed and yet really believes what he is saying, hesitate to label conspicuously false statements as lies. But some would argue that beneath the chaos and bluster, there is an economic rationale to the Trump administration’s disorderly retreat from globalization. According to this view, the US has been duped into enabling China’s ascendency, and one day Americans will come to regret it. We economists tend to view abdication of US world leadership as a historic mistake. It is important to acknowledge that the roots of the anti-globalization movement in the United States run much deeper than disenfranchised blue-collar workers. For example, some economists opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (a 12-country trade deal that would have covered 40 per cent of the global economy) on the questionable grounds that it would have harmed American workers. It fact, the TPP would have opened Japan far more than it would have affected the US. Rejecting it only opens the door to Chinese economic dominance across the Pacific. US populists, perhaps inspired by the writings of Thomas Piketty, seem unimpressed by the fact that globalization has lifted hundreds of millions of desperately poor people in China and India into the global middle class. The liberal view of Asia’s rise is that it makes the world a fairer and more just place, where a person’s economic fate does not depend quite so much on where they happen to have been born. But a more cynical view permeates populist logic, namely that in its excessive adherence to globalism, the US has sown the seeds of its own political and economic destruction. Trumpism taps into this sense of national mortality; here is someone who thinks he can do something about it. The aim is not just to “bring home” American jobs, but to create a system that will extend US dominance. “We should focus on our own” is the mantra of Trump and others. Unfortunately, with this attitude, it is hard to see how America can maintain the world order that has benefited it so much for so many decades. And make no mistake: America has been the big winner. No other large country is nearly as rich, and the US middle class is still very well off by global standards. Yes, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was right that Denmark is a great place to live and does many things right. He might have mentioned, however, that Denmark is a relatively homogeneous country of 5.6 million people that has very low tolerance for immigration. For better or for worse, the globalization train has long since left the station, and the idea that one can turn it back is utterly naive. Whatever might have been done differently before US president Richard Nixon visited China in 1972 is no longer possible. The fate of China, and its role in the world, is now in the hands of the Chinese and their leaders. If the Trump administration thinks it can reset the clock by starting a trade war with China, it is as likely to accelerate China’s economic and military development as it is to slow it down. So far, the Trump administration has only sparred with China, concentrating its early anti-trade rhetoric on Mexico. Although the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump reviles, has likely had only modest effects on US trade and jobs, he has attempted to humiliate Mexicans insisting that they pay for his border wall, as if Mexico were a US colony. The US is ill-advised to destabilize its Latin American neighbours. In the near term, Mexican institutions should prove quite robust; but in the long run, Trumpism, by encouraging anti-American sentiment, will undermine leaders otherwise sympathetic to US interests. If the Trump administration tries such crude tactics with China, it will be in for a rude surprise. China has financial weapons, including trillions of dollars of US debt. A disruption of trade with China could lead to massive price increases in the low-cost stores – for example, Wal-Mart and Target – on which many Americans rely. Moreover, huge swaths of Asia, from Taiwan to India, are vulnerable to Chinese aggression. For the moment, China’s military is relatively weak and would likely lose a conventional war with the US; but this situation is rapidly evolving, and China may soon have its own aircraft carriers and other more advanced military capabilities. The US cannot “win” a trade war with China, and any victory will be Pyrrhic. The US needs to negotiate hard with China to protect its friends in Asia and deal with the rogue state of North Korea. And the best way to get the good deals Trump says he seeks is to pursue a more open trade policy with China, not a destructive trade war. - Project Syndicate < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.
