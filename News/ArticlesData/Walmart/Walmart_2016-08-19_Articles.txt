Updated: November 23, 2016 @ 11:54 am Full Forecast top right promo - flex2 featured Target cuts outlook as it sees fewer customers in stores ANNE D'INNOCENZIO, Associated Press Aug 19, 2016 (…) NEW YORK — Target Corp. cut its profit forecast and a key sales outlook Wednesday as it saw fewer customers in its stores and acknowledged it didn't push the second part of its "Expect More, Pay Less" slogan. The Minneapolis-based discounter's second-quarter net income fell nearly 10 percent, though that was better than what most had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.1 percent, reversing seven straight quarters of gains. Its main competitor, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., reports results Thursday. Target's shares fell $4.74, or 6 percent, to $70.74 in afternoon trading. Customer traffic fell for the first time in a year and a half as Target struggled to get its grocery offerings right and shoppers looking for deals on essentials like detergent were turned off. Other issues, both company-specific and industrywide, ranged from a lack of new electronics for sale and lingering disruptions caused by the sale last year of its pharmacy business to CVS. Sales by markets also varied, with weakness on the East Coast but pockets of strength in California. "Our No. 1 focus is driving traffic back to our stores and accelerating business to our site," Chief Executive Brian Cornell said. Target joins retailers such as department store chain Macy's that are struggling with fewer customers coming in as shoppers buy more online. The bright spots in retail have been T.J. Maxx's parent company TJX Cos. and Home Depot as consumers look for clothing bargains and focus more on their homes. Under Cornell, Target has been trying to reinvigorate itself restore its cheap-chic status after a series of headline-grabbing setbacks such as a 2013 data breach. It's focusing on categories like fashion, home furnishings and wellness products, creating vignettes featuring home products and launching the children's line Cat & Jack. But striking the right balance between stylish clothing and bedspreads while offering toothpaste and detergent at good prices has been tricky. "Our progress in apparel and home has been really significant," said Cornell. "And we've got to make sure we never lose track of the other side of our brand promise and that's the "Pay Less" side. And that's all about those core household essentials that we have to make sure are presented effectively." To boost sales and traffic, Target plans to increase marketing for its essentials and work with key vendors like Apple to push more innovation and to also improve presentations. Apple product sales were down 20 percent and the electronics department was a "significant drag," Cornell said. Target is still struggling, however, to reinvent its food section — an area where Wal-Mart is particularly strong. Grocery sales represent about 20 percent of Target's total business but it has seen disappointing results from perishables like fruits and vegetables. Its nonperishable items have been doing well, and it's marketing more organic, natural or gluten-free products. Yarbrough noted that Target faces stiff competition on the low end from Wal-Mart, which is focusing on lowering prices further, and at the high end from the likes of stores like Whole Foods and others. "Grocery is going to be more difficult to fix," said Brian P. Yarbrough, a senior analyst at the Edward Jones investment firm, which downgraded Target's stock to "hold" from a "buy" rating Wednesday. "They're not a destination for food. They don't offer a whole suite of products." While nowhere near the online volume of Amazon, Target is expanding its online services. It's doubling the number of stores that will be used to ship products directly to online shoppers' homes, which will result in speedier deliveries. Online sales rose 16 percent in the second quarter, lower than the 23 percent gain in the first quarter. Target also is spending to modify some stores after an outcry from some customers about its policy of allowing transgender customers and staff to use the bathrooms that identifies with their gender identity.

Target's online sales growth is slowing while Wal-Mart's has ticked up. Adam Levy (adamlevy) Aug 20, 2016 at 4:00PM Image source: Getty Images. Every year, consumers do more and more of their shopping online. Global online sales grew about 25% last year, according to eMarketer. But some big-box retailers are having trouble keeping up with the market's rapid growth. Target (NYSE:TGT) grew its online sales just 16% last quarter. That's a decline from 30% a year ago. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), among the largest online retailers in the world, grew online sales just 12% last quarter. That's actually an improvement from the previous two quarters when it reported single-digit online sales growth. Both companies are now trailing Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) sales growth, which has accelerated over the last two years. Source: Target, Wal-Mart, Amazon financial reports The steep declines in Target's online sales growth indicate that it's on the same path as Wal-Mart when it comes to digital sales. That's bad news for investors. Here's why. Comparable-sales growth depends on online sales During the fourth quarter last year, Target managed to increase its online sales 34%. Those sales contributed 1.3 percentage points to the company's comparable-store sales growth of 1.9%. With the deceleration in online sales growth to 16% last quarter, comparable store-sales fell 1.1%. Digital sales only contributed 0.5 percentage points to Target's comparable sales growth. Target expects comparable sales to stay negative during the third and fourth quarters. Continued deceleration in online sales will emphasize the decline in foot traffic and sales in Target's brick-and-mortar stores. CEO Brian Cornell told analysts during the second-quarter earnings call that the "number one challenge was traffic." Target must compete against other retailers like Wal-Mart to attract customers to their stores when they could simply go online. Wal-Mart is winning the battle here, having increased traffic to its stores seven straight quarters. Last quarter, traffic increased 1.2% at Wal-Mart's stores. Big investments ahead? Wal-Mart just spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com, a relatively small e-commerce company that launched last year. On top of that, Wal-Mart plans to spend $900 million on its regular e-commerce operations this year and $1.1 billion next year. Those are steep increases from the $700 million the company spent on e-commerce in 2015. It may be too early to tell if Wal-Mart's investments are paying off. Online sales growth recovered last quarter, but growth was still slower than the second quarter of 2015. Target, meanwhile, has already committed to increasing its spend on technology and supply chain infrastructure to support its online sales. The company is investing $1.8 billion in improvements, up from $1 billion last year. Starting in 2017 it expects to invest $2 billion to $2.5 billion per year. Those are significant increases in investments, especially considering the lack of revenue growth at the retailer. But both Target and Amazon are going head-to-head with Amazon in online sales. Amazon continues to invest in growing its retail operations. Amazon spent $1.7 billion on capital expenditures last quarter alone, although a big part of that went to support its AWS cloud computing platform. Still, Amazon is investing in more fulfillment centers to support its growing Prime membership. It's also investing in improving the Prime benefits beyond two-day shipping. On top of all that, Amazon is working to develop new private-label products to undercut pricing at Wal-Mart and Target, which both stock their own private labels as well. Target's ability to capitalize on its investments in online sales will start to show over the next few quarters, but it might not be long before we see online sales growth dip into single digits, putting further pressure on comparable-store sales growth. If Target becomes desperate, we could see it move to make a big acquisition of smaller online retailers or develop strategic partnerships to bolster online sales. Adam Levy owns shares of Amazon.com.

Skip to content INFORMATION NIGERIA Nigeria's No.1 Information Portal Menu Home Trending Metro Entertainment Music Lifestyle Sports World Odd News Education Jobs Man Loses 300 Pounds By Walking To Store For Meals A man from Arizona, USA, who reportedly threw out all his food and committed himself to walking to a local Walmart store and back every time he wanted a meal has lost more than 300 pounds. Pasquale “Pat” Brocco, 31, began a to change his life three years ago when he was warned by his doctor that his weight of 605 pounds and his high blood pressure and high cholesterol put his life in serious danger. Brocco went home from that appointment and took a photo of himself in front of a mirror. “My stomach was down to my thighs. My chest was hanging down here. I was disgusted.” He said. He decided that every time he was hungry, he would walk the 1 mile to his closest Walmart, then back home to eat his meal. In less than two years, he said, he lost 200 pounds. “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking 6 miles,” he said. “It’s amazing because I never walked 6 miles in my life, and I was doing it every day.” Brocco put foods like vegetables, meats, sweet potatoes, quinoa and steel-cut oatmeal into his diet and took out the foods he learned over time were hampering his efforts. “Once I figured out dairy was my downfall, I took it out of my diet, and instantly I started losing weight again,” he said. Brocco graduated from walks to Walmart to incline walks on a treadmill at a gym. He also began lifting weights and using gym equipment he previously could not. “I mean, at 600 pounds, I couldn’t even go to the gym. I didn’t fit on the machines,” he said. Now 330 pounds lighter, Brocco said his nickname is no longer Fat Pat. As Possible Pat, he hopes to be a role model for his 1-year-old son. “I’m setting an example for my son so he can be Possible Pat too,” Brocco said. Because he lost so much weight, he had to have about 30 pounds of excess skin removed.

Facebook/PossiblePat By Maggie Maloney Aug 20, 2016 Pasquale "Pat" Brocco, 31, was called "Fat Pat" his entire life. But now, he prefers the nickname "Possible Pat" because of his incredible weight loss journey and his unique fitness plan that helped him lose more than 300 pounds: walking to and from his local Walmart. Three years ago, a doctor warned Brocco that his weight, which was then 605 pounds, as well as his high blood pressure and high cholesterol were extremely dangerous, according to ABC News. Brocco snapped a photo of himself after his appointment, and realized what his body looked like. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "My stomach was down to my thighs.

"You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking six miles," Brocco said to ABC News. "It's amazing because I never walked six miles in my life, and I was doing it every day." Brocco changed his eating habits by loading up on healthy food — like vegetables, meat, steel-cut oatmeal, and quinoa — while cutting out junk food. He also modified his diet along the way as he discovered what foods were hurting his weight loss goals. "Once I figured out dairy was my downfall, I took it out of my diet, and instantly I started losing weight again," he told ABC News.

Just this week, he underwent surgery to remove the roughly 30 pounds of excess skin, which he paid for through a GoFundMe and with a discount from his doctor. And now, "Possible Pat" is chronicling his healthy living, workouts, and meals through social media, making for some serious Instagram #fitspo. But his most important role at the moment? Being a role model for his 1-year-old son. "I'm setting an example for my son so he can be Possible Pat, too," Brocco said to ABC News.

Timothy Green (TMFBargainBin) Aug 20, 2016 at 8:06AM Image source: Getty Images. Trying to time the market is a recipe for disaster. But there's nothing wrong with waiting for shares of a great company to be knocked down before pouncing. Some of the best investing opportunities occur because some short-term problem temporarily sours a stock in the minds of investors. Keeping a watch list of stocks that aren't quite cheap enough to buy is a critical tool for capturing those opportunities. We asked three of our top Foolish contributors to discuss a stock that they're watching. Here's what they had to say. Not quite cheap enough Tim Green: When shares of retail behemoth Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) sank last year after its plan to raise wages and invest in initiatives like employee training and e-commerce caused profits to drop, I considered pulling the trigger and buying the stock. While the rise of Amazon.com is a major threat to the company's business model, I think that the market was underestimating Wal-Mart's ability to adapt. Fast-forward to today and investor sentiment has completely shifted. Since hitting bottom in late 2015, the stock has soared nearly 30%. Wal-Mart's results have been better than expected, with comparable sales in its U.S. stores increasing for eight straight quarters. At a time when many retailers are struggling to get shoppers in the door, Wal-Mart's store traffic is rising, thanks in part to the company's initiatives aimed at improving the customer experience. WMT data by YCharts. Wal-Mart has been investing in a variety of e-commerce initiatives, like its online grocery ordering and pickup service. But the recent $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce start-up Jet is the company's boldest bet so far. Jet aims to undercut Amazon on price by offering discounts based on the quantity of items purchased. The company is almost certainly burning cash at a blistering pace, but the acquisition gives Wal-Mart an e-commerce brand that could grow very quickly in the coming years, as well as the services of Jet's founder. Wal-Mart expects to produce between $4.15 and $4.35 in adjusted EPS this year, putting the stock price at nearly 17 times the high of that range. That's not particularly cheap, but earnings will be depressed this year due to the company's investments. Still, I try to ensure an adequate margin of safety for all of my investments, and Wal-Mart has gotten just a bit too expensive. If the stock drops on short-term worries in the coming months, I'll be waiting. Watching and waiting Matt DiLallo: After running up 50% since the start of the year, energy infrastructure giant Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is no longer the screaming bargain it once was. That said, there is certainly the case to be made that it is still on sale, given that shares are down more than 30% over the past year. However, I would rather wait until the next sale before bolstering my position any further. The reason Kinder Morgan's stock ran up so much this year is due to the significant progress it made on fixing its balance sheet problems. The company entered into several strategic transactions to sell or joint venture select assets. Those deals pushed its leverage ratio down to 5.3 times, which is below its year-end target for 5.5 times debt-to-EBITDA. That said, the company will not begin to return more cash to shareholders until its leverage is below 5.0 times debt to EBITDA. Given its current projections, that might not happen until 2018. Because most investors are not that patient, I think they might grow restless, especially if Kinder Morgan does not start hinting that a dividend increase will happen early next year. That is why I am hoping that there just might be another golden opportunity to buy Kinder Morgan's stock in the near future. I could be wrong, and I own enough Kinder Morgan stock to be happy if it keeps going higher, but I would jump at the chance to buy more if the stock suddenly dropped by double digits due to investor impatience.  A risk management expert with a bright future ahead Brian Feroldi: I'm already a happy shareholder of Verisk Analytics (NASDAQ:VRSK), but I'm eagerly waiting for shares to go on sale so I can continue to build upon my small position.   Verisk is a provider of tools and data analytics that help other businesses to measure and manage their risk profile. The company's primary customers are property and casualty insurers, but it is constantly adding new customers from other markets outside of the insurance sector that afford it plenty of long-term growth opportunities.    Though Verisk might sound like a boring business to own, it exhibits many traits that make for an excellent long-term investment. For one, more than 80% of the company's revenue is subscription-based, and since Verisk boasts stellar retention rates, its top line is highly predictable. In addition, as a data provider, it costs the company very little to service additional customers, which allows Verisk to grow its profits at a faster rate than its revenue.   VRSK Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. Lastly, the company's data is proprietary and dates back to 1971, which gives it a huge leg up over competitors. And since its services are mission critical to its customers, Verisk can push along regular price increases without much fuss.    All in all, Verisk is an extremely high-quality company with an enduring moat that I think should be able to grow at an above-average rate for years to come. I'd love to add to my position today, but the company's shares are currently trading for about 27 times full-year earnings estimates, hinting that they are a little bit pricey right now. However, if this stock were to suddenly go on sale, you can bet that I'd happily step in and buy shares at a discount. Brian Feroldi owns shares of Amazon.com, Kinder Morgan, and Verisk Analytics. Brian Feroldi has the following options: short January 2018 $30 puts on Kinder Morgan, short January 2018 $35 puts on Kinder Morgan, long January 2017 $35 calls on Kinder Morgan, and short January 2017 $35 puts on Kinder Morgan.

It happened Sunday night at the Walmart on North Memorial Drive. In the video taken by Richelle Stewart, a Walmart employee is seen trying to grab the monkey that had apparently escaped from a camper. A woman runs toward the employee and Monkey, saying “Let him go, let him go, let him go! If he bites you, they will put him down.” The woman then walks across the parking lot toward a camper parked nearby. According to the Lancaster Eagle Gazette, someone called police and said that the monkey bit the employee, but he did not require medical attention.

BUSINESS BOOKS 10 Critical Questions You Must Answer if You Want to Write a Book Don't skip any of these questions if you want your book to be extremely successful. By David Van Rooy David Van Rooy is the author of "Trajectory: 7 Career Strategies to Take You From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be" (2014, AMACOM). He explores the concept of career trajectory and how you can take advantage of your skills and the possibilities around you to reach your goals. He is currently Senior Director, Global Leadership Development at Walmart. He previously held roles in International HR and was also responsible for the worlds largest performance management and employee engagement programs at Walmart, covering approximately 2.2 million employees globally. Before Walmart, David held leadership roles at Marriott International and Burger King Corporation. He has a Ph.D. in Industrial and Organizational Psychology and has published over 20 peer reviewed scientific business articles and book chapters. @dlvanrooy @dlvanrooy WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement After my book was released, I was surprised by how many people asked me for advice on how to write and publish a book. Like all authors I learned a lot along the way. Here are 10 critical questions you must answer and tradeoffs to consider if you decide to write a book. 1. Publisher or self-publish: The publishing world has changed dramatically in recent years and the Internet has made self-publishing considerably easier. If you self-publish you have full control of your book, but also bear all costs. A publisher is harder to secure and will have control over some decisions, but also absorbs many costs (e.g., printing, distribution, cover art) and also gains access to critical distribution channels, including identifying outlets to review your book ; 2. Agent or no agent: With an agent you give a portion of your royalties to them. Literary agents work on a commission basis and are incented to find you the best deal so that their payout increases when you sell books. Though you give up some of your royalties, an agent is often your best chance to get your book proposal reviewed by a major publishing house. 3. Publicist or no publicist: Publicists bring access that is hard for many people to get on their own. They identify media outlets such as television shows, newspapers, and podcasts to bring valuable exposure to you and your book. The best publicists can cost tens of thousands of dollars and you will have to consider if their services are worth it to you. 4. What is the book's "hook": Every book needs a quick and compelling hook that captures attention. This is always needed to draw in potential readers/buyers, but also literary agents, publishers, and publicists if you go that route. 5. Who is the target audience: Don't try to pretend your book is for everyone - all books have a more targeted market. If you decide to use a publisher they will want to know exactly whom you are targeting and how big the audience is. They will also want to know how your book is different from similar books that have been written and if it has relevance to sell outside your home country. The target audience will also help you decide who to ask to "blurb" or endorse your book. 6. Write or ghost write: You would be surprised how many books are written by someone other than the stated author. Ghost writers are sought after and can make anyone come across as a gifted writer. Authors may not have time to write a book or find that a professional writer is better able to capture the voice they want to convey. 7. What is my platform: This one must be alive well before you publish your book. You must consider the best way to bring visibility to your book and contemplate platform options such as your standing as a well-known expert, your social media presence, professional speeches, access to different constituencies, etc. 8. What are my goals: Consider the reason you are writing a book to help hone your focus, especially because the outcomes are not always connected. You might want to make a lot of money but not care about getting great reviews. You way just want to build your brand by getting your name out there. You may want to achieve critical acclaim for your book even if it doesn't make a lot of money (think Indie films). Not everyone can be a NYT best selling author, but you can be pleased with the outcome if you know your goals in advance. 9. What format will the book be: You have many options. It can be hard cover, paperback, eBook, audio, small, large, etc. If you self-publish consider the costs of developing multiple formats, particularly hard cover and paperback. 10. How much time will you commit: The reality is that a book once published is there forever. In addition to the time it takes to write (or work with a ghost writer) you will also need to spend time promoting the book. You must consider you ability and willingness to travel, speak, go to book signings, and otherwise invest your time to market and sell your book. No series of decisions is right for everyone and you must consider your particular situation and goals. One last tip: don't get too fixated on the title of your book - it often changes as the writing process progresses, especially when you have a publisher and and edi.

It's a divisive issue and one some Warrenton residents share with people in other communities across the country who oppose the big-box behemoth for a variety of reasons. In fact, even a quick glance at the internet brings up a host of websites that are dedicated to nothing other than keeping Walmart out of those communities. But despite opposition by the Clatsop Residents Against Walmart group and others who spoke against the mega-retailer at this past week's City Commission meeting, Warrenton commissioners made the right decision in renewing Walmart's site design permit for another year. The approval marked the third time the permit has been extended. The decision of whether Walmart could build in Warrenton was originally made in 2013 when the commission first granted the retailer's land-use permit. That 2013 decision later drew a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that claimed the agency failed to protect wetlands in its review and approval of a wetland fill permit application by Peaksview LLC. Peaksview owns land that Walmart plans to build on at Ensign Lane and U.S. Highway 101 in the North Coast Retail Center. The suit stalled Walmart's plans until two weeks ago when a federal judge dismissed the case. The delay, however, forced Walmart to ask for the third extension of its permit. While in past votes commissioners had been unanimous in their approval, this time it wasn't a slam dunk. Commissioners voted 3-1 in favor with one commissioner absent from the meeting. The "no" vote is a bit puzzling and came from Commissioner Rick Newton, who said after the meeting that he opposed the extension because "I don't think it will make life better in Warrenton." Newton had previously voted "yes" last year on the extension issue. Despite the flip-flop, the extension approval this past week was right for several reasons. Whether Warrenton should have a Walmart or not was really decided when the city first began allowing big-box stores. That policy was reaffirmed with the original approval of Walmart's land use permit and then reinforced by the two additional extensions prior to last week's action. And, importantly, Walmart thus far has met each legal requirement to build and open in Warrenton, barring a successful appeal of the judge's dismissal of the lawsuit. Doing an about-face on the issue now, despite its divisiveness, is a form of discrimination and protectionism that government has no business in practicing. Governments make overall policy, and consumers, through freedom of choice, ultimately determine a business's success by making decisions with their feet on where they shop.

 Walmart and Target are struggling to compete with Amazon Daniel B. Kline, The Motley Fool Aug. 19, 2016, 8:07 PM 2,875 facebook linkedin twitter email print File photo of employees working at a Target store at St. Albert Thomson Reuters Target and Walmart face significant challenges as American and global consumers change how they shop. Having physical stores in convenient locations has kept both companies relevant, but it has become increasingly clear that what worked in the past will not be enough to guarantee future success. Shoppers simply have different expectations, creating what Target called "a difficult retail environment" in its Q2 earnings release, and both companies have struggled to adapt to different degrees.  In a world that has quickly gone digital -- where Amazon.com has continually refined and improved its delivery options -- neither Walmart nor Target has quite come up with an answer to the online leader. Efforts to mix technology into physical stores with ideas like curbside pickup, order online/pick up in store, and enabling apps to help with in-store shopping are bandages that do not close the wound. Target and Walmart are tackling these problems from somewhat different places, but comments and moves made by each one show they understand that it's a changing retail world where what worked in the past may not carry the future. How did Target do?  Target, which reported results on Aug. 17, had a fairly bleak second quarter, with a comparable-sales decrease of 1.1% (its first drop since Q1 2015) and GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.07, a decrease of 11.6% from Q2 2015. If you adjust for $161 million of pre-tax early debt retirement losses, the numbers look a little better, coming in at EPS of $1.23, an increase of 0.5% over the same period last year. That's better, but the company's adjusted increase comes from careful spending controls, not increased sales, and the chain has adjusted its expected comparable-sales growth for the final two quarters of the year to between flat and a loss of 2%. Q2 sales actually dropped by 7.2% and fewer people visited its stores. On the positive side, comparable digital channel sales grew 16% and contributed 0.5 percentage points to comparable-sales growth.  CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged "challenges" in his remarks in the earnings release while promising a turnaround eventually, just maybe not soon. "Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities," he said. "Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time." Walmart has better news Walmart has done a better job than its rival in managing its near-term affairs. On Aug. 17, The company reported Q2 2017 revenue of $120.9 billion, an increase of 0.5% (or 2.8% on a constant-currency level). U.S. stores saw positive comparative sales for the eighth straight quarter, rising 1.6%, which the company said was driven by its seventh straight quarter of increased traffic to its stores.  Global sales were up 2.2% when you exclude currency impact. On a worldwide constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume increased 11.8% and 13%, respectively, representing an acceleration from the first quarter. David McNew/Getty Images That's good news, certainly a better result than what Target delivered, but Walmart still faces the same long-term problem as its rival: Amazon. Walmart clearly understands that because it just spent $3.3 billion to buy e-commerce company Jet.com, a money-losing company with $1 billion in net sales, and placed its CEO, Marc Lore, in charge of its entire digital operation. The retailer also changed its digital strategy in China, selling its Yihaodian website to JD.com, the country's No. 2 online retailer. In exchange, Walmart gets a 5% stake in JD.com, valued at roughly $1.5 billion at recent prices, and access to JD.com's delivery network and shoppers, The Wall Street Journal reported.  An attempt to catch up For a long time, Walmart and Target had an edge over Amazon simply because they had a network of stores. However, by building up its Prime membership, which offers free two-day shipping, and increasing its shipping capacity and options (including Sunday delivery), the online retailer has made that edge less relevant. If more customers go online, Walmart and Target could be left behind. Walmart had $14 billion in online sales in 2015, while Amazon's sales (which include its web services business) reached $107 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. In FY 2016, only 3.4% of Target's $72 billion in sales were from digital operations, slightly higher than Walmart's 3%. Even though Walmart stands as No. 2 to Amazon in U.S. e-commerce sales, that's like saying that the Canadian Football League is the second-best professional football league in the world behind the NFL. It's true in a technical sense, but the distance between the two is so great, it's hard to imagine Walmart ever catching up, and Target barely registers as a competitor.  In May, Fortune cited eMarketer data showing that Walmart notched $12.5 billion in online sales in the last year in the U.S. while Amazon pulled in $82.8 billion.  Walmart has done a better job than Target in meeting the challenge so far, but shopping in stores has become a less necessary activity that will only become less relevant as time goes on. Both companies either need to find a way to make people buck the trend impacting nearly all physical retailers or do more online business.  Both have shown that's possible as digital sales are at least trending up, but long-term relevancy, maybe even survival, requires a lot more work.

Nathan Frandino reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript It was just another day off for registered nurse Letty Rubalcava. Until she walked into the bathroom at this California Walmart. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "There was two employees kind of standing outside of a stall. One of them had a cellphone an I could hear there was somebody inside the bathroom stall that sounded really agitated, kind of grunting." That's when the nurse of 10 years took charge of the familiar situation. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "I said I'm a labor and delivery nurse and then that's when they opened the bathroom door for me and I assisted her to the floor, and then I asked for blankets. I kind of went into auto-pilot." With the help of an obstetrician tech who happened to be nearby, Rubalcava helped calm the mother until the paramedics arrived to help with the delivery. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "Baby girl delivered easily and I kind of placed her skin to skin with mom. I love to be able to help moms everyday help them bring new life into this world." The baby was born prematurely but she and the mother are now doing well. (SOUNDBITE) (English) LETTY RUBALCAVA, REGISTERED NURSE, SAYING: "When I walked out of the Walmart bathroom there were some employees that clapped and somebody you know they were calling me an angel and that was very sweet you know but I just felt like I'm here at the right place at the right time." Rubalcava says she hopes to reconnect with the new mom and baby soon.

The service will rival Kroger’s Clicklist, which began in several Mid-South stores in June. Walmart is now serving out groceries at five locations in the Memphis area. “It’s a good idea and a lot of people would do it with so many working people,” Myrna Salomon said. Walmart grocery pickup has started at select stores in Millington, Cordova, West Memphis, Southaven, and Olive Branch. The stores will differ from Kroger, however. Kroger’s Clicklist charged $4.95 but has no minimum purchase. Walmart offers free pickup but has a $30 minimum. Also, Kroger does not currently offer same-day pickup in the area while Walmart guarantees same-day services if a customer orders online by a specific time. “I think it might be convenient if you have little ones in the car, especially newborns,” Sabrina Hall said. However, others think going inside the store is not a bad idea. “Fast food and everything is made to be lazy. It's not going to hurt to go in the grocery store,” Valencia Tearily said.

Dave Pell Date of Publication: 08.19.16. 08.19.16 Time of Publication: 3:52 pm. 3:52 pm Walmart’s Crime Problem, and the Week’s Other Must-Read Stories Daniel Becerril/REUTERS Editor’s note: We’re proud to bring NextDraft—the most righteous, most essential newsletter on the web—to WIRED.com. Every Friday you’ll get a roundup of the week’s most popular must-read stories from around the internet, courtesy of mastermind Dave Pell. So dig in and geek out. The Sausage Party’s Over I don’t want to be an alarmist, but there’s a chance we’re running out of swear words. Over the years, our language has become more coarse, and dropping F bombs and other profanities has been fully integrated into our daily exchanges. As use of the words becomes more acceptable, they lose their power. Then what? As MaClean’s Brian Bethune explains: “If English should lose its surprisingly small profane vocabulary set through overusage, we would be forced to invent new obscenities. That would be no easy task, given the polished perfection of what biology, time and chance has already bequeathed us.” (Are we ready for a world in which shit doesn’t happen?) Like … No We now have some data to back up the assumption that you probably already held. Your politically-charged Facebook posts, no matter how impassioned and well-reasoned, are highly unlikely to make a dent in the opinions already held by those who encounter them. But all is not lost. While you might not change your friends’ minds when it comes to politics, you’re almost certainly changing the way they feel about your friendship. (Related: No one is buying the message implied by all those happy family photos you share either.) NextDraft About The NextDraft newsletter is now on WIRED.com. Every Friday, mastermind Dave Pell visits the far reaches of the web to bring the news you missed. Politics, tech, science—you name it, and it’s here. (Original story reprinted with permission from NextDraft.) The Scene of the Crime Does Walmart have a target on its back? It sure looks that way when you consider at the soaring crime rates at many of its stores. “Police reports from dozens of stores suggest the number of petty crimes committed on Walmart properties nationwide this year will be in the hundreds of thousands. But people dashing out the door with merchandise is the least troubling part of Walmart’s crime problem. More than 200 violent crimes, including attempted kidnappings and multiple stabbings, shootings, and murders, have occurred at the nation’s 4,500 Walmarts this year.” It’s a big problem. It’s taxing police departments. And, as Bloomberg reports, it’s the direct result of the company’s cost-cutting strategies: Walmart’s Out-of-Control Crime Problem Is Driving Police Crazy. End of the Green Mile “They simply do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs, and resources; they do not save substantially on costs; and as noted in a recent report by the Department’s Office of Inspector General, they do not maintain the same level of safety and security.” The Justice Department just announced they would end the use of private prisons. Letting corporations profit off of incarceration? What could possibly go wrong… (Now that the US will no longer use private prisons, WeWork has some very raw, industrial startup space for rent.) + The poor performance of private prisons came to light thanks to journalism (yes, the very same media we love to attack), including an excellent MoJo piece I shared earlier this summer. And here from the publication: This is what’s missing from journalism right now. He Who Shall Not Be Named “We’ve made online heroes out of them. We call them lone wolf — that sounds cool. Terrorist — that sounds cool to people who want to be that.” Many publications in France have adopted a new strategy when it comes to covering terror and mass shootings. They’re not naming the perpetrators. Can removing the fame incentive make a difference in the mind of a sociopath? It’s worth noting that during some recent mass murder events, the shooter actually accessed social media during the incident. Today’s murderers don’t have to imagine the coverage they’ll get. They can experience it. The Horrors of War “Images of the boy sitting in an ambulance were released by activists and have since been shared widely on social media. He was identified as five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, who was treated for head wounds on Wednesday.” Another photo — this one of a shocked and bloodied Syrian five-year-old victimized by an airstrike — has sparked outrage. Photos like these can grab our attention and humanize distant events. But Syria has been ravaged from air and land for years, and somewhere around 400,000 people have been killed. I’m not sure we need another photo to convince us it’s not a pretty picture. Uber-uber We often imagine autonomous vehicles has being part of some distant future. But Uber just announced that they’ll be testing self-driving cars (with passengers … and drivers, just in case) in Pittsburgh later this month. Uber also acquired Otto, a self-driving truck company that “includes engineers from a number of high-profile tech companies.” Stroke and Mirrors No one ever remembers who comes in fifth place. Unless that person fabricates a story about being robbed at gunpoint. Ryan Lochte and his fellow swimmers claimed they were held up in Rio, but it turned out their version of events didn’t hold water. As you’d imagine, the Internet is going Brazil nuts. Bottom line: When you spend your life wearing a Speedo, you can’t hide much. In the end, Lochte admitted he lied and said me sorry. + He Said, She Said: According to the AP, “Lochte first lied about the robbery to his mother, Ileana Lochte, who spoke with reporters.” (I don’t get young people today. When I was a kid, I wouldn’t have even told my mom I was competing in the Olympics.) + The NYT with this quote from the vice president for policy at Americas Society and Council of the Americas: “[The incident] has tapped into one of Brazilians’ biggest pet peeves — gringos who treat their country like a third-rate spring break destination where you can lie to the cops and get away with it.” (Full disclosure: That’s how we treat most American cities too…) + Maybe now we can drop that baseless stereotype that Rio is a place where one might get robbed. + New Yorker: Why Brazilians are so obsessed with this story. Bottom of the News A baby girl born on a plane has been given a million frequent flier miles by the airline. With advanced medicine and today’s science, she might live long enough to find an eligible flight. + “Even during snack and play time, Fraley and the other instructors observed their students and gently pushed them to think more deeply.” The LA Times takes you to a boot camp to get kids ready for kindergarten. + How the humble pencil conquered the world. + I have watched Michael Cohen’s instantly classic Say’s Who interview on CNN about a hundred times. And I still can’t wait to watch it again. Although I much prefer the shorter version that I asked someone on Twitter to splice together. This is a weekly best-of version of the NextDraft newsletter.

Last year, Americans spent about $350 billion online, with Walmart's rival Amazon leading the pack. And as e-commerce increases, so does shipping and packaging. Specifically, cardboard.

Meet the Man Who Lost More Than 300 Pounds on the 'Walmart Diet' Delish 8/19/2016 Maggie Maloney © Facebook/PossiblePat Meet the Man Who Lost More Than 300 Pounds on the 'Walmart Diet' Pasquale "Pat" Brocco, 31, was called "Fat Pat" his entire life. But now, he prefers the nickname "Possible Pat" because of his incredible weight loss journey and his unique fitness plan that helped him lose more than 300 pounds: walking to and from his local Walmart.  Three years ago, a doctor warned Brocco that his weight, which was then 605 pounds, as well as his high blood pressure and high cholesterol were extremely dangerous, according to ABC News. Brocco snapped a photo of himself after his appointment, and realized what his body looked like.  "My stomach was down to my thighs. My chest was hanging down here," Brocco told ABC News. "I was disgusted." © Instagram To succeed the process must become a rhythm! Rhythm is something done repetitive, so the process must be repetitive! We have to be consistent and let it become in our nature! This is for all good and bad habits, something become a habit when done constantly and repetitively, so you can either do the things that will make you successful or the things that will make you fail the choice is yours! I choose success and even tho failure will be part of it I will let the process to success become my rhythm! Never forget to believe you can and do not I repeat do not let negativity control your mind positive thoughts only!!!

"You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking six miles," Brocco said to ABC News. "It's amazing because I never walked six miles in my life, and I was doing it every day."  Click to expand Replay Video The Secret to French Style, From a Fashion Insider Fashion royalty Lola Rykiel talks about her fashion philosophy and how posture can alter your style.

He also modified his diet along the way as he discovered what foods were hurting his weight loss goals. "Once I figured out dairy was my downfall, I took it out of my diet, and instantly I started losing weight again," he told ABC News. © Instagram When I'm with the boys I talk s**t not to discourage them but to push them!

Today, Brocco is a full 325 pounds lighter and wants to become a body builder, he wrote on his GoFundMe page. Just this week, he underwent surgery to remove the roughly 30 pounds of excess skin, which he paid for through a GoFundMe and with a discount from his doctor.  And now, "Possible Pat" is chronicling his healthy living, work outs, and meals through social media, making for some serious Instagram #Fitspo.  But his most important role at the moment? Being a role model for his one-year-old son. "I'm setting an example for my son so he can be Possible Pat, too," Brocco said to ABC News. 10 Secrets Nutritionists Tell Their Friends About Weight Loss Go to MSN Home More in Health & Fitness 25 Most Popular Pies—Ranked Eat This, Not That! 11 Airport Foods to Avoid at All Costs Eat This, Not That! 10 Ways to Avoid Holiday Overeating Cheapism 7 Doctor-Approved Ways to Boost Your Immunity Right Now Redbook These 37 celebrities never drink alcohol Spoon University 31 natural libido boosters to help you have better sex Reader's Digest Up Next The Drunkest City in Each State 24/7 Wall St. AdChoices AdChoices More from Delish The 11 Most Insane Calls To The Butterball Turkey Line Delish Starbucks Just Quietly Raised Its Prices, Yet Again Delish I Spent 6 Hours At Butterball's Turkey Hotline Boot Camp Delish Where To Find The Best Black Friday Deals On Kitchen Appliances Delish Delish Read more from Delish Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter Disclaimer About Health

(Seeking Alpha) Related DE 12 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Wednesday Mid-Day Market Update: Eli Lilly Tumbles After Alzheimer's Study Fails To Meet Goals; Euroseas Shares Rise Deere & Co: I Messed Up (Seeking Alpha) Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is losing momentum — both in brick-and-mortar stores and online — as it is bruised by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN). But, Amazon isn't the only rival encroaching upon Target; the rebound of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) may further halt the growth at Target. "Investors have realized that Wal-Mart is turning things around," CNN digital correspondent Paul La Monica shared on Benzinga's PreMarket Prep. La Monica is also positive on the retail giant's acquisition of Jet.com and said investors are sensing that maybe Wal-Mart is a better digital bet than Target and could even give Amazon a run for its money. The executive also warned that Wal-Mart outright will not become a significant competitor in digital versus Amazon, which is also taking the "right steps." He attributed the recent gains in Wal-Mart to overselling last year as well as Amazon shares' recent "cooling off." Related Link: The Retail Earnings Season Roundup: All The Results In 1 Place La Monica, while commenting on the results of Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) and Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL), noted that Deere is gaining momentum due to Chinese demand and Footlocker is performing well despite slip-ups from Nike Inc (NYSE: NKE). Commenting on GDP trends, La Monica said if businesses don't start more investing, that may keep GDP in this kind of sluggish mode at 2 percent at best. "It is better than Europe or Japan obviously, still it doesn't feel great," he added.

Maybe it’s not that shoppers are clutching their wallets or spending on home renovations instead of everyday home goods, a Target speculated. Maybe Target’s shoppers are just heading to Walmart more often. The keen business minds over at Bloomberg noticed this trend and compared the stores’ narratives and performance. While Target’s stores are generally full of more affluent shoppers, the chains are still similar enough that it makes sense to compare them. When sharing its results, Target CEO Brian Cornell blamed lower sales on consumers in general being “cautious” and spending their money on home renovations and things that are definitely not groceries at Target. Walmart’s growth in sales and total transactions shows that consumers are doing just fine — or perhaps they’re seeking cheaper prices and a wider variety of groceries at the strip mall across the street rather than going to Target. Walmart also notes that low gas prices are helping, since it leaves more money in shoppers’ wallets. (The company does sell some gasoline at its Sam’s Club warehouse stores, but discounted gas for members is more of an inducement to shop at the store and not something that the chain is looking to make money from.) Walmart doesn’t just have 100% more monkeys rampaging in its parking lots. In the company’s quarterly earnings call, executives shared that sales are up, customer satisfaction scores are up, and shoppers are shopping. “The latest retail sales data show that consumers are somewhat cautious at the turn to the second half of the year, but they are not pulling back sharply,” an economist at Bloomberg Intelligence observed. Maybe the leaders of both companies are right: for American consumer as a whole, being “somewhat cautious” means shopping at Walmart instead of Target, rather than cutting back on their spending entirely?

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Daniel B. Kline Aug 19th 2016 1:16PM Target (NYSE: TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) face significant challenges as American and global consumers change how they shop. Having physical stores in convenient locations has kept both companies relevant, but it has become increasingly clear that what worked in the past will not be enough to guarantee future success. Shoppers simply have different expectations, creating what Target called "a difficult retail environment" in its Q2 earnings release, and both companies have struggled to adapt to different degrees. In a world that has quickly gone digital -- where Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has continually refined and improved its delivery options -- neither Wal-Mart nor Target has quite come up with an answer to the online leader. Efforts to mix technology into physical stores with ideas like curbside pickup, order online/pick up in store, and enabling apps to help with in-store shopping are bandages that do not close the wound. Target and Wal-Mart are tackling these problems from somewhat different places, but comments and moves made by each one show they understand that it's a changing retail world where what worked in the past may not carry the future.

Groceries Photo credit: Getty Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – How did Target do? Target, which reported results on Aug. 17, had a fairly bleak second quarter, with a comparable-sales decrease of 1.1% (its first drop since Q1 2015) and GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.07, a decrease of 11.6% from Q2 2015. If you adjust for $161 million of pre-tax early debt retirement losses, the numbers look a little better, coming in at EPS of $1.23, an increase of 0.5% over the same period last year. That's better, but the company's adjusted increase comes from careful spending controls, not increased sales, and the chain has adjusted its expected comparable-sales growth for the final two quarters of the year to between flat and a loss of 2%. Q2 sales actually dropped by 7.2% and fewer people visited its stores. On the positive side, comparable digital channel sales grew 16% and contributed 0.5 percentage points to comparable-sales growth. CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged "challenges" in his remarks in the earnings release while promising a turnaround eventually, just maybe not soon. "Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities," he said. "Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time." Wal-Mart bought Jet.com in the U.S. and sold its Chinese online business for a stake in JD.com in China. Image source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has better news Wal-Mart has done a better job than its rival in managing its near-term affairs. On Aug. 17, The company reported Q2 2017 revenue of $120.9 billion, an increase of 0.5% (or 2.8% on a constant-currency level). U.S. stores saw positive comparative sales for the eighth straight quarter, rising 1.6%, which the company said was driven by its seventh straight quarter of increased traffic to its stores. Global sales were up 2.2% when you exclude currency impact. On a worldwide constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume increased 11.8% and 13%, respectively, representing an acceleration from the first quarter. That's good news, certainly a better result than what Target delivered, but Wal-Mart still faces the same long-term problem as its rival: Amazon. Wal-Mart clearly understands that because it just spent $3.3 billion to buy e-commerce company Jet.com, a money-losing company with $1 billion in net sales, and placed its CEO, Marc Lore, in charge of its entire digital operation. The retailer also changed its digital strategy in China, selling its Yihaodian website to JD.com, the country's No. 2 online retailer. In exchange, Wal-Mart gets a 5% stake in JD.com, valued at roughly $1.5 billion at recent prices, and access to JD.com's delivery network and shoppers, The Wall Street Journal reported. An attempt to catch up For a long time, Wal-Mart and Target had an edge over Amazon simply because they had a network of stores. However, by building up its Prime membership, which offers free two-day shipping, and increasing its shipping capacity and options (including Sunday delivery), the online retailer has made that edge less relevant. If more customers go online, Wal-Mart and Target could be left behind. Wal-Mart had $14 billion in online sales in 2015, while Amazon's sales (which include its web services business) reached $107 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. In FY 2016, only 3.4% of Target's $72 billion in sales were from digital operations, slightly higher than Wal-Mart's 3%. Even though Wal-Mart stands as No. 2 to Amazon in U.S. e-commerce sales, that's like saying that the Canadian Football League is the second-best professional football league in the world behind the NFL. It's true in a technical sense, but the distance between the two is so great, it's hard to imagine Wal-Mart ever catching up, and Target barely registers as a competitor. In May, Fortune cited eMarketer data showing that Wal-Mart notched $12.5 billion in online sales in the last year in the U.S. while Amazon pulled in $82.8 billion. Wal-Mart has done a better job than Target in meeting the challenge so far, but shopping in stores has become a less necessary activity that will only become less relevant as time goes on. Both companies either need to find a way to make people buck the trend impacting nearly all physical retailers or do more online business. Both have shown that's possible as digital sales are at least trending up, but long-term relevancy, maybe even survival, requires a lot more work.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Baird has maintained its Outperform rating and $80 target price on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) as it is encouraged by early signs of progress, thus adding to the defensive appeal of shares amid the tough retail environment. "[I]nvestments in employees/wages, customer service, merchandising, and digital/omni-channel capabilities appear to be striking a tone with consumers. While absolute valuation metrics appear stretched, relative reads are more in line with historical trends, so we believe shares can grind higher if these positive trends continue," analyst Peter Benedict wrote in a note. The retail giant's quarterly adjusted EPS of $1.07 beat expectations of $1.02 on stronger U.S. comps and a lower tax rate. Comps of +1.6 percent exceeded 1 percent plan, with traffic (+1.2 percent) the key driver. Related Link: This Wal-Mart Analyst Will Be Looking For Continued Capital Discipline Looking ahead, third quarter comps are seen growing 1–1.5 percent, a solid outlook given the struggles across many parts of retail. Further, the acquisition of Jet.com is expected to add additional upside. The company also raised its FY16 EPS guidance to $4.15–$4.35 (vs. prior $4.00–$4.30). Baird's FY16/FY17 EPS view go up by $0.05 to $4.30/$4.50 to reflect better core trends partially offset by assumed operating losses at Jet.com. At the time of writing, shares of Wal-Mart were down 1.64 percent at $73.08. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Pasquale "Pat" Brocco dropped more than half of his body weight by walking to Walmart when he needed a meal, according to ABC News. The Arizona man threw out all of his food and committed to walking to his local Walmart located 1 mile from his home, three times a day. In less than two years, Brocco said he lost 200 pounds. "You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking 6 miles," he said. "It's amazing because I never walked 6 miles in my life, and I was doing it every day." The inspiration for change came when his doctor told him that at 605 pounds, his life was in serious danger. He went home that day and took a photo of himself in the mirror. "I was disgusted," he said. Now Brocco incorporates healthy foods like vegetables and grains, took out foods that he knew were sabotaging his weight-loss efforts, and works out at a gym. He says he hopes his weight-loss journey will now set an example and be a role model for his 1-year-old son. These are Pat's pre- and post-weight-loss diets: Before weight loss (about 11,200 calories per day): Box of cereal 1/2 gallon whole milk 1 package peanut butter cups 1 candy bar 12-inch meatball and cheese submarine sandwich 100 fast food chicken nuggets 1 fast food apple pie 1 fast food milkshake 2 liters soda 4 doughnuts After weight loss (about 2,250 calories per day): 2 gallons water About 20 egg whites 1 cup oatmeal 24 ounces chicken breast Green beans 6 ounces ground lean bison 32 almonds 1/2 sweet potato embed Copyright 2016 Cable News Network/Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

 Walmart doubles down on digital for future growth BI Intelligence Aug. 19, 2016, 12:27 PM 1,144 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Amazon opens Prime shipping to all merchants Digital is mitigating in-store losses at Target Google's latest acquisition should boost Google Shopping This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart's Q2 2016 earnings revealed positive growth in the company's total U.S. sales. This growth was driven largely by its e-commerce business and investment in digital tools. The company's international revenue declined year-over-year (YoY) during Q2, but we expect better comparisons going forward, due to enhancements being made to Walmart's e-commerce sites and a key partnership with China-based e-tailer JD.com. As a whole, Walmart's business continues to thrive: Total revenue reached nearly $121 billion during Q2 2016, marking 0.5% YoY growth. Revenue from Walmart US alone totaled over $76 billion, growing 3% YoY. However, Walmart International revenue fell over 6% YoY, totaling $28 billion. The company's results were strongest in e-commerce: Global online sales on Walmart's e-commerce sites grew nearly 12% YoY. Walmart's online gross merchandise volume (GMV) grew 13% YoY. Walmart's strong digital performance was driven by a few key developments during Q2. Walmart focused on its grocery e-commerce business last quarter, with efforts aimed at building digital relationships with customers, scaling the assortment, and expanding online grocery, CEO Doug McMillan pointed out during the earnings call. Walmart also expanded its grocery click and collect service to 30 new markets. The pickup service is now available in 60 US markets at nearly 400 locations. In addition to grocery, Walmart's third-party marketplace continues to grow. Since the beginning of the year, the company has added nearly 7 million new items available for purchase to its marketplace. Walmart's third-party marketplace is vital to expanding its product offerings as it competes against major players like Amazon and eBay. Walmart's acquisition of Jet.com will help propel the company's digital growth even further. In the biggest e-commerce acquisition yet, Walmart acquired the two-year-old startup for $3 billion. Walmart will leverage Jet.com's existing business to help grow its online sales and customer base. Specifically, the company is focusing on customer engagement through Jet.com's technology that gives customers savings in real time based on the items in their shopping cart. This encourages shoppers to purchase multiple items at once rather than one at a time. "When customers build a basket of goods online rather than ordering one item at a time, shipping economics are in their favor and ours," noted McMillan. This will help steer customers toward larger purchases, while helping Walmart cut back on shipping costs associated with a higher volume of individual orders. A key partnership with JD.com will also help Walmart's e-commerce business, as well as its international performance. Walmart and Sam's Club will both be listed on JD.com as preferred retailers with items available for purchase through the China-based e-commerce site. This will help expand Walmart's presence in China significantly and could help grow its international revenue down the line. The partnership could also help drive shoppers to Walmart's physical store locations in China. CFO Brett Biggs specifically noted that this partnership will "better serve consumers through a powerful combination of e-commerce and retail." Leveraging JD.com's 188 million customers in China will likely raise visibility for Walmart as a go-to retailer in the country.

Image source: YouTube Pasquale “Pat” Brocco, 31, said he made a commitment to change his lifestyle three years ago when his doctor cautioned him that his weight of 605 pounds — in addition to his high blood pressure and high cholesterol — jeopardized his life. Brocco told ABC News that he went home from that appointment and looked at himself in the mirror. “My stomach was down to my thighs. My chest was hanging down here,” he said. “I was disgusted.” Image source: YouTube He decided that each time he wanted to eat, he would walk the 1 mile to Walmart and then back home to eat. He lost 200 pounds in under two years. “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking 6 miles,” he said. “It’s amazing because I never walked 6 miles in my life, and I was doing it every day.” Brocco also significantly changed his diet, cutting his daily calorie intake from about 11,200 calories per day to about about 2,250 calories per day. He incorporataed more vegetables and lean meats into his diet. “Once I figured out dairy was my downfall, I took it out of my diet, and instantly I started losing weight again,” he said. Once he began to lose weight, he began going to the gym. “I mean, at 600 pounds, I couldn’t even go to the gym,” Brocco said. “I didn’t fit on the machines.” He said his friends have stopped calling him “Fat Pat” in favor of “Possible Pat.” He hopes his 1-year-old son learns from his example. Image source: YouTube “I’m setting an example for my son so he can be ‘Possible Pat’ too,” Brocco said. Brocco lost so much weight that he recently had to have 30 pounds of excess skin removed by a plastic surgeon. — Follow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook: Follow @kgscanlon Share Tweet Rate this story Recommended from the Web 92 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

All Rouses locations are accepting cash donations and donations of non-perishable food and cleaning supplies for Second Harvest and the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank, the retailer announced. Customers can also donate online. Immediately after the storm, Rouses urged associates at the Denham Springs store, located in an area that was particularly hard hit, to contact store directors at a neighboring location to make sure all employees were accounted for. Rouses also posted a video to YouTube showing managing partner Donny Rouse assessing the damage at the Denham Springs store, with a promise to rebuild. Southeastern Grocers launched a weeklong donation-matching program through the Southeastern Grocers Foundation on Aug. 17. The retailer plans to match every dollar donated at any Winn-Dixie, Bi-Lo and Harveys store. “Winn-Dixie has been a part of the Louisiana community for 60 years. During that time, the strength and resilience of the community has been tried time and time again, and we are proud to have the people of Louisiana as our customers, our associates, and our neighbors, as their bravery and perseverance has been an inspiration as we begin our recovery efforts,” Southeastern president and CEO Ian McLeod said in a press release. “We are encouraging all our customers across the Southeast to rise up and support the great states and communities of Louisiana and Mississippi. We will continue to work tirelessly on the ground and with the American Red Cross to direct all available resources to help the people affected by the flooding.” Meanwhile, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation announced they would donate $500,000 in cash and in-kind donations, including truck loads of water sent to impacted areas. “We are deeply saddened by the devastating floods in Louisiana and the catastrophic effect it’s having on our associates and members of the community,” Mark Cooper, senior director of emergency management, Walmart, said in press release. “We are fully committed to the relief efforts and will continue to work closely with local officials to do everything we can.” Similarly, Target will donate $100,000 each to the Salvation Army and American Red Cross, as well as $30,000 to local schools. The retailer donated more than $100,000 of food to local food banks. It has partnered with local non-profits to distribute $20,000 in Target GiftCards for the purchase of supplies during recovery efforts. Target also plans to match donations to the American Red Cross from associates, up to $50,000. The retailer said its store teams in the affected area have been volunteering their time to contribute to relief efforts. “Communities where we have a presence don’t just represent a store to Target; these communities are home to many of our team members and countless valued guests,” said Laysha Ward, chief corporate social responsibility officer, Target. “We’re extremely proud of our team members’ efforts, not only as volunteers, but also in making sure our stores closest to the disaster areas are ready with needed supplies. We're honored to work with incredible partners like The American Red Cross and Salvation Army to provide relief and comfort during the response and recovery.” Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 1 Anonymoua (not verified) on Aug 22, 2016 They need to build anything in that area higher off the ground (sort of a fake unused basement type area which has good drainage and ventilation but no access for swatters human or animal to move in) Like every one of the houses on Jersey shore have done, build above the flood line. reply Log In or Register to post comments Post new comment Name: Sign In or register to use your Supermarket News ID Email: Your comment: * Advertisement Related Articles Wal-Mart Makes $600,000 Grant for Mexican Flood Relief   Sprouts Offers Colo.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Aug 19, 2016 at 10:26AM Target (NYSE:TGT) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) face significant challenges as American and global consumers change how they shop. Having physical stores in convenient locations has kept both companies relevant, but it has become increasingly clear that what worked in the past will not be enough to guarantee future success. Shoppers simply have different expectations, creating what Target called "a difficult retail environment" in its Q2 earnings release, and both companies have struggled to adapt to different degrees.  In a world that has quickly gone digital -- where Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has continually refined and improved its delivery options -- neither Wal-Mart nor Target has quite come up with an answer to the online leader. Efforts to mix technology into physical stores with ideas like curbside pickup, order online/pick up in store, and enabling apps to help with in-store shopping are bandages that do not close the wound. Target and Wal-Mart are tackling these problems from somewhat different places, but comments and moves made by each one show they understand that it's a changing retail world where what worked in the past may not carry the future. How did Target do?  Target, which reported results on Aug. 17, had a fairly bleak second quarter, with a comparable-sales decrease of 1.1% (its first drop since Q1 2015) and GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.07, a decrease of 11.6% from Q2 2015. If you adjust for $161 million of pre-tax early debt retirement losses, the numbers look a little better, coming in at EPS of $1.23, an increase of 0.5% over the same period last year. That's better, but the company's adjusted increase comes from careful spending controls, not increased sales, and the chain has adjusted its expected comparable-sales growth for the final two quarters of the year to between flat and a loss of 2%. Q2 sales actually dropped by 7.2% and fewer people visited its stores. On the positive side, comparable digital channel sales grew 16% and contributed 0.5 percentage points to comparable-sales growth.  CEO Brian Cornell acknowledged "challenges" in his remarks in the earnings release while promising a turnaround eventually, just maybe not soon. "Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities," he said. "Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time." Wal-Mart bought Jet.com in the U.S. and sold its Chinese online business for a stake in JD.com in China. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart has better news Wal-Mart has done a better job than its rival in managing its near-term affairs. On Aug. 17, The company reported Q2 2017 revenue of $120.9 billion, an increase of 0.5% (or 2.8% on a constant-currency level). U.S. stores saw positive comparative sales for the eighth straight quarter, rising 1.6%, which the company said was driven by its seventh straight quarter of increased traffic to its stores. Global sales were up 2.2% when you exclude currency impact. On a worldwide constant-currency basis, e-commerce sales and gross merchandise volume increased 11.8% and 13%, respectively, representing an acceleration from the first quarter. That's good news, certainly a better result than what Target delivered, but Wal-Mart still faces the same long-term problem as its rival: Amazon. Wal-Mart clearly understands that because it just spent $3.3 billion to buy e-commerce company Jet.com, a money-losing company with $1 billion in net sales, and placed its CEO, Marc Lore, in charge of its entire digital operation. The retailer also changed its digital strategy in China, selling its Yihaodian website to JD.com, the country's No. 2 online retailer. In exchange, Wal-Mart gets a 5% stake in JD.com, valued at roughly $1.5 billion at recent prices, and access to JD.com's delivery network and shoppers, The Wall Street Journal reported. An attempt to catch up For a long time, Wal-Mart and Target had an edge over Amazon simply because they had a network of stores. However, by building up its Prime membership, which offers free two-day shipping, and increasing its shipping capacity and options (including Sunday delivery), the online retailer has made that edge less relevant. If more customers go online, Wal-Mart and Target could be left behind. Wal-Mart had $14 billion in online sales in 2015, while Amazon's sales (which include its web services business) reached $107 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal. In FY 2016, only 3.4% of Target's $72 billion in sales were from digital operations, slightly higher than Wal-Mart's 3%. Even though Wal-Mart stands as No. 2 to Amazon in U.S. e-commerce sales, that's like saying that the Canadian Football League is the second-best professional football league in the world behind the NFL. It's true in a technical sense, but the distance between the two is so great, it's hard to imagine Wal-Mart ever catching up, and Target barely registers as a competitor. In May, Fortune cited eMarketer data showing that Wal-Mart notched $12.5 billion in online sales in the last year in the U.S. while Amazon pulled in $82.8 billion. Wal-Mart has done a better job than Target in meeting the challenge so far, but shopping in stores has become a less necessary activity that will only become less relevant as time goes on. Both companies either need to find a way to make people buck the trend impacting nearly all physical retailers or do more online business.  Both have shown that's possible as digital sales are at least trending up, but long-term relevancy, maybe even survival, requires a lot more work.

News Cisco, Home Depot, Wal-Mart, Tencent, Oil Lead Week In Review Cisco Systems topped quarterly forecasts, but it gave weak guidance and set plans to cut up to 5,500 jobs. (iStockphoto) IBD STAFF 8/19/2016 Reprints Stocks continue to grind sideways, while the latest run of retail earnings, including Home Depot (HD) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) didn't offer much clarity on consumers. Cisco Systems (CSCO) offered job cuts and a weak outlook. But Chinese internet stocks continue to deliver robust earnings, while oil made a strong advance. Stocks Hold Near Highs The major averages moved sideways, closing little changed. The Nasdaq rose 0.1%, grinding out its eighth straight weekly gain. The S&P 500 fell less than one point and the Dow lost 0.1%. Several Federal Reserve officials made hawkish hints, insisting a September hike was in play. While markets doubt that, the comments did have an effect. Energy stocks were strong as oil prices rallied. Retailers generally rose, led by Wal-Mart and Ross Stores (ROST), though TJX Cos. (TJX) was among the losers. Cisco Systems cut jobs and its outlook. Tencent (TCEHY) led a slew of  top-rated China internet stocks reporting earnings. Oil Prices Top $50 Again Brent crude futures, the international benchmark, rose above $50 a barrel. Meanwhile, U.S. crude prices shot up 9.1% for the week to $48.52 a barrel. Buzz about a new push for an oil production freeze among OPEC and large non-OPEC producers helped lift prices. But Saudi Arabia is raising production to meet domestic demand, and Iran hasn't made a decision on joining the informal freeze talks in September. Meanwhile, U.S. crude stockpiles fell for the first time in four weeks, with gasoline supplies also down. But U.S. production rose. The number of U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for an eighth straight week to a six-month high. Cisco Cuts Jobs, Outlook Cisco Systems said it will slash 5,500 jobs, or 7% of its workforce, as it continues to shift from hardware to software and services. Cisco topped fiscal Q4 views while sales edged higher. But Cisco's current-quarter EPS and revenue targets were below forecasts. Cisco stock on Monday had its highest close since late 2007, but it went on to fall 1.1% for the week. IBD'S TAKE: While Cisco revenue barely rises, fiber-optic component makers are booming amid strong demand from telecoms, internet giants and China. Acacia Communications shares have skyrocketed since their May IPO. Learn what Acacia CEO Raj Shanmugaraj has to say about the so-called fiber optic "super cycle" in a recent IBD interview. Wal-Mart Solid; Target Cuts Target Wal-Mart earned $1.07 a share, a penny below a year earlier but beating views. Revenue increased slightly as U.S. same-store rose again and e-commerce growth picked up. The brick-and-mortar retail giant emphasized digital marketing after buying Jet.com this month for $3.3 billion, as it tries to fend off Amazon (AMZN), Alibaba (BABA) and other online retailers. Rival discounter Target (TGT) beat profit views, but sales fell short as Apple (AAPL) product sales fell 20%. Target cut full-year EPS guidance, citing a "challenging environment" in the back half of the year. Wal-Mart shares hit a 14-month high on Thursday, but closed the week down 1.5%, back below the 50-day line, while Target lost 7.5%. IBD'S TAKE: Investors should focus on the true leaders. While brick and mortar retailers work hard to achieve sluggish growth, Amazon and Alibaba are delivering strong and accelerating revenue gains.

Home Depot Sees Housing 'Tailwind' The home improvement giant reported in-line earnings and sales that just fell short of views. But Home Depot raised its full-year EPS view as it still benefits from a housing "tailwind." Meanwhile, smaller rival Lowe's (LOW) missed on the top and bottom lines. Lowe's same-store sales growth was just half of Home Depot's. Home Depot briefly topped a buy point closed the week off 0.8%. Lowe's tumbled 4.8%. Ross Stores, TJX Ross Stores late Thursday earned 71 cents a share, up 13%, while sales climbed 7% to $3.18 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 71 cents and sales of $3.18 billion. Same-store sales rose 4%. The off-price apparel chain raised full-year EPS guidance. Meanwhile, off-price peer TJX on Tuesday topped Q2 EPS and sales views, but it gave cautious guidance. Ross Stores rose 3.5% to 65.06 on Friday and 3.1% for the week, becoming extended from a 59.78 buy point cleared last month. TJX is down 4.25% for the week, tumbling through a buy point that it cleared a month ago. Ford Plans Autonomous Vehicle By 2021 Ford Motor (F) said it hopes to have a fully autonomous vehicle in five years, echoing a similar 2021 target from a BMW (BMWYY), Mobileye (MBLY) and Intel (INTC) joint effort. Meanwhile, Uber later this month will offer ride-hailing services using self-driving Volvo SUVs, with a human driver ready at the wheel. It's part of a $300 million Uber-Volvo alliance. China Internet Earnings Strong NetEase (NTES) and Tencent Holdings, China's two largest internet gaming companies, both reported strong quarterly results that soundly beat estimates. Tencent, which is also a leader in mobile messaging, said revenue rose 52% to $5.38 billion, as EPS rose 45% to 17 cents. Tencent revenue growth accelerated to a three-year high. Its U.S. shares rose 8.3%, hitting fresh highs. NetEase reported revenue of $1.47 billion, up 96% in local currency year over year, as EPS rose 91% to $3.67. NetEase stock hit a high early in the week, but it fell Thursday after the results. It rose 1.9% for the week. China is now the world's largest online game market, but NetEase and Tencent have opportunities to expand further. China has the world's largest internet user population, at 686 million, yet the market is still estimated to be only about half penetrated, vs. roughly 90% for the U.S. China online discount retailer Vipshop (VIPS) turned in stronger-than-expected quarterly results. Vipshop revenue rose 49% to $2.02 billion, while EPS rose 30% to 17 cents a share. Shares rose 3%. China's Momo (MOMO), a provider of social networking and dating services, showed a tripling in revenue growth to $99 million, as EPS quadrupled to 12 cents. Momo shares rose 6.9% to 16.04 in volatile action, clearing a 15.39 buy point. In the previous week, Alibaba and JD.com, China's two largest e-commerce retailers, both posted double-digit growth in revenue and earnings that topped estimates. Youth Apparel Chains Strong Some youth-oriented apparel chains reported strong results. Children's Place (PLCE) posted a smaller-than-expected loss and a slim revenue gain. Children's Place also raised its full-year EPS outlook to $4.60-$4.70 from an earlier outlook of $4.17-$4.27. Shares rose 4.4%, hitting a record high. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) delivered a 35% quarterly EPS jump, while sales' 3% gain edged past views. Same-store sales rose just 3% though. The teen retailer sees Q3 EPS roughly in line with Wall Street targets. American Eagle eked out a 0.5% weekly gain. Urban Outfitters (URBN) reported a stronger-than-expected EPS gain on rising same-store sales. Shares shot up 23% to a 15-month high. Intel Goes Virtual, Partners With ARM Intel (INTC) is throwing down the gauntlet with a "merged reality" headset that eliminates cords and controllers, rivaling efforts by Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Facebook (FB) and HTC. The chipmaker announced the move during the annual Intel Developer Conference in San Francisco, Calif. The conference saw a record 6,000 in attendance and featured news that Intel is partnering with longtime rival ARM Holdings (ARMH) to make some of its mobile and Internet of Things chips. DOJ Prison Break Hits Geo Group, Corrections Corp. The Justice Department said it would phase out its use of privately run prisons, arguing that the government is better equipped for the job. Private prisons "do not provide the same level of correctional services, programs and resources; they do not save substantially on costs ... they do not maintain the same level of safety and security," Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said in a memo. GEO Group (GEO) plunged nearly 40% on Thursday, and Corrections Corp. of America (CXW) 35%, both hitting multiyear lows. Sporting Goods Retailers Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Foot Locker (FL) and Hibbett Sports (HIBB) all beat quarterly earnings views, though Hibbett's sales fell short. Dick's and Hibbett are dealing with the fallout from the liquidation of rival Sports Authority. Dick's won a bankruptcy bidding war for some Sports Authority assets earlier this year. Dicks' stock hit a record high, up 7.5% for the week. Foot Locker rose 12%. Hibbett Sports fell 0.7% in a volatile week.

A fringe issue is gaining unwanted attention, and TGT stock is taking the hit By Josh Enomoto, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  May 9, 2016, 6:00 am EST     Popular Posts: The 10 Best Pharma Stocks Under President Donald Trump The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Sign No One Is Talking About 3 Stocks to Sell Before Donald Trump Gets His Way Recent Posts: Black Friday Deals: 2 Stocks to Buy, 2 Stocks to Avoid 3 Stocks to Sell Before Donald Trump Gets His Way The Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Sign No One Is Talking About View All Posts Like any politician not named Donald Trump, Target Corporation (TGT) could have easily sidestepped a thorny issue by “Pleading the Fifth.” Instead, TGT went in guns blazing. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) Two weeks ago, the big box retailer announced that its guests and team members can use restrooms or fitting rooms that correspond to their gender identity. According to the Associated Press, Target became the first major retailer to publicly stand up for so-called transgender rights. At the same time, they drew unwanted attention at a particularly sensitive time, potentially harming the Target brand and TGT stock. 7 Blue Chips That Are Getting Ugly in a Hurry Backlash for TGT Stock A Christian activist group called The American Family Association fired back at the retailer immediately, calling for a boycott of Target stores. In the week following the transgender policy announcement, the AFA collected more than 744,800 pledges. In its second week, the AFA tacked on nearly 430,000 additional signatures — nearly a 60% increase. This supports AFA’s claim that the boycott proposal is one of their most popular campaigns. It also puts TGT in a defensive position that doesn’t help the company in any way. The timing of the decision is certainly peculiar. After all, the economy isn’t exactly a cauldron of opportunity. Since 2013, annual revenue for TGT has been largely flat, whereas fierce rival Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) — despite recent hiccups — has generally shown modest growth. Long-term investors of Target stock have also noted rising inventory levels over the past several years. And while Wal-Mart’s head executive Doug McMillon has personally voiced opposition to conservative advocacy movements, WMT as an entity smartly avoided the transgender identity issue. From a business standpoint, it comes down to raw numbers. Admittedly, quantifying the transgender population in the U.S. is difficult due to fears of discrimination, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. However, various research firms have produced rough estimates between 0.1% to 0.3% of the total population as being transgender. According to U.S. Census data, that amounts to less than one million people who identify that way. Consequently, this figure is outnumbered by just the AFA petitions. Understandably, TGT wants to protect its corporate message of inclusion and diversity. However, gender itself can be hard to define. For example, Facebook Inc (FB) offers an “extensive list of gender identities” for its users, which suggests gender as a preference as opposed to an existential right. Moreover, several TGT stores already offer unisex restrooms. The decision to weigh in so strongly on such a divisive issue has to be worrying for holders of Target stock. Since the retailer’s April 19 announcement, TGT stock has dropped 6.5%. Coincidence? I wouldn’t be too sure. First, there were no significant news items that would explain the sudden bearishness in TGT stock. Further, the announcement day also coincided with the company’s all-time closing high. The last time Target stock was this elevated was in July of last year. The negative impact isn’t just limited to angry evangelicals. According to marketing intelligence firm YouGov BrandIndex, the number of people that would consider TGT for their department store shopping needs fell from 42% to 38%. The study further indicated that a growing number of shoppers — especially women — heard negative comments about the company. Interestingly, brand perception of TGT is down to its lowest level in eight months. This is not to say that Target stock is going to collapse from here on out. But what smart investors will key in on is the wholly unnecessary drama that TGT executives created. How Target (TGT) Plans to Fix Its Supply Issues With unisex restrooms in tow, the retailer could have easily skirted controversy. Instead, they took a hard-line stance, promoting a very small social movement over the conservative sensibilities of millions of Americans. The decision not only hurt TGT stock, it’s risking the brand image Target purportedly wants to protect. As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Asda said like-for-like sales fell 7.5 per cent in the three months to June 30, which was a lot worse than the 5.7 per cent fall in the three months to March 30. This will be a major disappointment to the firm at a time when arch rivals Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have reported improving underlying sales. Doug McMillon, CEO of Asda’s parent company Wal-Mart said: “In the UK, the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales. Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics. We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments. While our turn-around will take time, I’m confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we’re addressing this with urgency.” Wal-Mart’s CFO Brett Biggs added: “In the UK, fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. “During the quarter, comp sales, excluding fuel, decreased 7.5 per cent. Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics; simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs through our cost analytics program and driving sales through strategic price investments where we remain committed to the previously announced five year £1.5bn price investment.” Asda reported a 5.8 per cent decline over Christmas, which had been its worst ever quarterly performance. In an attempt to turn the firm around, Asda’s parent company Wal-Mart has shipped in retail veteran Sean Clarke, a former Asda director, who took over as CEO​ on July 11 replacing Andy Clarke. Prior to this, Sean Clarke ​was head of Wal-Mart’s Chinese operations. Worryingly, ​Asda is seeing ​a five per cent​ drop in the number of shoppers visiting its stores​, signalling a failure to stem the rush to Aldi and Lidl. ​Asda usually comes top out of the big four in terms of basket prices, but shoppers on a budget can get goods for around 10 per cent less at Aldi and Lidl.​ The latest Kantar Worldpanel data shows that Asda is the worst performer out of the big four supermarkets. This is at a time when Aldi and Lidl are seeing sales increases of over 10 per cent as shoppers continue to desert Asda in favour of the discounters. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said: “It’s not good news for Sean Clarke. Asda needs to look at the weapons in its armoury. They will be thinking very hard about price.” Asda is rumoured to be mulling a big new wave of price cuts in order to win back customers. Asda is focusing on a revival plan, dubbed Project Renewal. It is on track with moves to slash costs, having announced in January it would cut hundreds of UK jobs, largely impacting its head office, which employs 3,000 people.Wal-Mart, the world’s biggest retailer, has confirmed that ​Dewsbury-born ​Roger Burnley will be named deputy CEO and chief operating officer at Asda when he rejoins the business in October.

ROS LBoard 1 Family cremates wrong body after hospital mix-up FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US AirAsia a Walmart in the sky, says Fernandes August 19, 2016 We are the Walmart in the sky, we just happened to be at 35,000 feet above, says AirAsia Group CEO. PUTRAJAYA: AirAsia, an airline that is well known to often break new ground, is keen to turn itself into “a Walmart in the sky”, a move to push its ancillary income to be a major contributor to its revenue. “We are the Walmart in the sky, we just happened to be at 35,000 feet above,” its group chief executive Tony Fernandes said. Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores and grocery stores. “While you’re walking through 7-eleven in the ground, there’s no reason we can’t be a consumer company up in the sky. Selling duty free, food, foreign exchange and insurance,” he told Bernama recently. However, the effort to boost its ancillary income is not something new, it has been a work in progress for sometime now, Fernandes said. “Right now, profitability from ancillary services almost matches profitability from our airline. We have a very strong airline business which is generating about 15 per cent margin, and a very strong ancillary income business which is generating far greater in margin,” he said. These are the things that would drive the business high, while AirAsia continues the effort to create new routes and increase frequencies. “Right now ancillary income makes up 23 per cent of our revenue, but almost 50 per cent of our profit,” he said. Asked on AirAsia India’s shareholding, Fernandes said it continued to cruise smoothly. AirAsia India started operations in June 2014 via a joint-venture between AirAsia Bhd, Tata Sons and businessman Arun Bhatia’s Telestra Tradeplace, with a 41.06 per cent, 49 per cent and 9.94 per cent shareholding respectively. Now, AirAsia Bhd has 49 per cent stake in AirAsia India, while Tata Sons Ltd and its executives hold the remaining 51 per cent. “Amar (Abrol, Chief Executive Officer of AirAsia India) is planning what we are going to do in the next 15-16 months. We have six aircraft now and we hope to ramp it up to 10,” he commented on the expansion plan. AirAsia India has recently announced that its seventh aircraft will joint operations next month, which marks the start of its growth phase in India. “While our competitors spend a lot of time suing us, they don’t realise they giving us free publicity. And so, we are a big brand in India. They saved me a lot of money,” he said. India needs more tourists and connectivity with its population of 1.25 billion, and it is a market with abundant opportunities for AirAsia India, he said. On the recent AirAsia 15-day roadshow, he said it received good response from investors as they were able to see how undervalued the airline was. “Our share price obviously had a good run. We’re at about RM3 (now). We were down at 78 sen. People are beginning to see our value,” he said. As at 12.30pm, AirAsia share price was up two sen at RM3.27.

Indices logged a modest return in a trading session marked by relatively muted moves for the main benchmarks as investors pored over a batch of upbeat economic data and digested signs that the Federal Reserve remains divided about the timing of the next interest-rate hike. A rise in oil prices, which pushed West Texas Intermediate crude trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark, helped nudge energy stocks up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.76 points, or 0.1%, at 18,597.70. The S&P 500 index was up 4.80 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,187.02. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index was up 11.49 points, or 0.2%, at 5,240.15. The S&P 500 index was up 4.80 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,187.02. Seven out of the S&P 500's 10 sectors finished in the green, with a decline in telecommunications, limiting the run-up in oil-and-gas stocks. Dow component Wal-Mart Stores was up 1.9%, giving the blue-chip gauge a lift, while a 1.2% slide in Caterpillar shares limited the benchmark's advance. Wal-Mart reported better-than-expected profit and revenues on Thursday. Shares in Cisco Systems fell after the maker of networking equipment late Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings and said that it plans to cut 5,500 jobs. Dow components Exxon Mobil and Chevron ended with gains of 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively. Equity indices struggled for direction as investors continued to adjust rate hike expectations for the year. Yesterday's release of the FOMC minutes for July indicated that Fed officials were divided on whether or not an interest rate hike would be appropriate in coming months. Specifically, concerns about the sustainability of recent hiring trends and consistently weak inflation readings compelled some members to hold off on raising rates. The stock market ended a range-bound day on a flat note as caution prevailed despite yesterday's dovish FOMC minutes from the July meeting. Equity indices struggled for direction as investors continued to adjust rate hike expectations for the year. Yesterday's release of the FOMC minutes for July indicated that Fed officials were divided on whether or not an interest rate hike would be appropriate in coming months. Specifically, concerns about the sustainability of recent hiring trends and consistently weak inflation readings compelled some members to hold off on raising rates. On Thursday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he would like to see another interest rate increase sooner rather than later. Among other Fed speakers, New York Fed President William Dudley on Thursday was upbeat about the outlook for jobs and growth, adding that time for a rate increase is edging closer. He spoke at a morning briefing for reporters at the regional Fed's bank headquarters on Wall Street. On the economic front, jobless claims last week fell by 4,000 to 262,000, representing a one-month low, and marking the 76th straight week that claims have been below 300,000. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's barometer of regional manufacturing activity rebounded slightly into positive territory in August. The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.4% in July, signaling that moderate but steady growth could continue for the remainder of 2016. Oil futures stretched their streak of gains to a sixth session in a row Thursday to settle at their highest level in nearly two monthslifting crude into a bull market. September West Texas Intermediate crude rose $1.43, or 3.1%, to settle at $48.22 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Data from the Energy Information Administration Wednesday showed weekly declines for both crude and gasoline inventories, prompting prices that day to settle higher for a fifth session. Treasuries ended the day on a higher note as the short-end of the curve enjoyed a decent bid. The yield on the 2-yr note settled lower by two basis points (0.71%) while the yield on the benchmark 10-yr note slipped one basis point to 1.53%. Today's participation was below the recent average as fewer than 737 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor.

"We are the Walmart in the sky, we just happened to be at 35,000 feet above," its group chief executive, Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said. Walmart, the world's largest company by revenue, is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores and grocery stores. "While you're walking through 7-eleven in the ground, there's no reason we can't be a consumer company up in the sky. Selling duty free, food, foreign exchange and insurance," he told Bernama recently. However, the effort to boost its ancillary income is not something new, it has been work in progress for sometimes now, Fernandes said. "Right now, profitability from ancillary services almost matches profitability from our airline. We have a very strong airline business which is generating about 15 per cent margin, and a very strong ancillary income business which is generating far greater in margin," he said. These are the things that would drive the business high, while AirAsia continues the effort to create new routes and increase frequencies. "Right now ancillary income makes up 23 per cent of our revenue, but almost 50 per cent of our profit," he said. Asked on AirAsia India's shareholding, Fernandes said it continued to cruise smoothly. AirAsia India started operations in June 2014 via a joint-venture between AirAsia Bhd, Tata Sons and businessman Arun Bhatia's Telestra Tradeplace, with a 41.06 per cent, 49 per cent and 9.94 per cent shareholding, respective.

Wal-Mart's vast fleet of stores and its online business are starting to click together. The company raised its earnings outlook for the year on Thursday and delivered strong profit and sales for the second quarter, as moves to improve the store and online experience are winning over customers. Wal-Mart has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure vegetables look good to cleaning up the stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It's melding online services with the stores - rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. As a result, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company reported its eighth consecutive quarterly increase in comparable-store sales, and the seventh straight quarterly gain in customer traffic. "We've got existing customers who are visiting stores more often and putting an extra item in their basket," said Greg Foran, CEO of Wal-Mart's US business, which accounts for 62 per cent of total sales. Wal-Mart is also picking up new customers, but that will take some time. Like its direct store rivals, Wal-Mart is reinventing itself to be more nimble as it tries to fight off competition. In particular, it's trying to compete with online leader Amazon.com, whose Prime shipping programme is swiftly converting members into loyal shoppers. And it faces competition from dollar stores and traditional grocers like Kroger, which are ramping up promotions and lowering prices. The report contrasts with results from Target Corp, which cut its profit forecast Wednesday as customer traffic waned. Wal-Mart is vastly expanding the items available on its website, and global online sales rose 11.8 per cent in the second quarter. That's up from the seven per cent pace of the first quarter, but still far weaker than the 20 per cent increases from less than two years ago. It's also spending US$3 billion to acquire fast-growing online retailer Jet.com, which it says will help it grab higher-income and younger customers. It will incorporate some of Jet.com's technology that lowers prices in real time. Spending to profit Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a pre-recorded call that the growth in global e-commerce came from the improvement in the US market, fuelled by its roll-out of Wal-Mart Pay and the online grocery and pick-up services that it's rolling out. The company added grocery pick-up service to 30 more markets in the second quarter, bringing the total to more than 60. The grocery business showed improvement from the first quarter, despite inflationary pressure. Both general merchandise and health and wellness items showed solid sales growth. Second-quarter net income jumped nearly nine per cent to US$3.77 billion, for US$1.21 per share, in the quarter ended July 31. That compares with US$3.47 billion, or US$1.08 per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings adjusted for non-recurring gains were US$1.07 per share, a nickel better than Wall Street had expected, according to a survey by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue was US$120.85 billion, also edging out analyst forecasts. Revenue at US Wal-Mart stores opened at least a year rose 1.6 per cent, its best performance since 2012. Customer traffic rose 1.2 per cent, marking the seventh straight quarter of gains. The US Wal-Mart division accounts for 62 per cent of total sales. The company now estimates that for the current fiscal year, adjusted per-share earnings will be US$4.15 to US$4.35. Analysts had expected US$4.27. Wal-Mart is also spending US$2.7 billion on higher wages and other investments for its hourly workers over a two-year period. The company also just rolled out a new system in about 650 neighbourhood market stores that gives hourly workers more certainty about their schedules. Wal-Mart says lifting wages, which has turned into a contentious issue for a number of major US restaurant chains and retailers, will lead to a more solid workforce that can better serve their customers. - AP «ECB officials saw shock from UK vote as largely contained P.A.

By MarkDeCambre U.S. stocks on Thursday logged a modest return in a trading session marked by relatively muted moves for the main benchmarks as investors pored over a batch of upbeat economic data and digested signs that the Federal Reserve remains divided about the timing of the next interest-rate hike. A rise in oil prices, which pushed West Texas Intermediate crude trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange — the U.S. benchmark — into bull-market territory, helped nudge energy stocks up. A bull market is defined as a 20% rise from a recent low. Read: Why oil prices just stampeded into bull-market territory The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.21% rose 23.76 points, or 0.1%, at 18,597.70, with much of that gain coming within the last few minutes of the session in an up-and-down trading day. Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +0.88%  was up 1.9%, giving the blue-chip gauge a lift, while a 1.2% slide in Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +2.52% shares limited the benchmark’s advance. Wal-Mart reported better-than-expected profit and revenues on Thursday. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.07%  was up 4.80 points, or 0.2%, to close at 2,187.02, supported by a 1.8% rally in energy shares. Seven out of the S&P 500’s 10 sectors finished in the green, with a 0.8% decline in telecommunications, limiting the run-up in oil-and-gas stocks. “If crude oil is able to sustain its gains, then this should obviously be good news for energy stocks, which could help to lift the Dow into new uncharted territories soon,” said Fawad Razaqzada, technical analyst at Forex.com. On the economic front, jobless claims last week fell by 4,000 to 262,000, representing a one-month low, and marking the 76th straight week that claims have been below 300,000. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s barometer of regional manufacturing activity rebounded slightly into positive territory in August. Discussing the relatively lackluster trading moves, Kim Caughey Forrest, senior portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group said, “I don’t understand why the market isn’t taking this [data] and doing something with it today.” “I don’t know what Mr. Market is waiting for,” she said Forrest said seasonally light trading volume might be contributing to what has been relatively muted trading. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.36%   was up 11.49 points, or 0.2%, at 5,240.15 Other market participants believe that the market has become too focused on ultraloose monetary policy and the Fed’s moves. “The obsession with low interest rates has brainwashed investors,” said Peter Boockvar, managing director at economic advisory firm The Lindsey Group. Boockvar said the market isn’t eager for a rate increase because of weak corporate earnings and a domestic economy that has been sputtering. “I think [U.S. GDP is] going to grow at less than 2% this year and we know where earnings are going; they’re going down ’cause profit margins are shrinking,” Boockvar said. Authorities attempt to aid Louisiana flood victims(1:34) Rescue and recovery efforts are under way in southern Louisiana, days after heavy rains brought massive flooding to the region. At least 40,000 homes have been damaged and at authorities say 11 people have died. Photo: AP On Wednesday, U.S. stocks closed slightly higher, shaking off losses as minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting showed that some policy makers were eager to raise rates but members were split on when and under what circumstance a rate raise would be most appropriate. Read: Fed was split in July over whether an interest-rate increase would be needed soon, minutes show On Thursday, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he would like to see another interest rate increase “sooner rather than later.” “The broader national economy is in good shape,” Williams said in a speech prepared for delivery to a business group in Anchorage, Alaska. Movers and shakers: Wal-Mart shares climbed as the retailing heavyweight’s second-quarter earnings and same-store sales came in ahead of Wall Street’s expectations. Shares in Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -0.80%    fell after the maker of networking equipment late Wednesday reported better-than-expected earnings and said that it plans to cut 5,500 jobs. Shares of prison operators Corrections Corp. of America CXW, +1.80% tanked 47% and GEO Corp. Inc. GEO, +1.28%  plunged 40% on Thursday after a report said the Justice Department plans to phase out its use of privately owned facilities. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. VRX, -4.95% shares dropped 2.7% after T. Rowe Price Group Inc. TROW, +0.05% filed suit against the Canadian drug company, alleging it was involved in “a fraudulent scheme.” Hormel Foods Corp. CSCO, -0.80% rose 1.9% after posting third-quarter profit that beat estimates. The company behind the Spam and Jennie-O brands also raised its yearly earnings forecast. Other markets: Oil futures US:CLU6  ended up, rallying more than 20% above the Aug. 2 low of $39.51 a barrel, driving it back into bull-market territory. Brent crude UK:LCOV6 pivoted up, topping $50 a barrel. Europe’s main stock benchmark SXXP, -0.07% posted gains for the first time in five sessions, while Asian markets closed mixed. Gold futures GCZ6, -1.77%  settled higher as a key dollar index DXY, +0.56% lost ground. Economic news: The Conference Board on Thursday said its index of leading economic indicators rose 0.4% in July, signaling that moderate but steady growth could continue for the remainder of 2016. Check out: MarketWatch’s Economic Calendar Among other Fed speakers, New York Fed President William Dudley on Thursday was upbeat about the outlook for jobs and growth, adding that time for a rate increase “is edging closer.” He spoke at a morning briefing for reporters at the regional Fed’s bank headquarters on Wall Street. —Victor Reklaitis contributed to this article More from MarketWatch What Eli Lilly’s hard fall in Alzheimer’s treatment race means for its competitors Sessions, Pompeo Tapped as Trump Cabinet Picks The nasty rise of ‘flash mob robbers’ Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets NY Stock Exchange NASDAQ Mark DeCambre Mark DeCambre is MarketWatch's markets editor.

Lifestyle People Chicken Charlie’s great Twinkie fry-off Karla PetersonContact Reporter When Charlie Boghosian heard that Hostess was bringing prepackaged deep-fried Twinkies to 4,000 Walmart stores this week, the man whose Chicken Charlie’s stand introduced San Diego County Fairgoers to the belly-busting wonders of the deep-fried Twinkie did not get his intestines in a bunch. While he may be the king of the hot-oil universe, Boghosian is a lover, not a fighter. What he loves is finding new things to fry and watching people eat them. Some of these things include Oreos, Klondike bars, bacon-wrapped pickles, s’mores and SlimFast bars. Boghosian lives to fry, and his philosophy about deep-fried food competition is the same as his philosophy about deep-fried food. Which is basically, more is better. In fact, more is best. “Here’s what comes to my mind,” Boghosian said this week. “I love this country because of our freedom to choose. You can choose to eat a deep-fried Twinkie from me. You can choose to eat a deep-fried Twinkie from somewhere else. I love it. I think it’s great.” The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to an oven near you. Hostess has launched packaged Deep Fried Twinkies, which are being sold at Walmart stores nationwide. Mary Altaffer The deep-fried Twinkie is jumping from the state fair to an oven near you.

Hostess has launched packaged Deep Fried Twinkies, which are being sold at Walmart stores nationwide. (Mary Altaffer) On the day after the frozen deep-fried Twinkies made their Walmart debut, Boghosian was in his Chicken Charlie’s FryBQ restaurant on Balboa Avenue doing the thing he does most and the thing he does best. The thing he does the most this time of year is juggle, as he runs the restaurant and ferries his Chicken Charlie’s trailers from the San Diego County Fair to the Orange County Fair, to the Los Angeles County Fair, which opens Sept. 2. The thing he does best is throw weird and/or unlikely items into his fryers and see what sticks. Just a brief conversation about his fair schedule leads to the top-secret revelation that he is debuting two items at the L.A. County Fair: deep-fried hot sauce and deep-fried bacon guacamole. “They’re amazing,” Boghosian says, his green eyes gleaming. The Syrian-born kid who was crazy about his mother’s deep-fried eggplant has grown into a man who has sold Americans on the Instagram-worthy, Facebook-friendly, bucket-list ready concept of deep-fried indulgence. And it all started with a Twinkie. “When I first came to America in 1980, I went into a 7-Eleven in Massachusetts. I walked in and saw these cakes on the shelf, and I asked, ‘What is this?’ And it was my first Twinkie. The Twinkie is America to me.” His first American love was the Twinkie, but his first deep-fried success story was the Oreo. It happened sometime in the 1990s, when Boghosian was looking for an item that would distinguish his Del Mar Fairgrounds food stand from all of the food stands. Inspired by his favorite McDonald’s meal (Big Mac and an apple pie), Boghosian decided he needed a deep-fried dessert. He experimented on all manner of Hostess items, but when his brother’s package of Oreos caught his eye, he tossed a few in the fryer, and a coronary classic was born. Boghosian did not create deep-fried Twinkies (that honor goes to a Brit named Christopher Sell), and while they are among his most popular fair items, he does not sell them in his restaurant. But the idea that they were coming to freezer cases nationwide got the gears turning. He would take me into his FryBQ kitchen and show me how to make a great deep-fried Twinkie, he said, but it wouldn’t be just any deep-fried Twinkie. It would be a deep-fried Twinkie rolled in bacon, Chicken Charlie’s-style. It starts with a Twinkie right out of the box. You roll the Twinkie in dry flour, then you dunk it in batter. Then you drop it in a fryer full of bubbling 360-degree vegetable oil. Let it bob around in there for a minute (tops) until it puffs into a golden ball of sin. Take it out, drizzle it with chocolate, roll it in chopped bacon and finish it with powdered sugar. Take a bite. Admit that, yes, you might just be an evil food genius. The deep-fried Twinkie covered with chocolate, powdered sugar, and crushed bacon will be available at Chicken Charlie’s FryBQ restaurant from Aug. 19-21 only.

(Eduardo Contreras) “Oh my God, that is good,” Boghosian said of his creation, which turned out to be a singularly sublime combination of fluffy Twinkie, comfort-food grease, warm creamy filling and savory bacon, for that final nail in your dietary coffin. The deep-fried Twinkie with bacon was so good, in fact, that Boghosian decided to put it on the FryBQ menu today through Sunday. You could call it the Revenge is Sweet Special, but Boghosian won’t. The idea that corporate America would attempt to bring the fairground to your freezer does not bother him one bit. He fully intends to give this prefab treat a try, and failure is not his idea of an option. “I just hope they know what they’re doing,” he said soberly. “Because it has to taste good.” The next day, I picked up a box of Hostess Deep Fried Twinkies at the Walmart Supercenter Store in Oak Park. I baked one in the toaster oven for nine minutes, cooled it for two minutes, and regretted it almost immediately. It wasn’t terrible, but it wasn’t good, either. Where Boghosian’s Twinkie was full of flavors and textures, this one was a ball of sweet mush wrapped in a brittle shell of disappointment. It needed bacon. It needed love. It needed Charlie.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St inches up with energy gain, Wal-Mart By Reuters Published: 16:43 EST, 18 August 2016 | Updated: 16:43 EST, 18 August 2016 e-mail By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, Aug 18 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended up slightly on Thursday as Brent oil's rise above $50 a barrel boosted energy shares and an upbeat outlook lifted Wal-Mart to a 14-month high. Wal-Mart rose 1.9 percent to end at $74.30 after the retailer reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its fiscal-year outlook. The upbeat forecast followed disappointing outlooks from Target and Lowe's Companies the previous day. The energy index jumped 1.8 percent after Brent crude topped $50 for the first time in six weeks as major producers prepared to discuss a possible output freeze. Late-session gains pushed the indexes out of flat territory where they had traded for much of the session, with the S&P 500 index up just 0.1 percent for the week so far. "With commodities rebounding and the economy remaining surprisingly resilient, with just a little bit more Fed-speak about rising interest rates, that could create a pause. On the other hand, it's been a good year, especially for value investors," said Bryant Evans, investment adviser and portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management, in Champaign, Illinois. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 23.76 points, or 0.13 percent, to 18,597.7, the S&P 500 added 4.8 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,187.02 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 11.49 points, or 0.22 percent, to 5,240.15. The benchmark S&P index is up 7 percent since Dec. 31. Its recent run to record highs has been partly supported by expectations the Fed will continue to keep rates low, as well as some upbeat earnings and economic news. Data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week. Investors expect more insight on the rate outlook at an annual meeting of central bankers from around the world in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week. Among the day's decliners, the telecommunications index fell 0.8 percent, leading sector losses. Cisco shares fell 0.8 percent to $30.48 after the network equipment provider said it would cut 5,500 jobs and gave a disappointing forecast. NetApp jumped 17.4 percent to $33.88 after its quarterly results beat expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.39-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.21-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 27 new lows.

The S&P 500 posted 19 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 93 new highs and 27 new lows. About 5.9 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.4 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Lester Brown, 39, from Manor in Texas, paid teacher Sabrina Drude's $97 bill at a Wal-Mart store near San Antonio, Texas, after he noticed her going through the checkout with lots of school supplies but no children. Drude, 23, explained that she was buying them for her students who come from an underprivileged area and often cannot afford supplies, at which point Brown offered to pay for them. Sabrina Drude, 23, a teacher from San Antonio, Texas, praised Lester Brown, 39, a former minister, after he paid for school supplies she was buying for underprivileged students Drude said she burst into tears after Brown approached her at the cash register in Wal-Mart to ask why she was buying so much stationery, then offered to pay for all of it The teacher thanked Brown for his kind gesture, but said she would not feel comfortable accepting his money. Drude ran her shopping through the till and was going to get her purse out as $97 flashed up on the display, but Brown got there first.

Share this article Share 16 shares 'He said "put your wallet away" and I just started crying,' Drude told CBS News. 'That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard.' When she asked him why he was being so kind, Brown responded: 'Because teachers don’t get the recognition that they deserve.' Brown, who is a former minister and is currently a crisis worker, told KENS5: 'It was the right thing to do. It’s what God said to do and it’s that simple. Brown said that he had been carrying a $100 bill around in his wallet waiting for an opportunity to give it to a worthy cause, 'and God said to respond' Drude said she chooses to buy equipment for her students because she doesn't want them to suffer the embarrassment of not being to afford it 'I remember I had this hundred-dollar bill with the intention of responding to something in need, and God said to respond. 'I challenge you, whatever it is you can afford, to volunteer at a school, help a family. You want people to live better, love thy neighbor.  'Love thy neighbor means do your part.' Drude said that while it is not a requirement for teachers to supply their pupils, she does so out of her own pocket so they don't have to deal with the embarrassment of their parents not being able to afford it. She added that she will be telling her students about Brown's kind act in the hope it inspires them: 'This is exactly the type of person I want to influence my kids to be.  'I want him to inspire my kids just like he inspired me; if any of my kids grew up to be half the man he is I’d be very proud.'

Matika previously were sentenced on Thursday. Dylan Lewis Rahmann, 24, of Saylorsburg, was sentenced to placement in the state’s Intermediate Punishment program in two cases on charges of false reports to law enforcement and contraband — controlled substance in a prison. The false ID count stems from a vehicle stop where he gave the wrong name. The drug count stems from an incident in April 2015 at the county prison where he was involved in bringing drugs into the prison. His placement in the state program is for two years. The program involves seven months in prison, a period of time in an intensive drug rehabilitation program and then time in a halfway house. If he fails to complete it he will be brought back and resentenced by Matika. Kathleen Ann Kattner, 45, of Palmerton, was placed on probation for two years on charges of simple assault and resisting arrest. The incident occurred Nov. 12, 2014, in the area of 901 Princeton Ave. in Palmerton. Police were dispatched to the area for a disturbance. On scene they found Kattner involved in the disturbance. When attempting to take her into custody, she kicked officer Shawn Leadbetter. Police also had to use substantial force to place her in the police cruiser. She admitted to a long-term alcohol and drug abuse problem and said most of her criminal record is due to it. She is facing sentencing in September on other criminal charges she previously pleaded to. Matika ordered her to get both drug and alcohol and mental health evaluations, zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use, and render 100 hours of community service. She is currently an inmate in the county prison on the other charges. Jason Paul Schmidt, 39, of West Hazleton, was sentenced to serve three to one day less 24 months in the county prison on charges of retail theft and theft. He was charged by Mahoning Township police for two incidents at Walmart on Aug. 26 and 30, 2015. He was also ordered to make total restitution of $1,691.98 to Walmart, get a mental health evaluation, and stay out of the Walmart store. He was given credit for four days spent in jail on the charges. He will begin the jail term at noon on Aug. 9 and serve it on consecutive two-day weekends. Ronald David Getz, 45, of Lehighton, was sentenced to serve 30 days to one year in prison on a charge of simple assault. He was charged by Lansford police for an incident at the borough’s midrise on Aug. 14, 2015. Getz admitted getting into an altercation with Dale Miles in the lobby area of the building. Getz said that Miles was “stalking” his then girlfriend. Miles, who was in court, denied that and said he never saw Getz before when he suddenly punched him in the face while entering an elevator at the midrise, knocking out one of his teeth. Matika said he was concerned about Getz’s prior record and felt a prison term was needed. Getz was also ordered to render 50 hours of community service when paroled, zero tolerance imposed on drug or alcohol use and have no contact with the victim. Due to pending health-related matters, Getz will not begin the jail term until 5 p.m. Sept. 30 and serve it on consecutive weekends. Samantha Nicole Gulla, 30, of Bel Alton, Maryland, and formerly of Lansford, was sentenced to serve a total one to 12 months in prison on charges of endangering the welfare of a child and DUI. She was stopped on July 5, 2015, along Bertsch Street by Lansford police. Police were originally dispatched for a domestic dispute and on scene spoke with Gulla, who had gone to a Bertsch Street residence with her 3-year-old son to see his father. She admitted driving to the residence with the child in the car while under the influence. She refused to submit to a blood test. She was also ordered to get a drug and alcohol evaluation, zero tolerance for drug and alcohol use, render a total of 100 hours of community service, pay a fine of $1,500, and have her license suspended for 18 months. She was given credit for 30 days spent in an inpatient rehab program and paroled. All defendants must also pay court costs of about $1,000 and a $50 per month supervision fee while on parole or probation.

REUTERS/Nacho Doce/FilesMore By Nandita Bose (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday, saying it benefited from cleaner and more efficient U.S. stores, investments in technology that improved online shopping and higher employee wages that fostered better customer service. The world's largest retailer has been spending heavily to entice consumers back to its stores with better stocked shelves, and improving its e-commerce business by investing in new warehouses that can deliver online shipments faster. Last week, it announced the acquisition of online startup Jet.com for over $3 billion to better compete with Amazon.com Inc . Wal-Mart also increased entry level wages to $10 an hour earlier this year and said it will invest $2.7 billion in employee compensation and training over two years, a move it said contributed to improved service in its stores. These steps, analysts said, helped Wal-Mart to raise its fiscal-year forecast and buck a string of weak results from higher-end brick-and-mortar competitors like Target Corp , Macy's Inc and Kohls Corp . Target cut its fiscal-year profit outlook on Wednesday after quarterly sales fell more than expected. Wal-Mart U.S. Chief Executive Officer Greg Foran said on a conference call that the company's customers were still cautious with their spending but were visiting stores more often and buying more items. Store visits increased 1.2 percent, and the average size of an order rose 0.4 percent during the second quarter ended on July 31. "We are seeing a steady improvement in the U.S. business, and it is responding favourably to the changes we are making," he said. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said sales were strong for grocery items and apparel but weak for electronics. "Walmart's strategic investments are generating traction, which is especially meaningful, given a large portion of its customer base remains challenged," said Moody's analyst Charlie O'Shea. The retailer said it was difficult to quantify the effects of low gasoline prices and unseasonably warm weather, but those factors contributed to overall sales growth. Online sales growth accelerated sequentially for the first time in more than five quarters, rising 11.8 percent from 7 percent in the first quarter. Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs said e-commerce growth was stronger in the United States than in major overseas markets, mainly because of its larger third-party seller business and the continued roll-out of online grocery pickup options. Wal-Mart has added 7 million items to its website this year, bringing the total to 15 million. This compares with 200 million on online rival Amazon.com Inc . The company raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook to between $4.15 and $4.35 a share, including an estimated hit of 5 cents from the Jet.com acquisition, from a previous range of $4 to $4.30. Second-quarter earnings per share of $1.07, excluding a gain from the sale of Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in China and other items, exceeded the analysts' average estimate by 5 cents. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.6 percent, excluding fuel prices, to beat expectations in their eighth straight quarter of growth. International sales fell 6.6 percent to $28.6 billion but increased 2.2 percent on a currency-neutral basis. Total revenue rose 0.5 percent to $120.9 billion. Wal-Mart's shares rose as much as 2.8 percent earlier in the trading day. They were up 1.8 percent at $74.23 in afternoon trade.

By CNBC on Publish Date August 5, 2016. Photo by CNBC. Watch in Times Video » embed Hampton Creek, a prominent start-up that is trying to bring tech industry panache to the world of mayonnaise, ranch dressing and other food products, has come under scrutiny by regulators for its business practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened a preliminary inquiry into Hampton Creek, according to a person briefed on the situation who asked not to be named because it had not been announced publicly. The S.E.C. inquiry is a response to a recent report from Bloomberg News that described an organized effort by Hampton Creek to buy large quantities of its Just Mayo product — a mayonnaise that uses a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs — by sending undercover contractors into stores. Kevin J. Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., declined to comment. Bloomberg earlier reported the S.E.C. inquiry. Hampton Creek’s chief executive, Joshua Tetrick, said he had heard from the S.E.C. about the informal inquiry but declined to give further details. Bloomberg’s report said the product buyback effort, which took place in 2014, made Just Mayo seem more popular than it was, not long before Hampton Creek raised $90 million from venture capitalists and other private investors. The basic details of the program were confirmed by a former Hampton Creek employee, who asked for anonymity because of confidentiality restrictions with his onetime employer. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After the report, Mr. Tetrick wrote in a blog post that the mayonnaise shopping spree was part of a quality control program that had minimal impact on overall sales. The inquiry puts a cloud over Hampton Creek, which has described itself as the fastest-growing food company in the world. It has promised to tackle the food industry with the gusto of a technology start-up, using some of the same big data tools to do so. One of its goals is to identify healthy, plant-based ingredients that can substitute for common foods like eggs, with less of a negative impact on the environment. Hampton Creek, based in San Francisco, has been praised by the likes of Bill Gates; received financial backing from prominent Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors like Marc Benioff and Vinod Khosla; and succeeded in getting its products widely distributed at Walmart, Costco, Whole Foods and other retailers. The inquiry may be only the start of tougher questions facing Hampton Creek. The company is believed to be losing significant amounts of money. It is raising up to $220 million from investors, according to a Delaware filing provided by Equidate, which tracks private company shares. It’s not uncommon, of course, for start-ups to bleed red ink in their early days. But Hampton Creek, founded in 2011, faces some basic challenges with the manufacturing costs for its products. According to one former employee, in 2014 the company had negative gross margins of about 20 percent on Just Mayo, meaning that the raw cost to the company for every $1 it got in sales was about $1.20. Photo Just Mayo products use a plant-based ingredient instead of eggs. Joshua Tetrick, the company’s chief executive, said Just Mayo planned to break even by the end of next year. The issue arises from Hampton Creek’s use of premium ingredients in its products without charging shoppers the often eye-popping prices attached to such food products. The vegetable oil used in Just Mayo, for example, does not come from genetically modified organism sources, which adds significant cost, according to the former employee. Journalism that matters. More essential than ever. Subscribe to the Times But on Walmart.com on Friday, a 30-ounce jar of Just Mayo was selling for $3.66 — 32 cents less than a jar of Hellmann’s mayonnaise of the same size. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Tetrick said the company planned to break even by the end of next year. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “We are fortunate to be well capitalized,” he said, declining to disclose how much the company had in the bank. He added that some of Hampton Creek’s dressings, mayonnaise and food service cookie products were gross-margin-positive, meaning they generated more revenue than they cost to make. “We’re not trying to optimize at every turn, thinking, ‘What’s the margin?’” he said. “It’s about solving the bigger food problem. You know what we do about it? We attack it.” The company’s program to buy its own mayonnaise has raised eyebrows among retail analysts. Food makers typically do quality checks through every step of production until the product lands on grocery shelves. Kurt Jetta, chief executive of TABS Analytics, a research firm, said that while he had heard of companies buying their own products off retail shelves, in most of those cases, “it’s to jack up the sales numbers, not for quality assurance.” He also said paying retail prices to buy products for quality assurance made “zero financial sense.” When food companies want to move a product off a grocery shelf to replace it with a reformulated or newly packaged version or because it has passed its expiration date, they issue a credit to the store manager — and then only to cover the price the retailer paid, not the consumer price. Some food industry consultants, though, said it was not unheard-of for companies to buy their food products off shelves. Stericycle is a company that helps manufacturers with “audits” of their products for quality assurance purposes. “Manufacturers and retailers may need help with on-site resolution, including handling consumer complaints, product quality evaluation and much more, but they may not have the internal staff to handle those things quickly and efficiently,” said Kevin Pollack, vice president and general manager at Stericycle. Word of the program was mentioned briefly in a lawsuit against Hampton Creek filed this year on behalf of two former contractors for the company who were seeking unpaid wages. The contractors worked in stores in 2014 and 2015, representing Hampton Creek and handing out samples of Just Mayo to spread word of the product. But according to the lawsuit, Hampton Creek required the contractors to also “buy out shelves of Defendant’s products.” Stephanie Strom contributed reporting.

CDT August 19, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Pasquale Brocco’s 300-pound weight loss started with a decision to walk to the grocery store. Three years ago, Brocco realized at 605 pounds, his weight could kill him. He said in an Instagram post his eating habits were suicidal. Brocco told ABC News he made a choice to walk to Walmart every time he was hungry. “You walk to Walmart three times a day, and you end up walking 6 miles,” he told ABC News. “It’s amazing because I never walked 6 miles in my life, and I was doing it every day.” As he shed weight and felt comfortable enough to go to a gym, he added more exercise to his routine.

(WMT) Pops on REAL Progress The world's biggest retailer may finally be out of the woods By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 18, 2016, 8:55 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Due for Even BIGGER Gains 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Recent Posts: Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Drug Failure Doesn’t Answer the Bigger Question The Dow Jones Is Completely Defying Expectations Why Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dycom Industries, Inc. (DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) still has some tough challenges ahead. But Thursday’s early-morning surge in Walmart stock following a solid second-quarter earnings report says something telling and inspiring: Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr The market finally sees more reward than risk in owning a piece of WMT. Last quarter, the world’s largest retailer earned an operating profit of $1.07 per share on sales of $120.9 billion. Factoring in adverse currency exchange rates, revenue would have grown 2.8% to $123.6 billion. Analysts collectively expected WMT to earn $1.02 per share on sales of $120.34 billion, so that’s a beat on both ends. Walmart stock holders also had to be encouraged by the comparisons. Namely, Walmart earned $1.08 per share on $120.23 billion in sales. So Q2 marked the eighth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. Same-store sales were expected to rise 1% — by analysts as well as the company — matching the first quarter’s comps growth rate. WMT pleasantly surprised on that measure too, however, logging same-store sales growth of 1.6%. All told, it marks a lot of progress on an effort that had yet to bear much fruit. Walmart’s Overhaul Effort Walmart stock began facing a brisk headwind in 2013 (fiscal 2014), forcing the company to make changes on multiple fronts. 7 Best Dividend Stocks You Haven’t Heard Of One of the retailer’s bigger sore spots has been its e-commerce division. It has been losing ground to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), partially because Amazon is good, and partially because Walmart didn’t allocate enough resources to its digital sales venue. That changed late last year. WMT announced it would spend an additional $2 billion on its e-commerce platform over the course of 2016 and 2017. More fulfillment centers and online grocery shopping were among the focal points. It didn’t help much initially. Walmart’s e-commerce growth rate continued every quarter since the first quarter of 2015, falling to only 7% for the first quarter. Last quarter, though, digital sales grew 11.3%. Gross merchandise volume was up 13% compared to Q2 of a year earlier. It was progress at a time investors needed to see it. The recent $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com could provide another much-needed jolt to Walmart’s e-commerce engine. The deal, however, has raised more questions than it has answered, most of them focusing on any integration and associated timelines. All the same, most observers are enthusiastic about the deal’s potential. Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace commented, “We believe the broadline retailers have higher vulnerability to online competition, but view Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com as a positive development in the company’s e-commerce strategy.” Walmart has also upped its payroll spending. After years of labor-related headaches (mostly a lack of pay), Walmart acquiesced. In April of last year, 500,000 employees saw their hourly pay ramp up to $9, then 1 million workers got a bump up to $10 per hour in February of this year. Though arguably necessary, owners of Walmart stock have seen those pay raises take a toll on the bottom line. Last year, CFO Brett Biggs warned investors the initiative could shave $1.5 billion off this year’s bottom line, and so far, the number doesn’t seem implausible. During the first quarter, selling and administrative expenses grew by $1.4 billion, or 6.3%, though revenue was only up 1%. For Q2, selling and administrative costs were up 4.6%, to $25.2 billion. Not Everything Is Hunky-Dory, Though Walmart has continued to struggle at finding a winning mix of formats and product focuses.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 45.13 or 0.24% to 18,552.57, while the S&P 500 Composite index inched down by 3.15 or 0.14% to 2,183.87, both falling short of a positive close in spite of a late rally. At session-lows, the Dow fell as much as 100 points. On the S&P 500, six of 10 sectors closed in the red as stocks in defensive Utilities and Telecommunications industries lagged. Stocks in the Technology, Industrials and Basic Materials sectors led, each gaining more than 0.10% on the session. The NASDAQ Composite index, meanwhile, fell 1.77 or 0.03% to 5,238.38, amid declines in media and telecom stocks. Despite the slight losses, the NASDAQ completed its first 8-week winning streak since 2010. Shares in Viacom B Inc (NASDAQ:VIAB) surged more than 1.5% to an intraday high of 44.16, amid reports of an impending settlement between chairman emeritus Sumner Redstone and CEO Philippe Dauman. As part of the settlement, Dauman could reportedly receive a severance package of as much $72 million, according to CNBC and other media reports. In addition, the two sides will end a protracted legal dispute and Dauman will reportedly be replaced by Tom Dooley as interim CEO through September. The top performer on the Dow was Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE), which jumped 1.69 or 2.95% to 58.90. It came after the multinational athletic apparel giant agreed to form a supply-chain partnership with private equity firm Apollo Global Management. As part of the deal, the partnership agreed to acquire Pennsylvania-based apparel company New Holland, which maintains factories in two Central American countries. The worst performer was Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT), which fell 1.49 or 2.01% to 72.81, amid heavy profit taking. On Thursday, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) hit 1-year highs at 74.29 after achieving comparable store sales growth of 1.6% in the second quarter, representing its strongest quarterly gains in three years. The biggest gainer on the NASDAQ was Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT), which surged 1.49 or 2.01% to 72.81. Shares in the Santa Clara, California-based semiconductor chip maker extended gains from Thursday's after-hours session after the company topped quarterly earnings forecasts amid a fresh record-high in new orders on the period. The worst performer was DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH), which fell 1.13 or 2.19% to 50.40. The top performer on the S&P 500 was Deere & Company (NYSE:DE), which surged 10.38 or 13.849% to 87.32. John Deere shares popped in spite of soft earnings over its third quarter, due primarily to continued weakness in the global agricultural economy. Earlier this week, billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Bill Gates reduced their stakes in the farm equipment manufacturer ahead of the earnings release. Investors, however, focused more intently on the company's forward guidance, as Deere increased its full-year earnings outlook from $1.2 to $1.35 billion. The worst performer was DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc (NYSE:DVA), which fell 3.17 or 4.69% to 50.42. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 1,759-1,191 margin. Investing.com offers an extensive set of professional tools for the financial markets.

But, this grocery chain that specializes in organic fare is also known as a pricey place to shop for food. And for parents trying to raise a family and grow their wealth at the same time, groceries can take a huge bite out of their budgets. If you’re looking to save money on food, you probably don't want to do all of your shopping at Whole Foods. However, the company has made recent moves to make shopping at the upscale grocer more affordable. For example, earlier this year, Whole Foods began opening 365 by Whole Foods Market stores, which were "designed around affordability and convenience," said co-founder John Mackey in a press release. "Through lower capital and operating costs, we are able to offer great values to our customers, and the response has been overwhelmingly positive." To help you figure out what to buy and skip at this grocer, GOBankingRates.com talked to consumer and money-saving experts. Click through to see their best and worst deals so you can save money on your next trip to Whole Foods. 10 Best Deals at Whole Foods You can find several items at Whole Foods that cost the same or less than at other grocery stores. Be sure, though, to check WholeFoods.com for coupons. You might also find Whole Foods coupons by searching coupon sites. Teri Gault, grocery-shopping expert and author of “Shop Smart. Save More,” recommended signing up for email notifications from discount gift card site Raise.com so you’ll know when discounted Whole Foods gift cards are available and can buy them to use in the store. Here are 10 products, in particular, that are typically good deals at Whole Foods. 1. Olive Oil Gina Briles, who has researched Whole Foods’ prices versus those at other grocers for Cheapism.com, said one of the best deals at Whole Foods is its 365 brand organic olive oil, which is priced lower than name brands and other supermarkets’ own organic brands. According to Briles, a 33.8-ounce bottle of non-organic 365 Everyday Value olive oil was about $4 less than the same size jar from Safeway Signature Select — one of the best generic brands for saving money. 2. Balsamic Vinegar The 365 Everyday Value organic balsamic vinegar is a great deal, said Gault. It costs about 25 percent less than Newman's Own organic balsamic vinegar sold in supermarkets, and it's richer and thicker, claimed Gault, who considers herself to be a balsamic aficionado.

Organic Milk A gallon of Whole Foods 365 Everyday Value organic milk cost 50 cents less than organic milk found at Safeway, found GOBankingRates. If you buy organic milk primarily to avoid the growth hormone given to cows, you can save even more by buying conventional milk that has an "rBST free" seal on the label, said Gault. 4. Non-Dairy Milk For those who can’t consume dairy or choose not to, Whole Foods has competitive pricing on its store-brand milk alternatives. According to research by Cheapism.com, 365 Everyday Value organic almond milk and soy milk is 60 cents to 70 cents less than some brands found at Safeway. When these and other non-dairy milks go on sale at Whole Foods, you can stock up and save as much as 50 percent per ounce as compared to the refrigerated 64-ounce varieties, said Gault. 5. Organic Chicken Broth A 32-ounce carton of 365 Everyday Value organic chicken broth at Whole Foods is priced 30 cents less than Safeway’s O Organics broth, according to Cheapism. GOBankingRates also found that it was 30 cents cheaper than the organic broth at Walmart. 6. Peanut Butter Whole Foods’ natural peanut butter is cheaper than similar peanut butter sold at grocery stores, said Kyle James, founder of coupon and deal site Rather-Be-Shopping.com. “If you buy a case, ask about a 15 percent quantity discount,” he said. Cheapism also found that a 16-ounce jar of Whole Foods’ almond butter costs $6.99, which is cheaper per ounce than Kroger’s Simple Truth 12-ounce jar of almond butter and the Maranatha brand at Walmart. 7. Vegetarian or Vegan Sausage If you love sausage but not meat, you can get a good deal on the vegetarian variety at Whole Foods. “In particular, check out the Tofurky vegan sausage links at Whole Foods, as they’re typically priced 30 percent to 40 percent cheaper than at your local grocery store,” said James. 8. Organic Coconut Oil If you like to use coconut oil for cooking or skin or hair care, you’ll probably get a good deal on the Whole Foods 365 brand. According to Cheapism.com, a 14-ounce jar is $1 less than Safeway’s O Organics coconut oil. And GOBankingRates found that the 365-brand jar was $1.50 less than Spectrum Coconut Oil at Safeway. Find Out: How to Stop Paying for Stuff 9. Organic Canned Beans “If you regularly stock up on canned organic black beans, you should only be buying them from Whole Foods,” said James. In particular, the 365 brand is a great deal, he added. 10. Organic Maple Syrup Whole Foods’ 365 Everyday Value organic maple syrup is about 40 cents less per ounce than Safeway’s O Organics syrup, according to Cheapism.com. And GOBankingRates found that the 365 brand price per ounce beat smaller bottles of syrup at Kroger and Walmart by more than 10 cents. 10 Deals to Skip at Whole Foods Although you can find many deals at Whole Foods, some items are priced much higher than similar products at other supermarkets. In 2015, Business Insider compared 31 items at Whole Foods and Kroger, and found the bill was $60 higher at Whole Foods. If you want to avoid overspending at Whole Foods, don't buy these 10 items in particular. 1. Beef Although Whole Foods does have sales on meat, its prices rarely go as low as supermarket sale prices, said Gault. And, Whole Foods’ “regular prices are most always higher than supermarkets’ regular prices on any meat, whether organic or not,” she added. 2. Organic Chicken Whole organic chickens usually cost around $4 per pound at Whole Foods, while the average price at supermarkets is $3.50 per pound, Gault said. 3. Cereal Instead of shopping at Whole Foods for cereal, you might want to check out other supermarkets and retailers for lower prices. "Name-brand cereals, crackers, cookies and other packaged items will frequently be less expensive at supermarkets or discount stores that carry the same brands (Walmart, Target)," said Stephanie Nelson of The Coupon Mom. 4. Gluten-Free Items Whole Foods carries a lot of gluten-free items, but they’re not as affordable as offerings at Sprouts or Target, said Gault. “Expect to pay 10 percent to 30 percent more for gluten-free at Whole Foods,” she said. For example, Whole Foods carries Nature's Path buckwheat gluten-free waffles, as does Target. At Target, they cost about $2.99, said Gault. But, they can cost more than $3 at Whole Foods, depending on where you shop. 5. Roasted Chicken Whole Foods’ deli offerings are beautiful — but marked up, said Gault. For example, whole non-organic roasted chickens are regularly priced at around $9 at Whole Foods. However, the regular price for roasted chickens at supermarkets averages $5 to $7, she said. 6. Fish Whole Foods states on its website that its seafood department sources from "responsibly managed fish farms and fisheries." Perhaps that explains, in part, the higher price of its fish. For example, the regular price of wild swordfish steak at Whole Foods is $13.99 per pound — $11.99 on sale, said Gault. However, the average regular price is $11.99 per pound at supermarkets, with sale prices averaging $6.97 per pound, she said. 7. Frozen Foods Many convenient frozen foods cost more at Whole Foods, said Gault. For example, Van's frozen waffles are regularly priced around $3.79 at Whole Foods, while the regular price at Target and Sprouts is $2.99, she said. 8. Produce The regular price of organic and conventional produce is generally higher at Whole Foods than supermarkets, said Gault. In fact, in-season organic produce is usually a featured sale item in supermarkets. For example, toward the end of the summer, when grapes are in season, supermarkets typically sell the non-organic variety for 77 cents to 99 cents per pound, she said. 9. Specialty Cheeses Don’t expect to find deals on artisan and imported cheeses at Whole Foods. You’ll likely find much better deals at warehouse clubs, such as Costco. There’s less variety at warehouse clubs — and you have to buy a larger quantity — but specialty cheese prices will typically beat prices at Whole Foods and other grocers, said Gault. “Expect to pay half as much for the same or comparable specialty cheese at club stores,” she said. 10. Eggs Whole Foods should not be your go-to place for eggs if you’re looking for a deal. Business Insider found eggs are almost $1 less per dozen at Trader Joe’s than at Whole Foods.

Wochit Tech After death, world's tallest water slide to be torn down A general view of the Verruckt waterslide at the Schlitterbahn Waterpark in Kansas City, Kansas July 8, 2014. REUTERS/Dave Kaup/File Photo The world's tallest water slide will be torn down after a 10-year-old boy suffered a broken neck and was killed riding it in August, an amusement park in Kansas City, said. The 168 feet (51.4 meter) slide will be decommissioned, closed permanently and removed after the ongoing investigation is complete, park officials said in a statement on Tuesday.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Stocks closed lower Friday, with utilities dropping more than 1 percent, as investors digested hawkish rhetoric from Federal Reserve officials and kept an eye on oil prices.  The Dow fell more than 100 points lower in midmorning trade before closing 45 points lower. McDonald's and Wal-Mart contributed the most losses on the index.

"There's not a strong conviction that stocks are cheap ... but there's no other game in town." "I think the market just assumes the Fed is off the table," said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service. "There's just a lot of money on the sidelines, and that's not consistent with a top in the market." The S&P 500 fell 0.14 percent, with utilities and telecommunications lagging. The Nasdaq closed just below break-even but posted its first eight-week winning streak since 2010. "The markets are going to be choppy ahead of the Jackson Hole speech," said Mark Heppenstall, CIO of Penn Mutual Asset Management. "I think the market is looking for more clarity." San Francisco Fed President John Williams signaled support for a rate hike in the near future in a Thursday afternoon speech. "In the context of a strong domestic economy with good momentum, it makes sense to get back to a pace of gradual rate increases, preferably sooner rather than later," he said. Market expectations for a rate hike in September were just 18 percent Friday and 43 percent for December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. "You have Williams saying September would be a good time to raise rates and everyone is a bit anxious," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. Williams's speech was just the latest piece of hawkish rhetoric from top Fed officials. Earlier this week, New York and Atlanta Fed presidents William Dudley and Dennis Lockhart said a September rate hike may be on the table. Meanwhile, U.S. crude settled 0.62 percent higher, at $48.52 a barrel, posting strong weekly gains. Weekly rig count data from Baker Hughes showed 10 rigs came online this week. This has been a "big, big week for crude, and that can only be positive," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. He also said the recent rise in oil prices has been triggered by talks of a production freeze, currency moves and, "after two years, we're closer reaching a balance in supply and demand." U.S. oil rose more than 3 percent Thursday and posted its highest settlement since July 1. There are no major data sets due Friday, excluding the rig count, and as earnings season comes to a close, investors are looking ahead to Fed Chair Janet Yellen's annual speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. "To me, the market is trying to reassess rate hike expectations," said Wunderlich's Hogan. The Dow and the S&P posted slight weekly losses amid a very narrow trading range. In fact, the S&P posted its 30th consecutive session without a 1 percent move on a closing basis on Friday, the longest streak since 2014. "With one of the most popular vacation periods on the annual calendar now upon us, I do not anticipate any late summer surprises for equities. Dip buyers will therefore remain full engaged," said Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities. U.S. Treasurys traded mostly lower, with the two-year note yield near 0.75 percent and the benchmark 10-year yield around 1.58 percent. The dollar rose about 0.3 percent versus a basket of currencies, but still recorded a weekly loss. Overseas, European stocks mostly fell, with the Stoxx 600 index slipping 0.81 percent. In Asia, stocks rose modestly, but the Nikkei 225 recorded a weekly loss of 2.2 percent.

Wal-Mart is one of the largest corporations in the world, but its cost-cutting measures are causing security problems that go well beyond petty theft. According to this investigation, there is about one violent crime every day at one of the company's 4,500 locations across the country.

This is the story of one of those women, and the factors that contribute to these types of crimes in Canada. (The Globe and Mail) Reconstructing a life to find a missing mother.

The answer, of course, is multidimensional, but an intensive review of the record reveals how cost-cutting and other decisions by the State Department during Hillary Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State aided in the militant group's rise.

Ricky Arriola was appointed Miami Beach City comissioner in 2015, a position he said has overlaped well with his day job: CEO of customer service provider Inktel Holdings Corp. Rick Arriola, CEO of Inktel Holdings Corp and Miami Beach City commissioner. Rick Arriola, CEO of Inktel Holdings Corp and Miami Beach City commissioner. 1 of 4 i By Chabeli Herrera cherrera@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story In the late 1990s and amid the rise of the internet age, Miami native Ricky Arriola realized companies weren’t keeping up with the pace of growth — and their customer service was suffering most. Arriola founded Inktel Holdings Corp. to help them keep up — and stay ahead — by serving as a third-party customer service support unit that now employs 1,200 workers and manages customer service for major brands such as Wal-Mart, the Goodyear Tire Company and Clorox. The Miami Lakes-based company provides phone-based support, social media management, marketing strategy and data analysis. Today, Inktel is one of the largest privately owned providers of third-party customer service in the nation. Arriola, who also had a brief stint as an attorney at Miami-based law firm Steel Hector & Davis, has also taken his customer service expertise to the Miami Beach City Commission. He was elected commissioner in 2015, a position he said has had many overlapping features with his CEO position at Inktel. “Inktel has taught me the importance of being personally accessible, so my commission office has an open door policy and I attend as many community events as possible,” Arriola said. “Miami Beach residents and business owners have my personal cell number and email, and I try to answer every query within 24 hours.” The Herald spoke to Arriola on the future of customer service in a world where the Internet is now king and where the share economy is becoming increasingly dominant. Q. What gap did you see in customer care that inspired you to start Inktel? How have those deficiencies changed and your business model with it? A. From the founding of Inktel, we had a simple goal of making our clients’ businesses better through world class customer service. Consumers became more educated and empowered as the Internet became widespread in American households, and companies were not keeping pace by improving their customer service functions. Many customer care agents were still reading from scripts and were not prepared for consumer queries that were becoming more sophisticated. Inktel began as a call center with a heavy focus on customer sales. As the internet and digital media took hold, we introduced new offerings such as online chat, social media-based service and email response. These services ensure our clients are communicating with their customers across all channels. We’ve sharpened our focus on serving companies in four industries that account for the bulk of our business: e-commerce, retail, consumer packaged goods and restaurants. Q. How have you transferred those learnings into your role with the Miami Beach Commission? A. Being an effective elected official relies on delivering great service to constituents, which is magnified in an activist community such as Miami Beach. Customer service in the private sector is all about listening to the consumer, learning from their feedback and modifying your practices to improve the way you serve — the same way governing must be shaped around anticipating and reacting to the needs of constituents. Miami Beach is one of the world’s most popular destinations, but like any city, we’re facing issues such as climate change, traffic and affordability challenges. I’ve been incorporating constituent input in the policy-making process from day one by prioritizing a light rail system, investments in our parks and cultural venues, the development of workforce and market-rate housing, and improvements to our local infrastructure. I’m also advocating for an “open data” technology platform that will make our government even more transparent for citizens accessing public information. Q. Miami was once known for its horrible customer service, but that seems to be changing. Has there been a push to improve things in that sector? A. Miami’s economy is largely rooted in the hospitality industry, which hinges on delivering exceptional service on a consistent basis — and building loyalty over time. The competitive nature of this sector and changing consumer demands have led to an improvement in the overall quality of customer care our visitors and residents are experiencing. For example, 15 years ago, there were one or two four- and five-star hotels in Miami, and now we have dozens as we welcome the most discerning business and leisure tourists from around the world. The same can be said of our retail industry. Ten years ago, the only high-end shopping plaza was Bal Harbour, and now we have the Design District, Merrick Park and the soon-to-open Brickell City Centre. Miami’s restaurant scene is also seeing a transformation as more celebrity chefs and international brands open Miami locations. In order for these high end establishments to maintain their brand reputation, their customer service has to be top-notch. The workforce that these brands employ get some of the best customer service training in the world, and that spills over into the rest of the local business community. Q. With tourism as our major industry, we constantly see customer service disasters from the cruise lines and the airlines. Are there mistakes you see these companies make over and over? How can they improve? A. The most common — and costly — mistake I see travel brands make is overlooking the importance of investing in employees, which has created a lot of competition for talent in the industry. The more employee turnover that takes place at a hotel, airline or cruise line, the more diminished the customer experience will be. One of our core philosophies at Inktel is that fulfilled employees equate to satisfied clients, and this should apply to the tourism sector as well. When your entire business model relies on customer loyalty, there’s little room for error. There may be a significant gap in price between mass market hotel brands and luxury brands, but it’s just as easy to provide great service at a 200-room Holiday Inn as it is at a 200-room Ritz Carlton. The difference lies in the people, their training and their compensation. By investing in people, tourism-driven businesses can reduce employee turnover and improve the customer experience, both of which help the bottom line. Q. Consumers have a lot of information at their fingertips — and sometimes it can feel overwhelming. What’s the challenge for companies when it comes to making sure customers get the right information? A. The internet has opened the door to a wealth of information, but there is no substitute for accessing the help of a human being. When there’s an emergency or a customer is in great need of help, all roads will inevitably lead back to a person communicating by phone, email, tweet or otherwise. More and more, customers are turning to the phone as their first option when in need of assistance. This seems to be a reaction to the digital-first experience prioritized by many large brands. It’s critical that companies large and small equip their people with the knowledge and training needed to make a positive impression over the phone. This rule applies to receptionists at professional service firms and call center agents representing Fortune 500 companies. Q. Self-service is a huge trend that has been growing recently. What are perhaps less-talked-about trends that you expect will become more popular? A. Self-service options such as mobile banking apps, web portals for retailers and check-in kiosks have grown increasingly popular among time-constrained customers. This sense of consumer empowerment has helped give rise to the do-it-yourself economy. An elevated level of professionalism is taking shape among do-it-yourself services, such as Uber and Airbnb. Users are becoming much more entrepreneurial, and we are beginning to see people purchasing multiple apartments solely for renting on Airbnb. Users are also quitting their jobs to drive for Uber full time, some even owning an entire fleet of cars. I expect that this proprietary trend will only continue to grow as people gravitate toward a more flexible lifestyle. Q. In some areas, one can argue customer service has become slightly less important — take the sharing economy, such as Airbnb and Uber. You don’t get the hotel experience and you pay for your ride automatically. Where does customer service come into play as we move more toward a sharing economy? A. The sharing economy might be built on a decentralized customer service model, but it relies heavily on collecting consumer feedback. Take Uber for example: Before a passenger hails a ride, they first need to review their last driver. This does two things: It requires the customer to provide measurable input, and it allows the company to collect valuable data about their drivers. Airbnb has a similar model that emphasizes the importance of customer feedback. The sharing economy is already changing the way traditional companies gather feedback and deliver service, as consumers become conditioned to sharing their thoughts. We’re seeing this in brick and mortar retailers that solicit feedback by email and promote in-store specials via text message. Even food and beverage companies, such as Starbucks and Chipotle, have migrated toward app-based software that streamlines the path to a sale and gathers valuable customer data. Q. What is the biggest complaint customers have across industries? Why isn’t it being addressed? A. Inktel analyzes customer feedback for some of the biggest brands in the world 24 hours a day, and the recurring theme we hear from consumers is that accessing helpful service is a tedious process that needs to be streamlined. The conventional wisdom is that company websites are too confusing; call center hold times are too long; and customer service agents are uninformed. The truth is that we’ve come a long way in recent years. Many of today’s companies are more responsive than ever before thanks to the sheer number of access points available to consumers, but many more brands still have work to do. When I read about a large-scale customer service breakdown similar to what Delta Airlines recently experienced [when a power outage led to mass cancellations], I can’t help but wonder how much of the fall-out could have been avoided had the right customer response protocol been in place. Anytime we take on a new client at Inktel, we begin by assessing the customer service solutions already in place, then make recommendations for how to improve. From there, we continually monitor data and modify our systems to meet consumers’ changing needs. J.

The Canada Child Benefit gives eligible families an annual benefit of up to $6,400 for each child under 6 years old, and up to $5,400 for each child between 6 and 17.

The benefit replaces a similar measure under the previous Conservative government as well as other tax benefits. The government says eligible families will see an average increase of almost C$2,300. WATCH: Liberal government’s promised Canada Child Benefit starts rolling out  The money likely will help retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> and Dollarama Inc <DOL.TO> more than higher-end clothing and supplies retailers as the benefit is aimed at lower- and middle-income families. “Those checks will definitely be a nice offset to the economic doldrums that has settled across the country this summer,” said Todd Hirsch, chief economist at ATB Financial. Hirsch said that if not for the benefit, he would have expected lower back-to-school sales this year. Consumer spending is important for reviving growth in Canada, where the economy has been stunted by the Alberta wildfires and low oil prices. The child benefit is the first tangible effect of the Liberal government’s plan to spend to boost the economy. The government estimates families will get C$23 billion in the 2016-2017 benefityear.

That, and the child benefit, should help retail sales maintain the strength they have seen this year, economists said. Karen Sterling, vice president of marketing for Giant Tiger, said she expects parents will spend at least a portion of their checks on school supplies and clothing. Ottawa resident Jennifer Hersey, 40, is receiving C$180. She plans to spend her usual C$500 on back-to-school items for her two daughters, 12 and 8, and put the extra money toward art lessons for her eldest daughter. With household debt at record highs compared to income, debt counselors recommend frugality. “I’d like to hope people will find restraint and take advantage of discount stores and opportunities where they can get a bargain,” said Laurie Campbell, chief executive of Credit Canada Debt Solutions. Adambare De Alwis plans to do just that. De Alwis, 50, expects to spend C$100 to C$200 on back-to-school purchases, saving at places like Wal-Mart.

EEOC’s lawsuit charged Wal-Mart with violating federal discrimination law when the giant retailer fired an intellectually disabled employee at one of its Wal-Mart stores in Rockford, Ill. At the time of his termination, the employee, William Clark, worked at a Wal-Mart store located at 7219 Walton St. in Rockford. According to EEOC’s lawsuit, Clark, who has intellectual disabilities that were first detected during childhood, began working for Wal-Mart in 1994. As a workplace accommodation for his intellectual disabilities, Clark needed a written list of daily tasks. EEOC alleged that Wal-Mart had provided Clark with a daily list as an accommodation for years, but at some point the company decided to stop providing Clark the accommodation he needed. Wal-Mart alleged that it terminated Clark because he failed to perform certain job duties. EEOC charged that Clark’s purported failure to perform certain job duties was due to Wal-Mart no longer providing Clark an accommodation. Wal-Mart’s alleged conduct violates the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which requires employers to provide disabled employees with reasonable accommodations that enable them to perform their job duties. EEOC filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Western Division (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.; Civil Action No. 14-cv-50145) on July 1, 2014, after first attempting to reach a pre-litigation settlement through its conciliation process. In addition to monetary payment to Clark, Wal-Mart will train employees on disability discrimination and requests for reasonable accommodations under the ADA. Wal-Mart will also monitor requests for accommodation and complaints of disability discrimination and report those to the EEOC, under the terms of the settlement.

Thanks to a permit request from developers, Dollar General store signs are expected to be placed on the building. Story and photo courtesy The Daily Record When plans were announced late last month to put new Dollar General stores in former Walmart Express locations in Four Oaks and Princeton, the Town of Benson appeared to be left out of the mix. That all changed on Wednesday when a permit to place Dollar General signs was requested for the empty building at 702 S. Wall Street. The permit allows for the addition of signs to the front of the building, a 20-foot high sign in the parking lot and additional signs on the canopy above the fuel pumps. “The Town of Benson is pleased that Dollar General will be locating a store here,” said Town Manager Matt Zapp. “At this time, we are under the impression that Dollar General will maintain the fuel pumps as well.” The move falls into place with the plans by Dollar General to extend their footprint to area communities in the wake of the failure by the retail giant to compete with local convenience stores. When Walmart announced the closings in January, it left abandoned buildings in dozens of towns across the country. Among those towns affected locally were Benson, Coats, Four Oaks, Steadman, Pikeville and Princeton. Prior to Wednesday’s announcement, Dollar General had expressed no interest publicly on acquiring the Benson location. “The Benson community continues to grow,” Mr. Zapp said. “Fortunately, we have strong local, regional and nationally recognized retailers that are flourishing here.” There was no timeline announced by either the Town of Benson or Dollar General officials when the store would begin the process of stocking shelves or open the doors.         Johnston County’s #1 Local News Source Email event information to Events@JoCoReport.com General Questions: Email our staff at Info@JoCoReport.com News Related Questions or Issues: Email our News Desk at News@JoCoReport.com Want to advertise with us?

Sabrina Drude was waiting to pay for several spiral notebooks for her students at Scobee Middle School in San Antonio. That’s when a man who was also waiting in line behind Drude offered to pay her bill. KENS-TV identified the good samaritan as Lester Brown. Lester Brown and Sabrina Drude (Image source: KENS-TV) “It was the right thing to do. It’s what God said to do, and it’s that simple,” Brown said, adding that once he paid it, Drude “started to cry.” Brown said he remembered he had stashed away a $100 bill, which he intended to use to respond to someone in need. So when he saw that Drude’s bill came out to around $97, he knew this was the moment. “You want people to live better, love thy neighbor. Love thy neighbor means do your part,” Brown told KENS. “I challenge you, whatever it is you can afford, to volunteer at a school, help a family,” he added. Brown is a pastor and re-entry specialist for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department. He also is the father of five children. — Follow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook: Follow @jonstreet Share Tweet Rate this story Recommended from the Web 61 Comments Get TheBlaze Newsletters Sign Up Refer Friends, Earn Rewards!

Photo: AFP Walton family members are gaining ground as the US’ richest retailers as Wal-Mart Stores Inc increases its earnings forecast. Shares rose 1.9 percent on Thursday, boosting the family’s net worth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to US$127 billion, a 19 percent increase since year-end. By comparison, Amazon.com Inc’s Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune rise 12 percent to US$67 billion this year. The Waltons — Alice, Christy, Jim, Lukas and Rob Walton — are the world’s richest family. They are ahead of Bill, Charles and David Koch, who have a US$106 billion fortune, and Bill Gates and his family, who control US$89 billion. Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday increased its annual earnings forecast after second-quarter results topped analysts’ estimates, a sign that the world’s largest retailer is pulling business away from rivals such as Target Corp. Sales at US Wal-Mart stores that have been open for more than 12 months rose 1.6 percent last quarter, which ended July 31, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said in a statement. The growth signals that chief executive officer Doug McMillon is making progress with efforts to lower Wal-Mart’s prices and improve customer service. Since taking the helm in 2014, he has boosted pay for US workers and poured money into online operations, aiming to provide a better experience for customers and stem defections to Amazon.com Inc. “Our strategy in the US is working as we delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps and international also performed well,” McMillon, 49, said in the statement. Wal-Mart now expects annual earnings to be US$4.15 to US$4.35 per share this year, excluding some items. That compares with a previous forecast of US$4 to US$4.3. Earnings amounted to US$1.07 per share in the second quarter, while revenue grew 0.5 percent to US$120.9 billion, the company said. This story has been viewed 1558 times. Comments will be moderated.

(NYSE: WMT) reported a decline in its adjusted non-GAAP EPS in Q2:17, as compared to Q2:16, the EPS came in ahead of expectations. Argus’ Christopher Graja maintains a Hold rating on the company. Q2 Results Wal-Mart Stores reported its adjusted non-GAAP EPS at $1.07 for Q2:17, as compared to $1.08 in Q2:16; the EPS was ahead of the estimate and the consensus. Comparable sales in the United States rose 1.6 percent, beating the consensus forecast. E-commerce growth boosted U.S. comps by 40 bps. Total e-commerce sales grew 11.8 percent in constant currency, while average invested capital fell 1.1 percent. Related Link: Wal-Mart's Turnaround Story May Be The Real Deal Capital Discipline Needed “We were pleased to see that capital stopped growing, and will be looking for continued capital discipline,” Graja mentioned, while adding, “WalMart must significantly improve its return on invested capital to become a multiyear outperformer.” Wal-Mart ended FY11 with ROIC of 14.6 percent, while ending FY16 with ROIC of 12.5 percent. The S&P 500 has delivered annualized return of 13.3 percent over the past five years, while Wal-Mart has underperformed, with annualized return of 9.5 percent. “It is hard to be confident of many things on Wall Street, but we are confident that WMT will outperform if it can consistently boost ROIC,” Graja stated, explaining that the company needed to “grow income faster than sales and sales faster than its capital base.” Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

These Retail Stores Are Open On Thanksgiving Day Watch Stocks In Vogue How Overtime Pay Ruling Affects Wal-Mart, Dollar Tree, Fast Food (Investor's Business Daily) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) saw its stock hit a new 52-week high of $75.19 on Thursday after a strong earnings report, which may have convinced a harsh critic to turn positive on the company. Bloomberg Gadfly's Shelly Banjo said that she doesn't "give the world's largest retailer praise lightly" given numerous missteps and errors, including letting Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have "free rein over online commerce." Banjo even noted that Warren Buffett himself, once a staunch supporter of Wal-Mart's business, has been selling shares of the retailer. So why the sudden change of heart? Further Evidence Of A Turnaround Wal-Mart's turnaround story is showing signs of success. Specifically, online sales grew and the company's management team "struck a positive tone" on how its move to pay workers more while simultaneously slashing prices is attracting more shoppers. Related Link: Was Target's Bathroom Boycott An Unexpected Tailwind For Wal-Mart? Banjo also said it is "worth pointing out" that Wal-Mart boosted its full-year earnings-per-share outlook from $4 to $4.30 to $4.15 to $4.30. Granted, any upward revision to guidance is positive, the company's guidance "doesn't look as notable" when comparing to last year's earnings per share of $4.57. "The optimist in me says Walmart's results could be early signs that the company is finally getting serious about what matters to customers right now, even if it means some short-term pain," Banjo stated. Finally, Banjo did caution that exceeding the Street's expectations in one single quarter is not enough to conclude a turnaround is sustainable. The key question moving forward is if Wal-Mart "lets the pessimists or optimists prevail." Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The gains were modest, however, as investors have been avoiding big moves. The dollar weakened further, and compared to the yen it’s at its lowest in almost three years. Stocks wobbled in the early part of the day, but energy companies were a standout as the price of U.S. oil reached its highest level since the beginning of July. The weakening dollar aided exporters including technology and chemical companies. The market turned higher in the afternoon. Phone company stocks continued to slump, as did financial firms. Stocks haven’t moved much this week and haven’t made many big moves over the last month. Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, said the U.S. market tends to be calm in August and trading volume is usually low. Lower trading volume means surprising events can cause big swings for stocks, but so far, it’s made this month the opposite of January and early February, when stocks tumbled and the markets were rattled. “We had record volatility to start the year and these things do tend to revert,” he said. “It’s amazing how quickly things change.” The Dow Jones industrial average picked up 23.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,597.70. The Standard & Poor’s 500 added 4.80 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,187.02. The Nasdaq composite rose 11.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,240.15. Benchmark U.S. crude gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $48.22 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.04, or 2.1 percent, to $50.89 a barrel in London. That gave energy companies a lift, and Marathon Oil rose 98 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $16.68 while Devon Energy gained $1.45, or 3.3 percent, to $44.76. Oil prices have rallied over the last two weeks, but they have essentially remained between $40 and $50 a barrel for the last four months. After oil traded as low as $26.21 a barrel in February, that relative stability has boosted energy company stocks. The dollar fell to 99.98 yen, its lowest level since October 2013. The euro rose to $1.1354 from $1.1290. The dollar was worth about 120 yen at the start of the year and it’s been gradually weakening. A weaker dollar is good for U.S. exporters like chemical, mining and technology companies. On Wednesday the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest meeting, which investors took as new confirmation the Fed is in no hurry to raise interest rates again. Detrick cautioned that the yen sometimes gains strength when investors are nervous Wal-Mart Stores climbed $1.37, or 1.9 percent, to $74.30. The world’s largest retailer raised its annual estimates after reporting strong results for the second quarter. The company is revamping stores and has won back some customers. Wal-Mart, which has lost sales to sites like Amazon as people make more purchases online, is also buying online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion as it fights for more online shoppers. Internet gear maker Cisco Systems reported unimpressive quarterly results and said it will lay off 5,500 employees, or about 7 percent of its staff. The company had already cut about 10,000 jobs over the last few years and it joins companies like Microsoft, Intel and HP in eliminating jobs and overhauling its product lines. Its stock lost 24 cents to $30.48. Prison operating companies nosedived after the Justice Department said it will end or sharply reduce contracts with the companies, saying privately-run prisons have more safety and security problems than prisons run by the government. The number of people in federal prison has fallen in recent years, but 22,000 people were in private prisons at the end of last year. That’s about 12 percent of all federal inmates. Corrections Corp. stock plunged $9.65, or 35.5 percent, to $17.57 and Geo Group tumbled $12.78, or 39.6 percent, to $19.51. Both stocks hit their lowest levels in years. The two companies each get about half their revenue from contracts with the federal government. However the new policy doesn’t cover private detention facilities used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and both companies operate those facilities. Harley-Davidson stock skidded after the U.S. government said the motorcycle company made racing tuners that caused some bikes to emit higher-than-allowed amounts of some types of air pollutants. The shares dropped as much as 8 percent, although they recovered some of those losses after the Justice Department said Harley-Davidson agreed to settle the case by buying back and destroying the devices and paying $15 million. The stock lost 94 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $53.54. Bond prices inched higher and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.54 percent from 1.55 percent. Gold added $8.40 to $1,357.20 an ounce. Silver gained 9 cents to $19.74 an ounce and copper picked up 2 cents to $2.17 a pound. Wholesale gasoline rose 4 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil edged up 4 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas rose 6 cents to $2.67 per 1,000 cubic feet. Germany’s DAX added 0.6 percent and the French CAC 40 index rose 0.4 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 gained 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1 percent and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 slid 1.5 percent. The Kospi in South Korea added 0.9 percent. ———— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP .

Matthew Heller August 19, 2016 | CFO.com | US share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Wal-Mart Stores reported same-store sales growth for the eighth quarter in a row and blew past earnings estimates, generating a solid return on its investment in revamping stores and changing the merchandise mix. The world’s biggest retailer earned $3.8 billion in the second quarter, up 8.6% from a year ago. Earnings of $1.21 per share easily topped estimates of $1.02, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Recommended Stories: Foot Locker Earnings Double in Third Quarter Wal-Mart Posts ‘Solid’ Quarter But Stock Falls Target’s Same-Store Sales Beat Expectations Revenue edged up 0.5% to $120.85 billion while same-store sales, a key measurement for retailers, rose 1.6%. Wal-Mart “is reaping the benefits of spending heavily to improve stores and draw shoppers,” The Wall Street Journal said, noting that it “has poured billions recently into making its U.S. stores more efficient and pleasant, boosting employee wages and improving e-commerce operations.” For the first time in nine quarters, Wal-Mart’s e-commerce sales rose faster than the previous quarter. Earlier this month, the company moved to boost its online business by purchasing Jet.com for $3.3 billion. “We remain focused on building e-commerce capabilities globally,” CEO Doug McMillon said in a news release. “Wal-Mart is uniquely positioned to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience where we save them time and money.” Wal-Mart’s results came the day after rival Target, which has struggled to draw shoppers to its selection of fresh groceries, reported a 9.7% plunge in earnings. Greg Foran, CEO of Walmart U.S., attributed Wal-Mart’s relative strength to improved grocery options, tidier stores, better customer service and discounts. “It’s filling store aisles with attractive displays of organic fruits, gourmet cheeses and other fresh products to snatch shoppers who’d more typically head to major grocery chains like Wegman’s, Safeway or Whole Foods for such goods,” USA Today reported. During the second quarter, Wal-Mart also offered a free month-long trial of a $49 two-day shipping membership similar to Amazon’s popular Prime program and rapidly increased the number of items available on Walmart.com. The company now forecasts full-year earnings in a range of $4.15 to $4.35 a share. Analysts were expecting $4.27. Post navigation ← United Bankshares Makes Another D.C.

August 19, 2016 Edition ›  Pat's Funny Bone: School days always meant a chair in back Pat visited the church where she attended 1st grade and found things almost exactly as they were 60-plus years ago. She entered her classroom, pulled a chair to the back, and sat down at the very location she sat in 1st grade. Article Comments Print Back-to-school sales! You gotta love them! This is the greatest time of the year. Lots of bargains in Walmart: new backpacks, sparkly folders and notebooks with a pledge from each student to keep their locker, notebooks, backpack and folders spotless. When you count up my “First Day of a New School Year,” I have had 64 of these days beginning in my 1st grade year (I didn’t go to kindergarten) and ending with my retirement as principal. Which means 64 times, I have had a clean desk, new binder, and a new lunchbox complete with a smashed Twinkie. Don’t get me wrong – I love Twinkies and Hostess chocolate cupcakes with the white squiggle on the top. But I have always questioned if anyone really ate Hostess Sno Balls or did they just sit on the shelf, day after day, month after month? Even the cream-filled chocolate cake in the middle did not redeem the awful taste of the giant pink marshmallow covered with coconut. Every fall, I have a flood of memories from my elementary school years flash back into my mind. I remember in 1st grade being so excited about the opportunity to learn to read, but by the time I finished reading my first book, I realized that the heroes, Dick and Jane, led a very dull life. All they did was “Look and See.” Last year, I had the opportunity to visit the church in which I attended 1st grade and found things almost exactly as they were 60-plus years ago. The drinking fountain where we sang “The Itsy Bitsy Spider” was gone, but my classroom was still there! I entered, pulled a chair to the back of the room, and sat down. Yes, this is it, and this is where I sat! Why the back of the room? All of you with the last names beginning with a “X,Y or Z” will understand. I was a “W” and spent 12 school years in the back of the room with the “Xylanders, Yates, and Zylstras.” We were always the last to get our lunch, last to be excused to recess, last to go to the library, and worst of all, last to use the restroom pass! But when it came to poem recitation, it was a blessing. One-by-one the A-V’s would stand in the front of the room and quote the required poem. That gave us at least 40 minutes of extra time to memorize that same poem, unless the teacher “pulled a quick one” and did it in “reverse alphabetical order.” As I sat in that room, I could smell new crayons, peaches and pink erasers. While I was taking in all of my memories, my brain started to play tricks with me and I was sure that I could hear the voice of Miss Brink, the dreaded other 1st grade teacher. For those of us who were chosen to be in Mrs. Green’s room, Miss Brink was the “mean teacher.” The students in her room would try to convince us that she was actually quite pleasant. But we knew better! We knew that she put a secret potion in her water fountain that messed with their brains. It had to be true because Sammy, the boy who ate the white paste and said it tasted like mashed potatoes, told us so. Just the thought of “Miss Brink” brought terror into the heart of every 1st grader in Mrs. Green’s room. You see, Mrs. Green was like a grandmother. But Miss Brink? Our mouths would become dry at just the mention of her name! I had my first confrontation with Miss Brink one day at recess. My friend Pearl and I were racing each other into the restroom. The rule was “no running in the halls,” but when you had to go, you had to go! Miss Brink took us both by our arms, opened the gigantic hall door, and marched us into Mrs. Green’s room. She gave us her best evil look and said, “You will sit in your seats with your head on the desk until recess is over!” She left the room. I sat there considering the need to put my head on my desk? That was a strange request, but a comfortable one. I fell asleep. A few minutes later, Miss Brink entered the room and ordered me to sit up straight. I tried to explain that I was only resting, but the drool on my desk gave me away. This entire confrontation with the dreaded Miss Brink was confusing. Put your head on your desk and sit up straight? She must have thought that we were contortionists. But as a “somewhat obedient” student, I knew that I should at least attempt to grant her request. Miss Brink did not think I was funny when I fell to my knees in an attempt to “sit up straight” and laid my head on my desk. She had no sense of humor. This would have been the perfect time for Pearl and me to “make our break,” but Pearl didn’t understand my communication attempts, so I returned to my desk, sat up straight, made funny faces at Pearl, but still “had to go.” Suddenly, my walk down Memory Lane was disrupted by Pastor Pete saying, “Where are the restrooms?” The restrooms? How did he know that it was there that my life of crime had started? Was he forcing me to return to the scene of my misdeed exactly like Jessica Fletcher does to the guilty person in “Murder She Wrote”? He’s been watching too many TV crime shows! He knew I was guilty! I stood up straight and tried to look as innocent as possible while he followed me through the same huge door, which strangely had shrunk to less than half its size over the past 60-plus years. But all was not lost. This time, I entered the restroom following Pastor Pete and shouted, “Look, Miss Brink, I'm going into the restroom without permission and I’m following a boy!” I finally had my day in court!

But a spokesman for the supermarket said there were no plans to close stores. And he described Northern Ireland as "one of our strongest markets". The supermarket has 17 stores in the province. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The chain - owned by US giant Walmart - posted a 7.5% fall in like-for-like sales in the second quarter. The results represent the eighth consecutive quarter of sliding sales and a worsening of the 5.7% drop seen in the previous period. Mr Clarke, who took up the reins on July 11 after he was parachuted in to replace previous boss Andy Clarke, is attempting to turn Asda around amid a brutal price war in the supermarket sector. Mr Clarke said he is "getting under the skin of the business", adding: "Although Asda is in midst of a very challenging period, there is no doubt in my mind that the culture that has always been at the heart of our success is still there. "We've also started one of the biggest journeys of reinvention in our history to further build on our strong offer and I feel positive about the future." The plan to revive Asda involves reduced prices through a previously announced £1.5bn investment, job cuts and improved ranges. Walmart boss Doug McMillon said he was addressing Asda's decline in sales with "urgency". "In the UK the competitive environment and food deflation continued to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp(arable) sales,"he said. "Our strategy to turn things around is focused on improving the retail basics. We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments." Mr Clarke, who has also held top roles with Walmart in Japan and Canada, will find himself up against a resurgent Tesco and Morrisons, which are both undergoing their own turnarounds. German discount duo Aldi and Lidl are also continuing to gain market share at the expense of the so-called big four - Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury's. Walmart's chief financial officer Brett Biggs said: "In the UK, fierce competition and food deflation continue to challenge the market, significantly impacting traffic and comp sales trends. "Our strategy remains focused on improving retail basics - simplifying and strengthening the offer through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic investments."

Wal-Mart's shares rose 1.9 percent on Thursday, boosting the Walton family's net worth to $US127 billion ($165 billion), a 19 per cent increase since year-end. That's more than the national GDP of Hungary.  Don't Play Up Next Video duration 00:00 Top 10 richest people Cancel Replay Replay Video Icon Player help icon More News Videos Previous slide Next slide Video duration 00:00 Top 10 richest people Video duration 01:46 Powder on teen in Bali 'paracetamol' Video duration 00:50 Britain tells Trump no vacancy for Farage Video duration 00:46 CCTV: Jamie Murphy searched at Bali nightclub Video duration 00:32 Jewellery store heist caught on camera Video duration 03:32 Donald Trump on immigrants Video duration 01:29 Tip-toes and triumph, Obama presents Medal of Freedom Video duration 01:06 Bishop warns against foreign law breaking More videos Top 10 richest people Forbes releases its 30th annual global rich list. By comparison, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune rise 12 per cent in 2016 to $US67 billion. The Waltons collectively own 52 per cent of Wal-Mart. The latest gains came after the retail giant ratcheted up its expectations for its full-year earnings growth after its second-quarter financial results surpassed forecasts. Its shares are up 21 percent year to date - marking a reversal from the nearly 30 per cent decline in 2015. Wal-Mart's online sales growth started climbing again and executives struck a positive tone about how its efforts to pay its workers more and push down prices at its stores were attracting more shoppers.

They're ahead of Bill, Charles and David Koch, who have a combined $US106 billion fortune owning oil refining conglomerate Koch Industries, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his family, who control $US89 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .

It is the eighth consecutive quarterly fall for the Leeds-headquartered supermarket. The Walmart-owned chain blamed "fierce competition and food deflation" for the drop in the three months to the end of June. Doug McMillon, Walmart chief executive, said: "While our turnaround will take time, I'm confident in the new leadership team there and want to assure you we're addressing this with urgency. "We are simplifying and strengthening our offering through improved availability and assortment discipline, reducing costs and driving sales through strategic price investments." Asda last month appointed Sean Clarke as the successor to chief executive Andy Clarke. He was until recently president and chief executive of Walmart China.

Articles > Market Commentary > Walmart (WMT) Beats on Earnings and Revenue, Improves Guidance Walmart (WMT) Beats on Earnings and Revenue, Improves Guidance Shares of Walmart Stores Inc. (WMT) were trading up +2.22 or +3.04 percent to $75.15 per share in Thursday’s premarket after the company released earnings for its fiscal second quarter of 2017 early this morning. The company beat analyst forecasts for both earnings and revenue in the quarter and improved its full year and third quarter guidance. Wal-Mart Stores stock closed at $72.93 per share, up +0.04 or +0.05 percent in Wednesday’s regular trading session. Stock Analysis Bentonville, Arkansas based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. also known as Walmart, was founded by Sam Walton in 1962 and incorporated in 1969. The company runs a total of 11,539 stores under 63 banners in 28 countries with e-commerce sites in 11 countries. Walmart is the largest company in the world by revenue and the world’s largest private employer, with more than 2.3 million employees worldwide. The company is half owned by the Walton Family, which retains ownership of 50 percent of the company through the Walton Enterprises holding company. Image by MichaelGaida / Pixabay As of 2009, the company is the largest grocery dealer in the United States with 51 percent of its U.S. sales from its grocery business. Wal-mart had revenue of $482.1 billion in its fiscal 2016 year. For the company’s fiscal 2017 second quarter, Walmart reported diluted earnings per share of $1.21, which was negatively impacted by $0.03 on currency translation. On an adjusted basis, Walmart reported earnings per share of $1.07. Total revenue came to $120.9 billion, an increase of five percent over last year. On a constant currency basis revenue was $123.6 billion, up +2.8 percent over the same period one year ago. The analyst consensus was for the company to report earnings of $1.02 per share on revenue of $120.1 billion Walmart reported its seventh consecutive quarter of positive traffic, up +1.2 percent, which led to a +1.6 percent rise in positive comparable store sales, its eighth consecutive quarterly increase. The company’s Neighborhood Market segment reported its comparable store sales had increased +6.5 percent in the quarter. The company reported net sales for Walmart International were $28.6 billion. With the exclusion of currency impacts, net sales came to $31.3 billion in the quarter, an increase of +2.2 percent over last year’s second quarter. In the company’s press release, Wal-Mart President and Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon stated that, “We’re pleased with the positive momentum in our business. Our strategy in the U.S. is working as we delivered an eighth consecutive quarter of positive comps, and international also performed well. We remain focused on building e-commerce capabilities globally and executing our omni-channel plan, as evidenced by our recent alliance with JD.com in China and agreement to acquire Jet.com in the U.S. Walmart is uniquely positioned to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience where we save them time and money.” Walmart’s consolidated operating income saw an increase of +1.6 percent in the quarter, which included a $535 million gain for the sale of Yihaodian. Excluding the Yihaodian gain, operating income declined -7.2 percent. The decline was attributed to the company’s investments in people and technology in addition to the negative impact of currency fluctuations. The company upwardly revised its guidance for the full 2017 year and now is estimating adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.35 or GAAP earnings per share of $4.29 to $4.49. Both estimates include an estimated dilutive impact of about -$0.05 per share, mostly in the fourth quarter. The nickel loss is expected as part of operating losses and the company’s planned takeover of Jet.com.

The blog network under the name revolutionized digital journalism and engaged its audience in important conversations. However, that’s not to say the publication was perfect. Here are its greatest hits and misses. The blog was rendered unsustainable after a lawsuit from Hulk Hogan, funded by PayPal founder and billionaire Peter Thiel, over a sex tape published on Gawker in 2012. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, was awarded $140 million in damages, resulting in Gawker’s bankruptcy and sale to Univision. https://t.co/yE7pAOS19e to end operations next week: https://t.co/LnvG0ZmD9I— Gawker (@Gawker) August 18, 2016 RT is pouring one out for Gawker and journalism. The site’s take on news writing can be summarized by their slogan: Today’s gossip is tomorrow’s news. The site consistently pushed the boundaries of journalism and often pushed the limits of good taste. Sometimes they crossed that line. Here’s to them and everything we loved and hated. 10 – A tangled web of hair weaves: Gawker investigates Trump’s hair It’s hard to describe the levels of quality this piece by Ashley Feinberg reached. In some of the finest journalism displayed on Gawker, Feinberg took a deep, investigative look at the mystery that is Donald Trump’s hair. Describing it as a “cotton candy hairspray labyrinth,” Feinberg’s report began when a tipster suggested she look into the Ivari International method. From there, she analyzed the way Trump’s hair moves, sits and even reacts to the wind. Unfortunately, the piece would later be used by another of Thiel’s lawyers to threaten the blog with legal action. As per Gawker’s nature, they left the article up along with the threatening letters they received. 9 – How did this happen? Jezebel posted pictures of a journalist being raped Gawker’s female-centric sister site made a decision so terrible it’s difficult to believe it wasn’t published by accident. In 2012, Anna North published a piece titled “Did Libyan Video of a Journalist's Rape Get Posted on YouTube? [Warning: Graphic Images]” They weren’t lying about the graphic images. The story was about the existence of a video of a foreign journalist being sexually assaulted in Libya. Writing about the video is not the problem; the trouble was that they included images that were originally not pixelated, revealing the victim’s face, along with her attackers’. After major backlash from their commenters, Jezebel pixelated the images. An editor explained, “This post is ultimately about the existence of a video, thus the images ARE the story – without them, there's nothing. To remove them would be, in effect, to un-report the story. Which is not going to happen.” It still doesn’t explain how they were published uncensored in the first place. Univision or omnivision? Network to expand after winning #Gawker in auction https://t.co/5ETPtf5K6xpic.twitter.com/JXaDVIQRWN— RT America (@RT_America) August 17, 2016 8 – A sub where everyone knows your name: Gawker doxes ‘jailbait’ subreddit moderator Former Redditor and moderator Violentacrez was seemingly a full time troll. In 2012, his time was divided between moderating the “Jailbait” subreddit where 20,000 users shared images of underage girls that were often gathered from their social media pages. He also moderated the Creepshots sub, which entailed users taking pictures of women – including underage ones, without their consent or knowledge. If that wasn’t enough, he started or moderated the following subs: Chokeabitch, N****rjailbait, Rapebait, Misogyny and many others. With such extreme views, all of which he defended, it’s a wonder he managed to hold down a full time job and have a family. While its members were aware of his proclivities, he did not want his identity shared – something that he apparently did not give a second thought to when sharing images of underage girls. In the end, Adrien Chen revealed that Violentacrez was 49-year-old Texas programmer Michael Brutsch. While many disagreed with the ethics of exposing someone’s identity, the truth is that there is no anonymity on the internet. A distasteful comment may seem like a fun way to rile up an audience, but you can never know if it will come back to haunt you. 7 – Gawker Stalker In 2006, Gawker was going through its terrible twos when someone had an idea: combine Google Maps with celebrity sightings! Thus, the Gawker Stalker was born. At first, it was a weekly roundup of celebrity sightings with the locations noted on Google Maps. While a tool like that could potentially be used to track the patterns of a celebrity, it does not seem terribly different from methods used by the paparazzi. Then it got worse. Updates came more frequently, and sightings popped up on the map more often. This led many celebrities to feel concerned for their safety, such as George Clooney, whose representative called the map “a dangerous thing.” Things blew up in 2007 when then-editor Emily Gould appeared on Larry King Live to defend Gawker Stalker, where she was taken to task for not only the map, but also the issues with their reporting. Gould left Gawker shortly after. The map has since been abandoned, along with their reporting on celebrities’ locations. 6 – A voice for the unemployed Hamilton Nolan has spent the past four years writing about one of the most important issues facing the US: unemployment. In 2012, he began a series titled “Unemployment Stories.” After a year, he posted the fortieth installment of the simple and painfully honest feature. For anyone who has not experienced unemployment, congratulations on either being very lucky or rich enough to never have a job. But being unemployed is about more than just financial worries. There’s an element of isolation to it. While most people are at work, an unemployed person is filling out resume after resume, trying their hardest for something to stick. One person described the first five hours of their day consisting of helping their employed girlfriend get to work, then they would “search the same 8 job search sites, submit my two resumes for the day, note the jobs available rarely changed from day to day, emailed family and friends, and then went home to wait by the phone for call backs.” Unemployment stories captured the dynamic of frustration and depression that being without a job entails. From adults watching their own parents struggle to find employment after losing their jobs in a tumultuous economy, to people who had to take jobs earning less than they did in high school, Unemployment Stories gave a voice to the people who needed it most. Billionaire funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker https://t.co/murR6wLyFJpic.twitter.com/EXhlMHugY8— RT America (@RT_America) May 25, 2016 5 – MSNBC was so wrong to show Trayvon Martin’s body that Gawker did it too The 2013 trial of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin was a media free-for-all, where the 24-hour news cycle covered nearly every minute of it – even the things they shouldn’t have. MSNBC and HLN accidentally aired an image of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin’s corpse when it was shown during the trial. A tipster sent Adam Weinstein the image, which he decided to publish. He apologized for sharing it, acknowledging that it was in poor taste, saying, “To Trayvon's parents, Sabrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, I'm sorry that I feel compelled to share this photograph.” But he went on to explain that he shared the body of a dead teenager, citing “Good old-fashioned rage that this kid is dead because my home state empowered a dullard aficionado of Van Damme and Seagal movie cliches to choose his own adventure.” 4 – Corporations are people, but they’re not good people Gawker’s firsthand accounts of working for Walmart illuminated how one of the biggest corporations in the US treat the people that make them profitable. Not well, as it turns out. Stories emailed from Walmart employees covered the range of managers to shelf stockers, all of whom felt mistreated by the company. “Customer's always complain about the service and morale of the store, but with the working conditions of the employees who are paid just enough to keep them toiling, treated less than human by management while being given 2-3 people's work to eek out in a 4-8 hour shift, and not even get all of their legally mandated breaks, what should customer's (sic) expect?” one employee wrote. The response was so strong that Walmart turned to its employees for defense. A plea for support was posted on a website for employees, reading: “Many people in the media don't know the amazing stories you have to share. This week Gawker is posting stories about Walmart, attacking the work our associates do, and it's up to us to set the record straight.” That backfired immediately, and more negative stories came in. There were some positive stories that were shared with Gawker, but they didn’t seem to be more than a silver lining on a crappy job. “A week after I joined Walmart, my first child was born. Would you believe that Walmart gave me a week off (without pay of course) and they didn't hold it against me when I returned,” one veteran employee told Gawker. 3 – Hugo, we hardly knew ye Jezebel has been a cultural icon for women’s interest news, so much so that it was parodied on Tina Fey’s hit sitcom, 30 Rock. But that does not mean it has made questionable decisions, such as the hiring of Hugo Schwyzer. Schwyzer, a self-proclaimed male “feminist,” wrote pieces focused on the male efforts to help gender equality.  However, that was when he wasn’t teaching gender studies at Pasadena City College, where in 2013, he was accused of behaving lecherously with students and bragging about using his position of power for sexual conquests. In a since-deleted blog post, he claimed to have attempted to murder an ex-girlfriend. Not exactly the ideal gatekeeper for a safe space. In 2013, he announced that he was leaving the internet for awhile. Gawker faces number of other lawsuits, including from Uber & Daily Mail's parent company https://t.co/k3xmXtrATXpic.twitter.com/m9JjtAtq0I— RT America (@RT_America) June 10, 2016 2 – Hello from the other side Gawker’s first-person series is often poignant, powerful and controversial – all the makings of important human interest pieces. Few, however, can come close to the Letters from Death Row series from Hamilton Nolan. The US is one of the only countries in the industrialized world to use capital punishment. Letters from Death Row gave faces and names to people who were pending execution. Some of them were offering the final statements of their lives. The series gave readers an inside look into the existence of men whose lives were completely consumed by the criminal justice system. 1 - Rob Ford. Whether this was a hit or miss is in the eyes of the beholder. Former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was recorded smoking crack in 2013, and editor John Cook nearly got his hands on the tape. After viewing the tape in secrecy, Cook learned that it would cost $200,000 to purchase, so he started an Indiegogo campaign called the Rob Ford Crackstarter to raise the money. Here’s where people’s opinions tend to deviate. Some believe that it is ethically questionable to solicit donations from “people who hang out with and surreptitiously record crack-smoking mayors” and would likely backfire. It turns out they were right, and after raising the money for the video, the source disappeared and so too did the tape. That is, until 2016 when it resurfaced. The silver lining of the gaff by Gawker is twofold. To start with, reporters from the Toronto Star had also seen the tape, but were unable to find an angle to write about it without showing the tape itself. In addition, the funds raised by Gawker’s campaign went to charitable organizations, such as the Somali Canadian Association of Etobicoke and drug rehabilitation programs. Gawker, we salute you.

Random Lake man arrested after high-speed chase USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 9:41 p.m. CDT August 18, 2016 Michael Lawrenz (Photo: Photo courtesy Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office) 141 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE PLYMOUTH - A 36-year-old Random Lake man was arrested and charged with 25 crimes after leading police on several high-speed chases. Michael J. Lawrenz was charged with multiple crimes including bail jumping, fleeing police, obstruction and possession of a controlled substance after eluding officers during a high-speed chase and then later leading officers on a second chase. According to the criminal complaint: An officer patrolling the Wal-Mart parking lot in Plymouth at 12:30 a.m. June 20 noticed a vehicle in the back of the parking lot with damage to its front-end. The officer, investigating a hit and run from earlier, ran the license plates on the vehicle and found the plates were registered to a different vehicle. The officer performed a traffic stop on the vehicle on Highway 57 after it left the Wal-Mart parking lot. Lawrenz, the driver, told the officer that he pulled him over at a very bad time because he had just lost his job, was living in his car and had no license. He said he stole the plates from a different car in a junk yard. Lawrenz had warrants out for his arrest related to cases in Grafton and Waukesha County, but when the officer went to arrest him for the warrants, Lawrenz said "I'm really sorry," put his car in drive and fled at a high rate of speed. The officer pursued Lawrenz on Highway 57 at speeds between 80 and 100 mph until Lawrenz turned off his headlights, causing officers to lose sight of the car and end the pursuit. Then at 6:25 p.m. on June 23, Sheboygan County Sheriff's deputies spotted Lawrenz in his car at a Kwik Trip and attempted to use their cars to box him in. Lawrenz, noticing the officers, accelerated "so quickly that there was smoke coming from the front tires as they spun on the pavement in the parking lot" and left the parking lot, narrowly missing the squad cars. Officers pursued Lawrenz at speeds of 110 on Sauk Trail Road for approximately 2 miles until Lawrenz lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a swampy ditch. Lawrenz then fled officers on foot and jumped a fence before stopping. He initially ignored officers' commands and resisted arrest,  but was ultimately apprehended. Once at the hospital, Lawrenz was found to have a laceration to his liver and was transported to a Milwaukee hospital for treatment. In searching Lawrenz's vehicle, officers recovered a prescription medicine bottle that did not belong to Lawrenz and several hypodermic needles, an unidentified white powder and several items of drug paraphernalia. Lawrenz was found to have several pending cases in Washington, Ozaukee, Waukesha and Sheboygan counties. 141 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://shebpr.es/2bG4E4m TOP VIDEOS Native American Storyteller and Quilt Maker Duo Appear On Show 2:53 Who is Nikki Haley? 1:30 Wisconsin weather forecast for Wednesday, Nov. 23 0:51 Dalai Lama: 'No Worries' About Trump 1:17 Storm looks to contend for Packerland title 1:37 Green Bay police chief on Deckner shooting 1:22 Easiest bird ever: Turkey in under 2 and a half hours 2:06 UWSP students studying natural resources wary of Trump presidency 2:31 Wisconsin weather forecast for Tuesday, Nov. 22 0:45 Colored Christmas trees at Wolosek farm 2:05 Manalapan family turns home into food pantry 0:51 Randall Cobb offers to match $20K for Stock the Shelves 0:35 Suspect arrested in fatal cop shooting in San Antonio 1:19 Raw: Tsunami warning in Japan after strong quake 1:23 Ghosts ready to defend title 2:18 Tuesday's forecast: More snow for the Rockies 2:47 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 Xavier boys looking to reload 0:59 UWSP professor talks about bullying experiences, future 2:54 Trojans transitioning to Barkley as coach 1:18 Northeast sees first major snow storm of the season 0:34 Dozens of vehicles crash on China expressway 0:47 Wisconsin weather forecast for Monday, Nov. 21 0:43 Answering Packers fans voicemails: Week 11 3:36 Breaking down Packers' 4th straight loss 2:34 Central Jersey NewsBreak, Weekend Edition, Nov. 18-20 2:59 Sheboygan Salvation Army kicks off its Red Kettle Kickoff campaign 1:59 3 matchups to watch in Green Bay-Washington 1:12 Just the FAQs: Fighting chronic absenteeism in Milwaukee schools 1:06 Anti-Trump protest in Paris 0:39

The ride-hailing company said Thursday that customers will be able to opt into the test program, which will use autonomous Ford Fusions summoned by the touch of a smartphone. Although other companies are testing self-driving cars on public roads, this is the first time the public will get access to them. The rides, which come with a human backup driver to handle situations that the autonomous cars haven't seen, will be free to those willing to take part. ___ Gawker.com dies next week, killed by an unhappy subject NEW YORK (AP) — Gawker.com, the website that broke new ground with its gossipy, no-holds-barred coverage of media, culture and politics, is shutting down after 14 years, brought low by an unhappy, but deep-pocketed, subject. Founder Nick Denton reportedly told staffers Thursday afternoon that Gawker.com will come to an end next week. The announcement follows the sale of the site's parent company, Gawker Media, to Univision for $135 million. That deal was struck after Gawker's expensive loss in an invasion-of-privacy case brought by the former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan. A Florida court awarded Hogan $140 million in damages ___ US stocks edge higher as energy prices rise; dollar weakens NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks again ticked higher Thursday as the continuing rebound in oil prices gave energy companies a lift. The gains were modest, however, as investors have been avoiding big moves. The dollar weakened further, and compared to the yen it's at its lowest in almost three years. Energy companies were a standout as the price of U.S. oil reached its highest level since the beginning of July. The weakening dollar aided exporters including technology and chemical companies. Phone company stocks continued to slump, as did financial firms. Stocks haven't moved much this week and haven't made many big moves over the last month. ___ Applications for US unemployment benefits fall to 262,000 WASHINGTON (AP) — Fewer people sought U.S. unemployment benefits last week, evidence that layoffs are scarce and employers are likely hiring at a solid clip. Weekly applications for unemployment aid slipped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 262,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The four-week average, typically a less volatile measure, rose 3,000 to 265,250. The number of people receiving benefits ticked up 15,000 to 2.18 million. That's nearly 4 percent lower than a year earlier. ___ Average US 30-year mortgage rate slips to 3.43 percent WASHINGTON (AP) — Long-term U.S. mortgage rates edged lower this week, remaining at historically low levels as a potential spur to home purchases. Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the average for the benchmark 30-year fixed-rate mortgage slipped to 3.43 percent from 3.45 percent last week. The average rate is down from 3.93 percent a year ago, and is close to its all-time low of 3.31 percent in November 2012. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate declined to 2.74 percent from 2.76 percent last week. ___ Gap offers muted outlook for annual profit NEW YORK (AP) — Gap offered a muted outlook Thursday after reporting a 43 percent drop in net income for the second quarter, weighed down by store closures. The company, which operates Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, said it earned $125 million, or 31 cents per share, for the period. That compares with $219 million, or 52 cents per share, last year. Adjusted results were 60 cents per share, a penny above market forecasts. Revenue slipped 1.2 percent to $3.85 billion. The company has been revamping its brands, but a promised turnaround has failed to come to fruition. ___ Wal-Mart raises annual profit outlook, reports strong sales NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart's vast fleet of stores and its online business are starting to click together. The company raised its earnings outlook for the year on Thursday and delivered strong profit and sales for the second quarter, as moves to improve the store and online experience are winning over customers. Wal-Mart has launched a flurry of changes, from making sure vegetables look good to cleaning up the stores to being sharper on keeping prices low. It's melding online services with the stores — rolling out a mobile payment system to speed checkouts. And it's pressing ahead with online grocery and pick-up services. ___ Hormel's sales rise after being hurt by avian flu last year AUSTIN, Minn. (AP) — Hormel Foods reported better-than-expected quarterly sales on Thursday, as the maker of Spam canned meat and Jennie-O turkey recovered from avian flu that hit its results a year ago. The company said total sales were up 5 percent, boosted by a 1 percent increase in volume. For the quarter, the company earned $195.7 million, or 36 cents per share. That was better than the 34 cents per share analysts expected, according to Zacks Investment Research. Total revenue of $2.3 billion in the period also topped market expectations of $2.24 billion. ___ Obama administration to phase out some private prison use WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration announced Thursday it will phase out its use of some private prisons, affecting thousands of federal inmates and sending shares of the two publicly traded prison operators plunging. Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates told the Bureau of Prisons to start reducing "and ultimately ending" the Justice Department's use of private prisons. The announcement follows a recent Justice Department audit that found that the private facilities have more safety and security problems than government-run ones. The policy change does not cover private prisons used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which hold up to 34,000 immigrants awaiting deportation. ___ T-Mobile phasing out data limits — but will you save money? NEW YORK (AP) — T-Mobile is phasing out data limits and pushing people toward unlimited data plans — which will mean higher prices for many new customers. Although T-Mobile is cutting the price of the unlimited plan, those who haven't been using that much data might eventually pay more for unlimited data they don't need. T-Mobile's announcement Thursday comes a day after AT&T said it would raise prices on some plans while giving customers more data. Verizon made a similar move last month. ___ Twitter: We suspended 360K accounts over 'violent extremism' NEW YORK (AP) — Twitter said Thursday it has suspended 360,000 accounts since mid-2015 for violating its policies banning the promotion of terrorism and violent extremism. The San Francisco-based company said in a blog post that it has also made progress in preventing users who were suspended from immediately returning to the platform using different accounts, which has been a problem in the past. It said its rate of daily suspensions is up 80 percent since last year, though it did not provide specific numbers. The suspensions spike immediately following terrorist attacks, it said. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average gained 23.76 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,597.70. The Standard & Poor's 500 gathered 4.80 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,187.02. The Nasdaq composite picked up 11.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,240.15. Benchmark U.S. crude gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $48.22 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.04, or 2.1 percent, to $50.89 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline rose 4 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil edged up 4 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas rose 6 cents to $2.67 per 1,000 cubic feet.

(Photo: Michael Lehmkuhle/The Advocate)Buy Photo Story Highlights City plans to extend Baker Boulevard to Evans Boulevard and put a roundabout on Sharon Valley Road. A tax increment financing district, or TIF, uses property taxes from the new Kroger for road work. 212 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE NEWARK – The North 21st Street commercial corridor attracts plenty of traffic, but also invites motorists to find alternate routes to reach their favorite stores without battling all the congestion. The future will likely bring more stores and more traffic, but also another route. The city plans to connect Baker Boulevard to Evans Boulevard, built a decade ago to reach the new Legend Elementary and Liberty Middle schools from Sharon Valley Road. And to ease traffic flow on Sharon Valley Road, a roundabout will be built next year at the Evans Boulevard-Sharon Valley Road intersection. Traffic on North 21st will likely increase when the Kroger Marketplace opens in November at the former Meijer location. Also on 21st, Popeyes is building a restaurant next to Rally's and the former Valley Lanes site is being marketed for a shopping center. And, the current Kroger on Deo Drive should be able to attract a new tenant to Indian Valley Plaza, its owner said. “Newark is a growing city at the right rate," Mayor Jeff Hall said. "We need to improve intersections and traffic flow. It’s challenging, but you want it to grow a little bit. "Traffic is not a bad thing. People are shopping and spending money. If everybody was concerned, there wouldn’t be that amount of traffic.” No matter how busy North 21st Street becomes, there is only so much that can be done to alleviate congestion, officials said. “You can’t widen the road," City Engineer Brian Morehead said. "The right of way purchase would be extravagant. The cost would be way more than construction. We’re trying to coordinate all signals and trying to eliminate as many driveway approaches as we can. There's not a lot we can do. It’s congested, but it’s our commercial area.” Traffic on North 21st moved at about 45 miles an hour 20 years ago, Morehead said, but now travels at about the posted speed limit of 35 miles per hour. Residents in north and west Newark prefer traveling Sharon Valley Road to King Road to Goosepond Road to reach Wal-Mart on North 21st or Kroger on Deo Drive. Park Shai, who manages real estate for Kroger building owner James Van Winkle, said the Deo Drive location should be attractive to a new tenant, if and when the building is vacant. “Kroger hasn’t announced they’re leaving yet and they still have a current lease,” Shai said. Obviously, we’d market it to get a new tenant in there.” Baker Boulevard extension In a few years, an even more direct route will be available when Evans and Baker boulevards are connected. A tax increment financing district, or TIF, will be established to use property taxes from the Kroger development to help pay for infrastructure improvements in the area. It will take a few years, the mayor said, to accumulate enough TIF funds to make the road improvements. “We’re at the very early stages,” Hall said. “We think there’s a need. I think everybody agrees with that. It’s a concept we think is right.” Many years ago, city officials considered extending Baker Boulevard all the way to King Road, and into Newark Township. That’s not the current plan, Morehead said, although no design work has yet been done. “We’ll try to get the TIF in place and move forward with design after that,” Morehead said. “I don’t think it’s necessary to go all the way to King. That could come at a later time. It wouldn’t be cheap.” The cost of extending Baker to Evans would cost about $4 million, Morehead said. It would add another $2 million to reach King Road, he said. Keith Loughlin, executive director of Newark Area Soccer Association, said soccer fans will be elated when the Baker Boulevard extension is built and they can enter and exit without ever driving on North 21st. The 65-acre NASA complex is located at the end of Baker Boulevard and within sight of the schools on Sharon Valley Road. “The North 21st Street corridor is very busy and in some ways very dangerous," Loughlin said. "We’re told people choose not to come to NASA because of North 21st Street.” NASA has grown in popularity and in size. There is room for a dozen full-size fields, or up to 30 fields of various sizes to accommodate players of various ages, Loughlin said. Parking has been expanded for up to 400 cars. The facility averages about 500 to 800 people per night. The annual Buckeye Cup attracts several thousand visitors, and another major event will be added in 2017, when the Hopewell Cup launches in the first week of October. Although soccer fans want to avoid North 21st Street, Loughlin said, they do look forward to the Kroger Marketplace opening. “We were sorry to see Meijer leave and excited Kroger put in that investment," Loughlin said. Sharon Valley Road The Baker Boulevard extension may take traffic off North 21st, but it will add traffic to Sharon Valley Road, where numerous athletic and education facilities are located. In about a one-quarter mile stretch on Sharon Valley Road is access to Reese Ice Arena, the Newark Rotary Park, the baseball field and Newark campus of Ohio State University and Central Ohio Technical College, North Newark Little League, Evans Athletic Complex and the bike path. Legend Elementary School has 541 students and Liberty Middle School 487 students. The Newark campus enrollment in 2014 was 3,579 for COTC and 2,516 for OSU-N. The ice arena attracts 150,000 people each season, from August to May. A roundabout will be built next year at the Sharon Valley Road-Evans Boulevard intersection, and the entrances to the ice arena and Rotary Park will be moved to the east, further away from the schools. “We studied it for a traffic signal there and the real tough part is busy traffic is a half hour in the morning and a half hour in the afternoon, and the rest of the time, a functioning light is not specifically warranted," Morehead said. The roundabout will be larger than the ones being built in downtown Newark, but will be one lane. Crosswalks will be added. “It’s a learning process for a lot of folks,” Morehead said of the roundabouts. “It keeps traffic moving continuously and it lowers the speed in and out of roundabouts.” A pedestrian bridge will be added later this year over the diversion ditch, connecting the neighborhood and bike path with the schools. There are no sidewalks on Sharon Valley Road. Jordan McWayne, general manager of the Reese Ice Arena, supports the roundabout. “I think it will be nice,” McWayne said. "It should help the traffic flow. It gets busy around here. And, it'll probably help the flow of buses. It backs up a little bit. It’s good to see the city focusing on the area and wanting to improve it.” kmallett@newark advocate.com 740-328-8545 Twitter: @kmallett1958 212 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/2bcedW4 TOP VIDEOS Newark basketball teams roll in Foundation Game wins 1:25 Lakewood girls basketball shows great potential 0:57 Defense, passing game combine to power Newark Catholic to regional title 1:56 Lake gets Newark Catholic off to flying start 0:17 Schroeder records hat trick in Newark Generals rout 1:13 Heath girls tune up vs. East Knox 0:38 Army Pfc.

(DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Few would argue that Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) isn’t working hard to rekindle its once-impressive growth. But few would say that work is decidedly paying off. The retailer posted yet another disappointing set quarterly numbers on Wednesday morning, sending Target stock soundly lower in response. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr (Modified) TGT earned an operating profit of $1.23 per share for the second quarter of the current fiscal year, up a penny year-over-year. That was enough to beat Wall Street projections for $1.12 per share of Target stock, as well as its own forecasts of $1-$1.20 per share. Revenues, however, were off about 8% to $16.17 billion, merely matching sales estimates. That came on same-store sales declines of 1.1%, which were a bit worse than the 0.9% expected. CEO Brian Cornell commented: “While we recognize there are opportunities in the business, and are addressing the challenges we are facing in a difficult retail environment, we are pleased that our team delivered second quarter profitability above our expectations. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our enterprise priorities as we continue to see the benefits of investing in Signature Categories, store experience, new flex-format stores and digital capabilities. Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time.” In fairness, Target really is getting its house in order. But that’s little salve to anyone whose Target stock is slumping this morning. Target Stock and Its Headwinds Target generally beats earnings and revenue estimates. However, it has stumbled a few times in recent quarters as company has been struggling with an identity crisis since calendar 2013. The “cheap chic” angle lost its luster versus the “fast fashion” movement employed by its apparel rivals. At the same time, e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has continued to chip away at hard lines like toys and electronics. Lowe’s Companies (LOW) Faceplants Into a Sell Rating Perhaps more than anything, Target never really shrugged off the 2013 hack that exposed 40 million customers’ debit card data. Revenue has been dwindling ever since, while income has been choppy at best. Anemic profits haven’t even been as strong as suggested on the surface. The float has been whittled down from 663 million shares in 2012 to 604 million as of the end of Q1. Target bought back another 19 million shares last quarter, pulling the total float down to 585 million shares of TGT stock. Still, Target is optimistic it can revive growth by adding product categories, beefing up its e-commerce effort and moving forward with a new kind of store. Target’s Turnaround Effort One of those initiatives was the expansion of its food business. While Target has long offered some groceries, in the latter half of 2015, it widened its selection to perishables such as meat and produce. The idea was to better compete with the likes of Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and even dedicated grocery chains such as The Kroger Co (NYSE:KR). The effort drove growth initially, but the company has more work to do on the grocery front. This week, reports surfaced that many of perishables were expiring before they could be sold, implying a lack of grocery foot traffic and/or supply-management challenges. As for e-commerce, Target is still playing catchup after years of not investing enough in its online venue. Digital sales were up 16% during the second quarter, which is an impressive improvement. But online sales still aren’t considered strong enough relative to the opportunity TGT has; they only make up 4% of the company’s revenue. That pace slowed from Q1’s growth rate of 23%. To that end, however Target continues to make strides. TGT recently hired Amazon supply chain executive Preston Mosier to serve as vice president of fulfillment operations. It will need all the help it can get on the online front. Not only was it competing head-to-head with Amazon as well as Wal-Mart, but WMT recently acquired online shopping site Jet.com. That should bolster the brick-and-mortar retailer’s online presence and threat. Perhaps the boldest initiative the company is taking on to buoy the value of Target stock is the development of smaller stores. The 20,000(+/-)-square-foot locales are roughly a tenth of the size of the typical Target store, allowing them to be established in, and serve, neighborhoods rather than the shopping center crowd. Twenty are already up and running, and while Walmart is getting out of the small-store business, Target recently accelerated its small-footprint plans. It now endeavors to open 14 more of the small-footprint stores before the end of 2016. TGT: Looking Ahead The overall assessment of Target’s overhaul efforts have been positive of late. Buckingham Research Group analysts commented earlier this week “We have been impressed with new management’s decisive actions and evidence of improved merchandising and execution, although the first quarter of fiscal 2016 was a modest setback.” Analysts’ collective outlook affirms the sentiment. The pros were looking for an average profit of $5.13 per share, up 19% from the prior year’s second-quarter bottom line. Sales were only expected to fall 4.5% in 2016, though, from $73.8 billion to $70.5 billion. Wednesday’s Vital Data: AAPL, CHK and HAIN But Target reeled in its full-year outlook. It now anticipates same-store sales will be flat to 2% lower for all of 2016, and lowered its earnings guidance from a range of $5.20 to $5.40 per share of TGT to a range of between $5.20 and $5.40. Target stock fell 4% on the downward-revised guidance. Rival Walmart will announce its quarterly numbers on Thursday of this week. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Epler | eepler@pennlive.com on August 20, 2016 4:45 PM, updated August 20, 2016 5:00 PM comments In his 38 seasons coaching Babe Ruth Baseball, Scott Reigle had experienced this rush only once before. Connersville, Indiana was the site of the 2002 Babe Ruth World Series, and Reigle’s Mifflin County chapter emerged as the fifth-best youth baseball team in the United States. While topping that run seemed improbable, there was something about his latest group of handpicked all-stars that activated those same emotions. Turns out, Pennsylvania and Mid-Atlantic Regional titles weren’t enough for this group of 13-year-old ball players. “Once we started tournament play I knew we had a chance to finish high in the state tournament, but thinking about winning a World Series at that time wasn’t on our minds,” said Reigle on his 14-hour drive home from Ottumwa, Iowa, on Friday. Mifflin County didn’t just represent the Rust Belt with pride and sportsmanship, it claimed the county’s first Babe Ruth World Series title with a 5-3 victory over Pearl City (HI) on Thursday. “It was a long term goal but we knew we had to do some other work first. When it comes down to it, it was a total team effort,” Reigle said. “We came up with the key hits every time we needed one. It was the full line-up.” It’s estimated that 60,000 teams in several age groups of Babe Ruth Baseball are scattered over 11,000 leagues across the nation. Mifflin County spent 124 days attacking its portion with grit and, quite frankly, a flair for the dramatic. Mifflin County's 13-year-old Babe Ruth baseball team went from the fields of Pennsylvania to a World Series champion. (Photo courtesy of Bittersweet Studios/Julie Ufema)) Saturday’s parade through the crowded streets of Lewistown was yet another chance to celebrate Mifflin County’s brilliant stretch of baseball. And team effort continued to resonate. When Mifflin County, a select group from the local 10-team league, charged into the state tournament in Belleville, teammates sold ham sandwiches to cover the freight. A tag sale at the Walmart Supercenter in Lewistown, where Saturday’s 11-mile parade route began, helped cover the cost of Mifflin County’s trek to Queensbury, N.Y., for the Mid-Atlantic Regional. And when the long road trip to Iowa was scheduled, dozens of local businesses and corporate sponsors emerged to make sure players were taken care of. The generosity also allowed Andrew Bern to broadcast the games live on WKVA so all of Lewistown could follow the young heroes and their quest to win it all. “Andrew did a nice job,” said Lewistown Sentinel sports editor Jeff Fishbein, who sent correspondent Ray Wilde to cover the action. “A lot of people were asking ‘did you hear the game last night?’ A lot of people and players from the other teams back home were following.” And why not? The action on the diamond was sensational. After clearing the field in Queensbury with a one-run victory in the final, Brycen Hassinger’s RBI single in extra-innings produced Mifflin County’s 4-3 victory over Eau Claire (WI) in the series opener. “I think we kind of trusted each other early on,” said third baseman and pitcher Brian Yetter. “People don’t know this but we relied on each other. Even if we struck out or made an error we couldn’t get down on each other. We knew we could pick each other up. We had confidence in each other. That was the biggest thing.” Later came Ethan Eichhorn’s three-run blast to fuel MC’s triumph over Waterford (CT). A day later, Eichhorn fired a no-hitter over host Ottumwa and watched teammate Casey Conner bash three hits. Reigle’s crew even avenged an earlier loss to West Fargo (ND) 7-6 on the strength of Brian Yetter’s three hits and three RBIs. Even the details of the rematch were dramatic. With three teams -- Mifflin County, Waterford and West Fargo - tied at 3-1 following pool play, the tiebreaker was runs allowed, which handed Mifflin County the top spot. Since 1980, the Pacific Southwest Regional champion had claimed 13 World Series titles. But Hawaii’s Pearl City would not cash No. 14. Mifflin County would rally from a 3-1 deficit and write its own history. “I’m usually pretty calm but I think my coaches were more nervous on Thursday than anybody,” Reigle said. “We had a great crowd there. The people and the community really supported the World Series.” Yetter, Colby Bodtorf, and Conner (MVP) were touted as all-tournament selections, with but not a single interview passed without the credit shifting to teammates. That means Reigle had it right. Only a complete baseball team can bypass improbable. “We joked about it a lot but we never thought it would happen,” said Bodtorf, Mifflin County’s shortstop and pitcher. “It was just playing with my team and having fun. We’re all just a bunch of good ball players that had fun playing.” “I think what I’ll remember is all the times we came back. All the times where it was the fourth inning and we flipped the switch and got the job done,” Yetter added. “Also, the amount of friendships you get out of this. Months down the road that’s what I’ll remember the most.” Follow @threejacker View/Post Comments About Us PA Media Group Advertise with Us Contact Us Send Us a News Tip Frequently Asked Questions Career Opportunities FAQ Community Rules Subscriptions Manage your Patriot-News Subscription e-Newsletters PennLive Sections Home News Sports PSU Football High School Sports Entertainment Pa.

The Bridges Prep board approved the purchase Thursday night contingent on tests and studies confirming the suitability of the site for a charter school campus. Those studies, which will cost about $75,000, include traffic analysis, utilities access and wetlands. “We have worked many years to get to this point. We have 18 acres, and it’s ours once we do our due diligence,” said board chair Dee Matthews. The property is across from the Beaufort-Jasper Water and Sewer Authority water tank, near Goethe Hill Road and south of Cross Creek Shopping Center and Walmart. Bridges Prep’s board anticipates building a 90,000-square-foot facility to house all grades from kindergarten through 12th grade. Although the school only started offering ninth grade this year, by the time the school opens, those students will be juniors. “We fully expect to have our first graduating class graduate from the new facility,” head of school Nick Ithomitis said. “The purchase is contingent on a variety of things that must be done to ensure the site is suitable for a school. But in all honesty, this is a giant leap forward in our quest for a new school.” Bridges Prep was chartered by the state in mid-2012 and opened at near capacity in August 2013. Since then, enrollment has grown by 200-plus students to more than 580 this school year. An almost $10 million federal loan will pay for the land, construction and equipping the new school, though Bridges leaders said they will seek additional funds to expand the project to include all high school grades. For the next two school years, Bridges Prep will continue to operate at three campuses — the main school at 1100 Boundary St., a K-1 school at Celadon on Lady’s Island, and middle and high school grades at nearby Greene Street.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obits E-Edition Autos Jobs Real Estate Classifieds Site Archive Vacant Wal-Mart property used for Bluecut fire volunteers Saturday Aug 20, 2016 at 8:47 AM Aug 21, 2016 at 9:26 PM Rene Ray De La Cruz Staff Writer @DP_ReneDeLaCruz VICTORVILLE — The property surrounding a vacant Wal-Mart in the High Desert sprang to life Saturday as emergency personnel used the abandoned building’s parking lot to help those affected by the Bluecut fire. The Southern Baptist Association’s Disaster Relief Team is utilizing the parking lot of the property located on Balsam Avenue and Bear Valley Road in Victorville to prepare hot meals from their mobile disaster relief kitchen. Agency liaison Dawn Dwyer with the State Mass Feeding program said her SBA team of nearly two dozen volunteers will prepare meals for evacuees sheltered at the San Bernardino County Fairgrounds. Dwyer said the SBA nonprofit program is currently assisting several agencies as they battle several fires throughout California. She added that her High Desert team will prepare and deliver hot meals during the evacuation period and beyond. “We’ll be here as long as the Red Cross needs us,” Dyer told the Daily Press Friday. “We have a complete kitchen with sanitation facilities ready to go. Some of our menu items include beef stew, pork ribs, chicken, vegetables and dessert.” The County of San Bernardino and ARC have partnered to activate the county's Mass Care and Shelter Plan by opening the Shelter Operations Compound at the fairgrounds on Thursday. About 80 evacuees sheltered at Sultana High School in Hesperia are being moved to the compound, which provides food, shelter, health care and animal care to residents displaced by the Bluecut fire. Shower and bathroom facilities will also be available for residents, with public information made available to provide evacuees up-to-date information about the Bluecut incident. County Assessor-Recorder-County Clerk Bob Dutton said the shelter includes a mobile office where residents affected by the fire can be served. He added that the office can help assess property loss, obtain recorded documents, speak with Department of Motor Vehicle Officials and insurance providers, and several county program representatives. Regional, civic and community leaders gathered at the fairgrounds on Friday to share how multiple agencies are handling the Bluecut fire, which had already destroyed 96 single-family homes, damaged three others and devoured 213 outbuildings. Red Cross Public Affairs Officer Georgia Duncan told the Daily Press Friday that the SBA group was not allowed to set up at the fairgrounds because there was not enough room. “The Southern Baptist Association team needs a hard concrete surface to set up their mobile kitchen and equipment,” Duncan said. “We’ve contracted with the Southern Baptist Association for years and we appreciate their efforts.” The Wal-Mart property was provided to the ARC for the SBA group by Coldwell Banker Commercial Victorville, said CBC President Jason Lamoreaux.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Computers Tech Q&A: Finding military records, digitizing VHS tapes By Kim Komando Published August 19, 2016 The Kim Komando Show Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print Illustration picture. Easy way to request old military records Q: Kim help! My grandfather served in World War II. You mentioned a way to find old military records with a caller on your national radio show. What was that website called? A: Archives.gov lets you request a family member's service records and browse through photos taken during the war. It's a great place if you're researching family history or want to replace lost or damaged medals. Certain requests require a $25 to $70 flat copying fee. Click here for direct links to order replacement medals and service records. By the way, if you ever miss my show or want to hear certain parts again, get the podcast. Here’s a link on my site to a free trial. Buying and selling on Craigslist Q: My daughter just started college and needs furniture for her new apartment. Where can I find cheap furniture that's still in good shape? A: Craigslist is a great place to look. Be sure to use specific search terms to find the best deals. "Moving," "divorce" and "everything must go" are buzzwords that help locate truly motivated sellers. A jilted spouse, for example, may be willing to sell an ex's favorite chair for a dollar. Someone who's moving out of state may lower their price because they don't have room to take everything with them. I have a list of the 10 top-selling items on Craigslist. Click here to see if any of these money-makers are collecting dust in your closet. Modernizing old videotapes Q: I have a slew of VHS tapes from the kid’s younger years. How can I get them into this century? A: Videotapes have a shelf life of only 10 to 12 years. As time passes, they lose their magnetic signal. The sharpness, quality and color deteriorate. Worst of all, the tape grows brittle and breaks as it’s played. To preserve the content of your videotapes, digitizing them is a must. Here are your choices: Costco, Wal-Mart and Walgreens will all transfer the old video formats to DVD. A Japanese company called Funai, the last company manufacturing VHS players, makes a device that transfers VHS content to DVDs. It’s inexpensive enough for home use and is available from a limited number of retailers, including my store. Click here to learn more about it. Defeating annoying telemarketers Q: I keep getting calls from an insurance company trying to sell me a policy. They always call back even though I hang up on them. How can I stop them from calling? A: If you hang up without specifically stating you're not interested in what they're selling, most telemarketers will mark you down as "no answer" and keep calling. Make sure your phone number is listed in the Do Not Call Registry. If you're really fed up, block these calls altogether. Click here to see three apps that can block these calls or at least notify you that it's a telemarketer on the other line. Breezing through airport security Q: Hi Kim! I'm visiting family next month and the airline recommends I arrive at the airport two to three hours before my flight departs. Is there any way to speed things up? A: The TSA recently introduced PreCheck to reduce wait times at security checkpoints. Visit TSA.gov/precheck to get started. You'll need to set up an appointment to provide the TSA with documentation and fingerprints and to have a background check completed. It costs $85, and the process takes a few weeks while the Department of Homeland Security determines your threat assessment. But once you're cleared, your membership lasts five years and you'll be able to breeze through the security checkpoints at the airport. With the extra time you'll have on your hands, you might be tempted to browse the web while waiting for your flight. But before you log on, click here for tips on reducing your risk of being hacked when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. Bonus: Updating your iPhone's operating system Q: I keep getting a prompt to update my iOS, but I'm planning on buying a new iPhone this fall. Should I even bother? A. Yes! The latest update to iOS 9.3.4 is really important, especially if you missed the update to iOS 9.3.3. That one fixed a vulnerability that was similar to Android Stagefright, which could allow a hacker to take control of your device by sending a corrupted text message. Version 9.3.4 makes the Pangu jailbreak tool useless and prevents other exploits that use the same software flaw to compromise your operating system. But updating your iOS is only the first step.

Login Search Close Update: US Stocks Edge Lower as Rate-Hike Chances Loom August 19, 2016, 04:20:28 PM EDT By MidnightTrader.com Staff, MT Newswires Shutterstock photo Stocks in the US ended Friday's session lower, capping a week of fluctuations that saw the markets pull back from record highs on Monday as Federal Reserve officials raised the chances of an interest rate hike. The possibility for a September tightening was rekindled by San Francisco Fed president John Williams who favors a rate hike "sooner rather than later," echoing a sentiment made by New York Fed president William Dudley earlier this week. Seven of the 10 S&P 500 sectors fell, with utilities down 1.3% to lead the losses. On the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 18 of the 30 components weakened, with Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT ) losing 2.1% while Nike ( NKE ) rallied about 3%. Oil prices were split, with West Texas Intermediate up about 0.3% late in the session while Brent, the international standard, slipped 0.5%. The S&P's energy sector fell 0.8%.

Posted: Saturday, August 20, 2016 1:30 am Sakaguchi cares for ‘his’ Explorers Dennis Fujimoto - The Garden Island The Garden Island Newspaper | 0 comments LIHUE — Kauai Police Department officer Troy Sakaguchi said the KPD Explorers go everywhere with him. He was able to get a break from sitting atop the Walmart rooftop Thursday to ensure the Explorers were safely picked up following their tour of manning fishnets to collect funds benefiting the Special Olympics, Kauai. The Explorers worked alongside Special Olympics athletes to collect funds toward its $25,000 goal to get the officers off the rooftop. “Special Olympics is such a good program,” said Joanne Strader, one of the chaperones for the group. “I love this program. Starting as a parent, I’ve been helping for 10 years, becoming a coach and a chaperone for more than 100 Special Olympic athletes on Kauai who range in age from 8 to older than 55 years old.” Strader said Special Olympics takes care of these athletes, sometimes for their entire life. The Cop on Top is one of the program’s signature fundraising efforts where police officers are hoisted atop a store such as the Walmart on Kauai, and help generate funds for the program from shoppers and other supporters. Sakaguchi and KPD Sgt. Jason Matsuoka were hoisted to the Walmart rooftop at 6 a.m. Thursday with a pledge to remain on the roof until 3 p.m. today, or until the $25,000 goal is met. © 2016 Thegardenisland.com.

The world of trademark law is murky indeed Trading blows … Clinton was allowed to trademark ‘Hillary for America’, but ‘Trump for America’ was disallowed. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images John Sutherland Saturday 20 August 2016 04.00 EDT Last modified on Tuesday 20 September 2016 10.02 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Should’ve seen it coming: the trademarking of public language Read more Last week US swimmer Ryan Lochte found himself wanted for questioning by Rio police over a story about being mugged – one of the two bad things that supposedly happened to him at the 2016 Games (the other was losing to Michael Phelps; the defeat stands, the mugging, it turns out, was made up). One wonders whether Ryan’s ejaculation, on learning that he was wanted back in Brazil, was a bellowing “Jeah!” He trademarked his peculiar victory scream in August 2012, after winning gold in London Olympics. “It means, like, almost everything,” he explained, somewhat unhelpfully. When, in November 2016, she becomes (God willing) the most powerful woman in the world, Potus (untrademarked, apparently) Hillary will be quite within her rights to tell Donald: “You’re fired!” His attempt to trademark that phrase was turned down in 2004. When she began her campaign, Clinton’s camp were luckier in trademarking the phrase “Hillary for America”. “Trump for America” was nixed. Advantage Hillary. Let’s hope it stays that way. Sarah Palin, when she was riding high all those years ago, tried to trademark her own name but apparently botched the application. It would not, one deduces, be hopeful for the world had the fearless Alaskan made it to the highest rung (“did you say blue button? I thought you said red. Ah, well, it’s only Russia”). The government-run intellectual property offices in the US and UK are, on the whole, level-headed in their rulings. Walmart is well on the way to owning everything in the US. But its attempt to trademark the yellow smiley face in 2006 was denied. Emoticons seem immune. Smile on. It’s not clear, however, whether Facebook owns the twin components of “face” and “book”. The US Patent and Trademark Office allowed the company to register “face” in 2010; it does not appear to have successfully registered “book”, though it has asserted copyright on the word in its user agreement since 2012. In 2010 it launched a suit against teaching website Teachbook, which sent shivers through the book and face-product worlds. It’s murky. Best tread carefully. Business needs clear definitions of ownership. But, for chancers, trademarking can be a Las Vegas casino. A small punt can, if the TM gods smile on you, bring unimaginably huge rewards. The cost for a trademark, here and in the US, is around £200. The forms are very simple and (unless you’re Sarah Palin, ) easy to fill in. Unsurprisingly, every year people try their luck. They may well be inspired by the sports announcer Michael Buffer, who, when compering boxing bouts in the 1980s, came up with the resounding command “Let’s get ready to rumble”. Buffer has made more than $400m renting out those five words. Shakespeare should have been so lucky. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Buffer’s trademarked $400m catchphrase Rather more methodical is the self-described “intellectual property entrepreneur” Leo Stoller. Stoller was foresightful enough to trademark, in the early years of the 21st century, the word “stealth”. Internet search engines mean he can now locate any recent use of “his” word. He may well be looking at this article now (I think we’re safe, under the “fair use” rule, but I’m not sure). Every year Stoller fires off a barrage of fierce letters from his web company Rentamark.com, demanding payment for the use of “his” word. Some recipients pay up – sometimes thousands of dollars. Stoller also went to law against the aircraft manufacturer Northrop Grumman for cheekily using “his” word for their B2 “stealth” bomber. Stoller, who is clearly not lacking a sense of humour, has also, the New York Times reports, trademarked the word “chutzpah”. There was some fuss a few days ago about high-street optician Specsavers applying to have the contraction “should’ve” (as in their slogan, “Should’ve gone to Specsavers”) trademark protected. They’ve got past the first round, but I hope they’re unlucky. Taylor Swift is a ferocious trademarker of her song material. I can’t believe she hasn’t put a TM stamp on Should’ve Said No. If she hasn’t, I hope she does quick. I like her more than the optician. Revealed: How copyright law is being misused to remove material from the internet Read more The most recent crop of applications to clear the first hurdle, as listed by the UK Intellectual Property Office, are mainly bland and name-protective. There are some oddities, though. Bella Freud, the fashion designer, wants to trademark “1970”. It seems bonkers. But I suspect it will be valid only as an epithet applied to her line (and very handsome garments they are) of “1970 Wool Jumpers”, emblazoned with the date across their front. I was a bit fazed by BBC Worldwide Limited applying to trademark the word “swashbuckle”. But then someone told me it was the name of a popular pirate-themed comedy game show on children’s TV. All clear. But does that mean no one else can use the word – in historical narrative, for instance – without a Stoller-style letter? Zounds! On hearing the EU referendum result, US brewer Sam Adams opportunistically lodged with US trademark authorities an application for “Brexit”, to be pasted on their upcoming brand of “hard cider”. Speaking for myself and 16 million others, not being able to use the word “Brexit” is no great loss. Cheers. • Orwell’s Nose by John Sutherland is published by Reaktion at £15.

Sabrina Drude, who teaches at a school in San Antonio, Texas, explained to the man that many of her students were from low-income families who could not always afford basic school supplies. Card In a Facebook post, she explained: “So, I was just at Walmart, buying school supplies for my kids, when this man started asking me questions (like why are you buying 150 notebooks?). “I explained that I teach science and it wasn't worth the hassle of trying to get kids to bring their own notebooks, and that it takes away from time I could be teaching them. He then proceeded to pay for my entire cart of classroom supplies. “I started crying and hugged him and asked for a picture. His son was watching the whole thing too. There are some really good people in this world.” She posted the picture on Facebook and Reddit and found the good samaritan who paid the shopping bill. He turned out to be pastor Lester Brown, who explained on the Love What Matters Facebook page: “I responded because I could tell that this lady was willing to do whatever it takes for the success of the kids she is responsible to teach. “It's important that people who are in trusted to empower kids are loved and appreciated for their effort. “Some of the greatest lessons I have learned are central to my life and they came from outstanding teachers and coaches. “I pray that every teacher this year is safe to empower their kids with not only classroom lessons but, more importantly, love and God's love at that.” Mr Brown added that he had been keeping the $100 bill in his wallet, waiting for the right moment he could help someone in need. Back in June, a jogger attacked by angry swarm of a thousand bees thanked the stranger who rescued her. Here’s how a kidney donation helped save seven lives in one day.

The alleged victims — five men and two women — filed the complaint against the U.S.-registered companies, Rubicon Resources and Wales & Co. Universe, and Thai firms Phatthana Seafood Co. and S.S. Frozen Food Co. on June 15. In the complaint, the plaintiffs say they were tricked into working for the companies and were victims of “forced labor, involuntary servitude and peonage” between 2010 and 2012. U.S.-based Wal-Mart is named among the buyers of Phatthana’s shrimp exports, according to the complaint. U.S. District Judge John F. Walter ordered the attorneys to appear in court September 19 to present arguments and evidence. Attorneys for the plaintiffs will also present damage claims and explain their case for U.S. jurisdiction, which the defense claims is lacking. “If counsel fail to file the required joint report or fail to appear at the scheduling conference, and such failure is not otherwise satisfactorily explained to the court, the cause shall stand dismissed for failure to prosecute, if such a failure occurs on the part of the plaintiff,” the court order said. “Default judgment shall be entered if such failure occurs on the part of the defendant.” According to court documents, the defense team on August 3 said the court holds no jurisdiction because the alleged conduct occurred outside the United States. Plaintiffs’ representatives countered that the court holds jurisdiction under both the Torture Victim Protection Act and the Alien Tort Statute, both of which can allow foreigners to seek redress for human rights violations for conduct occurring outside the United States. A call to a defense attorney was not immediately returned. The defense previously won a one-month extension from the original July 15 deadline to submit arguments and evidence, saying their clients were based in rural areas of Thailand that lacked internet access. “Such a delay is like buying time to prepare something, [which] is not good [for us], because this case happened a long time ago,” Keo Ratha, one of the plaintiffs, told VOA’s Khmer service. Moeun Tola, executive director of the Center for Alliance of Labor and Human Rights, also said a quick conclusion of the case was desired. “I don’t support this delay, because the victims have been waiting since 2012 and it’s now 2016,” he said. “They have been waiting for four years.” Credit : Voice of America (VOA) | Photo Credit: AP Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Share on Skype (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Like this: Like Loading...

The retailer pulled the items from its stores, and on Friday it began notifying customers that it will give them a refund on the products, which were produced between August 2014 and July 2016 and sold for as much as $75. Customers seeking a refund can visit Target’s help page on its website. Target is Mumbai-based Welspun’s second-biggest customer, behind Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., according to Bloomberg data. The company makes towels, sheets, rugs and carpets for 18 of the top 30 global retailers. Its other major clients include Wal-Mart Stores Inc., J.C. Penney Co. and Macy’s Inc. It also manufactures the towels for the Wimbledon tennis championships and the Rugby World Cup. “We have informed Welspun that, due to this conduct, we are in the process of terminating our relationship with them,” said Molly Snyder, a Target spokeswoman. “We value the trust that our guests place in us. The Target team will continue to work closely with all vendors to help ensure that the products we offer to our guests meet or exceed their expectations.” Spokesmen for Welspun couldn’t be reached after regular business hours in India. Phasing Out Target said it is phasing out all of its products from Welspun, which it has used as a supplier for more than a decade, though the process will take time since some merchandise has already been shipped or paid for. The withdrawal only includes two lines of Egyptian cotton bedding, and not all of its Egyptian cotton sheets are affected. Egyptian cotton, which has a longer fiber that creates a softer thread than other cotton, often carries a higher price because shoppers consider it to be higher quality. Welspun India is part of Welspun Group, a conglomerate which also owns Welspun Corp. Ltd., a pipe manufacturer that also supplies major oil and gas companies. Welspun India’s sales in the year through March rose 13 percent to 59.8 billion rupees ($891.6 million), and net income climbed 30 percent to 7.03 billion rupees.

But sports footwear and apparel giant Nike Inc saw shares up 3 percent, making it one of the Dow’s biggest gainers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.2 percent at 18,552.57. The broader S&P 500 was down 0.1 percent at 2,183.87 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was essentially flat at 5,238.38. “The market continues to exhibit sideways price action but it is still an upside bias. The market just can’t just sell off with any bad news,” Michael James of Wedbush Securities told AFP. “None of the economic data was really market moving, nor were the Fed comments from the last meeting. They had no impact,” he added. Oil stocks were in negative territory on the Dow, with supermajor Exxon Mobil Corp down 1.3 percent and Chevron 1.2 percent. Wal-Mart shares gave up all of Thursday’s gain which came after the retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, despite absorbing costs from its recent acquisition of the online retailer Jet.com. On Friday the company closed down 2 percent at $72.81. Nike surged after announcing it had formed a supply-chain partnership with private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC. The deal could help the retailer surmount logistics problems.

Lenoir resident Carl Marcus Nivens, 32, a suspect in a vehicle break-in outside the store, was “actively shooting” at police Sgt. Brett Ingram, who returned fire, killing Nivens, Learner said. Learner, district attorney for Burke, Caldwell and Catawba counties, said he made his conclusions after reviewing multiple video accounts of the shooting. He reviewed video surveillance from Walmart, body camera video from officers and preliminary autopsy photos. He also reviewed preliminary toxicology screens that indicated the presence of amphetamines and methamphetamine in Nivens, Learner said. And he read the findings of the lead investigator from the State Bureau of Investigation, he said. Learner met Friday with Lenoir Police Chief Scott Brown, Master Patrol Officer Brandon Thomas and Ingram, confirming to the officers and the department that the shooting was justified. Nivens had pulled a .38 caliber revolver from his waist band and fired at least one shot at police, Brown said in an earlier statement. Nivens ran from officers as they tried to question him about a possible vehicle break-in, Brown said. The store is in the 900 block of Blowing Rock Boulevard. One officer chased Nivens while another was positioned at the entrance/exit near where Nivens was running from police, Brown said. As he neared the exit, Nivens pulled out a gun and fired it toward police, according to the chief’s statement. “The officer giving chase was physically struggling with Nivens during this time trying to stop him,” Brown said. “The officer staged at the entrance returned fire and struck Nivens. Nivens was pronounced dead at the scene.” Other than minor injuries from the struggle with Nivens, no officers were hurt and no other injuries were reported, Brown said. Officers involved in the incident were placed on administrative leave, which is standard practice in such shootings, and returned to duty on Friday.

Mike Hanrahan, the co-founder of online marketplace Jet which was bought by Walmart in a cash and shares deal worth $3.3bn (€3bn), is a married father-of-two who lives in New Jersey. He attended St Augustine's NS and Good Counsel College before studying at Waterford Institute of Technology in the late 1990s. He worked at PwC, the largest professional services firm in Ireland, after completing his studies. A chest infection meant he couldn't take up a job in London, so instead he joined Credit Suisse where he met Marc Lore. Nine years later he joined Lore at Quidsi, which sold nappies and soap online. Lore sold the company to Amazon for $545,m. Lore, Hanrahan and another Amazon employee Nate Faust then founded Jet, which was established to compete aggressively with Amazon. Hanrahan is chief technology officer of Jet.com and helped build the algorithm which reduced prices depending on how much customers bought. The company wasn't expected to make a profit until 2020, but it has been adding 400,000 customers per month since its launch. It remains a growing but not yet profitable company. Hanrahan is also a project director of operations at Quidsi. The management team owned about 25 per cent of the business. Hanrahan said he is 'very much looking forward to continuing to build out Jet and its technology group, while working with Walmart'. Wal-Mart Stores bought Jet.com to sharpen its e-commerce abilities to better take on industry giant Amazon, and to attract more millennial customers.

Thanks for help with Berkshire Community Hall FRASER WILLIAMS 6:49 p.m. EDT August 19, 2016 Letter to the Editor (Photo: File photo) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE The Berkshire Community Association recently received a $5,000 grant from the Community Foundation for South Central New York. These grant funds, along with $2,500 donated by the Walmart/Sam’s Club Community Grant Program, were used to purchase new sturdy, lightweight tables, comfortable chairs and storage carts for the community hall. The new furnishings will positively affect many events such as weddings, anniversaries, reunions and meetings, where larger gatherings would have to borrow tables and chairs from local churches or the fire department. The Helping Hands Food Pantry, especially for their monthly seniors and holiday specials, will appreciate the new tables. The Berkshire Free Library — with its youth programs, reading and computer classes, book sales and the Blueberry Festival — will make good use of the new furnishings. The Berkshire Community Hall had been abandoned for 55 years. The restoration project began in 2006 and now hosts hundreds of events annually, including youth activities, dances and dance classes, benefits, anniversaries and weddings. A large share of this extensive ongoing project has been made possible by previous grants from the Community Foundation for South Central New York. In addition to the grant funds, Sam’s Club of Vestal donated light fixtures. The staff and members of the Berkshire Community Association and the residents of northern Tioga County express our gratitude to the foundation and the community grant program, whose generosity have played a significant role in restoring this historic treasure.

Finance Search Thu, Nov 24, 2016, 5:50 AM AEDT - Australia Markets open in 4 hrs 10 mins Wall Street closes down as Nike's gains stand outAFP – Fri, Aug 19, 2016 10:31 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3 percent on the previous day at 18,541.75, about an hour into trade Wall Street stocks ended the day in negative territory on Friday, putting the major indices down for the week as oil stocks joined Wal-Mart Stores in retreating from recent gains. But sports footwear and apparel giant Nike Inc saw shares up 3 percent, making it one of the Dow's biggest gainers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 0.2 percent at 18,552.57. The broader S&P 500 was down 0.1 percent at 2,183.87 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was essentially flat at 5,238.38. "The market continues to exhibit sideways price action but it is still an upside bias. The market just can't just sell off with any bad news," Michael James of Wedbush Securities told AFP. "None of the economic data was really market moving, nor were the Fed comments from the last meeting. They had no impact," he added. Oil stocks were in negative territory on the Dow, with supermajor Exxon Mobil Corp down 1.3 percent and Chevron 1.2 percent. Wal-Mart shares gave up all of Thursday's gain which came after the retailer posted better-than-expected earnings, despite absorbing costs from its recent acquisition of the online retailer Jet.com. On Friday the company closed down 2 percent at $72.81. Nike surged after announcing it had formed a supply-chain partnership with private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC. The deal could help the retailer surmount logistics problems. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Brexit to spark UK slowdown, blow hole in public purseAFP Brexit will spark an economic slowdown and ravage public finances, forcing a multi-billion-pound spike in state … Lufthansa scraps 900 flights Thursday as pilots extend strikeAFP Webjet signs with Chinese travel partnerAAP Dr Pepper Snapple Group buys Bai BrandsAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7390 -0.0011 -0.15% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5934 -0.0022 -0.37% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7001 +0.0036 +0.52% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Pope Francis Personal loan Aussie dollar Australia energy Kanye West Interflora Donald Trump Pet insurance Aussie weather Interest rate Australia Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Michael Sterbach, of Baldwin City, was sentenced Friday in Leavenworth County District Court for the theft that occurred in October 2013. According to prosecutors, Sterbach wheeled the bin out of a Wal-Mart in a shopping cart. Sterbach later admitted that he had done the same thing in Overland Park, Excelsior Springs and Lee’s Summit. He told investigators that he committed the thefts to support a drug habit, prosecutors said. Leavenworth County Attorney Todd Thompson said the delay in sentencing was due to the other cases Sterbach had pending. The bin stolen in Leavenworth contained an estimated $100, and the judge ordered that amount in restitution.

This year’s campaign will run from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at the Festival Foods on Northland Avenue and at Walmart on Calumet Street. More than 72 members of the AFD will fan out across the city with boots in hand as they greet people, asking them to make a donation in support of MDA. “We couldn’t be more proud to kick off this year’s Fill the Boot campaign alongside the inspiring, selfless individuals of the Appleton Fire Department Local 257 who make a profound impact on our families’ health, well-being and quality of life,” said Fundraising Coordinator Murphy Maes. “Together with their unwavering Fill the Boot support, we will raise critical funds and awareness to empower kids and adults in Appleton with life-enhancing resources and support that will open new possibilities so they can live a life without limits.” Funds raised through 2016 Appleton Fill the Boot events help MDA’s efforts to fund research and programs, such as state-of-the-art support groups and Care Centers, including the MDA Care Center at Prevea Clinic in Green Bay and the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield. They also help send more than 45 local children to MDA summer camp at Pilgrim Center in Ripon. The Appleton Fire Department raised $19,646 last year, with a goal of $20,200 for 2016.
