Credit Melissa Lukenbaugh for The New York Times Economic Trends How Did Walmart Get Cleaner Stores and Higher Sales? It Paid Its People More Can the answer to what ails the global economy be found in the people in blue vests at your neighborhood Walmart? Neil Irwin @Neil_Irwin OCT. 15, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story BENTONVILLE, Ark. — A couple of years ago, Walmart, which once built its entire branding around a big yellow smiley face, was creating more than its share of frowns. Shoppers were fed up. They complained of dirty bathrooms, empty shelves, endless checkout lines and impossible-to-find employees. Only 16 percent of stores were meeting the company’s customer service goals. The dissatisfaction showed up where it counts. Sales at stores open at least a year fell for five straight quarters; the company’s revenue fell for the first time in Walmart’s 45-year run as a public company in 2015 (currency fluctuations were a big factor, too). To fix it, executives came up with what, for Walmart, counted as a revolutionary idea. This is, after all, a company famous for squeezing pennies so successfully that labor groups accuse it of depressing wages across the American economy. As an efficient, multinational selling machine, the company had a reputation for treating employee pay as a cost to be minimized. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story But in early 2015, Walmart announced it would actually pay its workers more. That set in motion the biggest test imaginable of a basic argument that has consumed ivory-tower economists, union-hall organizers and corporate executives for years on end: What if paying workers more, training them better and offering better opportunities for advancement can actually make a company more profitable, rather than less? Advertisement Continue reading the main story It is an idea that flies in the face of the prevailing ethos on Wall Street and in many executive suites the last few decades. But there is sound economic theory behind the idea. “Efficiency wages” is the term that economists — who excel at giving complex names to obvious ideas — use for the notion that employers who pay workers more than the going rate will get more loyal, harder-working, more productive employees in return. Walmart’s experiment holds some surprising lessons for the American economy as a whole. Productivity gains have been slow for years; could fatter paychecks reverse that? Demand for goods and services has remained stubbornly low ever since the 2008 economic crisis. If companies paid people more, would it bring out more shoppers — benefiting workers and shareholders alike? Deep in a warren of windowless offices here, executives in early 2015 sketched out a plan to spend more money on increased wages and training, and offer more predictable scheduling. They refer to this plan as “the investments.” The results are promising. By early 2016, the proportion of stores hitting their targeted customer-service ratings had rebounded to 75 percent. Sales are rising again. That said, the immediate impact on earnings and the company’s stock price have been less rosy. The question for Walmart is ultimately whether that short-run hit makes the company a stronger competitor in the long run. Will the investments turn out to be the beginning of a change in how Walmart and other giant companies think about their workers, or just a one-off experiment to be reversed when the next recession rolls around? The future health of the United States economy, and the well-being of its workers, may well depend on the answer. Pressure From Investors On the morning of Feb. 19, 2015, Walmart’s 1.2 million employees across the United States gathered — many in front of their stores’ vast walls of televisions for sale — to watch a video feed by their chief executive. Doug McMillon, wearing a sweater and sitting in the office once occupied by the company founder Sam Walton, more or less acknowledged that Walmart had made a mistake. It had gone too far in trying to cut payroll costs to the bone. “Sometimes we don’t get it all right,” Mr. McMillon said in the video. “Sometimes we make policy changes or other decisions and they don’t result in what we thought they were going to. And when we don’t get it right, we adjust.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story What most store employees probably didn’t know was that Mr. McMillon and his executive team, who had been promoted into their jobs a year earlier, were under extraordinary pressure from investors. They needed to reverse a slide in business and fight off threats in all directions — dollar discounters on the low end, Amazon online, direct competitors like Target and countless rivals specializing in one slice of Walmart’s business, from grocery chains to home-improvement warehouses. People were shopping more — at Walmart’s rivals. The company offers its millions of shoppers a simple way to make their dissatisfaction known. On the back of sales receipts is a message, “Tell us about your visit today,” along with instructions to log on to a website and answer questions about the store: Was it clean? Were they able to get what they came for quickly? Were employees friendly? In early 2015, the answers that poured into Walmart’s global headquarters were, in a word, awful. The people paid to analyze the company tended to agree, too. A report by analysts at Wolfe Research in 2014 included photographs from a visit to Walmart of a sad-looking display of nearly empty bins of oranges and lemons and disorganized shelves of crackers. “Walmart U.S.’s relentless focus on costs does seem to have taken some toll on in-store conditions and stock levels,” they wrote. The analysts wryly added: “If an item is not on the shelf, you cannot sell it.” The company had been busy raising profits by cutting labor costs. The number of employees in the United States fell by 7 percent from early 2008 to early 2013, for example, a span in which the square footage of stores rose 13 percent. Some of that reflects technological advances, like self-checkout kiosks. But when Mr. McMillon and a new team came in to reverse the slide starting in early 2014, they diagnosed the problem as having taken the cost-cutting logic too far. From store managers nationwide, they heard that years of cost-cutting meant Walmart had become viewed as a last-ditch option for employment — not the place that ambitious people might want to work. They were under such pressure to keep labor costs low that the employees they hired showed little loyalty or career-building devotion to their jobs. “We realized quickly that wages are only one part of it, that what also matters are the schedules we give people, the hours that they work, the training we give them, the opportunities you provide them,” said Judith McKenna, who became chief operating officer in late 2014, in a recent interview. “What you’ve got to do is not just fix one part, but get all of these things moving together.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story That is how Walmart decided to build 200 training centers to offer a clearer path for hourly employees who want to get on the higher-paying management track. And it said it would raise its hourly pay to a minimum of $10 for workers who complete a training course and raise department manager pay to $15 an hour, from $12. It said it would offer more flexible and predictable schedules to hourly workers. The news from Bentonville made headlines worldwide. The federal minimum wage had been $7.25 since 2009, and the labor market had awarded meager pay gains for people at the lower end of the spectrum for decade, facts that helped increase Walmart’s bottom line. Now, the United States’ largest private employer — Walmart has about 2.3 million workers around the world — was signaling it was about to gingerly try a different approach, putting $2.7 billion where its mouth was. Walmart says its average pay for a full-time nonmanagerial employee is now $13.69 an hour, up 16 percent since early 2014. In the same span, consumer prices have risen 2.1 percent. Back to the Classroom On a Thursday morning in late summer, at a Walmart Supercenter No. 359 in Fayetteville, Walmart trainees followed instructors around to learn what this particular store was doing right, and wrong, on this particular day. Teresa Rasberry praised a display of University of Arkansas tailgating equipment — coolers, grills and folding chairs — complemented by a fluttering effect created by putting electric fans beneath overhead banners for Razorbacks football. Photo Teresa Rasberry, an instructor, teaches Walmart employees how to make attractive displays, like lining up bottles so they make vertical stripes of color. Credit Melissa Lukenbaugh for The New York Times “See how it pulls the eye?” she asked the trainees. “Step back and think about how the customer sees it.” Not so good was an end display of Mr. Clean, in which the various colors of the cleaning solution were jumbled together. Lining up the bottles so they make vertical stripes of color pulls more buyers in, she said. “It may sound silly,” Ms. Rasberry said, “but it works! I’ve tested it myself!” Back in a classroom, Walmart department managers discussed why a $15.86 bottle of Clairol hair coloring might be a bad fit for a store located in a place with an $80,000 average income. Women in that income bracket are more likely to get their hair colored at a salon, an instructor, Amanda Forslund, explained. This is one of the first of Walmart’s planned 200 training academies. New department managers will come in for two weeks of training covering general retail principles (customer service, inventory management) as well as specialized training for their specific area (the bakery or electronics, for example). Advertisement Continue reading the main story Walmart’s pay increases got most of the attention. But the new training and prospect of better career paths for hourly staff members could be more significant in the long term. It’s not that the retail industry doesn’t offer potential paths to good incomes. Starting pay for an assistant store manager at Walmart is $48,500, and the manager of one of its large stores can make comfortably above $100,000. The problem — described by Walmart managers and people outside the company who study labor markets — is that there is no clear path for an entry-level worker to get there. Much training is impromptu, and chains have tended to view their hourly workers as interchangeable cogs rather than resources worth investing in. That reputation has been particularly strong at Walmart. “I didn’t used to think this would be something I would want to do, to work at Walmart,” said Garrett Watts, a 22-year-old newly promoted customer service manager at a store in Fayetteville. “There’s a stigma with it. It used to be, if you worked at a Walmart, it was the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant.” Photo Garrett Watts runs customer services for a Walmart in Fayettville, Ark. He was hired at $9 an hour and now makes $13. He is setting his sights on an assistant store manager job. Credit Melissa Lukenbaugh for The New York Times He had gone to college for two years, suspended his education and was working as a desk clerk at a hotel when he switched to Walmart this year, lured not by the starting wage but by what he had heard from a friend about the potential to rise within a giant company. He was soon promoted to department manager and runs customer services for the store. He was hired at $9 an hour and now makes $13. “I wanted something that wasn’t a stopgap, but could be a real career,” Mr. Watts said. He is starting to set his sights on one of those $48,000-a-year assistant store manager jobs. ‘Step in the Right Direction’ Walmart’s announcement of what it refers to as “the investments,” made during the all-staff videoconference in 2015, became something of a Rorschach test. To macroeconomists, it suggested that a falling unemployment rate was finally creating the response that theory suggests it should: employers raising wages to attract the workers they need.

Privacy Policy To labor activists, it was a sign that political campaigns to raise the minimum wage were paying off. To Wall Street analysts, it was the company owning up to the weaknesses long apparent in customer surveys and sales numbers. And in the company’s own framing, it was about doing the right thing. “It’s clear to me that one of the highest priorities today must be an investment in you, our associates,” Mr. McMillon said in the video. Advertisement Continue reading the main story It was all of these things, Ms. McKenna acknowledged. The improving economy made it harder for Walmart to get good workers without paying more. Political momentum toward a higher minimum wage meant that entry-level pay would soon be rising in many places anyway. And executives really had concluded that customer service woes and slumping sales were because of underinvestment in employees. To some critics, though, it still amounted to a half-measure, and one framed to maximize public attention. “In our minds this is certainly a step in the right direction, but it’s typical Walmart in that it’s minimal and there’s a lot of spin on top of what’s really happening,” said Daniel Schlademan, a founder of the labor group Our Walmart, which wants the company to have a starting wage of $15 an hour. In particular, new hires typically do not receive the $10 minimum wage until they finish a training program that is supposed to take six months but frequently stretches longer. And a promised increase in the predictability and flexibility of hourly workers’ schedules is being tested in only 650 smaller “neighborhood market” stores. It has not been rolled out to the full 4,500 Walmarts. “The economic reality is that they put a great deal of pressure on managers to keep labor costs and hours down,” Mr. Schlademan said. And the actions fall well short of what Zeynep Ton, an associate professor of operations at the Sloan School of Business at M.I.T., calls a “good jobs strategy,” in which a retailer builds its entire operating philosophy around better-compensated staff members who are empowered to make decisions. Companies like Costco and the grocer Wegman’s have a base pay closer to that of what the retail activists seek and are successful by many measures. (Costco pays entry-level workers at least $13 an hour, with hourly pay reaching up to $22.50). But while Walmart’s changes aren’t as extensive as advocates would prefer, the company has shifted, in relative terms, up the industry’s pay scale. In early 2014, Walmart’s self-reported average full-time pay was 3.7 percent higher than the average hourly earnings for nonmanagerial workers at general merchandise stores calculated by the Labor Department. Now, it is 13.7 percent higher. “It’s about being competitive in the market and making sure the talent pool of applicants was the right talent pool,” Ms. McKenna said. That sounds an awful lot like a reference to the concept of an “efficiency wage.” Above the Market Rate The idea is that, sometimes, it is in an employer’s best interest to pay more than necessary to get a worker into a job. The 18th-century economic thinker Adam Smith described the need to pay a goldsmith particularly well to dissuade him from stealing from you. More recently, economists (including Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, who worked on these topics as an academic economist in the 1980s) have found evidence that people are more productive when they are paid above the market rate. Advertisement Continue reading the main story An employee making more than the market rate, after all, is likely to work harder and show greater loyalty. Workers who see opportunities to get promoted have an incentive not to mess up, compared with people who feel they are in a dead-end job. A person has more incentive to work hard, even when the boss isn’t watching, when the job pays better than what you could make down the street. Economists have found evidence of this in practice in many real-world settings. Higher pay at New Jersey police departments, for example, led to better rates of clearing cases. At the San Francisco airport, higher pay led to shorter lines for passengers. Among British home care providers, higher pay meant less oversight was needed. What is interesting about this is that, if you look at what’s ailing the broader United States economy, it looks a lot like what you would expect if employers were, en masse, failing to understand the possibility of efficiency wages. Employers have succeeded at holding down labor costs. The “labor share” of national income — the portion of the national economic pie that goes to workers’ pay, as opposed to corporate profits and elsewhere — has fallen. And average pay for nonmanagerial workers has grown more slowly than the overall economy. This has coincided with disappointing results for the economy. Worker productivity has been rising slowly for the last decade, and prime working-age Americans are staying out of the work force in droves. This implies that plenty of people don’t see jobs out there that offer sufficient pay or opportunity to make the jobs worth doing. Individually, employers may think they are making rational decisions to pay people as little as possible. But that may be collectively shortsighted, if the unintended result is less demand for the goods and services they are all trying to sell to these same people. Just maybe, in other words, employers across the country are pushing down labor costs like Walmart, circa 2014 — and this is one of the major culprits behind disappointing economic results since the start of the 21st century. “The management philosophy that became popular in the 1980s that led companies to cut pay for low-wage workers, fight unions and contract out work may have been profitable for the companies that practiced it in the short run,” said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist and leading scholar of labor markets. “But in the long run it has raised inequality, reduced aggregate consumption and hurt overall business profitability.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Customer Surveys Improve If you buy that theory — and, to be clear, it is more theory than settled fact — it means that the results of the Walmart experiment matter a great deal. That implies that if large companies were to spend more to pay and train their workers, it could create gains for the economy as a whole. And it would ultimately be better for those same businesses. Photo Kimberly Cook is an instructor for employees of Walmart, which plans 200 training academies. Credit Melissa Lukenbaugh for The New York Times So, 19 months in, what is Walmart finding? Those customer surveys that were so terrible at the start of 2015 have improved, with “clean, fast, friendly scores” rising for 90 consecutive weeks. Surveys by outside groups, like the investment banker Cowen & Company, point to more satisfied customers as well. That seems to have done the trick in reversing the sales slump. At stores open at least a year, sales were up 1.6 percent over a year earlier in the most recent quarter. That’s better than it sounds. Overall sales at general merchandise retailers are down 0.4 percent this year compared with last, according to census data. The profit landscape is less sunny. Operating income for Walmart’s United States stores was down 6 percent in the most recent quarter, reflecting higher labor costs and other new investments. The company’s stock has underperformed the overall United States stock market and an index of major retailers since the program was announced, suggesting investors are not convinced that these investments will pay a lucrative return anytime soon. Walmart Stock Has Lagged  The retailer’s share price has underperformed the market since announcing investments in worker pay and training.

You try to have the right asset. So rather than thinking about the lowest cost, the question is how do you get the best productivity.” The question for Walmart, and perhaps the economy as a whole, is whether these changes turn out to be one-off, or part of a shifting philosophy of how work and compensation should work in a 21st-century megacorporation. “Out of the gate, they’ve seen some improvement, but I think that’s because they were doing Retail 101 so poorly,” said Brian Yarbrough, a retail analyst at Edward Jones & Company. “The better question is what happens next year and the following year. The low-hanging fruit has been harvested.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. McKenna declined to be specific about what might come next. And of course in a volatile corporate world, an unexpected recession or management change, or rise of a new competitor, could upend any plans. But she suggests that the company’s changes should not be viewed as a one-time event. “This is a journey,” she said. In the short term, the Walmart experiment shows pretty clearly that paying people better improves both the work force and the shoppers’ experience, but not profitability, at least not yet. Still, here is one other nugget the company has found. The extra wages it is paying its workers don’t all go out the door on payday, executives said. Spending at the stores by employees has risen — offering a possible metaphor for what those efficiency-wage economists argue might happen across the economy, if wages were to climb.

Here's what's in store. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 14, 2016 at 5:07PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is out to prove that bigger isn't always better. The world's largest retailer issued its yearly capital expenditure plans last week, and they reveal a stark slowdown in new store additions. In fiscal 2018, which begins next February, the company will add just 55 Wal-Mart locations in the U.S, marking its slowest store growth in more than 20 years.  Of those new locations, 35 will be Supercenters and 20 will be Neighborhood Markets, down from 60 Supercenters and 70 Neighborhood Markets this year and 69 and 161, respectively, last year. The retailer will also open just 4 new Sam's Clubs next year, down from 11 this year and 13 in fiscal 2016. Internationally, the company's expansion will continue at the recent pace with about 200 new stores to be opened. In the same report, Wal-Mart said earnings would be flat next year, sending the stock down 3%. The times are a-changing  While the market seemed to greet the company's strategic shift with skepticism, there are several reasons why slowing down new store openings seems like the right decision. Since taking the helm in 2014, CEO Doug McMillon has repeatedly said that the company needs to invest to improve performance at current stores and boost its e-commerce capabilities. Over the last two years, the company has done just that, raising minimum wage to $10/hour and spending money to clean up stores, eliminate out-of-stocks, and bring back greeters. As a result, customer satisfaction scores are up and comparable sales have increased for eight quarters in a row. In the most recent period, comps improved 1.6%, its fastest pace in several years. Wal-Mart is dialing down its capital expenditures in the U.S. from to $6.8 billion last year to $6.4 billion this year to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2018. Instead of spending to open new stores, the company is "increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels, and other customer initiatives." With overall e-commerce sales increasing by about 15% a year in the U.S., Wal-Mart has recognized that it's better off leveraging its current store base rather than opening new stores as its real estate is not nearly as crucial in the e-commerce era, especially when the company already has stores within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. Having already saturated the country with stores, investing in remodels and e-commerce is the best use of the retailer's investment dollars. The nitty-gritty Wal-Mart made noise earlier this year with its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, ramping up its e-commerce position, but making its stores more appealing is just as much a key to its strategy. As McMillon said, "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly." Over the last 18 months, the company has been testing components such as layouts, signage, and front ends, and it's planning on remodeling 500 of its stores next year and adding online grocery pickup to another 500.  Wal-Mart's online grocery pickup program has been perhaps the company's most successful innovation in recent years. The retailer now allows customers to order groceries online and pick up them up at kiosks in store parking lots at scheduled times for no extra charge. The program, now offered in hundreds of stores and dozens of markets, has proven exceedingly popular and is a hybrid of physical and e-commerce retail that Wal-Mart is best positioned to offer. By the end of next year, it will have online grocery pick-up in more than 1,000 stores, or about a quarter of its national footprint. So called click-and-collect has been successful enough to prompt Amazon.com to launch its own chain of convenience stores, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal this week. The bottom line for Wal-Mart is that with a comparable store base of more than 4,000 locations, the company is better off driving profitability by increasing comparable sales and building out its e-commerce channel.  With about $300 billion in sales from its U.S. stores, just a 1% swing in comparable sales would add $3 billion in revenue and $750 million gross profit. The average supercenter generates about $80 million in annual revenue, meaning the company would have to open 38 new stores just to equal the effect of a 1% uptick on comps on revenue -- and many more to match the effect on gross profit -- as comparable sales are a much more efficient way to increase profitability. Wal-Mart investors may be disappointed to see flat earnings growth once again next year, but the company is making the right moves to position itself for continued growth into the future. With a massive store footprint, improving its in-store experience and enhancing e-commerce will allow it to grow profits in fiscal 2019 and beyond.

Based on the impact of America’s Biggest Health Fair, held by Walmart last year, the company is again hosting the largest single-day health event in the nation, with free health screenings expected to benefit hundreds of thousands of people, some whom may be taking an active role in their health for the first time. The newly named Walmart Wellness Day will take place from noon to 4 p.m. lOct. 15, in more than 4,600 Walmart stores across the country. The event will provide free blood glucose and blood pressure testing, vision screenings (where available), product samples and information on health insurance options. Additionally, more than 10,000 of Walmart’s licensed pharmacists will offer immunizations in all Walmart pharmacies in the US. Walmart set five world records with last year’s single-day event for the most: Blood pressure, glucose and vision screenings – more than 280,000 screenings were conducted Immunizations – nearly 52,000 administered Food samples – more than 2 million free samples of healthier foods were distributed to customers Nearly 3,000 customers were advised to visit their health care professional based on their blood glucose screening results 1.7 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention More than 7,000 reports of high blood pressure detected About 75 million American adults (32 percent) have high blood pressure—that’s 1 in every 3 adults, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention “The cost of health care in America has risen to more than $3 trillion, but the health of our customers is something we can’t put a price on,” said George Riedl, senior vice president and president, Health and Wellness, Walmart U.S. “As more than 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, we’re committed to and uniquely positioned to provide accessible and affordable healthcare that helps busy families live better. Walmart Wellness Day is at the center of that commitment. These screenings provide customers with a basic yet vital understanding of their general health conditions and ways to improve them.” Walmart has conducted thousands of health screenings over the past several years, some of which may have had lifesaving results. Last year, a Walmart pharmacy manager in Everett, Penn., reported that one patient’s readings during the wellness event were so alarming that she went immediately to the emergency room where she was treated for a hypertensive emergency. Her family, her doctors and the patient were all extremely grateful for Walmart’s clinical intervention. During Walmart Wellness Day, companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Gojo, BD, Pfizer, US Nutrition, Bausch & Lomb, Clorox, Bayer, 3M, Kellogg’s, GSK, Tums, Chile Avocadoes, Dannon, Uncle Ben’s and Vega will be instore providing customers with free product samples.  For the third year, Walmart is working with DirectHealth.com to help customers identify their health insurance needs, compare coverage options and enroll in the plan that is right for them. The customer open enrollment program for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans –Healthcare Begins Here –will be available Oct. 15 – Jan. 31, 2017, in more than 2,300 Walmart stores, online and via phone.

More: If spanking taught me anything, it's that spanking doesn't work The unnamed shopper was waiting to pay for her items at register 11 in the Payson, Utah, store when she went into labor. According to the store manager, Dustin Haight, she "insisted on paying for her merchandise" before she had the baby. Yes, that's right. Despite being "in distress, on her knees holding her stomach," the mom-to-be wanted to settle all monies owed before having the baby, right there in the Walmart checkout line. Anyone who's ever given birth will recognize this for what it is: amazing. Any woman who is able to do anything beyond curse and writhe around in agony when those labor pains hit deserves major respect. Can you imagine how efficient she is at home?

Yes — but not in a Walmart checkout line. It wasn't only the mom who got an unexpected surprise in Walmart Sunday. Apparently, the staff has had a real morale boost following the birth, and are planning a ceremony for the new arrival — believed to be a boy — as part of a grand opening later this month. The company is also going to gift diapers, formula, clothes and a birthday cake to the family. Register 11 has now been dubbed "register baby" — good for pregnant women approaching their due date to know just in case they want to avoid it.

People gathered for a public session hosted by Tom Valenti, developer of the planned Mission Gateway project, heard plenty Thursday night about the retailers that got away. But the audience of about 75 reserved their biggest reaction to the one they were happy to let go, Walmart. “We’ve been at it for a long time as you know,” Valenti said. “Our plan is to replace Walmart with several smaller retailers.” The room at Sylvester Powell Community Center erupted in applause. Walmart announced at the beginning of the month it was dropping out the development. Valenti, who has been pursuing the project since 2005, had seen the retail giant as the economic engine to power the rest of the development. But despite his attempts to make the 155,000 square-foot Walmart store fit in with the original mixed-use plan envisioned for Mission Gateway, it faced stiff public opposition in Mission. “I got the message in April when it was clear the voters did not want Walmart,” Valenti said, referring to the Mission election that shifted the City Council against the retail giant. Later in the meeting however, Valenti listed retailers he has tried to line up to replace Walmart who’ve said no including Costco, J.C. Penney, Trader Joe’s, Crate and Barrel, Macy’s, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl’s and Steinmart. Valenti, who has developed other shopping centers around the country, said the current retail market is in flux, with many stores no longer expanding or contracting. He declined to identify the potential tenants he’s negotiating with, except to say one would definitely be a grocer, the others are computer-related, sporting goods “and a few other things as well.” The only definite ingredient in the $180 million project at this point is a 150-room Aloft hotel and 50-room Element extended stay hotel planned for the corner of Roeland Drive and Shawnee Mission Parkway. The hotels would have two fine dining restaurants on the first floor. Valenti also is confident about 200 apartments will be developed along Roeland Drive and Johnson Drive in three-level buildings with first floor retail or restaurants. “The market for the apartments will be people who want to be in the area and near the Plaza but not as expensive as the Plaza,” he said. A swimming pool planned for the hotels also will be available to the apartment dwellers. And Valenti said if he could line up a tenant, he would still like to build an approximately 50,000 square-foot office building east of the hotel. That led to another one-that-got-away moment. “In 2012, we were 24 hours away from signing a letter of intent from AMC,” he said, referring to the movie chain’s headquarters. “As the last minute, they decided to go to Park Place.” The audience was there to listen and recommend what they wanted to see at the development. Valenti said he’d tried almost all the retailers suggested, but promised to continue working them. “If you’re anxious to get this going, I’m a thousand times more anxious,” he said. “My hope is for a spring start.” Comment Categories : Development, Mission Gateway Previous Post Next Post Comments Comments Related Construction under way on Market Lofts apartment project in downtown Overland Park Roeland Park in discussions with potential tenants for old pool site New residential development plan submitted for old Leawood Country Club property Spotlight on Local Rowan Property Management Rowan Property Management is a full-service property management company, handling single & multi-family homes, condominium complexes, and apartment buildings throughout the greater Kansas City Metropolitan area.

How the World’s Biggest Costume Maker Cracked Halloween Howard Beige, co-owner of Rubie’s, knows your 10-year-old wants to be Jigglypuff. He knows you secretly want to go as Harley Quinn. He can even predict the next president—usually. By Claire Suddath | October 14, 2016 Photographs by Emiliano Granado Video by Ali Withers From J.J. Abrams needs a favor. It’s six weeks before Halloween and he’s in search of a very specific Star Wars costume, in a very specific size, that’s sold out online. Abrams may have directed last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but when a friend’s daughter wants to be the warrior Rey for Halloween, he still has to track down a costume like a normal person. But of course a normal person wouldn’t have an assistant who can call up Howard Beige, executive vice president of Rubie’s Costume Co., the largest costume maker in the world and the manufacturer of roughly half of all the Halloween costumes sold in the U.S., including all the Star Wars ones. Abrams’s assistant reaches Beige as he pulls up to the Rubie’s factory in Queens, which is churning out rush orders for sold-out costumes. Sitting in his cluttered Mercedes with a drink-stained cupholder and a bag of Famous Amos cookies in the glove compartment, Beige notes the size Abrams is looking for and promises to have the costume sent over right away. He then walks into the facility, where 100 women are frantically sewing purple pants and blazers for Joker costumes from the 2008 movie The Dark Knight. “They have their thumb on the pulse of what people want” If you’ve ever dressed up as a movie or television character for Halloween, the costume you bought was probably made by Rubie’s. The odds drop a little with generic characters like witches or vampires—plenty of smaller companies make those—but with more than 20,000 costumes and accessories for sale at retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and Party City, Rubie’s has probably played a part in your Halloween festivities. What started in 1951 as a soda shop/novelty store in Queens has, over the past 65 years, grown into an international business that earns hundreds of millions. (It doesn’t disclose figures, but the analytics firm IbisWorld estimates $251 million in revenue in the U.S.) Rubie’s has 3,000 employees, contracts with 12 factories in China, owns four factories in the U.S., and runs six large warehouses, four on Long Island, one in Arizona, and one in South Carolina. Rubie’s has also spawned 15 subsidiaries in countries such as Japan, the Netherlands, and the U.K. It sells Carnival costumes in Brazil, Day of the Dead dresses in Mexico, and Easter Bunny and Santa Claus suits around the world. But in America its bread and butter is still Halloween. The company and the holiday have enjoyed a relationship not unlike a happy marriage: The success of one fosters the growth of the other. “Halloween is not the same holiday it was even 10 years ago,” Beige says, with a smile. “I like to think we had a hand in that.” Americans will shell out a record-breaking $8.4 billion on Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations this year, according to the National Retail Federation. That figure has jumped almost 70 percent in just 10 years, making Halloween the second-largest holiday in terms of decoration sales, behind Christmas. In the process, it’s become age-proof. “What was once a kid’s holiday has become something that most adults now participate in, too,” says Lesley Bannatyne, a historian and the author of Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History. Nearly half of all American adults will dress up this year, twice as many as 30 years ago. Candy and costumes are cheap enough that Halloween is also largely recession-proof, as well; sales actually increased in 2008 because, as Beige puts it, “almost anyone can buy a $9 mask from Walmart.” But figuring out what that mask should be, and how many to make, isn’t easy. More people are dressing up for Halloween, but they’re doing it differently, picking costumes in early October based on news events, movies, or internet memes that went viral only a few weeks or months before. Rubie’s tries to anticipate Halloween trends a year in advance, but it’s constantly adjusting its plans as expected blockbusters flop (The Legend of Tarzan), beloved actors die (Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka costume will be popular this year), or millions of people get swept up in the Pokémon Go craze and Beige finds himself mass-manufacturing last-minute Pikachu costumes to fill thousands of back orders. Pokémon will break into Rubie’s 10 best-selling costumes this year, which didn’t happen when it was popular the first time around. “Thank God we already had the license and the designs for that one,” he says. “Otherwise, it would’ve been a disaster.” At 58, Beige has thinning gray hair and a smile that never seems to fade. He has retained enough of his Queens accent that when he complains about his waistline, his version of “yuuuge” sounds just like Donald Trump’s. He co-runs the family-owned company with his older brother Marc and sister Maxine (another brother has retired), but while his siblings focus on finances and customer accounts, Beige plays the part of affable costume enthusiast, sweet-talking Hollywood studios into letting the company design outfits based on their movie characters, then persuading stores to carry them. “Howie is one of the most passionate people with regards to his company and the quality of his products of anyone I’ve ever met in this business,” says Pam Kaufman, chief marketing officer and president of consumer products at Nickelodeon. “They have their thumb on the pulse of what people want,” says Danny Gurganus, co-owner of Danny’s Trix & Kix, a 17,000-square-foot costume shop in Spring, Texas. He estimates that Rubie’s accounts for 60 percent of his sales. “What are we going to do? Not sell to Walmart?” Rubie’s is named after Beige’s father, Rubin, who opened the soda shop and novelty store with his wife, Tillie, in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens in 1951. Rubin Beige had once worked for a furrier, so when he noticed that the funny masks and hats he carried were selling well, he whipped up a few costumes—cowboys, angels, witches—that people could rent for parties, theatrical productions, and of course Halloween. Soon he was selling them to other stores. “Years later I found out that there was a word for that: wholesale,” says Howard, “At the time, we just thought of it as selling stuff around town.” By the time Rubin died, in 1972, the soda shop had become a full-blown costume company, pulling in $100,000 a year, most of it from high-quality rental costumes that cost stores about $300 to buy and people about $30 to rent. The newly widowed Tillie divided the company equally among her four children and told them that if they couldn’t make it big enough to support four families, she’d sell it. “So that’s what we did,” says Beige, who was then still in high school. Beige officially joined Rubie’s in 1975. At just 17 years old, he spent the summer visiting costume shops around the country, selling his wares from a pop-up clothing rack he kept in the trunk of a Dodge Colt. He later upgraded to a motor home, which he toured in for another six years. He showered in campgrounds. He was robbed outside a Howard Johnson in Redwood City, Calif. (“Wigs all over the parking lot!”) And he ultimately persuaded hundreds of costume shops to buy from Rubie’s. “Howie used to park that thing in our driveway,” says Terrie Frankel, 71, who owns Frankel’s Costume in Houston and was one of Rubie’s earliest customers, “and I’d bring him bagels and lox for breakfast.” Beige’s motor home tours coincided with a significant shift in the way Halloween was celebrated. In the 1970s, people stopped renting costumes in favor of cheaply produced wear-once items. The top manufacturer of these disposable outfits at the time and into the ’80s was Ben Cooper, a company that licensed movie and TV characters, then turned them into children’s costumes that rarely looked like the originals. Star Trek, for example, became a $3 Captain Kirk mask and plastic jumpsuit with a picture of the Starship Enterprise on it. “I actually went to Paramount and said, ‘This is ridiculous,’ ” says Beige. In 1989, he pitched the company’s executives on an adult-size replica of a Star Trek uniform. “I showed them a beautiful reproduction of the actual uniform Captain Kirk wore with the pips on the collar and the patch. They said, ‘What about the mask?’ I said, ‘The people who buy this costume want to be Captain Kirk but as themselves.’ ” He got the license the same day. Rubie’s began to pitch other rightsholders, picking up licenses for Barbie (1993), Star Wars (1994), Nickelodeon (2000), and Marvel (2014). It also gobbled up competitors: a by-then-struggling Ben Cooper (which came with Hanna-Barbera’s and DC Comics’ licenses) and novelty maker Forum. When Rubie’s doesn’t have a license, it produces look-alikes: Rival company Disguise carries the official Snow White costume, but at Rubie’s you can buy a suspiciously familiar red-blue-and-yellow dress and go as “Cottage Princess.” The team of enchanted seamstresses, with Beige, at Rubie’s Richmond Hill, Queens, factory. Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek Costumes are big business for studios. Not only are they essentially free marketing—a little girl dressed as Rey reminds all her friends just how cool Star Wars can be—but they generate a nice chunk of change without requiring much work. “I mean, come on, we’re a kid’s network, we have to have Halloween costumes—it’s the second most important time of the year for us outside of the [winter] holidays,” says Nickelodeon’s Kaufman. “Rubie’s goes to great lengths ... to make sure the right costume is available,” says Kelly Gilmore, senior vice president for global toys at Warner Bros. Consumer Products. About 55 percent of Rubie’s sales come from licensed costumes, which average about $20 for children and $35 for adults, although it sells plenty of elaborate get-ups for hundreds of dollars. About 8 percent of a costume’s retail price goes toward studio royalties, which means the studios can expect to make tens of millions each Halloween. Warner Bros., for example, accounts for more than 3,000 different products. The largest individual license, DC Comics’ Batman, has led to all-black Batman costumes from the Christopher Nolan films, blue-and-gray Batmans from the original ’60s television show, gray-and-black Batmans from the Arkham video games, and even a line of costumes based on the 2009 comic-book series Blackest Night, in which Batman was a zombie. March’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice inspired 300 costumes, for infants through adults. Rubie’s plans its tie-ins about two years in advance. The day before Abrams’s assistant called about the Rey costume, Beige had a meeting with Lucasfilm in which the studio presented him with the general plot, characters, and sketches for Star Wars: Episode VIII, which is scheduled for release in December 2017. Rubie’s designers (who must adhere to a strict nondisclosure agreement and will not tell you what happens in the next installment, no matter how much you beg) will soon send its Episode VIII looks to Lucasfilm for sign-offs. “The studios approve concept before we start, then the prototype,” says John Clausen, Rubie’s general manager, who’s been with the company since 1979. “And they do constant sampling of production in the process.” Rubie’s has already finished costumes for next year’s Wonder Woman movie (sparkly wrist-cuffs!), Spider-Man: Homecoming (one of the costumes is designed to look homemade, like Peter Parker’s first try), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It’s also planning a 2017 line of costumes for adults and kids from ’90s Nickelodeon cartoons, such as Rugrats and Hey Arnold! The studios have figured out the hard way that if they’re too tight-lipped about upcoming movie plots, Rubie’s won’t know which characters to focus on. When Beige was planning the lineup for 1999’s Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace, Lucasfilm intimated that Darth Maul would be its breakout character, much as Darth Vader had been in the original films. “Darth Maul was about 50 percent of the assortment for Episode I costumes, but then he gets killed in the movie,” Beige says. “We did not know that.” Rubie’s wound up selling only half of its Darth Maul inventory that year because people—kids, especially—don’t usually want to be characters who wind up losing a lightsaber fight. Lucasfilm now tells him which characters live or die. Rubie’s used to manufacture all of its costumes in the U.S., because it was convenient. Halloween sales have a finite deadline, and products made in other countries often don’t make it in time. In the early ’90s most of the company’s competitors moved overseas to take advantage of cheaper labor. And unlike regular clothes, which are subject to high import duties, most costumes are considered “festive apparel” and can be imported duty-free. In 1997, Rubie’s petitioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection to change the rule but lost. As a result, the company says that to remain competitive it was forced to move about 70 percent of its production overseas, mostly to China. It wasn’t an easy transition; in 2005 a Rubie’s factory in Mexico that produced Barbie costumes was accused of flouting labor laws. A U.S. Department of Labor report found that the Mexican government hadn’t inspected the factory in years, and a separate audit by Mattel uncovered a worker who was only 15 years old, legal in Mexico but too young to meet either Mattel’s or Rubie’s guidelines. Two labor unions, each backed by a different Mexican political party, fought for power within the factory. There were protests. Rubie’s closed the plant. (Mattel and Rubie’s still work together; this year kids can go as superhero, ballerina, or bride Barbies.) Recently, Rubie’s has become frustrated with U.S. Customs again. It claims the agency is applying its festive-apparel rule inconsistently. At issue are Santa Claus suits, which Rubie’s says fall into the festive category and Customs classifies as outfits and subjects them to high taxes. According to Customs, the difference between a costume and apparel is in how it’s made. Anything “flimsy” (Customs’ term) is tax-free. The agency has decided that the company’s more elaborate costumes count as regular clothing and can therefore be taxed, sometimes by as much as 30 percent. “You can have a skeleton costume and, if it’s well made, with nice tight stitching and finished edges, it counts as apparel. The exact same design, but cheaply sewn, is a costume,” says Arthur Bodek, a partner at Grunfeld, Desiderio, Lebowitz, Silverman & Klestadt, a law firm that specializes in international trade laws. Rubie’s smallest factory churns out a few thousand costumes a day. Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek “If you say costumes are subject to a tax of X amount, we’d know what to do. But you can’t tell us one year our products are apparel and another year they’re festive,” says Marc Beige, the company’s CEO. Rubie’s is still fighting the reclassification of the Santa suits in court. The company’s four U.S. factories spend most of the year making small batches of high-end costumes, such as a $1,000 Darth Vader costume that sells to the cosplay/Comic Con crowd. The year-round convention circuit has given Rubie’s a sizable boost in its non-Halloween sales; the company has a booth at nearly every major sci-fi/fantasy convention, where Beige can talk to fans about what brands he should be licensing. Because Comic Con–goers will spend a lot to mimic their favorite characters, Rubie’s can afford to make those in the U.S. In August, though, even the U.S. factories switch to the cheaper products, so Rubie’s can take advantage of the shipping convenience. The smallest factory, behind Rubie’s retail shop in Queens, holds 100 workers—older women, mostly—who churn out a few thousand costumes a day. It’s not enough to service Amazon’s needs, but it’s more than enough to replenish a favorite at the mom and pop stores a week before the holiday. “Halloween is not the same holiday it was even 10 years ago. I like to think we had a hand in that.” Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek Last-minute orders are still the biggest challenge for Rubie’s. “I can FedEx something to an independent store’s doorstep, but with Amazon and Walmart, it has to go to their distribution centers and then out,” Beige says. Rubie’s gives big-box retailers a cutoff date of mid- to late September for shipments; smaller shops can order until the day before Halloween. But that doesn’t mean the heavy hitters don’t try to squeeze in a few late requests. In the last few weeks Rubie’s has received a wave of orders for creepy clown masks, and its South Carolina plants are currently working to fill Walmart’s frantic request for more Pokémon costumes. “People might get mad if they know we’re doing that for Walmart,” Beige says, “but what are we going to do? Not sell to Walmart?” The relationship between Rubie’s smaller and bigger customers hasn’t always been pleasant. The company used to prioritize orders based on quantity—until it realized that Amazon would always get its orders filled before everyone else. “If Joe Independent pre-ordered all his costumes in January, but Amazon comes in with an order in June that wipes us out, Joe wouldn’t get anything,” says Tom Tinari, who manages Rubie’s more than 1 million square feet of warehouse space. The company now uses a computer system that balances quantity with the timing of an order to ensure the little guys don’t get left out. Small costume shops are still important to Beige, and not just because of people like Terrie Frankel, who know him from his motor home days. They give Rubie’s on-the-ground consumer insight that large corporations just can’t provide. Every January, Rubie’s hosts an annual meeting in Las Vegas with its oldest independent clients. Representatives from about 400 stores attend. Beige debuts the company’s upcoming product line for them and asks if they’ve missed anything that customers have been requesting. “Last year, we had people ask for [the horror-themed video game] Five Nights at Freddy’s, which wasn’t a costume anyone made,” says Gurganus, the costume shop owner in Texas, “When we had our meeting in January, I told them about it.” “I’d never heard of the game before,” admits Beige. Rubie’s picked up the license and now makes a line of creepy, misshapen, stuffed-animal costumes based on the characters in the game. (This year, the ’80s-vintage, Stephen King–inspired Netflix series Stranger Things took Rubie’s by surprise; kids hoping to be the telekinetic hero Eleven will have to resort to Etsy, until next year. The same goes for Ken Bone, the undecided voter whose mustache and red sweater provided the only feel-good moment in the second presidential debate.) The company also maintains three retail stores in New York—each the size of a city block—that it uses as test laboratories for costumes it has yet to put on the market. It’s tricks like these that have helped Rubie’s stay more or less in step with what people want. This year, Beige has noticed that more people are buying costumes as a group. Families are dressing in themes. (Rubie’s isn’t the only company to pick up on this: Children’s clothier Chasing Fireflies also offers several upscale Halloween costumes for families.) Millennials never really stopped dressing up for Halloween, Beige points out, and now that they’re starting to have their own kids, their parties have become less about getting drunk and more about family fun. “It’s the biggest change I’ve seen in a generation,” he says. And it’s causing Rubie’s to rethink the way it sells certain types of costumes: “Anything that can be a theme—superheroes, Star Wars, Wizard of Oz—is getting more popular.” For all Rubie’s attention to cultural shifts, some of its costumes are fairly retrograde. Target may have eliminated gender designations from its toy aisles, and the Disney Store’s online shop now calls all its Halloween costumes simply “for kids,” but the “girl” versions of Rubie’s outfits still have flirty skirts, even when they’re creatures that don’t wear clothes, like Pepé Le Pew, the Looney Tunes skunk. Women’s versions of superhero costumes are often skintight Lycra dresses, worn in its catalog by models in stilettos. There has been some pushback on the gender type-casting; women have started going as male superheroes instead of their feminine (and often less famous) counterparts. “We now make a female Iron Man costume, even though there isn’t really a female character in the movie,” says Beige. “Of course, sometimes they just buy the men’s version anyway.” Sexy schoolgirls and kittens, which peaked in popularity in 2006, started falling out of favor during the recession and have never recovered. Rubie’s still holds the Playboy license and offers everything from French maid outfits to a black-and-white-striped minidress that passes for a very unrealistic football referee—but every year they become a smaller part of Rubie’s business. Halloween is the second-largest holiday in terms of decoration sales, behind Christmas. Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek This year’s presidential election falls just eight days after Oct. 31, and a certain orange-faced candidate has upended costume trends. Beige used to claim that during election years he could determine the winner based on which candidate’s mask sold best. Bill Clinton’s beat George H.W. Bush’s, George W. outsold Al Gore, and almost nobody wanted to be John Kerry or John McCain. This year, though, all bets are off. “Two things are happening that make this election different. One, people are dressing up as Trump to both make fun of him and support him,” says Beige, who likens the Republican nominee’s costume-related popularity to the plethora of Sarah Palins in 2008. “Two, women don’t generally wear masks—they’ll do face paint—and how many guys are going to go as Hillary?” As far as masks are concerned, Trump is beating Hillary in a landslide. His bloated, rubbery face hangs above the door at Rubie’s retail shop in Queens, next to Bernie Sanders, Chris Christie, both Clintons, and a now dated Bernie Madoff. But among the families and couples shopping on a Saturday evening less than a month before Halloween, Trump inspires little more than the occasional snicker or finger-point. A group of college-age dudes don’t even notice him; they’re too busy triggering the motion sensor that animates a man sizzling in an electric chair, one of the mechanical decorations peppered throughout the store for ambience. The figure spasms as terrified people scurry by. There’s also a 15-foot-tall giant that cackles, a cigar-wielding clown that sings classic rock, and a head-spinning Linda Blair in mid-exorcism. “Honey, that’s not Supergirl, that’s Catwoman,” a mother explains to her daughter, who’s dragged her by the hand into the children’s superhero aisle and is eyeing a stretchy black bodysuit with accompanying eye mask — one of the few girls’ costumes that doesn’t have a skirt. “You said you wanted to be Supergirl.” “But I want to wear this!” the little girl says. “You don’t even watch anything with Catwoman in it,” her mom says, perplexed. Nearby, pre-teen girls swarm the Pokémon display while a couple bicker over which superhero duo they’re going to be. (He wants them to go as the Joker and Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad. She hasn’t seen the movie and thinks they should be Superman and Wonder Woman.) A family of five contemplates matching Minion costumes from Despicable Me. The aspiring Catwoman is still begging. Her mother sighs and takes the costume off the shelf. “Are you sure about this?” she asks. The girl nods. They walk to the register.

She’s not Hannah Montana, but she’s also not a wild and crazy girl who will do anything for attention, she says. It’s been a struggle to discover who she is, and to portray that to the world, because she said she never felt comfortable fitting into any “boxes,” and it felt like everyone wanted to categorize her. She feels that she, along with most humans, is beyond categorization, according to Yahoo. She is actually balanced and introspective, she says. Her partying days are over. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” At just 23-years-old, that statement seems like it would come from a much older person, but Cyrus said she’s been in the world of show business her entire life, playing Hannah Montana and selling a line of clothing at Walmart that was branded Hannah Montana. But when Walmart found out that Cyrus smoked marijuana, they let her clothing line go, she said. “It was Walmart or weed. And you see what I did — I chose the weed.” According to Variety, Cyrus had a difficult time making sense of her sexuality because she was raised in a southern, traditional household. “My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and s–t never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand.” [Image by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images] She said it was difficult at the time to identify with anyone, because she didn’t feel like a boy or like a girl, unlike her ultra-feminine mother. Her mother loves all aspects of femininity, but Miley could not relate, even though at the time, the world was trying to make her the poster child for girlhood on the show Hannah Montana. “My mom is like an ’80s rock chick — big blonde hair, big boobs. She loves being a girl. I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I f—–g hated it. My nails look like s–t. I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a “P” that should happen, for “pansexual.” According to The Daily News, “pansexual” is a term that means you are open to every possibility. Jennifer Bass, communications director at the Kinsey Institute, a prominent research center on human sexuality, says that “calling oneself pansexual is to open yourself up to every human possibility.” [Image by Rob Kim/Getty Images] Miley says she is neutral — neither straight or gay. What she is definitely not neutral about is her feelings for Donald Trump. She says she is a big Bernie Sanders supporter and she says she thought that Donald Trump running for president was just a joke that would not amount to anything big. “This is not a dig. But I do think there’s something that goes with the Kardashians and Trump. The Kardashians are better than Trump, because they are not trying to run the country. They are just trying to be famous, and that’s fine. We are obsessed with celebrity. When Trump started this, I was laughing. I thought it’s not going to go anywhere; there’s no way he’ll be the candidate.” Now that he is the candidate, however, and Bernie Sanders is out, she minces no words about people who don’t support Hillary Clinton. “That’s f*****g crazy and you’re out of your mind. It’s literally p*****g me off more than anything. If you could ever consider Donald Trump, you never understood Bernie in the first place.” [Featured Image by Theo Wargo/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Dream Kardashian Is Already A Social Media Sensation Now Read This: Lil Wayne Dances To Politically Upset Fans At Flog Gnaw After Race Incident Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Amy Schaeffer Tags: Miley Cyrus Bernie Sanders Supporter, Miley Cyrus dislikes Trump, Miley Cyrus pansexual Comments LATEST HEADLINES 2016 College Football Playoff Rankings: Predicting Top 4 Teams After Week 11 Action Reince Priebus Named Chief Of Staff By Donald Trump In Controversial Move NBA Trade Rumors: Shaquille O’Neal Hints Demarcus Cousins on Trading Block ‘Steep’ Beta Opens Up To Everyone November 18 Prior To December 2 Release Date Stahl-Trump Interview: Up To Three Million Deportations, Special Prosecutor For Clinton Possible [Video] L.A.

File photo by Rich Sugg rsugg@kcstar.com i By Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Mission Gateway developer Tom Valenti started a meeting at the Sylvester Powell Jr. Community Center on Thursday evening by telling a crowd there what had been announced the week before: No more Wal-Mart. That elicited a hearty round of applause from the gathering of about 50 people in Mission. Wal-Mart’s decision to abandon the long-stalled Mission Gateway project gives Valenti’s plans some semblance of renewal: Residents by and large didn’t want the ubiquitous retailer and made their feelings known at several public meetings over the years. The tone of Thursday evening’s meeting marked a departure from those previous meetings where Valenti typically encountered criticism. Instead, residents offered their ideas and shared a dialogue with Valenti. Valenti, the Syracuse, N.Y., principal with the Cameron Group who has tried for more than 10 years to get development started at the 16 acres between Shawnee Mission Parkway and Johnson Drive, told Mission residents about his challenges with the project over the years, as well as his hope for the future. First, the future: Valenti said he wants to start construction next spring on a project that replaces a 155,000-square-foot Wal-Mart store with three smaller retailers. Many aspects of his previous plans remain the same — apartments, restaurants, an Aloft hotel and an Element extended-stay hotel. Valenti said he’s pursuing a grocery store, a sporting goods shop and a computer-related shop. “But that could change,” he said. He didn’t name the potential tenants. An office building is possible, but Valenti said he would need a tenant to agree to occupy at least half of it before he could obtain financing. To make the project happen, Valenti said he needs a combination of tax increment financing and a community improvement district — two development tools that redirect taxes generated by the project to reimburse the developer for certain costs. Valenti suggested that he may need general obligation bonds, which would require the city to pledge its credit behind the project and cover debts if Mission Gateway underperforms. “I wish I didn’t have to ask for it, but I have to ask for it,” Valenti said. “I hope we’re not going to need general obligation bonds.” Such incentives would require Mission City Council approval. Mission Mayor Steve Schowengerdt said the council’s appetite for general obligations bonds will depend on how much is requested. “It would not be my first choice,” he said. Valenti recounted the long history of his experience with Mission Gateway since the old Mission Mall was demolished. He described near misses, like the time he said he came within 24 hours of signing a letter of intent to relocate AMC Entertainment Inc.’s corporate headquarters from downtown Kansas City. AMC decided in 2011 to move to Leawood’s Park Place development instead. And then the issue of Wal-Mart, which he once said would be the “rocket fuel” to finally get Mission Gateway going but instead became a touchy subject among Mission residents. Mission residents didn’t want the retailer, and Roeland Park leaders didn’t want to lose their Wal-Mart store and all the tax revenue it generates for the suburb’s budget. “I understand the applause about there’s no Wal-Mart; however, Wal-Mart is the world’s No. 1 bricks-and-mortar retailer, they’re the No. 1 retail credit, they’re the No. 1 employer,” Valenti said. “I understand the misgivings about Wal-Mart. Please understand, though, we had a lease signed with Wal-Mart and the City Council had approved the plan with the Wal-Mart in it. We had a signed lease and I had an obligation. They didn’t back out and, quite frankly, I may not be the smartest guy in the world but I got the message back in April when it was clear the voters did not want Wal-Mart.” In Mission’s April elections, a slate of candidates opposed to the Wal-Mart-anchored development won seats on the Mission City Council, stacking the deck against Valenti’s plan. Wal-Mart later pulled out of the development and opted to renovate its Roeland Park store. Valenti recounted a number of retailers that he has pursued for the site — Trader Joe’s, Kohl’s, Menard’s, many others — that have all said no. Valenti said he had been in negotiations with Costco, the wholesale retailer, but that plan did not come to pass. Still, he said he continues to work with several retailers. After addressing the crowd for nearly 90 minutes, Valenti thanked them for their time. And he got his second round of applause of the evening.

For a complete gallery, click here http://gocards.com/galleries/?gallery=3041 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- It was this kind of night at Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium -- the train whistle guy was getting the shakes. He was going through withdrawal. He was lunging to pull the cord and people had to hold him back. Somebody get this guy some points. Forget style points. The Cardinals just needed some of the regular kind. They weren’t in position to be picky. I don’t know about the other Experts, but I spent all week talking about Louisville putting up Oscar-red-carpet style points, and now I was sitting here watching People of Walmart. When we last saw the Louisville football team, it was scoring 26 points against a top-five defense at Clemson -- in the second half. In this game, there are just over six minutes to play and the Cards get the ball up 17-14. Forget style. At this point, they’d wash your windshield for some points, anything. It's the fourth quarter of a home game and we still have to pay attention? What the heck? Louisville coach Bobby Petrino looked like a guy making a visit to the Geek Squad with his X-box controller. “Look, I keep pushing A and B, and my quarterback doesn’t spin and run away from everybody. This thing is defective.” Not just that, but this is Duke. It hasn’t been so long ago that Duke went to court in Frankfort, Ky., to argue that its football team was so bad that backing out of a contract to play Louisville did NOT constitute damage to Louisville. And it won. Now Louisville’s on the verge of having to obtain a protective order to safeguard its status as a Playoff Contender. I mean, Louisville was a 34-point favorite. Lamar Jackson is the Heisman Trophy Frontrunner. This game was prime time. An ESPN audience. The last time Louisville played at home, Lee Corso was just outside the North end zone putting on the Cardinal head and doing the Tomahawk chop. Louisville beat Florida State 63-20. It went to Clemson and the GameDay guys were there again. Crap. Where are the GameDay guys? Lee? Kirk? Can you hear me? This isn’t how it’s supposed to work. “That was a day of work right there, and the first thing you have to do is take your hat off to Duke and their game plan,” Petrino said after the game. “They did a great job of keeping the football, shortening the game, working the clock.” How good? These Duke guys worked the play clock like they were taking the LSAT. They used every second. Louisville had the ball for only 2:45 in the second quarter, but still ran only six fewer plays than the Blue Devils. The Cardinals were like the guy in the U-Scan line behind a person who is not, technically, sober. Duke lounged around between plays. It checked its text messages. At one point, I’m pretty sure Duke quarterback Daniel Jones ran over to Wagner’s. It was the kind of keep-away stall game that Dean Smith would’ve been proud of -- had anyone but Duke been running it. Duke coach David Cutcliffe knows a little something about football. His team may be banged up, but he always brings a full deck in the coaching department. “The best defense against Lamar Jackson and all of that offensive talent is for them to watch us make first downs,” Cutcliffe said. Duke did that. In fact, 46 percent of its yardage came on third down. Louisville did its damage -- 203 of its 469 yards -- on first down. After the game, I listened to Louisville fans on the elevator: “This was bad for our playoff hopes. What do you think we’ll do in the rankings?” Here’s an honest answer: I don’t know. But I don’t think they decide playoff stuff in the third week of October. I don’t think your ranking after six games is set in stone. Beating Duke by 50 would’ve guaranteed nothing. But this Duke team wasn’t coming into Louisville and losing by 50. It played a good, solid, disciplined game. It was a break or two away from putting more than just a scare into Louisville. Sometimes that happens. Sometimes the other guys play well. And then, sometimes, you’re not your best. Those nights just happen. Some nights, everything is just a little off. On third and short on the second series of the game, Louisville ran one of those Petrino specials. Play action. Jackson sold it. Duke bought it. He was standing there with the ball, and tight end Keith Towbridge was standing in the flat, wide open. Towbridge was on Floyd Street. Duke’s defense was somewhere on Fourth Street. Easy play. But Jackson held the ball a beat too long. A Duke defender broke free to pressure him, and Jackson overthrew Towbridge by several yards. The punting unit came out. Some nights it’s like that. This was one of them. Sometimes your sophomore quarterback makes sophomore quarterback plays, even if he is the Heisman frontrunner. Sometimes your defense, ranked seventh in the nation in third-down stops, struggles on third down. Sometimes the crowd is just a little off. I wasn’t going to say anything, but the coffee in the press box was lukewarm. It happens. This Louisville team is going to be trying to live up to its performance and statistics of the season’s first four games for the rest of the season. Some nights it will. But some? I don’t know if any team could live up to those every night. Some nights, your quarterback is only going to go for 325 yards and two touchdowns. Some nights you’re not going to average 10 yards a play. Some nights you have to count on a defensive end like Drew Bailey, who had 11 tackles, 7 solo, 3 for a loss. The fun thing about this bunch is that in a game that likely few will remember a month from now, Jackson still had plays you can’t forget -- flicking the ball 50 yards in the air on the run for a completion, stopping in the backfield when rushed, reversing course, evading defenders and basically outrunning the entire defense to gain 19 inexplicable yards. “Yeah, I think every season that you win games and you have a good season, there's going to be one or two games that are very close and difficult and hard,” Petrino said. “I know that from over the years there's been games you go in and you think okay this is going to be a high-scoring game, and it's a low-scoring game. Or this one's going to be a defensive thing and it ends up being both offenses score a lot of points. You never know what's going to happen until you go out and play and that's why you play the game.” We can talk all we want about style points and running the table the rest of the way and all that. These players have to go out and do it. Perhaps we underestimate at times the roller coaster they’ve been on. They went from just one of the guys to the most popular kid in school in the course of a month. Lamar Jackson went from nearly obscure to Heisman hype and being talked about on Jimmy Fallon in about four seconds. That Clemson game ended and in some ways, Christmas was over for these guys, and it was time to pack away the lights and get back to work. Petrino said he didn’t think his team was suffering any kind of hangover from all that, but it would be hard not to. “I don't feel that way because I didn't see it in practice,” he said. “I thought our guys did a good job in practice and got well-prepared for the game. I like the way we went about our business yesterday at the hotel and today in the walk-through and I feel like we were ready to play. We didn't blow them out, but we did win the game.” Petrino knows perception is always going to be a factor. You’ve got four playoff spots, a bunch of teams vying for them, little margin for error, and weekly discussion of the horse race. But here’s the fact: If Louisville plays impressively all season and wins out, I don’t think it’ll come down to what happened against Duke that determines its ultimate fate. And if it doesn’t play impressively and win out, it won’t matter anyway. Either way, the Cardinals need lots of help. If you want to know how concerned Petrino was with style points, consider the game’s final 32 seconds. Louisville got the ball at the Duke 35. Petrino could’ve taken at least a couple of shots at the end zone. He didn’t. And he shouldn’t have. Jackson downed the ball, and that was that. Petrino knows everyone will talk about style points. “I think that's the reality of where we're at right now,” he said. We've got to understand that, but again our objective is to go win, keep ourselves in it and I think we did that. I think we'll be all right, we've just got to go play better.” Consider the alternative to winning. Think about what might have been. Duke forced a 46-yard field goal attempt -- which Louisville missed -- with 1:59 left. Can you imagine if that play had stood, if Duke had gotten a game-tying field goal or worse, the questions facing Petrino after calling that reverse that lost seven yards on first down after the Cards got to the Duke 17? Whew. People always remember the play calls that don’t work. They rarely remember the ones that worked great -- but weren’t executed. Instead, a Duke defender rolled into the leg of Louisville kicker Evan O’Hara, the Cards got the ball back, Petrino called two plays, held down on the right trigger on his X-box controller and Jackson sprinted into the end zone. The train whistle guy, finally, could pull his cord for some of the good stuff, and Louisville survived and advanced, style points or not. Copyright 2016 WDRB Media. All Rights Reserved.

Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian Rupert Jones Saturday 15 October 2016 02.01 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger The stock market hitting an all-time high this week spells good news for thousands of people participating in company share schemes – and they are not all fat-cat chief executives and board direectors. Saturday, 15 October, is a key date for about 139,000 postal workers who received free Royal Mail shares when the business was floated on the stock market in October 2013. Each full-time employee initially received 613 free shares, which were automatically put into an employee share scheme. Under the rules, Saturday is the first day that the postal workers are free to sell their shares if they wish, and those who do stand to make approximately £3,000 apiece, based on this week’s Royal Mail share price of around 490p. Meanwhile, supermarket giant Asda this week revealed that its share ownership schemes have effectively delivered more than £750m for staff since the first one was launched in 1982. More than 22,800 Asda employees took part in the company’s Save As You Earn (SAYE) scheme which matured in July this year, giving them the chance to buy shares in the company’s American owner Walmart for a knockdown £37.27 a share. That’s the equivalent of around $45 – and this week Walmart shares were at around $67. Between them, 22,855 Asda staff have benefited from a £56m payout from the latest scheme, equating to a profit of just short of £950 per worker, a spokesman said. Royal Mail and Asda are among scores of big-name companies that operate employee share schemes – others include Tesco, Morrisons and drinks group Diageo. Malcolm Hurlston, chairman of the Employee Share Ownership (Esop) Centre, says the great thing about broad-based employee share ownership is that “everyone in a company – from the boardroom to the shop floor – is able and incentivised to acquire shares in the company for which they work”. Probably the best known and most popular of these schemes is SAYE, also known as Sharesave. With this, workers have the right (known as an option) to buy shares in their company at a price fixed at the outset. This price can be up to 20% less than the share price when the plan was set up. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Taking part in the Sharesave scheme is a great way for me to put aside a bit of money each month and share in the success of TSB.’ Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty Images Workers save between £5 and £500 a month over three or five years, and at the end of the period can use the accumulated money to buy shares at the fixed price. If at that point the share price is lower than the discounted price, you don’t have to buy them – you simply get all your savings back. That’s why this scheme has previously been described as “win-win”. However, you used to get a tax-free bonus added to your cash, but the SAYE/Sharesave bonus rate –which is set by HM Revenue & Customs – is currently set at zero, which means you won’t receive any interest on your savings. In other words, you could have got a better return by putting your cash into a savings account or doing something else with it. Big cuts in store for Royal Mail and Post Office workers' pensions Read more There are now almost 1.5m SAYE accounts held in the UK, according to employee share group ProShare, and they have delivered bumper returns to many ordinary workers. For example, in August 2014 almost 23,000 BT employees – most of them call centre staff and engineers – benefited from a £1.1bn SAYE scheme payout. Their built-up savings could be used to buy BT shares for just 61p each, which is pretty good going when you consider that BT’s share price the day before the scheme matured was 388.5p. Based on that price, the average gain for those selling their shares immediately was an impressive £41,674 per employee. However, there have also been cases where companies have offered schemes that have left workers disappointed because the share price has fallen below the option price. Many household-name businesses offer SAYE schemes. For example, TSB’s latest one, a three-year savings plan, closed to applicants on 22 August. When it matures, staff will be able to buy shares in TSB’s parent company, Spanish bank Sabadell. These are listed on the Madrid stock exchange and priced in euros, although the staff are saving in sterling. The option price, 77.68p, was based on the average closing Sabadell share price and euro/sterling exchange rate for the first five days of August, to which the bank applied the maximum 20% discount. This week, Sabadell’s share price was around €1.15, or £1.04. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Tara Bridgeman. Tara Bridgeman, who works at a TSB branch in Barnet, north London, says: “Taking part in the Sharesave scheme is a great way for me to put aside a bit of money each month and to share in the success of TSB. It was easy to set up and is flexible, as I can choose how much money I save and have the option to take a payment holiday if I need to. It’s also helpful that it’s taken directly out of my salary before it hits my bank account so I’m not tempted to spend it.” The history of the British co-operative movement - timeline Read more Another popular type of scheme is the share incentive plan (SIP), introduced in 2000, which offers several different ways of getting shares. There are just over 1m SIP accounts in existence, and this is what Royal Mail used for the free shares it gave to its workers in 2013. With a SIP your employer can give you up to £3,600 of free shares in any tax year, but you have to hold them for at least three years. At the Royal Mail, the company’s flotation in October 2013 was highly controversial because the government sold 60% of the business for 330p a share, only to see the price immediately shoot up. But whether the workers should sell their shares is a very different matter. Crucially, if they cash them in any time soon, they will have to pay income tax and national insurance contributions (NICs) on their value – ie, 20% tax and 12% NICs for a basic-rate taxpayer. Under SIP rules they will have to wait another two years before they can sell these free shares completely free of income tax and NICs. There are two other approved share schemes in use in the UK: the company share option plan (CSOP) and enterprise management incentives (EMIs). The first of these gives you the option to buy up to £30,000 of shares at a fixed price – but Hurlston says CSOPs are “in pretty sad decline”. In 2013-14 there were 1,280 live CSOP schemes, down from more than 5,000 in 2000. By contrast, EMIs are on the rise, with nearly 10,000 companies using them, according to the most recent official figures. EMIs are mainly used by small, fast-growing companies that perhaps aren’t able to pay huge salaries right now, but want to keep hold of their staff by promising them “jam tomorrow”.

Garbett Homes is in charge of developing the residential section of the property and presented their proposal to the neighborhood in a meeting last night to get feedback.   "I like it, I like getting homes over there, single family dweller's, rather than more apartments," said John Hill. John Hill lives across the street from the school.  He has lived in the neighborhood since 2000 and has been there through all the proposals that have come up.  The most recent was a proposal to place a WalMart there.  That proposal was met with strong opposition from neighbors and was vetoed by the mayor a few months ago. Neighbors were concerned it would generate too much traffic to an already busy area and increase criminal activity.    Garbett Homes plan is to build about 80 single family homes in the area south of the school's parking lot.  They say at last night meeting -- where about 50 people showed up -- their plan had strong support.  He says many people were concerned about what would go in the commercial lot of the property because a WalMart is proposed to go up in the next 3 years.  Unfortunately, for those neighbors, Garbett Homes is only developing the residential area.  The commercial area is being handled by Wasatch Property and residents say they have yet to see a proposal from them over that lot. "Wasatch isn't ready to do any announcements or releases about their plans," said Jacob Ballstaedt with Garbett Homes.  "I think they're still thinking working out details." Granite High School closed its doors in 2009.  Since then residents have wanted to preserve the building because of its history.  In February, the city discussed changing the property's zoning which allowed only residential living.  In 2011, the city tried to pass a bond to develop a community center but it failed.  There was also an attempt to turn the area into green space.  Ever since it closed residents have reported seeing vandalism and criminal activity near the school. While many today said they are sad to see it go and would have preferred to have the building preserved and turned into a community area they're ready to see something there rather than just vacant buildings.  "Hopefully it improves the area which single family housing should," said Hill. Neighbors are still waiting to hear what will come from the commercial area.  Residents have said they are anticipating a WalMart to go up -- even though they don't want it -- but they hope it's not a full scale facility. "If they put a neighborhood WalMart, I'd be OK with that," said Hill. Garbett Homes will have a busy couple of weeks to put their plans into action. "We're gonna make a submission to the committee, plan to do that sometime next week and we hope to be in front of the planning commission in the first week in November," said Ballstaedt. Hill says after attending the meeting, speaking with Garbett Homes, and learning more about their plans and intentions he says he's on board with the proposal.  He says as long as they stick to their proposal and do as they say they have his approval, but, he adds he still has many more questions.  Garbett Homes says they will be having follow up meetings with the community to talk about the next step as the proposal moves forward.   ABC4 News reached out to South Salt Lake Mayor, Cherie Wood, for comment about the proposal.  Her office said they had no comment at this time because it was still in the early stages of the process.   Copyright 2016 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Turner turns ground at Crawford Crossing Justin Much , Stayton Mail 4:02 p.m. PDT October 27, 2016 Turner Mayor Gary Tiffin (Photo: Special to the Stayton Mail) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE A pitch to its appeal will sound something like this: minutes away from the freeway, the state capital, a Walmart and Mill Creek Industrial Park, yet nestled into a semi-rural setting with a rolling-hill backdrop where you may find deer grazing in your front yard. Add to that living in a community that emphasizes quality of life – with a well-regarded school district to boot. But that scenario description is still down the road. What is currently transpiring is Turner’s long-awaited Crawford Crossing development is breaking ground. The project, in one manifestation or another, actually dates back a couple of decades and once included a vision for a much larger scale of development, and a ritzier one as well. STATESMAN JOURNAL Turner development could see 200-plus homes, new park The subdivision breaking ground this past week calls for 203 single-family homes, 131 apartment units and a 40-acre public park surrounding a 70-acre lake situated at the northern end of Turner. In some respects, the recent recession and its concurrent economic downturn may have inadvertently turned a favor to the city of Turner. “What would have been a gated community is coming together instead as a neighborhood,” Turner City Administrator David Sawyer reflected on the initial “Turner Lake” plans juxtaposed to those now unfolding with Crawford Crossing, LLC. “We’re really excited about this project; we think it’s going to be good for everyone involved,” said Richard Fry, Crawford Crossing’s property manager. Fry envisions it as a win for Salem as well as Turner, stressing the prime location just minutes from the capital city’s border. In Turner, the setting is one of growth and the limited opportunity or availability for it elsewhere in the city as the bulk of its vacant land lies within Crawford Crossing borders. “The project will allow us to grow and become a more financially sustainable city,” Turner Mayor Gary Tiffin said. Sawyer agreed: “Absolutely. It’s very hard to expand a city when 90 percent of all buildable (vacant land) is in that project, so it’s critical that this thing is finally happening.” STATESMAN JOURNAL Turner Lake development plan unfolds The road to the first turning of ground was a detailed one, in no small part due to the number of entities involved. In addition to the city, permits needed approval through Marion County (road permit), Department of State Lands, DEQ water quality, Army Corp of Engineers, along with a FEMA flood-plain revision permit. “This is a heavily-permitted project,” Sawyer said, itemizing the list and purposes of each.  “There were all these independent permit components to go along with all the city requirements to get the land-use decision done. That finished in January, and it took the next six months to get all the other permits.” Those six months were mere current history tied to this land and its broader development. Riverbend Sand & Gravel began operating its mine at that site in 1996, an enterprise that generated $200,000 of revenue for the city in the decade or so of its operation, more or less a franchise fee for the operations and locking up of all that land. Much of that revenue served to develop vital sewer infrastructure. “The money was to help provide sewer,” Sawyer said. “It did help build the system and kept rates low for awhile, but processing costs and debt service have made rates increase substantially. This new project will help stabilize rates by spreading costs over more users.” In 2008 the site was closed, the land was reclaimed and the excavated pit was allowed to fill with water in preparation for this land development. Informally dubbed "Turner Lake," the body of water has been likened to Staats Lake in Keizer. “Some see it as a big political gain,” Sawyer mused. “But that land has been a part of building Turner’s future, and now it’s going to be an integral piece as we develop the park and lake. We have 20 years into this piece of property.” It wasn’t originally deemed a 20-year venture; the economy inserted an obstacle to the initial post-quarry quest. That quest envisioned 500 homes and substantial commercial development. The economic slide hit and the project stalled around 2009. "Every subdivision that wasn't being built at the time essentially went on the shelf," Sawyer recalled. Even as the recession eased, other factors served to scale down and change the complexion of the project, including land-use issues that pared the number of dwellings and nixed commercial components. Public elements developed within newer proposals included pathways for pedestrians and access to the lake. "(There is) huge added value to the project to the public; none of those were on the table six years ago," Sawyer said. "There is a lot more value for the community in the long run, but still a lot of assets for the developer as well." Fry said project plans call for three phases, and the first phase aims for buildable lots by 2017. “We have approvals and are just starting to do the dirt work,” he said. “We’re hoping we’ll have approved lots by May.” The target is 67 lots in addition to an apartment complex in that phase. No timeline has been set for the next two phases as yet. As part of the planning for this site, Turner officials will be working in partnership with University of Oregon’s Community Planning Workshop to create a long-term vision for the park and lake space. The city will also be leading a public-safety planning process for the lake itself. jmuch@StatesmanJournal.com or 503-769-6338, cell 503-508-8157 or follow at twitter.com/justinmuch Crawford Crossing development in Turner plans for 203 single-family homes, 131 apartment units, a 40-acre park surrounding a 70-acre lake.  (Photo: Courtesy of City of Turner) Buy Photo Turner City Manager David Sawyer.  (Photo: JUSTIN MUCH | Stayton Mail, JUSTIN MUCH | Stayton Mail) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://stjr.nl/2eC615F TOP VIDEOS Willamette University students hold rally in opposition to Trump 0:36 Sherwood at Sprague Football Highlights 3:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Dog with leg defects takes first steps after surgery 0:29 CCTV's Sunset at Sprague Football Highlights 1:38 Student with Down syndrome achieves dream to be a cheerleader 1:26 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 'Thrill the World' in Salem 1:19 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 More Stories 180 GOP leaders denounce Trump's comments: Track your region Oct. 10, 2016, 6:38 p.m.

Crowley Updated 10:18 pm, Friday, October 14, 2016 Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Thomas Smith Thomas Smith Police: Albany officers' actions in shooting followed law 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany The city police department cleared two officers involved in shooting out the car window of an alleged bank robber, a man who had gained national attention earlier this year when he was fired from Wal-Mart. On Sept. 14, Detective Robert Lawyer and Detective Sgt. Patrick Donnelly were trying to arrest Thomas Smith, 53, of Albany, on Green Street. Smith allegedly backed his car toward Lawyer, who opened fire, according to police. The gunshot blew out the window of Smith's car, but he was not seriously injured. Police conducted an internal investigation and found Donnelly and Lawyer's actions "were within the policy of the Albany Police Department and in accordance with the law." An Albany rights activist, however, says the report is short on detail. Smith was in the news in November after he was fired from his job at Wal-Mart for redeeming $2 in empty cans left unclaimed outside the store. Smith said he was never told he could not take unclaimed cans, but Wal-Mart officials said it was theft. A GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign raised more than $21,000 for him. Smith was on parole for a 2002 robbery of a KeyBank branch in Latham and had served more than 13 years of a 15-year sentence before he was released last year on parole.

On Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at approximately 1:00 p.m., Albany police Detective Sergeant Patrick Donnelly and Detective Robert Lawyer observed Thomas Smith, 53 of Albany, inside of a vehicle on the 200 block of Green Street and attempted to take Smith into custody in connection with four separate bank robberies that occurred in the City of Albany between July 29th and September 12th, 2016. Smith became the suspect in the robberies following a thorough investigation by Albany police detectives who followed up on several leads using surveillance footage, gathered evidence and obtained information from witnesses. On Wednesday, September 14, at 12:56 p.m., detectives received information that Smith's vehicle was traveling on South Pearl Street and shortly thereafter, observed the vehicle heading southbound. As Smith stopped his vehicle on the 200 block of Green Street, detectives exited their vehicle and attempted to effect Smith's arrest for the four robberies. As Detective Lawyer was approaching Smith's vehicle from the rear, Smith, who was still in the driver's seat, accelerated his vehicle in reverse towards Detective Lawyer. Believing his life was in danger Detective Lawyer fired a single shot ceasing Smith's actions. Smith was subsequently taken into custody. He was not shot or injured during the incident. The investigation has found that Detective Sergeant Donnelly and Detective Lawyer's actions were within policy of the Albany Police Department and in accordance with the law. Albany police suspected him of four recent bank robberies in the city between July 29 and Sept. 12. The case is still pending and Smith remains in jail. On the day he was arrested, Smith said he was parking his car. Smith made almost daily visits to employees at The Center for Law and Justice on Green Street who had helped him during his dispute with Wal-Mart. "I was backing up and this guy just popped out and I heard boom and the window blew out," Smith told the Times Union in an interview from jail in September. "Thank God the bullet missed the back of my head." During the jail house interview, Smith said he started using drugs again recently after a fight with his father sent him into a depression. He maintained his innocence, but he acknowledged that he used some of the money raised during the Wal-Mart dispute on drugs. The police press release said the detectives had received information that Smith was in the area and saw him stop on Green Street. The detectives left their vehicle and tried to arrest Smith, according to the statement. "As Detective Lawyer was approaching Smith's vehicle from the rear, Smith, who was still in the driver's seat, accelerated his vehicle in reverse towards Detective Lawyer. Believing his life was in danger Detective Lawyer fired a single shot ceasing Smith's actions," the statement said. The shooting happened on the same block as the justice center. Alice Green, executive director of the justice center, said police statement on the shooting provided little detail on how the officers tried to arrest Smith. Witnesses told Green that the officers were in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car, so it was unclear how Smith would know they were police. "If the police officer was not in uniform, if the police officer was in an unmarked car, people don't understand why police thought he was trying to run him down," Green said. "It doesn't provide the community with enough information about the incident and why it was necessary to fire the shot. We are just thankful that no one was hurt or killed." ccrowley@timesunion.com • 518-454-5348 • @townstu • http://facebook.com/cathleenFcrowley Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Walmart Video Gaming Rollback Sale Deals from $2 + free...

Teams of investigators from the Jefferson County Regional Financial Crimes Task Force, which is headed by the office of District Attorney Brandon Falls and the U.S. Secret Service, fanned out Friday morning armed with search and arrest warrants at the businesses, which serve as pawn shops and provide payday loans and check cashing. The Financial Crimes Task Force includes Vestavia Hills, Birmingham and Mountain Brook police, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart and Target. Pelham police and the Shelby County District Attorney's Office also took part in today's arrests. At 10 a.m., officers descended on stores in Jefferson and Shelby counties, handcuffing employees and seizing dozens of boxes of business records and stolen goods. "The investigation uncovered organized retail theft and purchasing of stolen property that reached into the hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Falls said. Jefferson County District Attorney Investigator Chris Clark and Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Raulston said the investigation began about three months ago when retailers realized hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise was being boosted off the shelves. Fitbits, iPads and other "smart products" were disappearing from Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreen's and Home Depot. Investigators from those stores teamed up with federal and Jefferson County authorities to launch Operation Get Fit, which culminated in today's roundup. What they found was the stolen items being sold to the dozen of stores owned by Shelby County resident and business owner Steve Scott. Scott's home, as well as 12 of his businesses were hit Friday. Vestavia Hllls police Capt. Kevin York said the retailers provided undercover officers with goods to present as stolen to the businesses owned by Scott. "The new, in-the-box property was presented as stolen,'' York said. "The clerks knew it was stolen when they took it in." "Fitbits is what got it started but I saw a little bit of everything,'' he said. "This is a big operation. It's a million-dollar business." As of 4:30 p.m., investigators were only halfway through inventory on the stolen items recovered today, and said they've already documented a half-million worth of fenced goods. The businesses raided were: Cash 101, 3183 Pelham Pkwy.; Check Exchange, 1415 Pinson Valley Pkwy.; Cash Plus, 615 19th St. North, Bessemer; Cash Max, 3569 Pelham Pkwy.; Check Exchange, 9541 Parkway East; Cash Max,  Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive, Hueytown; Cash Max, 1205 Ashville Road, Montevallo; Check Exchange, 1240 Forestdale Blvd.; Cash Max, 602 Springville Road; Scott's Jewelry and Pawn, 4673 U.S. 280; Cash Max, 825 9th Ave. North, Bessemer, and Scott's Jewelry and Pawn, 608 Springville Road. Those arrested face felony charges ranging from theft to receiving stolen property. They are: Steve Scott, 58; Shannon Norwood, 46; Cynthia Graves, 38; Taylor McMonigal, 27; Latonya Graham, 38; Tara Vincent Tate, 34; Sheila Kennebrew, 51; Tamika Williams, 39; Serena Parker Garrett, 34; April England, 36; Talitha Warren, 34; Latonya Jack, 31; Nathalie Alarcon, 26; Atasha Beam, 31; Cody McBride, 32; and Sarah Vickers, 38. Falls said he is pleased his office could be a part of the investigation. "This is a great example of cooperation between police departments, federal agencies, private businesses and what they can accomplish together,'' he said. Investigators spent all day collecting and documenting evidence. York said the public can expect to see more investigations like Operation Get Fit. "It hurts everybody because the retailer passes the losses on to the buyers,'' he said. "They have to make up for what they've lost, and that causes everybody to pay more. That affects you, me, everybody."   Most Read Active Discussions About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office Lt. D.R. Johnson said the department responded to the store at 2:45 p.m. after a Walmart employee found the message. As was the case Oct. 4, management had already evacuated the store when deputies arrived on the scene. Virginia State Police, Blacksburg Police Department and Virginia Tech Police Department responded with K-9 units to sweep the stores for explosives, but nothing was found. The store was able to resume operations around 6 p.m. Both threats are being investigated by the sheriff’s office. Johnson expressed gratitude to the assisting law enforcement departments, as well Dublin Fire Department. Written by: Editor on October 14, 2016.

RELATED: Texas man who allegedly hid meth in ear smiles in mugshot A woman who is nine months pregnant and her husband were shopping for a baby crib at the location when a young man with a beard approached them in the parking lot and said “something to the effect of ‘give me all the money or I’ll shoot you,’” according to the affidavit. The suspect lifted his shirt to expose a handgun and the woman’s husband yelled at the man, prompting the suspect to flee the scene. Police obtained surveillance video from both locations and were able to collect images of the suspect and the vehicle he was driving, which were released to local media. Investigators received a call from a woman who believed her son, later identified as Zarate, was the suspect in the two alleged attempted robberies. Police said Zarate admitted to using a BB gun during the crimes, which was obtained as evidence in the case. The gun was a black Umarex 40 XP carbon dioxide airgun, the affidavit said. RELATED: Knife fight in downtown S.A. lands 2 men in hospital Police also learned that Zarate had taken his mother’s silver Kia minivan throughout that weekend the robberies occurred. Investigators were able to obtain the clothes he allegedly wore during the robberies, as well, according to the affidavit. Zarate also confessed to performing the crimes, according to police, saying that he thought people would assume the gun he was toting was a real gun. If convicted, Zarate faces five to 99 years or life in prison for each charge.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The true cost of Brexit hit home for U.K. shoppers as Unilever’s iconic Marmite spread and a host of other products remained absent from Tesco Plc’s online store Thursday because of a standoff over price increases triggered by the Brexit vote. Britain’s biggest supermarket chain said Wednesday that it’s “currently experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products,” and aims to have the matter resolved soon. Unilever, which reported a decline in third-quarter sales volumes Thursday, told analysts that it was “confident” the issue would be resolved quickly, noting that the U.K. accounts for just 5 per cent of its business. The dispute lays bare the close ties between Tesco and its third-largest supplier, which produces household brands like Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and was Tesco Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis’s longtime employer. Unilever, along with other consumer-product makers like Nestle SA, is facing heightened sourcing costs from a plunge in the pound since the June vote to leave the European Union, yet passing those expenses along to retailers will be difficult with U.K. grocers already locked in fierce competition. “Tough price negotiations are a constant factor of the relationship between food manufacturers and retailers, and are going to be very tough in the U.K. following the Brexit vote,” Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note. “But they rarely break out in public or lead to de-stocking of manufacturer products.” Top customers Tesco is Unilever’s third-biggest customer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co., accounting for 2.3 per cent of its revenue, according to Bloomberg data. The Guardian newspaper has reported that Unilever wants to raise prices by about 10 per cent because of the fall in sterling. Among Unilever’s brands to exit the Tesco web store were Persil detergent, Flora margarine and more than 100 products in the Dove range of body care. A check of Tesco.com Thursday morning showed the products were still unavailable. “Retailers’ margins are already squeezed,” Justin King, former CEO of J Sainsbury Plc, said at an event hosted by Bloomberg in London on Wednesday. “So there is no room to absorb input price pressures and costs will need to be passed on.” The Brexit vote has affected pricing of products ranging from floor coverings to toilet paper. Unilever was among companies that lobbied voters to remain in the European Union, while supermarkets including Tesco took a more neutral stance ahead of the vote in a bid not to alienate either faction of consumers. Sainsbury and Wm. Morrison Supermarkets Plc declined to comment on their relationships with Unilever. Wal-Mart’s Asda unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The question is whether Sainsbury, Asda, Waitrose and others are taking it on the chin or if they will play hardball too,” Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, said in a note. “What about other suppliers — Unilever is probably not a one-off trying to pass on higher input costs.” Chocolate, cheese Food companies such as KitKat maker Nestle and Swiss dairy concern Emmi AG have both said they will look to raise prices in the U.K. to respond to the plunge in sterling. Nestle is due to report third-quarter sales Oct. 20. “The margin in the U.K. will be lower next year than this year or last year, that’s for sure,” Emmi Chief Executive Officer Urs Riedener said on Oct. 6. “We’re obliged to push price increases in most of the segments.” Any dispute between Tesco and Unilever would be particularly touchy for Lewis, the Unilever veteran. Tesco has sought to improve relations with its vendors in the wake of an accounting scandal and criticism from a grocery industry regulator. The tussle also risks damaging Unilever’s reputation as a good corporate citizen, an image that Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman has sought to enhance in recent years. “This sort of standoff benefits no one,” said Bryan Roberts, an analyst at researcher TCC Global. “Unilever will lose market share by not being in Tesco, and shoppers will feel a huge degree of frustration. A speedy resolution would be in everyone’s best interests.” Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

The child was at Wal-Mart in Clayton around 8:20 p.m. when she stopped breathing.  Johnston County EMS responded to the Wal-Mart parking lot for a report of the child having a medical emergency.  On the scene they found the young girl not breathing. Paramedics worked for more than an hour trying to save the little girl’s life without success. No foul play is suspected but Clayton Police are investigating. Officials say they are awaiting toxicology reports as part of the investigation. Photos by John Payne Update (3:22pm Friday): In an email, Town of Clayton spokesperson Stacy Beard said the child may have had a previously existing medical issue.  The girl went into Wal-Mart with her family. Upon returning to their SUV her family noticed the child began having trouble breathing and called 911. Beard said there were no signs of neglect or foul play at the scene nor after an autopsy.  Clayton Police are still investigating the incident.  The child’s name has not been released.         Johnston County’s #1 Local News Source Email event information to Events@JoCoReport.com General Questions: Email our staff at Info@JoCoReport.com News Related Questions or Issues: Email our News Desk at News@JoCoReport.com Want to advertise with us?

BUILDING WEALTH Kiplinger's Wealth Creation Web Conference Series Advertisement Medicare Guide to Medicare Open Enrollment for 2017 What retirees need to know about choosing Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plans for next year. Thinkstock By Kimberly Lankford, Contributing Editor From Kiplinger's Retirement Report, October 2016 Get ready to be bombarded with mailings and TV ads for Medicare plans. Open enrollment for Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans runs from October 15 to December 7, so this is your opportunity to reassess your coverage for 2017. Even if you're happy with your plan, you may be taking a new drug or your plan's coverage may have changed. New plans may have entered—or your plan may have left—the business in your area. Or you may want to try out Medicare Advantage, which provides both medical and drug coverage through a private insurer. SEE ALSO: 11 Common Medicare Mistakes Average monthly premiums for Part D prescription-drug plans are increasing slightly—from $32 this year to $34 in 2017—but that masks some of the bigger cost increases. As drug prices rise, insurers are trying to manage their costs by dropping some drugs from their formularies, which list covered drugs, or passing along a larger share of the cost to consumers. Such changes could make the plan that was your best deal this year a less-than-optimum plan next year. “Some people with multiple chronic conditions don’t want to upset the apple cart,” says Tatiana Fassieux, board chair of California Health Advocates and a longtime counselor with the state’s health insurance assistance program. “But this year, we’ve found the formularies have changed significantly, not just in what they cover but also in how much they charge.” You may need to pay 30% or more of the price of expensive specialty medications—or as much as 50% if you don’t use a certain pharmacy. “Some plans have been moving cancer drugs to a higher-cost pricing tier,” says Kirsten Sloan, senior policy director for the American Cancer Society. You may even have to pay a lot more for a few generic drugs, which can cost the same as brand-name drugs under some plans, says Fassieux. The bottom line: Your out-of-pocket costs could be vastly different depending on the plan you choose. You’ll get the first clues about changes to your plan’s cost and coverage in the plan’s Annual Notice of Change, which must be mailed in late September. Then you’ll be able to compare 2017 plans using the Medicare Plan Finder starting on October 1. Type in your zip code, drugs and dosages, and the tool calculates your total costs (premiums plus out-of-pocket costs for your drugs) for each plan in your area. The best plan for you may be different than it is for your spouse. Advertisement SEE ALSO: 5 Ways to Ease the Pain of Health Care Costs in Retirement Your state health insurance assistance program can provide personalized assistance—find local contacts at www.shiptacenter.org or by calling 800-633-4227. After narrowing your search based on total costs, dig deeper to find out about any restrictions on coverage for the drugs you need. To control costs, some plans limit access to expensive drugs. They may only cover the drug with “prior authorization,” requiring your doctor to explain why you need it. “Unlike health plans, Part D plans generally have no information about your health conditions,” says David Lipschutz, senior policy attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Or the plan may only cover an expensive drug if you’ve tried cheaper versions, called “step therapy.” There may be limits on the quantity you can receive of a certain drug—even if you’ve been taking it for years. Most Part D plans now have preferred pharmacies that you’ll need to use to get the lowest out-of-pocket price. For 2016, the Humana Walmart Part D plan, for example, charges a $1 co-pay for generic drugs on its preferred list if purchased at Walmart or Sam’s Club, and a $0 co-pay through the Humana mail-order pharmacy, but a $10 co-pay at other pharmacies. For brand-name drugs not on its preferred list, you’d pay 35% of the cost at Walmart, Sam’s Club or the Humana pharmacy, but you’d pay 45% to 50% at other pharmacies. (The 2017 plan details will be available in October.) “We’ve talked to people in rural areas who have to travel 50 miles or farther to find a preferred pharmacy,” says Fassieux. Preferred pharmacies can change from year to year—Walgreens, for example, was added as a preferred pharmacy to some large plans last year. Advertisement The “doughnut hole” coverage gap is changing slightly. For 2017, after a deductible of up to $400, you’ll just be responsible for co-payments until your drug costs reach $3,700 (including both your share and the insurer’s share of the costs). Once in the doughnut hole, you’ll have to pay 40% of the cost of brand-name drugs and 51% of the cost of generic drugs yourself. TAKE OUR QUIZ: Making Sense of Medicare After your out-of-pocket costs reach $4,950 (including the 50% brand-name discount paid by the drug manufacturer), you’ll pay only 5% of the drug costs. Comparing Medicare Advantage Plans If you have a Medicare Advantage plan or are considering switching to one from traditional Medicare, this is also the time to compare options for 2017. The average premiums have been about $37 per month for the past several years, and some plans charge $0 on top of your Medicare Part B premiums. The plans with the lowest premiums generally have smaller provider networks. Compare costs and coverage for every plan in your area by going to Medicare.gov/find-a-plan and clicking on “Medicare Health Plans.” Type in your drugs, dosages and general health condition to estimate your total costs under each plan. Check the plan’s star ratings for customer service, and find out how the plan covers any care you typically receive, as well as the cost sharing for hospital stays and surgery. Advertisement Compare each plan’s maximum out-of-pocket costs, which must be $6,700 or less in 2017. “In competitive markets, you might see plans with $2,400 maximum out-of-pocket costs,” says Alan Mittermaier, president of HealthMetrix Research, which analyzes Medicare Advantage plans based on out-of-pocket costs for people in good, fair and poor health. Check out www.medicarenewswatch.com in October for the 2017 results. Ask your doctor or contact the plan to find out whether your doctors, specialists and the hospital you prefer will be covered in 2017. Find out what happens if you use a doctor that isn’t included—some plans charge a higher co-payment, while others don’t cover out-of-network providers or facilities at all. SEE ALSO: 7 Ways to Save on Prescriptions During open enrollment, you can also switch from traditional Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan. But if you decide to return to traditional Medicare after more than 12 months in a Medicare Advantage plan, medigap insurers can deny coverage or charge you more because of your health. Find out whether your state has any special open enrollment period. For more information, see The Attraction of Advantage Plans.

Young will be appearing at the Vancouver Writers Fest in October 2016. [PNG Merlin Archive] PNG Share Adjust Comment Print The Two of Us Kathy Page Biblioasis            Teardown Clea Young Freehand  Word is, the publishing industry (a business sector conscious of market demand) doesn’t invest much in, or encourage, short story collections. Alice Munro-like exceptions exist, of course, but — word is — that literary genre is regarded as a money pit. In a Walmart world, apparently, any volume of short stories is artisanal, a hand-crafted labour of love: those who seek it out will cherish it, but the majority of fiction readers desire the engagement or satisfaction or dollar value that only novel-length storytelling is thought to bring. Based on the evidence of Kathy Page’s The Two of Us and Clea Young’s Teardown, though, someone’s mistaken. These collections, 28 stories representing untold hours of art-making effort on their authors’ parts, invite us into captivating worlds. In ten-page allotments, admittedly, but still. Technically accomplished, they’re immersive, emotionally involving (the proverbial laughter through tears), and insightful. If you’re a short story reader already, here’s another pair to seriously consider. If you’re not, maybe considering giving them a taste. They’re way more satisfying than kale. For The Two of Us Salt Spring Island resident Kathy Page selected pieces that focus on pairs. Psychologically rich and cinematic in the best way, they showcase Page’s range of interests, clever setting choice, and singular eye. Usually taking place in the U.K. (where Page once resided), the stories capture assorted moments in time. For instance, just four pages, “Johanna” features the reminiscences of a man whose philosophy decades earlier had been “love often” and “don’t count on me.” Settled now, he wonders if he’d want to meet one of the children he sired. Not quite two pages, “Daddy” relates just an instant in the day of a girl who is about to begin a caving adventure with her father. Some stories envision intersecting strangers. A lovely scenario, “The Last Cut” portrays a hairdresser shaving the head of a last-minute client, a woman with cancer who then asks for his help in choosing the perfect hat. Page often examines familial and romantic relationships. “The Perfect Day” follows shifting allegiances between interchanging pairs: a daughter taking her ailing elderly father to a historical landmark with her waspish mother in tow. Her vow — “I intend to keep smiling and move on through the kind of day I want us all to have” — proves difficult to uphold. That story twins with “The House on Manor Close” and “Dear Son,” where the subtle tensions and evolved dynamics of adult children with elderly parents are portrayed with both humour and finesse. Showcasing lovers — squatters; worried expectant parents with problem DNA; former friends with benefits; an obese couple struggling with prejudice; and a marriage on the verge — Page hints at the myriad possible trajectories any romance might take. Altogether Page offers a master class in fun with numbers, in this case two. She has been longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize for this collection.  From first (“Teardown”) to last (“Firestorm”), the dozen witty stories of Clea Young’s debut collection are compelling snapshots: you want to look and then look at them once again. Like Page, Vancouver’s Young pays close attention to relationships — unsettled, post-honeymoon marital ones, in particular. Beginning with “No sex drive, post baby, body image issues (what the hell happened to her breasts)?,” “New World” is characteristic. The basic compulsion — to end a sexual dry spell and return to an earlier and more vital incarnation of coupledom — is confounded by the very changes that time’s passage has brought to the relationship. And reclaiming youth is a costly venture. Young dwells productively on the senses of loss, as in “What have we become?” and “Where’s the dynamo I used to be — before the baby, the long haul relationship, the daily grind years?” “What have we become?” and naive “We’ll ever become like them” moments pervade many of the stories, and Young’s incisive comic take on that commonly felt circumstance can be laugh aloud funny even when the undercurrent is sad or lamenting. And with children a reality or a subject for earnest debate, the tensions and “Is that all there is?” realizations mount. Ruined breasts (which appear again in “Dock Day”) are only one symptom of the larger universal malaise called Love and Marriage. A couple wandering IKEA and another one on a road trip to an undesired but obligatory wedding (while facing an infidelity-and-retaliation crisis) resound because their entanglements are so, well, relatable. Young’s stories don’t veer too far from that comfort zone, but inside it they reflect the skill and assuredness of a seasoned pro. And when she does let loose, though, as with a tale of unhinged waitresses and a sleazy boss (in “Lamb”) or a edge-of-surreal encounter on a ferry (like many of the stories, “Juvenile” is set on the west coast), she’s a capable provocateur. A talent to watch for, in other words. Young will be appearing at the Vancouver Writers Fest this month.  A lecturer at UBC, BJG’s the author of three novels, The Age of Cities, This Location of Unknown Possibilities, and From Up River and For One Night Only.

 Walmart only got 1 out of 10,000 teen votes for favorite shopping site, while Amazon got 40% Eugene Kim Oct. 14, 2016, 1:48 PM 2,409 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon is at the top of the mind for the teenage "Generation Z" demographic, who are famously picky and fickle when it comes to what they shop for. According to a new survey by financial firm Piper Jaffray, which asked 10,000 US teens, Amazon continued to be the #1 "preferred website" for online shopping, accounting for 40% of the responses. That's largely unchanged from previous surveys, as Amazon received 41%, 38%, and 36% of the responses in the past 3 semi-annual surveys, respectively. PiperJaffray Perhaps what's more impressive is that eBay is the only other non-apparel retailer in the top 10, while Target only got 6 votes and Walmart one single vote out of the 10,000 survey respondents. "For context, mindshare in our Taking Stock with Teens survey has historically not broken above the low 30% range for brands/retailers and, therefore, the fact that Amazon is maintaining at 40% mindshare is encouraging," PiperJaffray wrote in the note.

CDT October 14, 2016 Anthony Zarate booking photo. (Photo: Austin Police Department) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST AUSTIN, TEXAS - The suspect in two robberies outside South Austin businesses has been arrested and charged after his mother recognized surveillance images of him and called police, an affidavit stated. According to the arrest affidavit, police have charged Anthony Zarate, 18, in connection to the Oct. 2 robberies outside a Slaughter Lane HEB and outside the Southpark Meadows Wal-Mart. APD noted in the affidavit that the robberies happened within one hour of each other and the locations were approximately two miles apart. The affidavit states officers were first called to the HEB parking lot around 1:40 p.m. Oct. 2 by a woman who was approached by a man in the parking lot. The woman told police that the man – later identified as Zarate – asked for her purse and lifted his shirt to expose a weapon when she told him no. Zarate allegedly walked away when she screamed for help and got on her phone to call police. Police were also called to the Southpark Meadows Wal-Mart around 2:20 p.m. for a service call, the affidavit said. The victim in this incident, who is nine months pregnant, told police that Zarate approached her and demanded money while showing a handgun tucked into his waistband. The woman’s husband approached Zarate from behind and yelled at him, and the affidavit stated he ran away. According to the affidavit, police reviewed surveillance video from the Wal-Mart and observed Zarate enter the store around 1:50 p.m. and leaving approximately 20 minutes later wearing a different shirt, jacket and pants. He was also seen on surveillance video walking back and forth in the parking lot before approaching someone. The two interacted for a brief period before returning to his silver minivan and fleeing the area. APD said they were contacted by the Travis County Sheriff’s Office on Oct. 11 after Zarate’s mother called to report she recognized the surveillance images distributed by the media as her son. Police searched Zarate’s room and seized several items of clothing consistent with what was seen on surveillance video, along with an airgun Anthony claimed was used in the Wal-Mart robbery. Police arrested the teen, who later commented “in the fear of the moment you would just assume it would be a real gun” to a detective during an interview. Zarate was booked into the Travis County Jail early Wednesday morning on two felony charges of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Online records show he is being held on combined $50,000 bond.

Most Popular Samsung is normally a perennial presence on the Viral Video Chart, which tracks paid and organic views in any given week through Sunday. But these are not normal times, with Samsung's Galaxy 7 a fire hazard and its production line shut down. Its washing machines are under suspicion, too. As a result, the marketer isn't spending money to make sure people see great Galaxy 7 ads, and its videos of Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard doing laundry have lost some of their charm. And so we present the fourth consecutive Viral Video Chart without any campaigns at all from Samsung, last seen here in early September after dominating in August. Into the void, among others, comes Google -- with a new smartphone to sell.

Urban League awarded $25K grant Angelia Davis , davisal@greenvilleonline.com 9:51 a.m. EDT October 14, 2016 The Urban League of the Upstate received a $25,000 grant to support of its Workforce Continuum of Care: Cast Preparation/Broadband Fiber Optic Training Program. The grant is from the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving program and the program the money will support helps Upstate residents develop career skills before they enter the workforce. The program offers national certifications based on the in-demand occupations established by the local workforce development board. These national certifications help pave the way for new employment opportunities for the underserved and create an entry into the global economy. “The majority of job openings in the future will require some sort of post-secondary credential, leaving behind many hourly workers, and it is our vision to help bridge this gap in an effort to create a thriving community where everyone has the opportunity to live, learn and work,"  said Jil Littlejohn, president and CEO of the Urban League of the Upstate. “Thanks to generous corporate donors like the Walmart Foundation, we are making significant strides in helping to eliminate barriers to employment for entry-level job seekers," Littlejohn said. “The Walmart Foundation is committed to assisting organizations like the Urban League that help people learn the skills they need to succeed in the workplace,” said Brooke Mueller, director of public affairs for Walmart. “We are proud to support the Urban League’s critical work, strengthening communities and creating career pathways in the Upstate.” In 2015, community giving in South Carolina from Walmart stores, clubs, and the Walmart Foundation totaled $30 million. ​“Thanks to generous corporate donors like the Walmart Foundation, we are making significant strides in helping to eliminate barriers to employment for entry-level job seekers,” Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2ezLgaV TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Man explains why he is poll watching at a Greenville County Precinct 0:42 Church Burned and Vandalized in Greenville 2:17 Todd Kohlhepp's neighbors relieved he's in custody 1:17 Family dog euthanized during search 1:58 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 More Stories Paladins' Dirks makes most of first start Nov. 12, 2016, 9:33 p.m. Paladins pour it on against Catamounts Nov. 12, 2016, 9:12 p.m. Veterans Day Tribute at Upcountry History Museum Nov. 12, 2016, 8:23 p.m. Watson wanted win, not numbers Nov. 13, 2016, 9 a.m.

American Honey Going Out Film American Honey, film review: Forget Shia LaBeouf, Sasha Lane is the Star This is a movie with almost no plot beyond keeping on keeping on, says David Sexton, but Sasha Lane makes the film 4 David Sexton Friday 14 October 2016 09:04 BST We meet 18-year-old Star (luminous 21-year-old newcomer Sasha Lane) dumpster-diving in nowheresville, aka Muskogee, Oklahoma. A white van, pumping out music, full of raucous kids, drives by, parking in the local Walmart. Intrigued, Star goes into the store — and instantly forms a connection with their leader, rampant motormouth Jake (Shia LaBeouf at his most strutting yet — saying something, that). He jumps on to a checkout and, until security chuck him out, starts dancing to Calvin Harris and Rihanna’s We Found Love in a Hopeless Place. Star has. She’s hooked. Next day she joins this crew and they hit the road, first to Oklahoma City, then all over — Kansas City, Omaha and Grand Island in Nebraska, Rapid City, Williston and Pine Ridge. This crew of a dozen or so college-age kids are living in shared motel rooms, making a little money by selling magazine subscriptions, managed by Krystal, a dead-eyed, hard-bodied bitch in lurid skimpies (Riley Keough, 26, Elvis Presley’s eldest grandchild). For the next near three hours we follow these kids on the mother of all road trips, their hustling punctuated by dancing around fires, singing in the van, fighting, drinking, toking and fucking. This is a movie with almost no plot beyond keeping on keeping on — save that the exquisite focus of this film, Star, becomes hopelessly infatuated with Jake and caught up in a power-struggle over him with Krystal.  Leader of the pack: Shia LaBeouf “You think you’re special. You know I pay Jake girl money? $100 every time he finds a girl — and he fucks all of them too,” Krystal tells her. Star and Jake, both aggressive towards each other and yet fiercely attracted too, do have hot sex, in a convertible they’ve stolen, and on the grass outside a house the crew have commandeered. Briefly, they even dream of getting out of this life and buying a little place of their own (40 acres and a mule, the promise of General Sherman to freed slaves in 1865). But though each is furiously jealous of the other, their messy life on the road just carries on. There’s a fair bit of casual crime — theft from the houses of people unwise enough to let them in, people held up at gunpoint — but there are no consequences, and no police ever appear. Mostly they’re just happy, listening to loud and very offensively worded trap music (that’s Southern rap coming out of the trap of the drug lifestyle), doing drugs, drinking, letting off fireworks. The others on this crew look pretty extraordinary, totally wasted yet somehow still energetic, covered with tattoos and studs, mainly just very young, trapped in this sub-culture. But they are pretty thinly characterised. There’s a doomy girl called Pagan who obsesses about Darth Vader; there’s a guy who has a pet flying squirrel; there’s a dick who loves getting out his dick. They’re going nowhere but they have their team spirit, kept up by all these violently assertive, filthy-mouthed, thumping songs about sex, money, aggression and choices. American Honey: an exclusive report from the London Film Festival Gala Premiere Towards the end, they harmonise to the differently sentimental anthem American Honey by country and western outfit Lady Antebellum (“nothing’s sweeter than summertime/ and American honey”) and you think here at last is the film’s closure. But no — there’s another wild, drunken, druggy bonfire party and more crashing trap. It is to a large extent massively extended MTV — and your reaction depends largely on whether you care for this music. The director of this extreme American road trip, however, is British, Andrea Arnold (Wasp, Red Road, Fish Tank, Wuthering Heights). You might almost say a tourist then? In more than one sense. For although now 55, she remains not just concerned with life for those on the fringes of society, as in her previous work, but patently committed to being down with the kids. That’s ultimately what this film is about, what it is for, for those viewers who have proclaimed it one of their films of the year already: real — yet safely proxy — teen outsiderdom, rule-breaking, discovery and revelry. Arnold based this film, which she wrote as well as directed (although clearly much is improvised on a 2007 New York Times article, Door to Door: Long Days, Slim Rewards, about these travelling sales teams), so it has a factual basis, or it did back then. And she made it by scouting non-professional actors (12 or so out of the main cast) and taking them on the same road trip depicted in the film, living in cheap motels for two months and working with a minimal crew. They filmed sequentially too, to allow the story and characters to evolve in almost documentary fashion.  PrettyFamous | Graphiq Yet the greatest allure of this movie is the astounding, weaving, ever mobile cinematography of Arnold’s regular cameraman Robbie Ryan, easily a match for the dancing hand-held work of Emmanuel Lubezki for mystic Terrence Malick and showy Alejandro G Iñarritu. Ryan is right in the midst of these kids as they party and dance, and even more so in that crowded van with them all the time, not breaking the shot. It seems a real physical feat when, for many movies made in planes or trains (yes, that one), never mind vans, they have to be recreated as sets in enlarged form to make any sustained interior filming possible. No less remarkably, Ryan has found amazing depth and richness of colour and contrast in his journey across these states, from derelict shacks to palatial estates, oil fields to truck stops. It’s often beautiful just as photography, even if not taken any further as narrative. Arnold’s repeated insertion of images of natural life — insects, especially, birds, even a bear — are even more obviously derivative of Malick and seem intrusive. Star has a proclivity for releasing trapped insects: heavy-handed symbolism in an otherwise spontaneous-feeling film. Never mind. The film (in a tight 4:3 format) remains focused on Star, all the way on her journey. You’re on it with her, simple as that. Actually, there’s a point where she and Jake are having sex on the grass when you think they might ask the cameraman to give them some space.

She makes the film: she is not just remarkable-looking, she has her own way of making it seem that every moment she’s there, it’s her time, what happens matters. That’s a gift — and without her, American Honey would not be half the film it is. For otherwise it needs you as a viewer to be as captivated by Shia LaBeouf’s displays (smashing up the room when he thinks Star has been with someone else, showily motorbike riding, etc) as the heroine is herself. Not so easy. American Honey’s flaw is that it has no reason to begin where it begins or to end where it ends, if ever. It just goes on. And the meaning, the perspective on these kids, dancing on without consequences, as if youth itself were a guarantee? Perhaps it is just the director’s own party — so what’s to ask?

Deputy Sees Homeless Woman Walking Downtown Street in Her Bare Feet, Takes Her Shoe Shopping Inside Edition 14/10/2016 Deborah Hastings © Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. The woman, who was battling drug addiction, was trying to get her life back together. Tulsa County Sheriff’s Officer Brandon Hendrix doesn’t think he did anything extraordinary. “It’s just a pair of shoes,” he told InsideEdition.com Thursday. Not to thousands of people who have seen an online photo of him standing next to a barefoot homeless woman at a Walmart check-out line. Some 35,000 have viewed that image, making Hendrix a bit of a local hero in a town that could use some positive feelings directed at its law enforcement officers.   Hendrix, 43, had just left the department’s downtown headquarters when he saw a woman walking down a street in her bare feet. It was 87 degrees. The blacktop had to be blistering hot, he thought. “That looks pretty uncomfortable,” he remembers thinking. He followed her for a bit, then casually remarked on the absence of her shoes. The woman said she’d been in a fight with someone and lost her only pair. “Do you mind if I take you and buy you some new ones?” he asked her. He also called the station and asked for another officer to join him, “so she’d know I was on the up and up,” he said. She was skittish, but agreed to go. “I don’t think she really believed me until we got to Walmart,” he said. The woman volunteered a few details about her life. She’d become addicted to drugs and fallen on hard times. She had children somewhere. “She said she was trying to get her life back on track,” Hendrix said. He suggested that having shoes to walk that track sure couldn’t hurt. Inside the big box store, Hendrix told her to pick whatever she wanted. He and his fellow deputy hung back, he said, so people wouldn’t think she was their prisoner. Eventually she settled on a pair of canvas sneakers that were teal and gray – just like her dress, he said. He also got her some socks. “I wanted to take her to a nicer store, but wasn’t anything open,” Hendrix said, noting that it was early in the morning. He says he doesn’t remember how much the merchandise cost. “I don’t know,” he said. “I just paid with my credit card.” He drove her back downtown, but she wanted to be let out several blocks from where the homeless congregate. She didn’t want to be seen with law enforcement officers because she would be considered “a snitch,” she told him. That’s just fine, he said, and pulled over. Off she went with her new shoes on her feet. Hendrix says he doesn’t understand all the media attention his act of kindness has generated. One of the last big headlines to come from Tulsa law enforcement concerned the September fatal shooting of a motorist by Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby, who now faces manslaughter charges. Hendrix said he just tried to help someone who needed it. “I would hope that someone would do the same for someone in my family who needed something,” he said. “It’s not like it’s a big deal. It’s just a pair of shoes.” Go to MSN Home More in News Second tremor hits NZ hours after deadly quake kills two Mirror NHS plans involving hospital closures 'kept secret from public' Press Association London-bound flight forced to land after stork-hit Evening Standard OAP dies as flat is destroyed in fire Press Association TV host's stunning Trump accusation Associated Press How IS improvised by moving underground Sky News Up Next Theresa May sets out stall for UK's place in Trump’s world The Guardian More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from Inside Edition Mom Breastfeeds Hungry Daughter in Middle of Wedding Inside Edition Man Marries His Cell Phone in Vegas Inside Edition Single Mom Gives Lottery Winnings To Homeless Man Inside Edition Inside Edition View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

There was also one Sentinel and one Galvatron at the same store. Nearby Target had one Sentinel. TRU had the best find, for me anyway. As I was looking at the legacy Megazords, I picked up the last LE Dragonzord, debating if I should splurge on it, when I saw a large TR box behind it, which turned out to be a TR Blaster. I instantly put the down the Dragonzord and purchased Blaster. Additionally, I saw two Sentinels and two Galvatrons in the Transformers section before finding Blaster. concrusher792 Mini-Con Posts: 44 News Credits: 1 Joined: Mon Dec 22, 2014 2:02 pm Top Re: North Carolina Transformers sightings by CAROLINA-TF-FAN » Sat Sep 03, 2016 4:09 pm Motto: "When it comes to new figures the waiting is the hardest part." I decided to go south for my hunting today first to York, SC Walmart. They had 2 TR Blurr and 1 Hardhead. Next we went to the Rock Hill Walmart on Old York Hwy and there they were 2 full sets of wave 2 deluxe. Needless to say they only have 1 full set now. They also had 2 Sentinel Primes and 1 Galvatron. I still have not seen any TR Legends or Titan Masters in my local NC or SC stores.I did buy Alpha Trion online today for $30 with free shipping.

Raleigh, they all received Wave 2 TR deluxes but either they only got two per store and/or some systematically bought all of the Brainstorms, cause the maximum I saw at any store was 2 on a peg and no Brainstorms. WG on Creedmoor near 540 had 1 Mindwipe and 1 Highbrow, WG further down Creedmoor off of Millbrook had none, WG on Glenwood at Duraleigh had just 1 Mindwipe, and the WG at Brier Creek near Duke Health Raleigh had 1 Mindwipe and 1 Chromedome. concrusher792 Mini-Con Posts: 44 News Credits: 1 Joined: Mon Dec 22, 2014 2:02 pm Top Re: North Carolina Transformers sightings by ShockFlave » Wed Sep 21, 2016 6:53 pm The Toys R Us over at Triangle Town Center has some of the new RID warriors (Scorponok, Powersurge Optimus, Quillfire).

Brainstorm isn't out yet, for one. Not in the cases with the others, will be shipped on its own, 8 per case. For another, Walgreen's doesn't stock toys by the case like Walmart/Target/TRU/etc. A case gets opened up at a distribution center, with individual items fulfilled in the single digits for any stores where the peg for the product is empty. What each store gets is completely random. This may end up being different for Brainstorm if he gets his own endcap display like Namor and some past ML and SW Black exclusives of theirs have - in that case it's likely each location will get several of Brainstorm, alone.

Two of each of those remain. Also a few each of Clash of the TF Warriors Starscream and the white Power Surge OP. No Paralons at all, still, so I broke down and just ordered it online on their site. Same store had a couple Fort Maxes, two PMOP, a Blaster, and the Morbot/Quickshadow wave of Rescue Bots. SW's SilverHammer wrote:I-I trusted you Scotty!

Picked up a Paralon b/c of his BW Scorponok style head. There was also at least 1 TR Fort Max (may have been 2, I was more concerned with the RID Warriors) and about 3 Galvatrons. Later I went to Think Geek store at Crabtree while my friend ran some errands. I had been wondering if they would ever reduce the price of their CW Victorion sets since they were overpriced and probably did not sell well at the inflated cost of $119.99. When I went in there was one left and the price had been dropped to $59.99. That was one of the lowest prices I had seen in a while and had been wanting it for a while as well, so I splurged and pounced on it. Amazon's cheapest was $72.00, HTS still charging $99.99 and ThinkGeek.com is charging $109.99, so I think I did pretty well. concrusher792 Mini-Con Posts: 44 News Credits: 1 Joined: Mon Dec 22, 2014 2:02 pm Top Re: North Carolina Transformers sightings by ScottyP » Sat Oct 15, 2016 5:27 pm Weapon: Battle Blades 1 of each TR Wave 2 deluxe at the Walgreen's on the corner of Capital Blvd. and New Hope Church Rd in Raleigh. $19.99 each is no fun but if you only need one or all, they're there for the taking!

It’s lacking the instructions, poster, and the lil card however. Apperently those instructions are printed on some real expensive paper. I took the only one they had but they did have a couple of Onslaughts and of course if one TJ Maxx had Purplejack and the gang then others will to. I hope I can find me a Superion with Bluebolt at another TJ Maxx.

It’s the one in the Hope Valley Commons shopping center, the one with the Harris Teeter. After I got mine they had 3 left. They’re not hanging with the other TRs, they put the Brainstorms all together on a shelf mixed in with the other toys to the right of where Wolfwire and Mindwipe are hanging.

Rockford police were called at 12:50 a.m. to the resort, 7801 E. State St., after shots were fired. They found the 23-year-old on the hallway floor suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene. His name is being withheld pending family notification. Officers also found a second man, 20, who had been shot. He was taken to the hospital for treatment and was in critical condition, according to Rockford police. Four others — an 18-year-old woman, and three men ages 18, 19 and 21 — were shot and taken to the hospital with injuries that are not life-threatening. All of those shot live in Rockford, Sgt. Rich Gambini said. Police said a dispute involving several people occurred before shots were fired. "It was a large birthday party," Gambini said. "It was chaotic, and people were running from the scene." Gambini did not have information this morning about who is responsible for the shooting. No one has been arrested. Chavez Dyse of Rockford attended the party but was at a nearby  Wal-Mart store buying snacks when the shooting occurred. She said the birthday party was for her cousin and took place in two linked hotel rooms. Her female cousin was one of the five people shot and taken to the hospital. She was responsive and recovering this morning, Dyse said. She said the party was exclusive and the location not widely shared. "Well under 50" people were there, she said. Someone let people in through a side door, which may be how the shooter slipped in, Dyse said. "I'm shocked and disappointed," Dyse said. "Rockford is not getting any better. This is just sad. You can't even chill at a hotel with people you know and have a good time without something bad happening." Calls seeking comment from the hotel manager were not immediately returned. This is the 22nd homicide in Rockford so far this year; there were 19 homicides in 2015. A concerned Denise Cardona, 27, of Monroe, Wisconsin, arrived at the Clock Tower at 9:35 a.m. today to help her mother catch a bus for a trip out of town. Cardona said she'd heard about the shooting. "I did not want to drop her off," she said. "So we stayed with her until she got on the bus." Bessie Young was at the resort this afternoon on a visit from outside Fort Hood, Texas. She moved from Rockford in the 1970s but returns to visit family. "There's a lot of violence here," she said, "as there is all over the world." Adrian Vasquez, owner of Totally You Hair Salon inside the Clock Tower Resort, said the shooting hasn't affected the salon. "It's business as usual," he said at about 11 a.m. "We have not had one call canceling. We have children in here right now." Industrialist Seth Atwood opened the landmark Clock Tower in 1968 to lure visitors to his multimillion-dollar Time Museum collection of exotic timepieces. The museum closed and the timepieces were sold. In 1999, the Atwoods sold the 250-room resort to Regency Hotel Management. Regency sold it in 2005 to WPH Rockford LLC and Sage Hospitality, which built the CoCo Key Water Park. The hotel was sold at auction in 2011 to Allied Hospitality of Houston, the current owner. CoCo Key has been shuttered since summer 2015 and maintenance problems have sparked concern among city officials. Anyone with information about the shooting should contact the Rockford Police Department at 779-500-6555 or Rockford Area Crime Stoppers at 815-963-7867.

Eduardo DeJesus Cossio III, 32, was remanded to jail after he was placed on three years probation and ordered to pay investigative costs to a beer company and stores by San Diego Superior Court Judge Dan Link. “He was really trying to get free beer,” said his attorney, Daniel Greene. “He was down on his luck. He didn’t think it through.” “He wasn’t trying to harm individual citizens. He thought the beer would not be re-sold,” said Greene, who added that his client thought it would be returned to the manufacturer. Cossio, formerly of Chula Vista, bought 13 packages of beer bottles at Walmart stores in Chula Vista, National City and Target stores in Eastlake and El Cajon in 2014 and 2015. He drank the beer, and then put soapy water, food coloring, and/or cleaning solutions in the bottles before gluing the caps back on. He got refunds and the products were placed back on the shelves. Other people bought them and took one or two sips before realizing they were tampered with. One man went to an emergency room to see if he was poisoned, but no one was actually injured, according to attorneys. One man told an official the beverage tasted like someone else’s “bad mouth water.” “Food tampering is very serious,” said Deputy District Attorney Elizabeth McClutchey, who asked for 365 days in jail. McClutchey said a beer manufacturer spent $59,603 in investigative costs as it was initially believed to be possibly a broad product tampering case. She said Cossio went to great lengths to make it look like the returned bottles resembled beer. Target employees identified Cossio as he wore a distinctive set of earrings, beard, and hair style in store security tapes. He filled out the refund records with his correct name, date of birth, and driver’s license number. Link ordered him to stay 500 feet away from all Target and Walmart stores and to pay probation costs of $1,433. He was fined $1,484. Link suspended 215 days of jail time which Cossio may have to serve if he violates probation terms. Link specified that he must serve 30 days in jail, but can be screened for housing in a work furlough project for 120 days. If Cossio is allowed to go to his auto technician job during the day, he would be locked up at night and on weekends. Cossio apologized to all the victims. “I didn’t think it would lead to all this,” he said. Most liquor stores do not give refunds when someone tries to return alcohol products. The attorneys said Walmart and Target gave refunds because they were department stores and wanted to please customers. Charges involving 29 similar counts were dismissed after he pleaded guilty to three counts of adulteration of a food product. He could have received a maximum term of four years and four months in prison. He got credit for one day previously spent in jail before he posted $10,000 bond.

Long before Wal-Mart ruled retail, before Rupert Murdoch bought broadcast media, 10 dairy farmers in the Tillamook Valley decided that bigger was better. They threw in $25 per factory and in 1909 formed the Tillamook County Creamery Association, makers of Tillamook Cheese. Last year, the creamery boasted $270 million in sales and produced 300,000 pounds of cheese a day.

The uptick, which had been projected last winter by government analysts, largely reflected the revenue loss from expiring tax breaks for businesses and individuals that Congress extended in December. President Obama had proposed to pair the tax cuts with some tax increases on wealthy Americans, to avoid adding to the deficit, but Congress refused. The $587 billion deficit for fiscal year 2016 is equivalent to 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product, the measure of the overall output of the economy. The previous year’s deficit was $438 billion, or 2.5 percent of G.D.P. — a reduction of three-quarters from the level amid the recession at the end of the George W. Bush administration. While the tax cuts were the immediate cause of the return to rising annual deficits, budget shortfalls long had been forecast to climb unsustainably after 2018 because of the costs of an aging population. The number of people 65 years or older is expected to increase nearly 40 percent in a decade, driving up spending for Medicare and Social Security. Mr. Obama, in his budgets this year and in past years, unsuccessfully proposed significant tax increases for the wealthiest taxpayers and some corporations to offset spending initiatives and reduce deficits. In contrast, congressional Republicans proposed mainly to cut Medicare spending, in part by offering beneficiaries taxpayer-funded vouchers to purchase private insurance, and Medicaid, with reduced block grants to states. But legislation to that end never came to a vote. First Draft Political news and analysis from the staff of The New York Times.

Privacy Policy Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, proposes some of the same tax increases as Mr. Obama has, and more. But the new revenue is intended to pay for her spending plans, including for education, not to reduce deficits. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mrs. Clinton’s Republican rival, Donald J. Trump, would cut taxes by trillions of dollars mostly for the wealthy and corporations even as he has vowed to sharply reduce the federal debt. His promises to reduce spending enough to cut the debt and pay for his tax cuts have been disputed even by conservative groups, because Mr. Trump has said Medicare and Social Security are off-limits for cuts. The Obama administration’s final reckoning on spending and taxes for 2016, which was jointly released by Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and the budget director, Shaun Donovan, showed increases in spending for veterans benefit payments, the health programs Medicare and Medicaid, and for interest payments on the nation’s debt. Military spending increased little over all, and dropped for military operations and maintenance. Spending on nutrition for the poor, formerly known as food stamps, was down 4 percent.

News Opinion Commentary Commentary: Five myths about charter schools Online Learning Damian Dovarganes / AP Charter schools' ntense rate of growth has fueled an equally intense debate about the role they'll play in the future of U.S. education. Charter schools' ntense rate of growth has fueled an equally intense debate about the role they'll play in the future of U.S. education. (Damian Dovarganes / AP) Emma BrownThe Washington Post They're in demand among parents who say traditional public schools have failed — but they're not always successful. Their intense rate of growth has fueled an equally intense debate about the role they'll play in the future of U.S. education. Advocates see their expansion as evidence that parents have a huge appetite for school choice. Critics see the beginning of the end of public education, with systems of neighborhood schools replaced by independent, privately run companies without the same obligation to teach the toughest students. A great deal of confusion surrounds charter schools. Here are some of the myths. Myth No. 1: Charter schools are everywhere. At its national convention this year, the NAACP called for a moratorium on charter school expansion. The Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, a union-backed coalition, demands: "Stop flooding our communities with under-performing and unaccountable charter schools." The charter debate is front and center in the education reform wars, and you'd think that they're everywhere — a wave overtaking every community. Not quite. Charter schools advocates protest proposed school cap Chicago charter school advocates gathered to protest a provision that would cap the number of charter schools in the city under a contract with the Chicago Teachers Union. (Alyssa Pointer/Chicago Tribune) Chicago charter school advocates gathered to protest a provision that would cap the number of charter schools in the city under a contract with the Chicago Teachers Union. (Alyssa Pointer/Chicago Tribune) See more videos Yes, the charter movement is growing. And charters have a significant market share in an increasing number of cities, with New Orleans (where 93 percent of students attend charters) leading the way, followed by Detroit (53 percent), Flint, Mich., (47 percent) and Washington (44 percent). Forty-three states and Washington, D.C., have laws allowing for charter schools. But in many parts of the country, charters are few and far between. About 3 million students are enrolled in approximately 6,800 charters, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. That's only about 6 percent of all public school students. Eight states have no charter schools, and five have fewer than 10. The debate is loud, but the market share is still small. Myth No. 2: Charters are were the brainchild of union-busting billionaires. Critics of charter schools often accuse philanthropists — including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, entrepreneur Eli Broad, hedge fund manager John Arnold and the Walton family, heirs to the Walmart fortune — of fueling the rise of charter schools and other reform projects as a way to promote free-market ideology and undermine teachers unions. In Salon early this year, Diane Ravitch (a George H.W. Bush-era federal education official who has become perhaps the nation's most voluble charter critic) railed against Gates for using his wealth to push charters in Washington state. In the Huffington Post, Bill Bigelow argued that Charles and David Koch are involved with school reform because "they hate public schools."

Now that the dust has settled on the tentative contract agreement between the Chicago Teachers Union and Chicago Public Schools, and all the parties have patted themselves on the back, let's take a closer look at what was lost at the bargaining table. In a curious side deal with the CTU, CPS is... (Andrew Broy) It is true that deep-pocketed foundations have played a key role in the expansion of charter schools, through contributions to charters themselves and to the ecosystem of organizations that work with such schools. But charters were originally the brainchild of teachers union stalwart Al Shanker, who served as president of the American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to 1997. Shanker proposed charter schools in 1988, arguing that they would give small groups of teachers a way to dream up new methods of reaching the students for whom traditional schools were not working. Their successes and failures would hold lessons for other schools striving to improve. The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1992. Some charters have acted as Shanker envisioned, but in many states they haven't, rejecting requirements for teacher certification or barring collective-bargaining rights. Driven by a vision of market-based reform, charters have become not laboratories so much as competition meant to either spur traditional schools to improve or replace them. Just a few years after proposing charter schools, Shanker largely disavowed them, holding instead that schools would get better only by standardizing their goals — the same theory that underlies today's controversial Common Core state standards. Myth No. 3: Charters are better than traditional public schools. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is a big fan of expanding school choice via vouchers and charters. "We will rescue kids from failing schools," he told the GOP convention in July. Books, articles and documentaries like "Waiting for 'Superman" have created in the popular imagination a picture of charter schools with impossibly long waiting lists, offering an escape to children desperate for a better education in neighborhoods beset by crumbling traditional schools. While it is true that some charter schools outperform traditional schools, it is also true that many charter schools fail. The Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) has produced a series of studies comparing academic results at charter and traditional schools. In 2013, CREDO found no difference nationally between traditional and charter schools in math, while in reading, the average charter school student gained the equivalent of an additional eight days of learning per year. But there was wide variation. Among the charters CREDO studied, 31 percent were significantly weaker in math than their traditional school counterparts, 29 percent were significantly stronger and 40 percent showed no real difference. CREDO studies also show variation across state lines. In cities, charters tend to fare better: The average student in an urban charter school gains the equivalent of 40 more days of learning in math and 28 additional days in reading. But the average charter student in Texas and in Ohio — a state that has been notorious for allowing poor-performing charters to persist — learns less in math and reading each year than her peers in traditional schools. Myth No. 4: Charter schools are public. Or private. In August, a National Labor Relations Board majority ruled that a charter school in Brooklyn "was not established by a state or local government" and was, therefore, "not itself a public school." The board's lone dissenter argued that "charter schools operate as K-12 public schools" and should be treated as such since "they are substantially regulated under state and local laws, and they are overseen by state and local authorities." This is one of education's more bitter feuds, a semantic battle that underlines how important public education is to our nation's notion of itself. Advocates insist that charter schools are public because they are tuition-free and equally open to all children. Critics argue that charters are at the leading edge of an effort to privatize public education in the same way other government functions, such as prisons, have been outsourced to private companies. How the charter school lobby is changing the Democratic Party Harold Meyerson At a time when Democrats and their party are, by virtually every index, moving left, a powerful center-right pressure group within the liberal universe has nonetheless sprung up. Funded by billionaires and arrayed against unions, it is increasingly contesting for power in city halls and statehouses... At a time when Democrats and their party are, by virtually every index, moving left, a powerful center-right pressure group within the liberal universe has nonetheless sprung up. Funded by billionaires and arrayed against unions, it is increasingly contesting for power in city halls and statehouses... (Harold Meyerson) Neither side is entirely right. Charters are a hybrid, and judges and regulators have struggled to figure out how they should be treated under the law. "Courts have had a difficult time determining their legal status because they exhibit both public and private characteristics," researchers wrote in a University of Massachusetts Law Review article last year. When charter students in Colorado, for instance, set a fire that destroyed private property, the property owners sued the school for negligence. The school argued that it was a public entity and therefore immune. A federal judge agreed, finding that the school's autonomy did not make it a private institution. Often, the public- or private-ness of charter schools depends on state law. In many states, for example, charter schools are subject to sunshine laws, meaning their records and board meetings are open to the public. But not everywhere: In D.C., for instance, charters are exempt from sunshine laws, which means journalists and parents often cannot access even basic information about how the schools spend taxpayer money. Myth No. 5: All charters employ zero-tolerance discipline. Many of the nation's most heralded charter school networks were built as "no excuses" schools that practice a broken-windows approach to discipline. Children are expected to abide by strict rules — walking in silent lines, eating silent lunch, sitting up straight, maintaining eye contact with the teacher as she moves about the room — and are punished for even small infractions. The suspension rate among charters nationally was 16 percent higher than among traditional schools in the 2011-2012 school year, according to the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. But it has never been the case that all charter schools subscribe to the no-excuses, zero-tolerance philosophy. In D.C. in 2011-2012, the same year that charter schools were 72 times more likely than the traditional school system to expel a student, there were six charters that issued zero suspensions or expulsions, and 15 others that issued five or fewer. Lately — amid growing concern over feeding the school-to-prison pipeline with expelled students, and over producing graduates ill-equipped to deal with the freedom and responsibility of college life — there's been a shift even among some stalwarts of the no-excuses approach. At Ascend charter schools in New York, kids no longer get in trouble for wearing socks that are the wrong color. In D.C., charter schools' suspension and expulsion rates are dropping. Some KIPP schools now use restorative justice, which prioritizes working through problems over doling out punishment. Even Education Secretary John King Jr. — whose charter school in Boston is known for both its high test scores and high suspension rates — delivered a speech this summer calling on charter leaders to rethink their approach to discipline.

At a price of $844 per share and above, Amazon's market capitalisation is over US $ 400 billion In Mid-June 2016, we called out our position on Amazon. We did short the shares of Amazon based on the signals generated by our Algorithms. Lets understand a few basics of Amazon stock on the bourses. At a price of $844 per share and above, Amazon's market capitalisation is over US $ 400 billion. Compared to Walmart its peer in brick and mortar, its revenues are one-fourth of Walmart (Amazon's revenues also includes the revenues from cloud and other tech infrastructure services apart from ecommerce). While the metrics for valuation of an ecommerce is vaguely different from its peers in brick and mortar space, it is definitely not comparing apples and oranges. Amazon trades at trailing PE ratio of 210 as compared to Walmart at 14. There is a huge difference in the profits and losses both the companies Amazon and Walmart generate. Next year Amazon will have completed 20 years on its listing on the bourses. Hence it is definitely not a start up. Our Short of Amazon in June 2016   When we had initially shorted Amazon in mid-June 2016, the global ecommerce scenario was a bleak with several mark downs in valuations of several ecommerce companies, not only in the US but closer home with Flipkart, Snapdeal. While on a flight back from San Francisco, I met up with Kunal and Rohit, the co-founders of Snapdeal in the Eithad Lounge. While their mood down on a different set of reasons which is not relevant for the discussion here, I did discuss on our going short on Amazon and our outlook on ecommerce stocks. Rohit was clear that the they and the ecommerce sector will bounce back within 6 months. He had different set of reasons why the investors will come back to ecommerce. My point for going short on Amazon was completely different. Amazon has come off its peak in mid-June 2016. Amazon has traded above Point C for only 30 minutes in the last 10 days in June 2016. Our justification on calling a sell signal on Amazon was justified as shown below. A Fibonacci Ratio as well on the historical price performance of the stock.   Inspire Brexit and other fears, the markets were still on a run and so was Amazon stock in July and August 2016. We had to cover our shorts and the Amazon stock rallied. Post-Brexit, we called for a sharp correction in the markets on 27 July 2016. While we waited for the markets to correct, in August 2016 all the indices rallied to touch their all-time highs together, a phenomena that was witnessed in 1999, pre dot.com bust. Amazon stock also followed the market trend. When the markets corrected on 9 September 2016, we have once again picked up extremely strong sell signals on Amazon through out September 2016.   As the Amazon stock rallied over $847, we triggered a short on Amazon. There is a wide consensus amongst many hedge fund analysts and stock market analysts that the Amazon stock has peaked off.   Only time will say how the stock performs. Our Algorithms have proved the market correction of 9 September 2016 correct which we predicted on 27 July 2016. We will continue to gain from the signals our algos are providing us to gain profits for our investors. Let's wait and watch! We may prove correct on our call on Amazon this time round. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ The author is director, EquNev-K1T Capital Hedge Fund, a US equity market-focused Indian hedge fund Kapil Khandelwal Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Rosneft, Trafigura sign pact for picking 98% in Essar oil Business Standard Why is this Indian Hedge fund going short on Amazon?

Why India's venture capitalists need Flipkart Livemint 15-10-2016 Snigdha Sengupta © LiveMint Flipkart, which started up in 2007, alone accounts for over $3 billion or roughly 20% of the overall capital drawn between 2007 and 2015. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Flipkart, the country’s largest home-grown e-commerce company, is slated to hit the road this quarter to raise a fresh round of capital, Mint reported this week. It hopes to raise at least $500 million and up to $1 billion, the report said citing unnamed sources. The report follows an earlier one in the Economic Times that said, also citing unnamed sources, that Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is in talks to buy a stake in the Bengaluru-based company. Any kind of fund-raising by Flipkart is always something of an event in India’s start-up market. There are many who will insist otherwise. Flipkart, they argue, is no longer the benchmark for either funding or valuations. A lot of venture capitalists I meet also frequently complain about the media’s “unhealthy obsession” with reporting on start-up fund-raising at the exclusion of everything else, thus turning all matters funding into an event. But, here’s why start-up fund-raising and Flipkart’s in particular is so important. Between 2007 and 2015, venture capital-backed companies in India raised more than $15 billion from a variety of investors including venture capital firms, hedge funds and strategic investors, according to data compiled by VCCEdge. Flipkart, which started up in 2007, alone accounts for over $3 billion or roughly 20% of the overall capital drawn during this period. It has raised that money at astounding valuations. When it last raised capital, $700 million in July last year, its valuation was reported at $15.2 billion. In July, India’s venture capital market was still riding an unprecedented valuation wave and Flipkart was its flag-bearer. Things have changed since. The market has undergone a valuation correction. Again, Flipkart has led the way. Over the past few months, several foreign mutual funds that hold minority stakes in the company have successively marked down the value of their shares. Last reported, the e-commerce company’s valuation was estimated at around $9-10 billion. With the e-commerce sector bellwether falling out of favour with investors, the valuations and fund-raising prospects of several others in the market have been impacted one way or the other. The reported upcoming Flipkart fund-raising is interesting on two counts. One, the valuation at which it raises the next round of capital is going to influence future capital inflows into the e-commerce sector, the poster child of the ongoing start-up wave in the country. It could raise $1 billion at a valuation of $9-10 billion or more or it may muster just $500 million at a drastically lower valuation. Either way, it will give the e-commerce company, which is desperately battling Seattle based e-tailing giant Amazon for market dominance here, the runway to still prove to its investors that it can deliver the goods. Two, Flipkart’s success in raising funds, hopefully at a more than decent valuation, equally extends the runway for India’s venture capitalists. After more than 10 years of continuous investing, the venture capital market is yet to deliver a single blockbuster exit. Most firms active here have raised and deployed successive funds over the years without much to show so far in terms of returning profits to their investors. Let’s take a closer look at how much the top-rung firms currently manage between them. The 12 most active firms that invest from dedicated India funds have raised over $12 billion till date, based on data compiled from media reports and the websites of venture capital firms. Sequoia Capital India alone accounts for about $3 billion. It raised a massive $920 million fund earlier this year. Second in the pecking order, in terms of size, is Nexus Venture Partners, which now has more than $1 billion in funds under management. Next is Matrix Partners India with $710 million, followed by SAIF Partners at $700 million. These 12 firms represent investors who invest across the seed and alphabet rounds (Series A, B and C). Most of the capital they’ve raised has already been deployed, mostly in the consumer Internet sector. The concern for these investors and in turn for the start-up market is bringing in the next $12 billion. It is true that most of these venture capital firms have enough capital in reserve to see them through the next 2-3 years. But, after that the next tranche of funds will depend on a number of factors. How soon will the Indian start-up market begin to deliver supernormal returns on the investments that have been made so far? Will the flag-bearers of the current start-up wave go the distance and justify the investments made so far? How many among the 12 firms that have raised and deployed the $12 billion will survive? These are questions that don’t have easy answers yet. The Indian venture capital market is still young and the best assets are yet to be created. For that, uninterrupted access to early stage funds is paramount. The obsession with funding, Flipkart and valuations is going to be around for a while. There will always be time later to talk about the other stuff. Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint. She contributes stories on venture capital and private equity.

By Kedar Grandhi October 15, 2016 08:27 BST While the case dates back to 2002, there are currently about 9,500 past and current Asda workers who have joined this class actionGetty Images Asda faces a claim to pay £100m ($121.9m) as back payments to thousands of female workers, employment solicitor Leigh Day has revealed. It comes after a class action related to the same was given the right to proceed by an employment tribunal in Manchester. Day is representing 7,000 female shop floor workers who were or are working with the supermarket chain. They had complained of receiving between £1 and £3 less per hour than staff at Asda's distribution centres, which primarily consist of male workers. The Walmart-owned retailer had argued that the difference in pay was not because of gender but because of the difference in location and the nature of work. However, these female workers argued that the work they do were of the same value as that done in the warehouses but they were getting paid lesser as Asda perceived their work as "women's work", worth less than men's work. The tribunal ruled in favour of the women workers. It said that the jobs of these shopfloor women could be compared with jobs being done at the warehouses. While the case dates back to 2002, there are currently about 9,500 past and current workers who have joined this class action. Lauren Lougheed, a lawyer representing the Asda women staff, said: "Asda tried to argue that because the shops and distribution centres were in different locations, with different pay arrangements, that Asda could pay the men what they like. "However, the employment tribunal found that Asda, the employer of both men and women, could have made sure that there was equal pay between men and women if they wanted to, but chose not to." Asda, however, argued that the employment tribunal ruling would not determine the eventual outcome of the case. "It relates to a technical preliminary issue of whether jobs in different parts of the business can be compared. The tribunal has yet to consider whether the jobs are of equal value in terms of their demands and if some jobs are, only then will the tribunal move on to consider the reasons for the differentials, including the existence of different market rates in different industry sectors," it was quoted as saying by Sky News. The supermarket further argued that both men and women doing the same job in its retail stores were being paid the same, while both the sexes doing the same job in its distribution centres were also getting an equal pay. However, it said, "pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors."

The Oscar-winner (Wasp (2005)) anticipates audiences are smart, that they are intelligent enough to sift through a number of tough, esoteric cultural issues in order to find the truth lurking at the center of whatever tale it is she's telling. Her first two narrative features, the impressively prescient Red Road and the mesmerizingly essential Fish Tank, don't pull any punches and refuse to take the easy way out. Her last film, an adaptation of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, is an emotional stunner the filmmaker managed to make feel bracingly current, utilizing the author's themes in a way that allowed them to take root in ways that were primal, heartfelt and pure. For her U.S. debut, American Honey, Arnold hits the road Jack Kerouac style, taking her cast and crew through the American heartland while telling a story about a teen girl, Star (Sasha Lane), who joins up with a group of magazine salespeople, dubbed a 'Mag Crew,' as a way to potentially get out of poverty and make new friends. She is smitten with the happy-go-lucky charmer Jake (Shia LaBeouf) who recruited her out of a Wal-Mart parking lot. She is wary of the manipulative, seductively feral Krystal (Riley Keough), the tough-as-nails woman who controls the purse strings and sets all the rules. Most of all, Star is taken with the collection of fellow outsiders who make up the core of the Mag Crew, coming to look at them as the close-knit family she's heretofore never really known until now. At an epic 163 minutes, Arnold's movie has the guts to take its time even if the story itself isn't complicated. Instead, this is an observational romp through image, expectation and perception, the filmmaker dwelling both on how Star begins to see the world she's suddenly been unleashed upon as well as how society itself makes assumptions about her and the rest of the ragtag Mag Crew. What can sometimes feel like nothing more than a supercilious descent into poverty in all actuality ends up being anything but, Arnold's sights set a heck of a lot higher, and as such her film ends up being all the more essential because of this. The grungy, haphazard quality of the narrative, reminiscent in many ways of Larry Clark's 1995 drama Kids, is juxtaposed with the pure, simplistic beauty of the filmmaking itself. Robbie Ryan's (Slow West) handheld, free-flowing cinematography manufactures a sense of individualistic grace that allows American Honey to achieve an internal elegance that's touching. At the same time, Joe Bini's (We Need to Talk About Kevin) lyrically dynamic editing allows for changes in tone and perception that are instantaneous and natural, and as such Star's journey has a kinetically mesmeric quality that's haunting. Then there is Lane. Literally discovered by Arnold on a Florida beach while the young woman was enjoying her Spring Break collegiate holiday, the newcomer proves to be a fiery talent who is difficult to resist. In practically every scene of the film, everything seen through her eyes, Star's awakening to the world around her is breathlessly realized. Even with minimal dialogue, Lane manages these emotional transitions with stupendous intimacy, allowing her climactic interior transformation to ring with the kind of optimistic ebullience that brought tears to my eyes. With LaBeouf and Keough, the latter of whom is marvelously terrifying, as the only real name actors making major appearances (Will Patton pops up for an important vignette, but his role is more of an endearingly grizzled cameo than it is anything substantive), the majority of the heavy lifting is left to the core group of youngsters making up the Mag Crew. They're an intriguingly irresistible cross-section of America's youth, each finding a way to make their mark utilizing the most minimal of screen time. Star's interactions with them have genuine warmth, and I loved the way they could so often come together as one, usually doing so in complete silence. American Honey, for all the heart it proudly wears on its sleeve (especially near the end), isn't exactly the most uplifting story a person is ever likely to see, and dealing with all the Sturm und Drang for almost three full hours is admittedly grueling. But Arnold remains a craftily intelligent filmmaker, and there's a lot more going on here than just a documentary-like overview of youth culture in the face of extreme poverty. The themes keep evolving long after Star's story has come to summation, and while the kids are far from all right the sense of hopeful possibility that some of them might be makes enduring this tale's harsher realities markedly worthwhile.

(WWLP) – Westfield Police Captain Michael McCabe re-confirmed Friday that there was no criminal investigation into Thursday’s discovery of a woman’s body in a car, in the Westfield Walmart parking lot. “There was no suspicious cause, and this was not an opiate death,” Capt. McCabe told 22News. He identified the deceased woman as 39-year-old Jill Wetherell of Agawam. Capt. McCabe said he was making Wetherell’s identity public, in part, because he had received a call from a worried relative from out of state. He said there was no investigation under way.

There have been 22 storm related deaths in that state alone, and flood waters continue to rise.  Amarillo resident, Nick Rocha, is putting his life on hold, once again, to offer a helping hand.  "Any time there's a distress call for helping people, or helping people get out of the danger zone, you can guarantee my bags are packed up and ready to go," said Rocha.   Nick Rocha is no stranger to seeing devastation. In fact, he hadn't even unpacked his bag from his last volunteer work with another deadly flood situation in Louisiana this summer.  He's using his vacation time through is daytime job at Wal-Mart to head to North Carolina. He leaves on Monday -- driving over 14,000 miles to Fayetteville.  "I'll be feeding people street by street and delivering food to the shelters," said Rocha.  Rocha plans on staying for 20 days, with some days lasting well over 12 hours While he might be putting his life in danger -- heading out to some of the worst flood areas in the southeast -- he says it's all worth it.  "He's a great example of that volunteer spirit is," said Executive Director for the American Red Cross of the Texas Panhandle, Kiley Murray. "That's what the Red Cross and a lot of non-profits are based one, that volunteer spirit."  And it's that need that keeps Rocha volunteering with the Red Cross year after year. No matter how emotional a scene may be -- Rocha never hesitates.  Rocha will actually have some company this time around, another volunteer from Fritch will drive with him.  Copyright 2016 KFDA.

By trutxfan on Oct 14, 2016, 8:09pm CDT 15 Tweet Share  Tweet Share on Twitter Share Share on Facebook Pin Pinterest 15 Comments ⋆ Rec Recommend this Post 3 Hi there BRB. What's happening? Everyone in good spirits after the great game against the mighty Vikings? No? Well, buck up boys and girls. It's just football. I've been taking a sabbatical from the threads lately due to life being too short to listen, or read, about how bad our team is. We still love our guys. We still look forward to each and every game as the most important part of our week. This week is our first meeting with our friends from Indiana. In keeping with my theme of food from our opponents area, I started researching food that Indiana is famous for. What I found was bleak. I'm sure they have some good restaurants serving great food, but food from Indiana turned up fried pork tenderloin sandwiches, corn, and believe it or not, oysters. It seems that from the web sites that I looked at, oysters used to be packed in barrels and shipped to Indiana a long time ago and that was really the only "fresh" seafood they could get. I actually found that interesting. One guy said his grandmother would order hers in October, then they would arrive in November. They would be placed in the coolest part of the cellar, and grandma would make dishes from them through December, culminating in scalloped oysters for Christmas dinner. I want to meet grandma, she sounds like a great gal. Now, what to cook? This needs to be a theme thing. I could go all horse meat, but my wife would probably kill me. I could just make a pork tenderloin sandwich. Boring. I could BBQ some oysters. Intreaguing. I really like bbq'd oysters. And just for kicks, I'll throw in a super easy version as an appetizer. But, I think I'll go with one of my favorites for this edition. Pork tenderloin a'la Trutxfan. It's not a greasy fried sandwich. It's a smokey spicy BBQ'd pork tenderloin. Here we go, first go buy some pork tenderloins. I'm not going out of my way this week. I'm going with Smithville pork tenderloins at HEB. Let me just digress for a second. This is my post, so I can rant a little if I want to. I'm super pissed at HEB right now. I live in Kerrville. This is the home of HEB. This is where it started. Over the last few years, HEB has run all the other grocery stores out of town, with the exception of the satan that is WalMart. They did this by undercutting prices to the point that other stores couldn't compete. Now that it's just them and WalMart, they have continually jacked up the prices. I started doing price comparisons with friends who live in San Antonio and Houston and have found that we here in Kerrville are paying on average 30% more for our food than those in the big cities with competition. This, in my opinion, is unconscionable. They have consistently raised their prices since all the competition folded. Baisicly giving a kittening you to the town that started them off. Ok, rant over. Take your pork tenderloins out of the package and dry them off. You now want to get some seasoning on them. This is Texas, not the bland north where they put toilet seats on football helmets, so we are going with some kick. Salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, siracha powder, ancho chili powder, and smoked paprika. I just cover them with a light layer of each. Now take some nice thick bacon and wrap these rascals up. Cover them with the wrap of your choice and let them sit in the fridge over night. It's now game day (in my mind). Time to start cooking. We are going to grill these babies. Tenderloins have almost no fat, so low and slow is a waste of resources and very difficult to achieve a moist product with. Heat your grill up with what ever you want. I go wood. I'm like that. Use charcoal, gas, dead BESF fans, whatever gets your grill nice and hot. Put the fire on one side, and leave the other side cool. This is the heralded two zone method that I invented (no, I really didn't invent this). With the fire screaming on one side, put the pork on the cool side, closer to the fire than the opposit side of the grill. What you are looking for is enough heat to crisp your bacon, while cooking your pork through. Rare pork is not what you want to serve to you friends and family. The bacon grease will help your pork stay juicy and adds much flavor. I'll temp mine when everything starts get a little brown. 165 in the center of the pork is good. If my bacon starts to get too crispy before my pork temps out, I'll move it farther from the fire. An average pork tenderloin takes about an hour. Now, while your pork is cooking, you can make those oysters. Shuck your fresh oysters. Save some of the oyster liquor. I do mine over a plastic container for this purpose. Mix in a bowl, lemon juice, diced tomatoes, diced onion, and diced garlic. Dice it up real small. You won't need much for each oyster. Now put your oysters on a half shell on a platter. Pour in a little oyster liquor, put a dollop of the veg on top. Throw on some Parmesan cheese. Now put them over the hottest part of the fire on your grill. Heat them until the cheese bubbles. Super easy. Super tasty. As for what to serve with your pork, let's spice up some corn. I put some smoked paprika and salt on mine. If you want a really interesting and spicy alternative, pour some juice from a jar of jalepenos on them after you wrap them in foil. I start grilling my corn unwrapped to get a good char on them, then I wrap them in foil with some butter to finish. This corn is on the cob, by the way. I'll also make a pot of BBQ beans to go with it. Lets all eat well while we enjoy our first victory against the Colts this year. Have a few beers. Relax. Enjoy your Sunday evening. Remember, it's just a game and supposed to be entertainment, no matter how bad they kitten it up sometimes. your friend, Trutxfan. Go Texans!!!

SCOUT Parris Campbell Bank Bag: Ohio State vs Wisconsin Week PART-3 Bill Greene 10/14/2016 Ohio State heads to Wisconsin to play the Badgers this Saturday night in one of the top games in the country, so there is plenty of excitement in Buckeye Land. Bill Greene is back this week to answer questions from BSB subscribers. Here is Part-Three. KansasCityBuckeye: I am of the opinion that there needs to be a no-tampering rule for both assistants and head coaches until their season is over. I don't think it's right when coaches are offered, interviewed, or accept new positions during the season. Do you agree? Why or why not? Why would or wouldn't it happen? BG: I don't think there is a lot of that going on during the season, to be honest. Most of what goes on during the season happens between agents and university representatives anyway. There's no way to stop that, especially given the nature of these jobs where coaches are fired often so they are always on the lookout for the next landing spot. These guys know the best way to get that new job is to do your current job really well. I don't see it as a big problem in college sports at all.  USFbuckeyeBG: Shaun Wade... I know the hurricane is what drove them to Bama, but thats just another visit to Bama... Heard anything new? BG: There won't be much coming out until he finally decides where he's going. Welcome to recruiting the Florida kids, and this is normal with this state. Torrance Gibson did this and it worked out for Ohio State. Carlton Davis did this, and the Buckeyes got burned at the last minute. I wish I had something to add one way or the other, but nobody knows how this one is going to end right now. I would imagine he's telling Nick Saban he's coming, while telling Urban Meyer there's nothing to worry about.  dfaulkne: Can you talk more about how OSU gets insight on whether a guy is likely to go pro or not. Are there open conversations during the year between the player and the coaching staff? Or do they rely more on "secondhand" information and chatter from family/etc. Obviously they have to plan their recruiting strategy on this, but it just seems difficult to pin things down unless you're dealing with a true superstar like Bosa or Elliott. BG: It's different with every kid, but often times the team finds out when we find out. They had a clue, but they did not know for sure what either Tyvis Powell or Jalin Marshall were doing right up to their announcements. They found out what Zeke was doing when he met the media after Michigan State. The team definitely wants to know, but sometimes these decisions aren't finalized until very late as the kids try to get as much info as they can about where they might be drafted. I think they knew what Mike Thomas was doing pretty early, as well as Bosa. Not sure when they found out about Darron Lee. When Ryan Shazier decided to go, that decision was made a few days before the bowl game, and I was consulted for my opinion on the matter. They had not spoken with the coaches prior to that decision and never did talk to them until he announced it.  buckeyebones: If your son was a big time recruit what would be your concerns as a parent and what advice would you give him? BG: We would be totally forgetting whatever jersey we bought at WalMart, and who we've rooted for all our lives. That would mean nothing to me, because that is fantasy anyway. A hobby. Choosing your school is strictly business, and this becomes clear once folks go through it. If the kid is not at all interested in education, that should factor in it. If this is a decision made to play in the NFL, the school should be picked based on that factor. If you are looking to truly use your education after football in a certain field, you need to pick a school based on educational opportunities offered. Which school recruiting you can truly help you with life after football? If this is a football decision primarily, then style of play should be looked at. For certain positions, the depth chart needs to be studied, especially quarterback. Without knowing specifically the type of player and person we are talking about, it's pretty hard to answer. You need to identify the ultimate goal the player is shooting for, and if it's the NFL, or a degree, or winning a title, or getting on the field early, etc. etc. choose the school that fits what you're looking for.  buckeyebones: How is the fit for Danny at UK? Do you think he ends up there? BG: I do think it's a good fit for him in a lot of ways and I do think that's where he will go. I hope everything works out well for him because I like him and his family a lot. He's been through a lot at an early age, and he's been forced to grow up fast through his experiences at Massillon as a 14-year old kid and committing to Ohio State as a freshman. He's going to be tough enough to face life going forward because of what he's been through already at an early age.  raider2426: What direction do you see the Oregon going after this year? If they make a move what kind of names do you see popping up for that job? BG: That needle has been pointing down for a while now and that can't bode well for Mark Helfrich at all. This is a program that spends a lot of money on building a winner, and they expect to win. I don't think they are going to be all that patient going forward. I think Oklahoma offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley is young and dynamic, and an offensive guru. He could energize recruiting and keep up the tradition of wide open offence.  BuckeyeNatural: Ok Bill, you get to build an OSU dream team with Urban Meyer as the head coach, selecting a full starting lineup from the best OSU players of all time. Go... BG: It all starts at QB and I would love to see Urban paired with Terrelle Pryor, who was really good in Tressel's Covered Wagon, but what about in this offense? Wow. Runningback would be Zeke. Receivers would be Ginn, Warfield and Cris Carter. O-line would be Pace, Parker, Lachey, Hicks and Stringer. Tight end would be Jan White. On defense, the D-line would be Bosa, Vrabel, Willis and Big Daddy. Linebackers would be Gradishar, Spielman and Jack Tatum. Corners would be Winfield and Springs. Safety would be Tim Fox and Neal Colzie.  buckeyebones: Could we have another JT QB in our future? Just read an article on JT Daniels, soph at Mater Dei. 2,234 yards, 35 TDs, 2 INTs in six games. Calls all of his own plays. BG: They will take a QB in the 2019 class, so maybe it's this guy? I don't know much about him, but I went and watched his film and he looks awesome. Don't see this kid wanting to run the zone read though, LOL. Looks like an Alabama or USC type of QB.  buckeyebones: Our 2017 class now has a 4.24 average star rating. On signing day will it be higher or lower? BG: Hard to see it rising because every four-star kid they take makes the average go down. This is going to be an amazing class when all is said and done. Maybe they take all five-stars going forward and it goes up?  JohnCarrollBuckeye: Bill will Okudah be a safety or corner for Ohio State? BG: I think he starts at safety when Malik Hooker goes to the NFL.  WraithBuck: Bill, can you and are you willing to share the best advice you have been given in the sports writing business and in life? BG: The people that know me could tell you I'm a pretty simple guy and not complicated at all. I've been blessed with a great family and great friends. My dad was like me in a lot of ways. His advice to all of us kids was "treat people like you want to be treated and work your tail off." And that's what I've tried to pass on to my kids. I've done well in this business because I've tried to always do those things. I know I'm not the smartest person around, not the best writer, not the best talent evaluator, not the best photographer, or the best interviewer. But I try to treat people well, and I work as hard as I can every day.  buckeyeinsc: Kind of like picking a person to make a putt with a championship or money on the line (Nicklaus, Tiger, etc.)...if you had to WIN one game in College Football be it massive rivalry game, Championship, etc...who would you chose? BG: I think Nick Saban is on his way to being the best college coach of all time. Four out of seven national titles is amazing, and that number might keep growing over the next few years. He has a chance to continue this run as long as he wants to keep grinding away. I'll take him.  bridgette: Living here in Los Angeles I have been able to see Wyatt Davis play a few times.  This guy seems REALLY good to me!  I don't see any way he's not one of our best five lineman next year.  Am I missing something? BG: I saw him in Cincinnati earlier this year and was sold on him after watching 3-4 plays. I think he just might battle for Elflein's spot next year as a true freshman.  BuckeyePavs: Bill, did you ever see Omar Provitt play? One of the best that never was....He was better than Mario Manningham and Lynn Bowden. BG: I saw him play more than once and agree with you that he was amazing. Great hoops player as well. Saw him last year at Warren Harding and told him how much I admired his play when he was in high school. He was a great receiver who would have killed it in the spread offenses of today. Just an amazing talent. Put out this tweet last year from the game I saw him.  Bill Greene?@BillBankGreene Warren Harding honoring the 1990 state champs. Omar Provitt might be the best I've ever seen in Ohio. #Dazzling   Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter Trending on Scout Game Review: Ohio State vs Maryland Buckeye Leaves: Buckeyes Shine On Both Sides Cowboys Melt Steelers 35-30 Ohio State defeats Maryland 62-3 What We Learned In OSU Thrashing Of Terps Buckeye Sports Top Stories What We Learned In OSU Thrashing Of TerpsThe BSB staff gives you their immediate thoughts from yet another dominating Ohio State victory. by James Grega Jr. Buckeye SportsYesterday at 5:06 PM Buckeye Leaves: Buckeyes Shine On Both SidesOhio State got big performances from a plethora of players on both offense and defense in a 62-3 win over Maryland. by Tim Moody Buckeye SportsYesterday at 4:51 PM What We Learned In OSU Hoops Season OpenerOhio State topped Navy 78-68 in the season opener Nov. 11 in Annapolis, Md. by James Grega Jr. Buckeye SportsFriday at 8:59 PM OSU Men's Hoops: Bucks Beat Navy, 78-68The Ohio State men's basketball opens the season with a 78-68 win over Navy in the third annual Veterans Classic. by Ryan McGlade Buckeye SportsFriday at 8:05 PM View From The Fan: OSU Rolling Into MarylandBuckeyeSports.com subscriber Ben van Ooyen's weekly column "View From The Fan" continues with a preview of the Buckeyes' road trip to Maryland. by Staff Buckeye SportsFriday at 4:35 PM Game Preview: Ohio State at Maryland Ohio State is coming off an ultra impressive win over Nebraska and now must travel to take on Maryland.

(Photo: Nathaniel Shuda/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE OSHKOSH - Visitors to downtown Oshkosh could soon see changes city officials hope will make parking easier and less of a hassle. But paid parking isn't one of them — at least not yet, anyway. The Oshkosh Common Council adopted a series of recommendations Tuesday from Walker Parking Consultants that include spending $10,000 for about 30 signs that more clearly identify public parking areas. It also will revamp its "minimalist" parking website to include easy-to-access information about parking rules, permits, on-street parking and citations, as well as searchable GIS and interactive maps. RELATED: City to mull downtown parking options RELATED: Oshkosh gets input on central city strategy However, councilors held off on deciding whether to bring back paid on-street parking downtown and install pay stations on every block, citing concerns about the $400,000 price tag, potential negative feedback from the public and that opinions about paid parking ebb and flow too often. "I support 90 percent of the plan, but I don’t believe our citizens are going to be happy about going downtown and having to pay to park when they can go to Target and Walmart, all the other stores and pay nothing," Councilor Steve Herman said. "I know the BID supports it, but they're also the ones that wanted (paid) parking removed 10 years ago or 15 years ago," Herman said. "Are we going to spend all this money (to) put the pay stations in and all that and 10 years later, another council's going to say 'nuh uh'?" The Downtown Oshkosh Business Improvement District, which was created in 1987 in an effort to keep parking downtown, supports the plan and says it will contribute to the cost of the pay station program — about half the $400,000 or $20,000 a year for 10 years, City Manager Mark Rohloff said. "When we met with them, we told them ... they needed to make a good-faith effort for this to happen," Rohloff said. "As we explained it to the BID, there had to be something that the BID was going to continue to do to support parking." RELATED: Oshkosh council OKs grant for strategy study Downtown BID board members unanimously endorsed the recommendations, in the hopes that the plan would create a new source of revenue for parking improvements, said Jim Collins, the city's transportation director. "I'm struggling with spending almost half a million dollars (for parking stations), knowing potentially we're still going to be under water," Deputy Mayor Deb Allison-Aasby said. "When it comes to the expenditure of that, I'm going to struggle with that until somebody can provide some information that would sway me in that." Councilors directed Rohloff and city staff to reach out to the BID and to the city's parking utility and report back.

At about 7:30 a.m. Thursday, Pappe crashed into several parked cars in the parking lot of the Grants Pass Walmart store while driving a silver Chevrolet Suburban SUV, according to OSP, which is handling the shooting investigation. Pappe then drove in the wrong lane down Redwood Highway until he crashed into a guardrail near F Street. Pappe refused to leave his vehicle when ordered by Grants Pass police, and he could be seen holding a large knife, police said. After police attempted to negotiate with Pappe for about 20 minutes, Pappe allegedly exited the truck and headed toward officers while carrying the knife. Police said they fired a Taser and bean-bag rounds at Pappe, but the man continued to advance. Police fired multiple gunshots at Pappe, then called medics who were already staged nearby. Pappe was pronounced dead at the scene. No officers were injured during the incident, and the names of the officers involved are being withheld pending investigation, said OSP Sgt. Kyle Hove. A medical examiner and forensics investigators will determine the number of shots fired and by whom, Hove said. The report will be submitted to the Josephine County District Attorney's Office. "We look at every aspect of it," Hove said. Court records show Pappe in 2015 rammed his vehicle into the back of his foreclosed Gold Hill home because he was upset squatters were living in it. Police said he poured gasoline in the residence after threatening to burn the house down. He pleaded no contest to a felony charge of second-degree arson in the case. — Reach reporter Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or nmorgan@mailtribune.com.

(WPRI) — A popular type of protein bars are being recalled because they could be contaminated with a dangerous bacterium. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Nutrisystem bars were sold in several states, including Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as well as online on sites such as Amazon.com and Walmart.com. The chocolate chip cookie dough in the Nutricrush bars may be contaminated with listeria, which can cause serious, even fatal infections. The recalled products have an “enjoy by” date of Aug. 22, 2017 and a lot code of NF082216A. Photos: Food and Drug Administration The FDA advises consumers to not eat the bars and instead return them for a full refund.

Prosecutors say on the night of Oct. 5, 95-year-old Thomas Harty was beaten and stabbed to death, and 77-year-old Joanna Fisher was beaten, nearly suffocated and survived a knife wound to the throat. Fisher remains in the hospital. According to Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan, Fisher told investigators that she and her husband were watching television when a pair of suspects invaded their home, launched a savage attack and fled with credit cards, cash and the couple's 2003 Toyota station wagon. Joshua Hart, 23, and Brittany Smith, 27, both of Athol, were arraigned Friday in Orange District Court, where they pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and a host of other charges. The pair were arrested Oct. 7 after fleeing to Virginia. Sullivan, Assistant District Attorney Jeremy Bucci and Orange Police Chief Craig Lundgren spoke to reporters after the arraignment and revealed details of the attack. According to a statement of alleged facts released by Sullivan's office: • The home invasion lasted for approximately two hours. Hart immediately attacked Harty and stabbed him with a knife. Smith struck and pushed Fisher from her wheelchair to the floor. Smith stabbed Fisher and cut her throat. The two unsuccessfully tried to suffocate Fisher. They ransacked the home in search of money, took credit cards, a cellphone and cash, and fled the scene in the older couple's station wagon. • Harty died after suffering stab wounds and being suffocated with a pillow. • Fisher crawled in an effort to call for help. She learned that the suspects had disabled the phone and stolen Harty's cellphone. She took refuge within her home until health care workers made a scheduled visit around 9 a.m. on Oct. 6. The workers summoned help and Fisher was transported to the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. • Fisher described to police a white male, 5-foot-8 or 5-foot-9, with facial hair, and a female who was slender with dark hair and dark eyes. • Within hours of the home invasion, a purchase was attempted at a Walmart in the Worcester area using a credit card stolen from Harty. A transaction for the same merchandise was then made using a debit card stolen from Fisher. • Video surveillance at Walmart showed a vehicle matching the description of the Toyota, and a man and woman matching the description of the suspects. Investigators recognized the pair as Hart and Smith.   • On Friday night, Oct. 7, Massachusetts State Police attached to the Northwestern district attorney's office obtained arrest warrants for larceny of a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property, and activated them in a national warrant database. • On Saturday morning, Oct. 8, members of the Rockridge County Sheriff's Department in Virginia arrested Hart and Smith without incident in a U-Haul parked in a Walmart parking lot. • Hart admitted to Rockridge officials and Massachusetts State Police that he had murdered Harty and had tried to help Smith kill Fisher. Smith admitted that she and Hart had worked together and armed themselves with a knife prior to coming to the residence. • Hart told investigators they looked at homes in the area for an older car to avoid tracking technology, and a target that would have money to help them escape. • Hart told investigators he and Smith looked in the window and saw Harty. They tried to enter through a window and failed. Both told investigators they entered the garage, found keys to the car and entered the home through a door in the garage. • Their stated motive was to avoid going to jail on a previous charge (Hart) and to avoid drug treatment (Smith) and to leave the area and start a new life. Hart and Smith are charged with murder, attempted murder, home invasion, armed robbery, conspiracy and larceny over $250. In separate dockets, they are charged with larceny of a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. Conviction on the murder charge carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. The two are held without bail pending a court date in December.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive Instagram Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

Wellness Day: Free Check-Ups, Flu Shots Oct. 15 Nearly 300,000 people were screened last year Oct 14, 2016, 4:30 pm EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wellness Day is right around the corner, offering a number of free health check-ups for those who arrive early. Source: ©iStock.com/Niloo138 4,600 of the company’s locations around the country will take part in Walmart Wellness Day, which is on Saturday, October 15. The event takes place from noon to 4 p.m. You will have access to free blood glucose and blood pressure tests, vision screenings, product samples and information on health care insurance. You don’t have to make an appointment, but make sure you show up on time. Walmart is also offering flu shots at over 10,000 pharmacies. Some are calling it the largest screening event in the nation as the retailer screened 280,000 patients in 2015. Additionally, Walmart managed to give out 52,000 flu shots and check the blood pressure of 7,000 people. One of these had such high blood pressure that he had to be rushed to the emergency room of a local hospital immediately. Another 3,000 customers were implored to see a professional in their area to check their blood glucose levels as they were simply not up to par. “We’re committed and uniquely positioned to provide accessible and affordable healthcare that helps busy families live better,” said George Riedl, senior vice president and president of health and wellness for Walmart U.S., in a statement. Walmart recently announced that it was giving entry-level managers a pay raise of more than $1,000, as well as paying overtime to those who make less than $23,660. WMT shares surged 0.5% Friday.

Chase Bryan Little, 31, and Colton Tye Leblanc, 24, were charged with felony assault with hate-crime enhancements in the attack on Maan Singh Khalsa. A man previously identified as a suspect, Dustin Albarado of Louisiana, was cleared of criminal liability, said Simon O’Connell, Contra Costa County deputy district attorney “The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsa’s unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law,” O’Connell said in a statement.

The men were in the East Bay for contract assignments at the Chevron refinery in Richmond. Little is from Beaumont, Texas, while Lablanc is from Winnie, Texas. The confrontation unfolded the night of Sept. 25 as Khalsa, 41, was leaving a Richmond Walmart and stopped at a red light at the intersection of Blume and Hilltop drives. A white, four-door truck with five men inside pulled up next to Khalsa, and a man in the back seat threw a half-empty beer can at him, Khalsa told police. Khalsa told officers he said, “You forgot something,” as he got out of his car and threw the can back at the truck. The men in the truck started screaming and cursing at him, and as soon as Khalsa left the intersection, driving east on Hilltop Drive, the truck followed him, officials said. At an intersection before the Interstate 80 overpass, the truck again pulled up to Khalsa, who sensed something wasn’t right and called 911. Before police could arrive, according prosecutors, two men in the back seat got out of the truck and began punching Khalsa in the face through his open window while yelling profanities at him and knocking off his turban — an important part of Sikhism that’s made some of its wearers targets of violent anti-Muslim bias by people confusing the two religions. After they were done beating him, one of the men yelled, “cut his f— hair off,” Khalsa told police. Little used a knife to cut Khalsa’s hair and stab Khalsa in the hand as he tried to protect himself, officials said.

Eventually, after making a number of quick turns, Khalsa was able to get away as he began blacking out from the pummeling. “No community should be attacked because of their faith, ethnicity, gender or sexuality,” said Harsimran Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which had pressed for the hate crime charges. Little is out on bail, and a bench warrant will be issued for Leblanc, O’Connell said. Jenna Lyons and Kimberly Veklerov are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

 A new way to search for data is helping NASA's biggest brains save millions and get to space faster Matt Weinberger Oct. 14, 2016, 5:16 PM 3,466 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Orion crew capsule. NASA NASA is using a database technology popularized by Facebook to save millions just by making sure its engineers don't repeat the mistakes of the past. The same technology is directly applicable to industry, real-time analytics, the Internet of Things, and large-scale retail, too. Not too long ago, an engineer on the Orion spacecraft had a major problem, David Meza, Chief Knowledge Architect at NASA's Johnson Space Center, recently explained to Business Insider. Orion's uprighting system, which flips the returning capsule right-side-up after it splashes down in the ocean, wasn't working correctly. In tests and simulations, the capsule stayed on its side, even after hitting the water. Not great, considering it's supposed to be carrying four astronauts. Luckily, NASA maintains the so-called "Lessons Learned" system, where the agency's engineers take the lessons they've learned and contribute them to a central database. Lessons Learned spans a half-century of collective NASA engineering knowledge, all the way back to the legendary Apollo moon missions — which is good, because Apollo used a similar uprighting system to Orion. There was every possibility that somewhere in Lessons Learned was the key to fixing Orion. But that massive database is no good if you can't find anything. NASA's original web search for Lessons Learned couldn't turn anything up; even NASA's History Office only turned up 3 relevant files in eight days of looking. The Orion team even visited retired Apollo astronauts at home to see if maybe they had anything useful in their attics. NASA Chief Knowledge Architect David Meza Screenshot/YouTube That's where Meza and his team came in. Meza had been experimenting with a new, smarter, data-driven approach to sifting the Lessons Learned database. Within three hours, Meza's better Lessons Learned had come up with 30 relevant documents. One the first 10 documents had cure for what ailed Orion. The mission was back on track. Meza says the engineer approached him afterwards: Without that information, NASA would have had to spend 2 years and millions of dollars building a second Orion uprighting system just to test, delaying its 2023 launch further.  Graph search Meza cites the Orion case as a big reason why his team has embraced a newer kind of database, growing in popularity among developers, called a "graph database," a term first popularized by Neo Technology. Neo makes the Neo4j software, used by customers including Marriott, Monsanto, Walmart, and Meza's team at NASA.  Facebook borrowed the term for its famed "social graph," which it introduced in 2007. In fact, Facebook is a great example of a graph database: Everything is defined by relationships.  Mark Zuckerberg explains the Facebook social graph. Justin Sullivan/Getty Your profile is instantly and invisibly linked to everybody who likes the same bands, foods, places you've been, songs you've listened to on Spotify, and so on. So when you search Facebook for "Friends who like Nickelback," it's basically drawing a line between your friends and people who like the band. It seems simple. But with more traditional "relational databases," which are more like giant spreadsheets, it would be impossible at Facebook's scale, or at least "really, really, really slow," says Neo4j CEO Emil Eifrem. Imagine an Excel workbook with multiple tabs, one listing all your friends, one for everybody on Facebook who likes Nickelback, and so on. Then, imagine having to compare the two databases to find a match. Then, imagine doing that for every single one of the people who visit Facebook every day. Not easy, cheap, or fast. Down to earth At NASA, Meza's team combined a Neo4j graph database with the combined know-how of a data science specialist and a web developer to come up with a better, smarter way to search the Lessons Learned database. Before, Lessons Learned required you to punch in a keyword, like "valve contamination," which would produce a bunch of links to documents in a spreadsheet. But there was no way to search within those documents: You'd have to download the files as they came up, one by one, and hope it was in there. By putting Lessons Learned into a graph database, combined with some magic with statistics, it became a lot simpler to link together the millions of articles in the database in a way that's just a little bit more like Wikipedia — automatically and intelligently grouping together articles based on their content and the words used therein.  A simple example of a graph database. It's all about the relationships.Neo4j It means that the NASA Lessons Learned database can make more natural connections between topics. "Valve maintenance" might lead to "water corrosion" might lead to "fire hazards," based on cross-indexed words in the article. It means engineers can spend less time guessing the magic words to make their answer appear and get back to work on Orion.  Intriguingly, the International Consortium of Independent Journalists used Neo4j to similar ends, putting the Panama Papers leak into a graph so hundreds of reporters from around the world could sort the data and come up with blistering reveals on the effects of offshoring capital on the global economy.  World domination Graph databases are broadly applicable past Meza's brand of knowledge management, as well. It turns out that graph databases are fabulous at pattern detection: Going back to the Facebook example, it's pretty simple for it to guess that you might know somebody if 90% of your friends know them, too. Similarly, if half of your friends like Taco Bell on Facebook, it's not that hard to extrapolate that you might, as well.   That's why Amazon built its own graph database system, called Dynamo, early on in its development to power its famed recommendation engine. If a book has lots of attributes in common (author, subject matter, publisher) with something a customer bought, Dynamo can go through that graph and guess that you might like it.  Neo Technology CEO Emil Eifrem Neo4j "The graph can be people connected to other people, or it can be other things," explains Eifrem. In a business context, graph databases are fabulous for fraud detection, for the same reasons. Instead of looking for characteristics of a person or product, you're looking for characteristics of a credit card transaction. All the transactions made to or from, say, specific accounts are all connected to each other. So if one is fraudulent, all the connections probably are, too.  Graph databases are a newer way of looking at data — not just the data, but how each point relates to each other. NASA is using it to move faster; Amazon and Walmart are using it for commerce. Either way, Facebook might be the most visible graph out there, but it's not the only one. "We're just living in an increasingly connected world," says Eifrem. SEE ALSO: So What The Heck Is The 'Social Graph' Facebook Keeps Talking About?

Here are three trends to watch when the company reports third-quarter earnings. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 14, 2016 at 4:35PM Image source: Getty Images. Some people say a lot. Some say very little. Companies can exhibit similar tendencies. Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) doesn't file all that frequently with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and its press releases can be few and far between, so keeping up with the company between quarterly reports can be harder than keeping up with some of its peers. Sept. 30 has come and gone, and with the books closed on the company's third quarter, I thought it to be a good time to review events in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. A winner in every quarter Main Street Capital is a business development company (BDC), which is a special type of financial company that makes money by lending to and investing in small businesses in the United States. Most investments come in the form of debt, while a smaller portion takes the form of equity. The debt investments provide routine interest income, where equity offers upside (or downside) in the form of capital gains or losses. Main Street Capital has sold a company at a significant realized gain in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Calendar Quarter Company Realized Gain 1Q 2016 Southern RV $14.4 million 2Q 2016 Samba Safety $28.4 million 3Q 2016 Travis Acquisition $17.9 million Total   $60.7 million Data source: Company investor relations and SEC filings. The most recent exit of Travis Acquisition was detailed in an Oct. 6 press release, though the acquirer noted in its own press release that the transaction closed on Sept. 30, the last day of Main Street Capital's third quarter. It is great to see a BDC sell portfolio companies at a gain, especially when the sales price is in excess of its most recent valuations. In an ideal world, all BDCs would generate gains on their equity investments in excess of their losses, and, most importantly, turn those gains into cash by selling their stakes to someone else. Of course, BDCs control when they realize gains, and they also control when they realize losses.  What about the losers? Winners are frequently balanced with losers, and all BDCs will have losers. The only way to bat 1.000 is to buy risk-free U.S. Treasuries and hold them to maturity. The most difficult question to answer for any BDC is just how much of its capital losers will consume over the long haul. For Main Street, there are some losers to worry about, namely the companies in its portfolio that are most exposed to energy prices. After all, its realized gains in 2016 have come from companies outside the energy industry. Realized losses from its energy-exposed investments could very easily offset its non-energy gains, and then some. Direct exposure is relatively easy to measure -- it reports that energy-related companies (oil and gas production and equipment and services companies) made up about 7.7% of assets at the end of the last quarter. Much more difficult to quantify is its indirect energy exposure. Located in Houston, Main Street has naturally invested in companies that operate in areas where energy companies are important drivers of the local economy. Energy is to Houston and surrounding areas what Wal-Mart is to Bentonville, Arkansas. Though Bentonville's best car mechanic may not collect a paycheck from Wal-Mart, its performance certainly has an impact on local demand for his services. You get the point. I've been keeping an eye on some of its indirect exposure by keeping tabs on the dividends Main Street Capital earns from its portfolio companies. Operating earnings from recurring sources of income weakened over the last year, and the company is increasingly relying on dividends from its investments to pay dividends to its shareholders. Some portfolio companies that do not have a direct link to oil prices -- they aren't in the business of drilling for oil -- have indirect exposure to oil prices, and have been writing smaller dividend checks to Main Street in recent quarters. Main Street's three-part health exam When Main Street Capital reports earnings on Nov. 4, there are a few trends investors should pay particularly close attention to. The first is the most obvious: How does Main Street Capital's operating income compare to its current dividends it pays investors? Dividend coverage has deteriorated, and it's walking a very fine line on covering its routine dividends to shareholders with recurring operating income. Second, how much of the company's recurring earnings are non-cash in nature? Notably, non-cash payment in kind (PIK) interest nearly doubled in the first six months of 2016 from the first six months of 2015, and now makes up about 5.5% of its operating income. PIK income is interest or dividend income that is paid in additional debt or equity securities rather than cash. Stressed borrowers often elect (when allowed) to "pay" interest to their creditors by rolling the interest into the loan. Cash is always preferably to PIK.  Finally, Main Street Capital's dividend income earned from its equity investments is an excellent barometer for the health of the companies in which it owns an equity stake. Fluctuations in dividend income earned from its equity investments will likely foreshadow gains or losses in its investment portfolio. As with any high-yield stock in the financial industry, I believe investors' time and energy are best spent trying to rule out risks to the downside rather than painting rosy pictures of what the upside could be. If you can rule out the risks, the upside will roll in as monthly dividends. Main Street's quantity of operating earnings (net investment income) and the quality of its earnings (cash vs. non-cash income) should take a front seat, particularly as dividend coverage has been trending in the wrong direction.     Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The deep investment in big data gathering and analytics is fueled by an ability to create added value for companies based on actionable business insights, and to create added value for consumers by providing lifestyle benefits. While gathering and analyzing data comes at a substantial cost, the return can be great for businesses and impacts almost every facet of business operations. Targeted and Timely Marketing Big data's marketing promise is companies working together on analytics for tailored marketing capabilities that reach the right people at the right time. Predictive analysis can provide more targeted advertising, on-device couponing, service reminders in vehicles or appliances, or more rewarding perks and programs based on actual usage trends. Through data-driven insights, brands can take advantage of cross-sell and upsell opportunities. Other marketing and sales tactics include more targeted and timely offers to increase a brand's ability to attract new customers, and to retain those they already have. Value-added services improve the customer experience in ways that garner greater customer loyalty. Companies that know their customers better have a competitive advantage: They can deploy a highly targeted offer rapidly -- often faster than their competitors. Media services such as Netflix and Pandora have disrupted their industries not just through their streaming models, but through the ways they have innovated personalized recommendations that significantly increase duration of engagement. In the retail sector, near real-time analysis of both in-store and online purchasing behaviors leads to faster insights into demand shifts. Stores can adjust merchandise stock levels, pricing and bundled offers to take advantage of shifts before their competitors do. Amazon and Walmart employ big data analytics to optimize their supply chains, resulting in improved product availability and delivery to the consumer. Retailers also use video analytics and data from consumers' mobile devices to analyze in-store shopping patterns and adjust store layout to optimize traffic flow and product placement. Anticipating Customer Service Needs The volume and velocity of quality performance data, coupled with always-on connectivity, enables improved customer service. Machine-to-machine automation enables the real-time aggregation of performance data from thousands of devices. That in turn enables the rapid deployment of over-the-air application updates to address error codes and security threats, or to deliver enhanced services based on actual usage. Convenient access to their account, service, and delivery information is becoming a standard customer expectation. When brands respond quickly to anticipate and manage customer expectations, that improves their experience. Communication systems that enable the choice of mediums and provide automated or personalized messages for customer service or product updates reduce the number of in-bound customer service calls and increase overall satisfaction. The expensive, time-consuming and often risky process of product research and development is enhanced when consumer data, quality-of-performance data, and predictive analytics can be integrated across marketing, product design, manufacturing and testing. By enabling concurrent engineering and advanced modeling of product usage, companies can streamline time to market significantly, while improving product quality and chances of adoption. Revolutionizing Business Models The availability of product usage data also is pushing new data-driven business models. Access to device data provides original equipment manufacturers the opportunity to transform a traditional relationship with their customers. They can shift it from a one-off sale to an ongoing relationship that can take advantage of upsell opportunities and offer services that generate recurring monthly or annual revenue streams. Companies leveraging connectivity to introduce new business models include the following: Uber's simple but profound idea for connecting "I need a ride" people to "I'm looking for a fare" drivers resulted in a disruptive data-driven business that is revolutionizing public transportation. In the insurance industry, access to actual driving data, such as speed, braking pressure and cornering behaviors allows insurers to create better risk profiles for individual policy premiums. Insurers like Progressive are using usage-based insurance premiums to lure the best drivers away from competitors. Streaming music service Spotify leverages 600 Gigabytes of user-centric data per day to provide music recommendations or select the next song heard on its service. While some companies collect and manage user and device data internally, a host of Data as a Service and Analytics as a Service companies have emerged. These companies collect and aggregate data from an array of mostly free -- often social media -- data sources, and deliver the data to B2B customers via an API or Web dashboard. The sheer volume, real-time velocity, and variety of largely unstructured data being generated by smart home products make almost any data calculation a big data calculation. Companies are still trying to figure out how to translate all of this data into real business value, but the opportunity is there for applications in marketing, customer service and new business models.

CBS Boston reports that Joshua Hart, 23, and Brittany Smith, 27, were ordered held without bail at their arraignments on first-degree murder and several other charges in Orange District Court. The suspects are accused of killing 94-year-old Thomas Harty and severely wounding his wife, 77-year-old Joanna Fisher, in the couple’s home on October 5. Investigators said Hart and Smith attacked and robbed complete strangers. “These folks were minding their own business. They were living their life, they were watching TV that night,” said Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan. “It was a home invasion of such epic proportions, it lasted almost two hours.” Harty was stabbed and suffocated with a pillow. Fisher was also cut and the two tried, but failed, to suffocate her, authorities said. She was left for dead and Hart and Smith stole the couple’s 2003 Toyota Corolla station wagon and drove off, according to the D.A. Surveillance at a WalMart in Worcester showed Hart and Smith allegedly used the couple’s stolen credit card just hours later, according to CBS Boston. Three days later they were found in a U-Haul truck that was parked in a WalMart parking lot in Rockbridge, Virginia, and arrested. Authorities also revealed the motive for the first time Friday. “This particular crime is alleged to have occurred because neither Miss Smith nor Mr. Hart wanted to return to jail or drug treatment,” said prosecutor Jeremy Bucci. Hart was afraid that his involvement in a stolen motor vehicle case earlier in the week would result in him being brought back to jail in either Massachusetts or Pennsylvania, Bucci said. Smith was due to be arraigned in the same stolen motor vehicle case and was also scheduled to report to drug treatment on Thursday, October 6. “They were looking for an older model vehicle without a tracking device inside of it, so that they could make good on their escape and they hoped that they could recover some money to help them escape,” Bucci said. “It is, without a doubt, that this crime was senseless,” Sullivan said.

Photo / Getty Images He already runs the world's biggest online shopping company, but Alibaba founder Jack Ma is not satisfied. The Chinese billionaire has unveiled an even more ambitious plan to expand the company's reach across the globe, creating 100 million new jobs and transforming the global economy to create a more equitable world. It may sound pie-in-the-sky, but the goal forms part of mission statement of the $369.5 billion (US$261 billion) company's visionary executive chairman. In a letter to shareholders, Mr Ma outlined Alibaba's achievements of the past financial year - including a gross merchandise turnover of more than $632 million (1 trillion RMB), an "unprecedented" figure - before looking to the future. "We have more than 430 million annual active buyers, which means one out of every three individuals in China has made a purchase on our retail marketplaces," Ma wrote. But, he said, while proud of Alibaba's online shopping achievements, "we want to do far more", saying that the benefits of globalisation had not been spread evenly, but that "digital disruption will bring us closer to a level playing field for young people and small businesses". "We are not merely trying to shift buy/sell transactions from offline to online, nor are we changing conventional digital marketing models to squeeze out a little additional profit," he wrote. "We are working to create the fundamental digital and physical infrastructure for the future of commerce, which includes marketplaces, payments, logistics, cloud computing, big data and a host of other fields." The Alibaba group of companies, founded in 1999, accounts for 60 per cent of all Chinese online sales, and this year overtook Walmart as the world's largest retailer. Continued below.

THE NEW 'NATURAL RESOURCE' It's through cloud computing that Alibaba aims to expand its reach, and the company has been investing in the technology as part of a strategy that sees shoppers' data as the contemporary equivalent of mineral riches. "Over the next 30 years, with computing power as the new 'technology breakthrough' and data as the new 'natural resource,' the landscape of retail, financial services, manufacturing and entertainment will be transformed," Ma wrote, forecasting a decades-long period of transformation. "The internet revolution is a historical inflection point, much like when electricity was introduced, and it may have an even greater impact," he predicted. Alibaba's mission, he said, was to "empower merchants with the ability to transform and upgrade their businesses for the future" and "help companies all over the world to grow". "We believe, the commerce infrastructure we have created in China - marketplaces, payments, logistics, cloud computing and big data, all working in concert - can be applied on a global scale to lift up small and medium businesses and ordinary consumers around the world." We have more than 430 million annual active buyers, which means one out of every three individuals in China has made a purchase on our retail marketplaces. Jack Ma, Alibaba founder Eight years after launching, Alibaba Cloud hosts 35 per cent of Chinese websites, while delivering cloud computing and big data services. And the company is ramping up its Australian operations, with a Melbourne office set to open at the end of this year with the aim of signing up more local businesses to its online platforms. Companies like Bellamy's, Blackmores, Chemist Warehouse and Woolworths have already jumped on board, setting up shop on Alibaba's Tmall Global to gain access to the lucrative Chinese market. Tmall Global has 260 million registered shoppers. Jessica Rudd opened a store on the platform last year, selling organic Australian mother and baby products under her Jessica's Suitcase brand, turning over more than $100,000 in its first month. Alibaba's regional managing director Maggie Zhou wants Australia to climb the global rankings on Tmall Global, where it is currently the fifth biggest seller country in the world with 1300 brands represented. It is already number two on Taobao Global, which taps into the network of Chinese resellers known as daigou. '100 MILLION NEW JOBS' Ma said Alibaba was constantly adapting to the changing e-commerce environment, as staying at the forefront of innovation was key to its continued success. "In the coming years, we anticipate the birth of a re-imagined retail industry driven by the integration of online, offline, logistics and data across a single value chain," he said. "With e-commerce itself rapidly becoming a "traditional business," pure e-commerce players will soon face tremendous challenges." A shift to mobile revenue was one such change, he said, with mobile climbing from a single-digit percentage to three-years of total revenue from Alibaba's Chinese retail marketplaces, in the space of two years. "This is why we are adapting, and it's why we strive to play a major role in the advancement of this new economic environment," Mr Ma said. Innovations like Alibaba's Qianniu app, which helps online businesses to improve sales and marketing while enhancing efficiency, were an example of the type of projects the company aimed to focus on. "In 20 years, we hope to serve two billion consumers around the world, empower 10 million profitable businesses and create 100 million jobs," Mr Ma said, adding: "This will be an even more difficult journey than the one behind us." - news.com.au By Dana McCauley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Westend61 / Getty Images When you think of giving birth, you probably picture doing it in a hospital bed, at a birthing center, or maybe at home in a tub full of water. Instead of having her new baby in one of those expected settings, a woman named Cecelia Rivas suddenly gave birth to Matias, her third child, at a Utah Walmart. What's more, she was the epitome of an excellent customer, making sure to pay for her purchases before the baby came out. Rivas gave birth next to a cash register with the help of store employees shortly before 7:00 A.M. on Sunday. "When she went to the register, she was in distress, on her knees holding her stomach," the store’s manager, Dustin Haight, told ABC News. "Just before she went into full labor, she insisted on paying for her merchandise," he said. "We weren’t really interested in taking her money at [that] point, but she insisted...she paid and then had the baby. You can’t make that up. It was pretty funny." Rivas told the Daily Herald that she first felt contractions around 2:00 A.M. on Sunday and realized she didn’t have everything she needed for the baby. So, after insisting that her husband stay behind with their other children, she decided to go out and buy the necessary items. She felt her labor pains getting stronger at about 5:30 A.M., while she was checking out, but her water suddenly broke and she could feel the baby’s head. Rivas says she was “really surprised and really scared” but thanked everyone who helped her through the process. Carrie Coleman, M.D., an ob/gyn at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells SELF that these births are “not completely uncommon.” Lauren Streicher, M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, agrees and tells SELF that, while still rare, speedy childbirths happen in unexpected places more often than you’d think. She’s had patients deliver on their front lawns, in the elevator on the way to labor and delivery, and on the toilet. Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF that the majority of women who deliver this way have had a previous birth. “You can assume that the baby just came too fast,” she says. It’s pretty common for women to have a second, third, and subsequent babies faster than they did during their first delivery, Coleman explains. According to Streicher, your cervix opens faster during subsequent deliveries, which is why the birth process is typically a lot quicker. Contractions also work a little better after the first time around, she says, and may be less intense than they were during a first delivery. “Someone can have mild contractions—the kind you can sleep through—and by the time you start to have [strong] labor pains, the baby could be literally ready to come out,” she says. Your body also figures out the drill over time. “By the third birth, there is a lot of ‘memory’ in the pelvic floor, and the body responds to the forces of labor more quickly, so the patient can miss the opportunity to respond,” Whelihan says. That’s why ob/gyns on call will typically ask a patient in labor if this is their first pregnancy. “If it’s not, you’re going to have them come in sooner than you would if it was a first pregnancy,” Streicher says. Otherwise, a doctor may end up coaching a partner through the delivery process over the phone while the baby is born on the side of the road. “I can’t tell you how many times that’s happened,” Streicher says.

Tax cuts mean budget cuts, so what suffers is education, infrastructure and all kinds of things government does to make our lives better and our local businesses stronger. Republicans argue that pushing wealth and income to the top few has a "trickle down" effect. They say wealthy people (like Paris Hilton) are "makers" who "create jobs" and therefore deserve to have heaps of money pushed their way for their benefit. They say that government spending on things that make the lives of We the People better really just makes us into "takers." But in reality, policies that push more and more of our country's resources into the largest hands put our smaller hands at even more of a disadvantage. The giant corporations have huge advantages over small, local businesses just due to their size; huge tax breaks on top of their size-given advantages just make it that much harder for smaller businesses to compete. So the "WalMart business model" of undercutting and bankrupting a community's small businesses and draining entire regions of wealth gains even more power. After decades of these "trickle down" policies, this is also known as "look around you." Trump's Tax Plan Means Fewer Customers With Money To Spend At Local Businesses The Main Street Alliance is a "is a national network of small business coalitions" that "works to provide small businesses a voice on the most pressing public policy issues across the nation." (Donate here.) - Advertisement - A Main Street Alliance blog post by Stephen Rouzer, "Donald Trump's Revised Tax Plan Won't Work for Main Street," begins, "The latest version of Donald Trump's ever-changing tax plan is facing scrutiny from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Main Street Alliance leaders. The plan, one that features across the board tax cuts, disproportionately benefits the highest-income earners, those grossing more than $1 million annually." This description of Trump's plans as a huge benefit to the wealthiest is based on a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) post explaining a Tax Policy Center (TPC) analysis of Donald Trump's tax proposals. The CBPP post, "Revised Trump Tax Plan Heavily Tilted Toward Wealthiest, Tax Policy Center Analysis Shows" explains how the analysis shows that Trump's tax cut raise the after-tax income of the already-wealthy by another 14% or more, while hardly benefiting the rest of us -- or even cutting the take-home incomes of the poorest. This would seriously affect small, local businesses. Rouzer explains how passing so much to the top few while starving the rest of us means local businesses have fewer customers with money to spend: "A 2015 report released by the Main Street Alliance, "Voices of Main Street," surveyed over 1000 small business owners and found that 52 percent of respondents cited 'more customers' as the most important key to increasing small business success. Doubling the number of respondents that said 'lower taxes' and more than quadrupling the number that responded 'fewer regulations.' - Advertisement - "Tax cuts skewed towards the wealthy elite starve our communities of much-needed resources while further tilting the scales towards large corporations and the rich." Rouzer concludes with some great comments from business owners: "'To level the playing field for Main Street businesses our tax code must no longer skew in favor of large corporations and their shareholders,' said Deborah Field, the owner of Paperjam Press in Portland, Oregon, and a former corporate tax accountant. 'Without holding multinational corporations accountable to pay what they owe and first providing relief to low and middle-income earners we shouldn't begin to consider tax cuts for the rich.'

Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Flipkart, the country’s largest home-grown e-commerce company, is slated to hit the road this quarter to raise a fresh round of capital, Mint reported this week. It hopes to raise at least $500 million and up to $1 billion, the report said citing unnamed sources. The report follows an earlier one in the Economic Times that said, also citing unnamed sources, that Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is in talks to buy a stake in the Bengaluru-based company. Any kind of fund-raising by Flipkart is always something of an event in India’s start-up market. There are many who will insist otherwise. Flipkart, they argue, is no longer the benchmark for either funding or valuations. A lot of venture capitalists I meet also frequently complain about the media’s “unhealthy obsession” with reporting on start-up fund-raising at the exclusion of everything else, thus turning all matters funding into an event. But, here’s why start-up fund-raising and Flipkart’s in particular is so important. Between 2007 and 2015, venture capital-backed companies in India raised more than $15 billion from a variety of investors including venture capital firms, hedge funds and strategic investors, according to data compiled by VCCEdge. Flipkart, which started up in 2007, alone accounts for over $3 billion or roughly 20% of the overall capital drawn during this period. It has raised that money at astounding valuations. When it last raised capital, $700 million in July last year, its valuation was reported at $15.2 billion. In July, India’s venture capital market was still riding an unprecedented valuation wave and Flipkart was its flag-bearer. Things have changed since. The market has undergone a valuation correction. Again, Flipkart has led the way. Over the past few months, several foreign mutual funds that hold minority stakes in the company have successively marked down the value of their shares. Last reported, the e-commerce company’s valuation was estimated at around $9-10 billion. With the e-commerce sector bellwether falling out of favour with investors, the valuations and fund-raising prospects of several others in the market have been impacted one way or the other. The reported upcoming Flipkart fund-raising is interesting on two counts. One, the valuation at which it raises the next round of capital is going to influence future capital inflows into the e-commerce sector, the poster child of the ongoing start-up wave in the country. It could raise $1 billion at a valuation of $9-10 billion or more or it may muster just $500 million at a drastically lower valuation. Either way, it will give the e-commerce company, which is desperately battling Seattle based e-tailing giant Amazon for market dominance here, the runway to still prove to its investors that it can deliver the goods. Two, Flipkart’s success in raising funds, hopefully at a more than decent valuation, equally extends the runway for India’s venture capitalists. Also Read: The endgame for venture investing in India After more than 10 years of continuous investing, the venture capital market is yet to deliver a single blockbuster exit. Most firms active here have raised and deployed successive funds over the years without much to show so far in terms of returning profits to their investors. Let’s take a closer look at how much the top-rung firms currently manage between them. The 12 most active firms that invest from dedicated India funds have raised over $12 billion till date, based on data compiled from media reports and the websites of venture capital firms. Sequoia Capital India alone accounts for about $3 billion. It raised a massive $920 million fund earlier this year. Second in the pecking order, in terms of size, is Nexus Venture Partners, which now has more than $1 billion in funds under management. Next is Matrix Partners India with $710 million, followed by SAIF Partners at $700 million. These 12 firms represent investors who invest across the seed and alphabet rounds (Series A, B and C). Most of the capital they’ve raised has already been deployed, mostly in the consumer Internet sector. The concern for these investors and in turn for the start-up market is bringing in the next $12 billion. It is true that most of these venture capital firms have enough capital in reserve to see them through the next 2-3 years. But, after that the next tranche of funds will depend on a number of factors. How soon will the Indian start-up market begin to deliver supernormal returns on the investments that have been made so far? Will the flag-bearers of the current start-up wave go the distance and justify the investments made so far? How many among the 12 firms that have raised and deployed the $12 billion will survive? These are questions that don’t have easy answers yet. The Indian venture capital market is still young and the best assets are yet to be created. For that, uninterrupted access to early stage funds is paramount. The obsession with funding, Flipkart and valuations is going to be around for a while. There will always be time later to talk about the other stuff. Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint. She contributes stories on venture capital and private equity.

Todd Schnuck succeeded his brother Scott Schnuck (not pictured) as chief executive of Schnuck Markets, Inc. in 2014. Hucker became chief operating officer and president. Photo By David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Schnucks, one of the biggest grocery chains in St. Louis, is the target of a boycott, faces a potential strike and has, in recent weeks, managed to anger some local nonprofit groups. Now the company is embroiled in a fight with one of its former top executives. Former Schnuck Markets president Anthony Hucker has filed suit against the chain and CEO Todd Schnuck for breach of contract, alleging he was terminated without cause after he was offered the CEO job at Save-A-Lot a year ago. In the lawsuit pending in St. Louis County Circuit Court, Hucker accuses the Maryland Heights-based company and Todd Schnuck of intentionally interfering with his employment prospects after Schnuck refused to waive a non-compete agreement Hucker signed when he was hired. After he was offered the CEO position at Earth City-based Save-A-Lot in October 2015, Hucker alleges that he approached Todd Schnuck, asking him to waive his non-compete agreement. Save-A-Lot, which is owned by Eden Prairie, Minn.-based SuperValu, has more than 1,300 stores in multiple states. After his meeting with Schnuck, Hucker alleges he emailed Schnuck to say he was willing to remain at Schnuck Markets if the company was unwilling to waive the non-compete agreement. “Todd Schnuck never responded, either verbally or in writing,” the lawsuit states. Instead of waiving the non-compete, Hucker was terminated without cause in November 2015, according to Hucker’s attorney Jerome Dobson, and caused him to lose the opportunity to be CEO of Save-A-Lot. “As a result of defendants’ tortious interference, (Hucker) has suffered lost wages, benefits of employment, and other employment compensation,” the lawsuit filed Sept. 22 says. A spokesman for Schnuck Markets said the company was aware of the lawsuit but did not comment on pending litigation. Hucker previously worked in leadership positions at Aldi, Wal-Mart Stores and Giant Food before joining Schnuck Markets’ executive ranks in 2013. Founded in 1939, Schnuck Markets has 99 stores in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa. When Hucker was promoted to president in September 2014, he became the chain’s first non-family member to hold the position. Non-compete agreements typically bar an employee from taking another job at a competitor, but Hucker doesn’t view Save-A-Lot, a discount grocery chain, as a competitor to Schnucks, according to his attorney.

Schnucks’ competitors are Dierbergs stores.” Dobson did not specify an exact figure Hucker is seeking to recover, which includes severance, but said it was in excess of $100,000. “They terminated him, refused to pay him his severance and they wouldn’t release him from his non-compete,” Dobson said. Tucker moved to Florida after leaving Schnuck Markets and earlier this year was named chief operating officer of Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of multiple grocery chains operating in seven southeastern states, including Winn-Dixie and Harveys. The legal dispute is the latest controversy facing Schnucks, which is privately held. On Sunday, Schnucks completed the layoff of warehouse employees first announced in April that led to one of its unions, Teamsters Local 688, to boycott the chain beginning in June. After Local 688 union members’ picketing at the entrances of Schnucks stores protesting the layoffs, in August, the grocer ended its long-standing policy of allowing solicitors to stand at its doors. The solicitation ban drew criticism from groups including the Salvation Army that had raised funds for charity for years at the retailer. A Schnucks spokesman said earlier this year that the solicitation ban was not related to the union dispute but, rather, a redirection of its charity efforts from the front of the store to its My Schnucks Card (eScrip) fundraising program. Schnucks also is in the midst of a contract dispute with its largest union, Local 655 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents thousands of checkers, stockers and other employees. Last month, Local 655 employees voted to reject Schnucks’ contract proposal and authorize a strike, and contract negotiations are continuing. The union said Friday that it planned to hold an employee meeting the week of Oct. 24 with an update on contract negotiations. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

(Mark Gail/The Washington Post) By Emma Brown October 14 Follow @emmersbrown They’re in demand among parents who say traditional public schools have failed — but they’re not always successful. Their intense rate of growth has fueled an equally intense debate about the role they’ll play in the future of U.S. education. Advocates see their expansion as evidence that parents have a huge appetite for school choice. Critics see the beginning of the end of public education, with systems of neighborhood schools replaced by independent, privately run companies without the same obligation to teach the toughest students. A great deal of confusion surrounds charter schools. Here are some of the myths. Myth No. 1 Charter schools are everywhere. At its national convention this year, the NAACP called for a moratorium on charter school expansion. The Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, a union-backed coalition, demands: “Stop flooding our communities with under-performing and unaccountable charter schools.” The charter debate is front and center in the education reform wars, and you’d think that they’re everywhere — a wave overtaking every community. Yes, the charter movement is growing. And charters have a significant market share in an increasing number of cities, with New Orleans (where 93 percent of students attend charters) leading the way, followed by Detroit (53 percent), Flint, Mich., (47 percent) and Washington (44 percent). Forty-three states and the District have laws allowing for charter schools. But in many parts of the country, charters are few and far between. About 3 million students are enrolled in approximately 6,800 charters, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. That’s only about 6 percent of all public school students. Eight states have no charter schools, and five have fewer than 10. The debate is loud, but the market share is still small. Myth No. 2 Charters are the brainchild of union-busting billionaires. Critics of charter schools often accuse philanthropists — including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, entrepreneur Eli Broad, hedge fund manager John Arnold and the Walton family, heirs to the Walmart fortune — of fueling the rise of charter schools and other reform projects as a way to promote free-market ideology and undermine teachers unions. In Salon early this year, Diane Ravitch (a George H.W. Bush-era federal education official who has become perhaps the nation’s most voluble charter critic) railed against Gates for using his wealth to push charters in Washington state. In the Huffington Post, Bill Bigelow argued that Charles and David Koch are involved with school reform because “they hate public schools.” It is true that deep-pocketed foundations have played a key role in the expansion of charter schools, through contributions to charters themselves and to the ecosystem of organizations that work with such schools. But charters were originally the brainchild of teachers union stalwart Al Shanker, who served as president of the American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to 1997. Shanker proposed charter schools in 1988, arguing that they would give small groups of teachers a way to dream up new methods of reaching the students for whom traditional schools were not working. Their successes and failures would hold lessons for other schools striving to improve. The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1992. Some charters have acted as Shanker envisioned, but in many states they haven’t, rejecting requirements for teacher certification or barring collective-bargaining rights. Driven by a vision of market-based reform, charters have become not laboratories so much as competition meant to either spur traditional schools to improve or replace them. Just a few years after proposing charter schools, Shanker largely disavowed them, holding instead that schools would get better only by standardizing their goals — the same theory that underlies today’s controversial Common Core state standards . Myth No. 3 Charters are better than traditional schools. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is a big fan of expanding school choice via vouchers and charters. “We will rescue kids from failing schools,” he told the GOP convention in July. Books, articles and documentaries like “Waiting for ‘Superman’ ” have created in the popular imagination a picture of charter schools with impossibly long waiting lists, offering an escape to children desperate for a better education in neighborhoods beset by crumbling traditional schools. While it is true that some charter schools outperform traditional schools, it is also true that many charter schools fail. The Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) has produced a series of studies comparing academic results at charter and traditional schools. In 2013, CREDO found no difference nationally between traditional and charter schools in math, while in reading, the average charter school student gained the equivalent of an additional eight days of learning per year. But there was wide variation. Among the charters CREDO studied, 31 percent were significantly weaker in math than their traditional school counterparts, 29 percent were significantly stronger and 40 percent showed no real difference. CREDO studies also show variation across state lines. In cities, charters tend to fare better: The average student in an urban charter school gains the equivalent of 40 more days of learning in math and 28 additional days in reading. But the average charter student in Texas and in Ohio — a state that has been notorious for allowing poor-performing charters to persist — learns less in math and reading each year than her peers in traditional schools. Myth No. 4 Charter schools are public. Or private. In August , a National Labor Relations Board majority ruled that a charter school in Brooklyn “was not established by a state or local government” and was, therefore, “not itself a public school.” The board’s lone dissenter argued that “charter schools operate as K-12 public schools” and should be treated as such since “they are substantially regulated under state and local laws, and they are overseen by state and local authorities.” This is one of education’s more bitter feuds, a semantic battle that underlines how important public education is to our nation’s notion of itself. Advocates insist that charter schools are public because they are tuition-free and equally open to all children. Critics argue that charters are at the leading edge of an effort to privatize public education in the same way other government functions, such as prisons, have been outsourced to private companies. Neither side is entirely right. Charters are a hybrid, and judges and regulators have struggled to figure out how they should be treated under the law. “Courts have had a difficult time determining their legal status because they exhibit both public and private characteristics,” researchers wrote in a University of Massachusetts Law Review article last year. When charter students in Colorado, for instance, set a fire that destroyed private property, the property owners sued the school for negligence. The school argued that it was a public entity and therefore immune. A federal judge agreed, finding that the school’s autonomy did not make it a private institution. Often, the public- or private-ness of charter schools depends on state law. In many states, for example, charter schools are subject to sunshine laws, meaning their records and board meetings are open to the public. But not everywhere: In the District, for instance, charters are exempt from sunshine laws, which means journalists and parents often cannot access even basic information about how the schools spend taxpayer money. Myth No. 5 All charters employ zero-tolerance discipline. Many of the nation’s most heralded charter school networks were built as “no excuses” schools that practice a broken-windows approach to discipline. Children are expected to abide by strict rules — walking in silent lines, eating silent lunch, sitting up straight, maintaining eye contact with teachers as they move about the room — and are punished for even small infractions. The suspension rate among charters nationally was 16 percent higher than among traditional schools in the 2011-2012 school year, according to the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. But it has never been the case that all charter schools subscribe to the no-excuses, zero-tolerance philosophy. In the District in 2011-2012, the same year that charter schools were 72 times more likely than the traditional school system to expel a student, there were six charters that issued zero suspensions or expulsions, and 15 others that issued five or fewer. Lately — amid growing concern over feeding the school-to-prison pipeline with expelled students, and over producing graduates ill-equipped to deal with the freedom and responsibility of college life — there’s been a shift even among some stalwarts of the no-excuses approach. At Ascend charter schools in New York, kids no longer get in trouble for wearing socks that are the wrong color. In the District, charter schools’ suspension and expulsion rates are dropping. Some KIPP schools now use restorative justice, which prioritizes working through problems over doling out punishment. Even Education Secretary John King Jr. — whose charter school in Boston is known for both its high test scores and high suspension rates — delivered a speech this summer calling on charter leaders to rethink their approach to discipline.

While it is hard to believe that people would mistake the familiar fast food clown for a creeper, the public reputation of clowns as a whole is not particularly positive or even neutral right now. “McDonald’s and franchisees in local markets are mindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities,” the company said in an email statement. “And as such are being thoughtful with respect to Ronald McDonald’s participation in community events for the time being.” McDonald’s isn’t placing an outright ban on public appearances by its red-nosed clown, a corporate spokesman said. But the company is “being thoughtful in regards to” Ronald McDonald’s appearances. There is no word on whether the clown will be paid for his time off. WOMAN GIVES BIRTH AT WALMART A woman was in the checkout line at the Payson, Utah, Walmart when she began to feel stomach pains. She was in labor. She asked a store employee to call 911. While on her knees, she still insisted on paying for her purchases. The unnamed woman completed the transaction, then laid down on the floor and gave birth before the paramedics arrived. Employees were excited to tell the story, and the store is planning to buy her a supply of diapers and other baby supplies. FLORIDA WOMAN VACUUMS GASOLINE, STARTS FIRE An explosion at the Shuttle Car Wash in Titusville, Florida, caused $500 in damage to a vacuum cleaner, but fortunately, no one was hurt. The explosion, around 5 p.m. Monday, was captured on surveillance cameras. Apparently, the woman was trying to vacuum up gasoline that was spilled in her trunk. As the vacuum machine was burning, she got in her car and drove away, and hasn’t been seen since. THIEVING RACCOON CAUGHT ON CAMERA Guy Williams tried to get some video of a raccoon he spotted on the campus of Bellarmine University in Kentucky. He had been feeding the raccoon acorns and even named him Stanley. Williams set his phone down while recording video in order to get a ground-level angle. Stanley grabbed the phone with his teeth and took off running with it. The phone continued to record as the raccoon ran away, with William’s yelling “Stanley!” as he gave chase. Stanley dropped the phone, apparently convinced that it did not taste that good. You can see the video here. CARS CRUSHED IN UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE A broken 24-inch water main caused flooding in the Crayford neighborhood of southeast London in Sunday. While thousands of homes were without water service, the streets were flooded. An underground parking garage took on so much water that a floor expanded and rose several feet- far enough to crush cars against the ceiling!  A number of vehicles crumpled after polystyrene insulation under the floor appeared to float or swell, forcing them into the concrete ceiling above. Flood water rose several feet at the newly-built car park below a block of flats in Crayford, south-east London. Residents said they had been warned if any of the cars were removed too hastily it could result in gas explosion. No one was injured, but more than a dozen cars are thought to be affected, some badly enough to be considered totaled. Can anyone explain why a parking garage has several feet of polystyrene insulation in the floor while the ceiling is concrete? You can see a news report on the flood here.

The bonds are expected to price via negotiated sale the week of Oct. 24, 2016 subject to market conditions. Proceeds will be used to refund outstanding obligations for savings. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the underlying rating on the district's $764 million in outstanding ULTs and the district's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are payable from an unlimited property tax levy and are further secured by the PSF bond guarantee program, rated 'AAA' by Fitch. (For more information on the Texas Permanent School Fund see 'Fitch Affirms Texas PSF Rating at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable', dated Aug. 5, 2015.) KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AA+' IDR and underlying ULT bond rating are based on Mansfield ISD's exceptional financial resilience, solid expenditure flexibility and strong growth prospects. The rating incorporates the district's moderate long-term liability burden. Economic Resource Base Mansfield ISD is located in the southeastern portion of Tarrant County and is directly connected to nearby Dallas and Fort Worth, the DFW International Airport, and surrounding communities by a robust and expanding transportation network. The city of Mansfield is located for the most part within the district boundaries. A small portion of the district extends into Johnson County and Arlington. The 2015 population is estimated at about 150,000, reflecting continued solid growth. Enrollment has been steady at about 33,000. The district's economic profile is characterized by high income and wealth levels. Revenue Framework: 'a' factor assessment Revenue growth prospects are strong, consistent with 10-year trends well in excess of U.S. GDP. Increases in the district's maintenance and operations (M&O) tax rate require voter approval. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment The district's expenditures are likely to grow at a pace generally in line with revenue growth. The district's solid expenditure flexibility is derived from management of its workforce costs and is not impeded by moderate carrying costs. The majority of employer pension and other post-employment benefit contributions are borne by the state of Texas. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aa' factor assessment Mansfield ISD's long-term liability burden is a moderate 15% of estimated personal income. The district's long-term liability is likely to remain moderate based on expected growth of regional debt at a pace consistent with population and income growth. The district's net pension liability represents a modest portion of its long-term liability burden. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment Fitch expects the district to demonstrate a high level of financial resilience in a moderate economic downturn based on its solid expenditure flexibility supplemented by reserves. The district's healthy financial cushion reflects a history of strong operating performance enabled by conservative budgeting practices. RATING SENSITIVITIES Growth Management: The rating is sensitive to the district's ability to continue to successfully manage growth as demonstrated by alignment of its recurring operating spending with revenues, and affordability of debt as reflected in the district's carrying costs and long-term liability burden. CREDIT PROFILE Mansfield ISD's taxable assessed valuation (TAV) realized strong 7.5% compound annual average growth (CAGR) for the 10 years ended in fiscal 2014, during which time enrollment grew an average of 4.6% per annum. The district's TAV growth continued at a strong 6.6% annual average clip for fiscal 2014 through 2017, during which time enrollment growth has decelerated due in part to lower enrollment yield per household and higher new home prices. New construction contributed 36% to the 7.7% increase in the district's fiscal 2017 TAV. Comprising most of the district's economic resource base, the city of Mansfield reports over 5,000 single family lots in various stages of development. These, along with multi-family developments are expected to contribute to the district's tax base expansion and enrollment growth over the next five years. Mansfield's economy is diversified across manufacturing, health and medical services, utility services, distribution, retail, property management, and leisure services. Large employers include Mouser Electronics, Methodist Mansfield Medical Center, SJ Louis Construction of TX, Wal-Mart Super Center and Klein Tools. Significant near term commercial, industrial and medical development and additional transportation improvements bode well for the city's ongoing economic growth. Revenue Framework Funding for public schools in Texas is provided by a combination of local (property tax), state and federal resources. The state budgets the majority of instructional activity through the Foundation School Program (FSP), which uses a statutory formula to allocate school aid taking into account each district's property taxes, projected enrollment and amounts appropriated by the legislature in the biennial budget process. The vast majority of districts are funded using a target revenue approach, whereby the combination of local and state funding for operations meets a predetermined per-pupil amount (which varies from district to district). Property taxes contributed 43% of the district's fiscal 2015 general fund revenues and state funding 56%. Mansfield ISD's revenues realized a 7% CAGR for the 10 years ending fiscal 2014, above the pace of U.S. economic performance for the same period. The growth reflected enrollment trends as well as the district's above-average TAV growth. The district has the ability to capture year-over-year tax base gains due to a one-year lag in state aid adjustments. Fitch anticipates the continuation of strong revenue growth based on local economic expansion and anticipated enrollment growth based on single-family construction plans. Similar to 93% of Texas school districts, Mansfield ISD's $1.04 per $100 of TAV M&O tax rate is at the statutory ceiling and as such has no independent legal ability to raise revenues. The district has the ability to seek an additional $0.13 M&O rate increase through a tax ratification election, although no immediate plans are in place. Expenditure Framework Instructional costs comprise 65% of the district's fiscal 2015 general fund operating expenditures, consistent with spending patterns of other districts in the state. Fitch expects the natural pace of the district's recurring operational expenditures to grow in line with to marginally above its revenues. The district general fund also includes pay-as-you go spending for selective capital projects and for its fleet and technology expenditures. The district maintains discretion over its labor costs, contributing to strong expenditure flexibility. Moderate carrying costs, representing 13% of governmental spending, do not pressure the district's operating budget. Fitch expects these to remain moderate based on proportional growth in the district's operations and debt service. The district's 10-year principal amortization is considered somewhat below average at about 40%. The assessment assumes ongoing state funding for the majority of employer pension and OPEB contributions. Mansfield ISD's pension contributions are currently limited to 1.5% of salaries and include pension contributions on the portion of salaries above the statutory maximum (total fiscal 2015 pension contribution of $5.7 million). Long-Term Liability Burden Mansfield ISD's $1 billion long-term liability burden is moderate at 15% of estimated personal income and is comprised primarily of debt ($970 million). The district has no debt authorization remaining. Depending on the outcome of facility planning committee underway, the district may seek additional authorization in May 2017. The district retains the independent legal ability to raise its interest and sinking (I&S) tax rate for payment of debt. The district's I&S rate of $0.47 per $100 of TAV and its expanding tax base provide capacity below the state's threshold of $0.50 for capital needs. Fitch expects the district's long-term liability burden to remain moderate, because population and income growth are likely to be aligned with additional debt needs. The district participates in the Teachers Retirement System of Texas (TRS), a cost-sharing multiple-employer pension system. Under GASB 67 and 68 reporting, TRS' assets covered 83.3% of liabilities as of fiscal 2015, a ratio that falls to a Fitch-estimated 75% using a more conservative 7% return assumption. The state assumes the majority of TRS employer contributions and net pension liability on behalf of school districts, except for small amounts that state statute requires districts to assume. Like all Texas school districts, Mansfield ISD is vulnerable to future policy changes that shift more of the contributions and liabilities onto districts, as evidenced by a relatively modest 1.5% of salary contribution requirement that became effective in fiscal 2015. The district's pension contributions are determined by state statute rather than actuarially and, like other Texas school districts, have historically fallen short of the actuarial level. Recent state reforms have lowered benefits and increased statutory contributions to improve plan sustainability over time. The proportionate share of the system's net pension liability paid by the district is minimal, representing about one-half of 1% of personal income. Operating Performance Fitch expects Mansfield ISD to demonstrate exceptional financial resilience during a moderate economic downturn given its healthy financial cushion and solid expenditure flexibility. Mansfield ISD targets a four-month reserve in excess of its three-month minimum policy reserve level through economic cycles and generally maintains structural balance of its recurring operations. To better align financial reporting with its operating cycle, the district changed its fiscal 2016 year end from August to June. This change contributes to an estimated $22 million net surplus as the fiscal year captured only 10 months of expenditures. The district is considering applying up to $15 million of its fiscal 2016 net surplus in fiscal 2017 for projects including a STEM academy and early childhood development center, as well as fleet purchases.

By Jan Miller October 14, 2016 11:46 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Image of It’s called Christmas Creep by some. It’s not even a debate to many folks; it just makes them angry. But there’s a positive twist to this whole early Christmas shopping dilemma that we’re already seeing in Lubbock stores including Walmart, Hobby Lobby and Walgreens. First of all, if no one was buying it, retailers wouldn’t take up shelf space with it. So some of us must appreciate the head start on the holiday season. Every year I really want to do up Christmas in a big way, but somehow life is so hectic that I run out of time to get everything done the way I really want to early enough to relax and enjoy it. Let’s face it, all of our lives are much fuller than in the old days. We are juggling so many things that we need to start earlier on the big projects like Christmas if we don’t want to arrive at the actual day too completely exhausted to enjoy it. Maybe it’s too soon for gifts and a live Christmas tree, but it’s not too soon to make a plan and pull together some of the pieces, the ornaments and decor, the cards and wrapping paper, the boxes (oh boy, always scrambling for a box for something!) and the recipes. As a kid, I celebrated Christmas with my Grandparents and it was the best! Grandma had everything planned out to a T and she always started early. I remember for the really big dinners, Grandma and Mom and I would even set the table for supper in the morning. It was the complete and matched setting, including relish dish, bread plate, dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, multiple forks and spoons and engraved napkin holders. A wonderful handcrafted centerpiece and the best linen all made it a really special occasion. It’s the kind of attention to detail that we scarcely have time to think about anymore. But maybe, if we start early enough, we can remember all these things and lay out the plan in advance so we have the kind of old-fashioned Christmas we always dream of. Oh, and the energy and time to actually relax and enjoy it!

Well, Walmart has finally decided to sell them online with all four wave 2 deluxes (Wolfwire, Highbrow, Chromedome and Mindwipe) currently available on walmart.ca. While Toysrus.ca does not have them yet, they have a big 25% off sale on all Transformers in store (including Playskool for once, but not toys already on liquidation). Maybe this will help sell the ton of Combiner Wars boxsets that haven't moved yet. Credit(s): Toysrus.ca and walmart.ca Search Got Transformers News? Let us know here!

This was learnt first hand as I walked into Toysrus today, seeking a raincheck for the deal they had on Titans Return leader toys (at $35 CAD), and was told that corporate has decided that rainchecks will no longer be given for Transformers items. There has allegedly been some foul play involving rainchecks and it got bad enough that Toysrus Canada has decided to stop this practice entirely. This was discovered in Quebec so let us know if you hear the same at your local Canadian Toysrus. UPDATE It seems it is only select Toysrus stores in the Quebec area. There is no widespread change in the policy, as confirmed by Ontario managers. This seems more like a case of managers passing their own rules as corporate mandate when it isn't the case.

I raincheck is typically a small paper form that a retailer will fill out when they have a sale on an item, but are out of stock for that item. It basically extends the sale price to some future date (30 days, 90 days, etc.) so that when the item is in stock again, you can get it at the sale price even if the sale is over.

It will have to go back to the old system now of seeing the toy in the store and waiting for the deal rather than getting it right away with my raincheck. The thing Kurona (and this may be why they did this) is that all Transformers of a certain class in a line have the same number. So even if Wolfwire and Breakaway are different toys, TRU will see them as the same item. So I would ask for a raincheck for the item number and get a coupon that said I had 90 days to get a deluxe for, say, $10. And then I would be able to get the new deluxe right away for $10 when I found him in a store (even though he technically had not come out yet when the sale was on). So that was fun. but now its over. it will be like the states and the UK now where I have to wait for a sale to get the item I want and I will be restricted to what their selection.

This was learnt first hand as I walked into Toysrus today, seeking a raincheck for the deal they had on Titans Return leader toys (at $35 CAD), and was told that corporate has decided that rainchecks will no longer be given for Transformers items. There has allegedly been some foul play involving rainchecks and it got bad enough that Toysrus Canada has decided to stop this practice entirely. This was discovered in Quebec so let us know if you hear the same at your local Canadian Toysrus. UPDATE It seems it is only select Toysrus stores in the Quebec area. There is no widespread change in the policy, as confirmed by Ontario managers. This seems more like a case of managers passing their own rules as corporate mandate when it isn't the case. Until corporate has any policy changes distributed in writing, the existing written policy from corporate always overrides whatever 'rules' a store manager or employee decides on. Make sure to contact corporate when a store won't follow existing rules/policy.

Tim Morris is spearheading the local Wreaths Across America event to recognize service men and women buried in the cemetery at 7800 Van Belle Road. “We’re looking to get a wreath for every single veteran in our cemetery,” Morris said Thursday. “We’ll be doing a fundraiser; we’ll be out there selling wristbands to raise money for these wreaths.” The wreaths will cost approximately $12,500. Wreaths Across America supporters will begin offering 13,000 wristbands for donations of $1 or more in front of Walmart, 2675 E. Lincoln Ave., beginning next week. In addition to asking store customers to purchase a wristband in honor of area veterans, Morris said supporters will also be conducting a drawing for two barbecues — one donated by Walmart and one by Ace Hardware. Entry into the drawing is free, Morris said, noting he hopes that will help attract attention to the local Wreaths Across American program. Morris said the wreaths have to be purchased by Nov. 28 for delivery in December or January. But he won’t be waiting that long to have an official Wreaths Across America ceremony. “The official ceremony will be at 9 a.m. Dec. 17 at the cemetery,” he said, noting Veterans of Foreign Wars members will be on-hand to recognize service members buried in Lower Valley Memorial Gardens. Morris does not recommend sending checks to the national Wreaths Across America office as donations will go toward a general fund account, and not necessarily be earmarked for recognition of Sunnyside veterans. Instead, he said, area residents who want to donate to the program can stop by the cemetery or mail a check to Wreaths Across America, C/O Lower Valley Memorial Gardens, P.O. Box 936, Sunnyside, WA 98944. Make checks payable to Wreaths Across America.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- For the second time since 2014, a Monroe County auditor has been accused of using a county credit card for personal expenses. Steven Saulter, who resigned as auditor in June, is accused of purchasing $620-worth of food and prescription medications for his personal use with a Monroe County credit card between September 5 and October 10 of last year. In a probable cause affidavit filed this week, Saulter is accused of making 33 different charges on the county credit card for personal use during that period. The purchases were allegedly made mostly at Kroger, Marsh and Walmart stores. A Monroe County Sheriff's detective who interview Saulter said he was "cooperative" and admitted to using the card for his personal use, but "stated it was a misunderstanding." "He had been under a lot of stress at the time due to some personal issues, and apparently had 'accidentally' used the county credit card in lieu of his personal debit card, as they looked similar," the affidavit states. The detective notes he compared a card identical to the county card Saulter used to his personal debit card and noticed several distinct differences. Saulter was charged Monday with three counts of fraud and one count of official misconduct. All four counts are level 6 felony offenses. Saulter, a Democrat, replaced former Monroe County auditor Amy Gerstman, who pleaded guilty in September 2014 to felony official misconduct and misdemeanor conversion for using county-issued credit cards for personal purchases. She was sentenced to three months home detention in that case. Just months later, former Monroe County human resources director Rhonda Foster pleaded guilty to conversion for her own alleged misuse of her Monroe County-issued credit card. According to a probable cause affidavit in that case, Foster used a county Visa card to pay her personal property taxes in Delaware County, as well as personal expenses at Macy's and Lowe's.  Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

Early buying interest may be generated in reaction to upbeat earnings news from financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Traders are also digesting closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices. U.S. stocks ended Thursday's session lower but well off the lows of the morning, as a rebound in oil prices helped temper the negativity trigged by concerns about slowing global growth in the wake of weak Chinese trade data. The Dow Industrials ended down 45.26 points or 0.25 percent at a 2-week low of 18,099, the S&P 500 Index closed 6.63 points or 0.31 percent lower at a 1-month low of 2,133 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed at a 1-month low of 5,213, down 25.69 points or 0.49 percent. Twenty-three of the thirty Dow components closed lower for the session, while seven stocks advanced. Chevron (CVX), Goldman Sachs (GS), Pfizer (PFE) and DuPont (DD) were among the biggest decliners of the session. However, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Merck (MRK) rose strongly. Among the sectors, computer hardware, semiconductor and financial stocks came under selling pressure, but gold, utility and airline stocks gained ground. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims remained unchanged at the previously week's revised level of 246,000 in the week ended October 8th. Economists expected claims to have risen to 254,000 from the 249,000 originally reported for the previous week. The four-week average fell to 249,250 from 252,750. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag fell by 16,000 to 2.046 million in the week ended October 1st. A separate Labor Department report showed that import prices rose 0.1 percent month-over-month in September, in line with estimates, following a 0.2 percent drop in August. Annually, prices were down 1.1 percent. Fuel import prices rose 1.2 percent month-over-month. Excluding fuel, import prices were largely unchanged. At the same time, export prices climbed a bigger than expected 0.3 percent following a 0.8 percent drop in August, rendering the annual rate to a negative 1.5 percent. Non-agricultural export prices were up 0.4 percent. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are climbing $0.38 to $50.82 barrel after rising $0.26 to $50.44 a barrel on Thursday. The gain of Thursday came amid reaction to weekly petroleum inventory data showing a build in crude stockpiles for the first time in about 1-1/2 months. The Energy Information Administration's weekly petroleum status report for the week ended October showed that crude oil stockpiles increased by 4.9 million barrels to 474 million barrels. Stockpiles were at historically high levels for this time of year. Meanwhile, distillate inventories declined by 3.7 million barrels but were above the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels last week but were above the upper limit of the average range. Refinery capacity utilization averaged 89 percent over the four weeks ended October 7th compared to 90.8 percent for the four weeks ended September 30th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,252.80 an ounce, down $4.80 from the previous session's close of $1,257.60 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rose $3.80. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 104.29 yen compared to the 103.71 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1010 compared to yesterday's $1.1056. Asia The major Asian markets rebounded from the previous session's losses, as traders digested catalysts such as Chinese inflation data and oil's advance. The Japanese market rose, as the yen weakened further and traded above the 104-level against the U.S. dollar in the Asian session. The Nikkei 225 Index saw some volatility until early afternoon trading, moving back and forth across the unchanged line. After moving decisively positive, the index moved steadily higher for the rest of the session. The index ended up 82.13 points or 0.49 percent at 16,856. Construction, export and financial stocks moved mostly to the upside. However, food, chemical, pharma and utility stocks came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index moved about in a volatile manner throughout the session before ending nearly flat. The index was up 0.20 points at 5,519 at the close of trading. Financial, material and IT stocks lost ground in the session, with the weakness offset by gains by the remaining sectors. China's Shanghai Composite Index rebounded in last minute trading, ending up 2.46 points or 0.08 percent at 3,064, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 202.01 points or 0.88 percent before ending at 23,233. On the economic front, data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual inflation accelerated to 1.9 percent in September from 1.3 percent in August, although it remained below the 3 percent central bank target. Economists expected a 1.6 percent rate. Meanwhile, Chinese producer price inflation returned to positive territory for the first time in more than four years. Producer prices edged up 0.1 percent in September in contrast to a 0.8 percent fall in the previous month. Prices were expected to fall 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, a Bank of Japan report showed that corporate goods prices fell in line with expectations on a year-over-year basis, although the pace of decline slowed. Europe European stocks are rebounding strongly after declining for three sessions in a row. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has climbed by 0.9 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are up by 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. In major corporate news, German business software firm Software AG confirmed its outlook for fiscal 2016, citing growing relevance in key markets, increasing maintenance revenues and a strong project pipeline. Hedge-fund operator Man Group reported that its funds under management increased by 6% to $80.7 billion as of September 30th compared to $76.4 billion as of June 30th. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reported that its September sales totaled nearly 90,900 units, an increase of 14.2% year-over-year. FCA said the monthly performance in Europe significantly outperformed the industry average increase of 7.3%. On the economic front, the euro area trade surplus increased in August, as exports grew faster than imports, figures from Eurostat showed. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus rose to 23.3 billion euros in August from 20.8 billion euros in July. Economists had expected a surplus of 20.4 billion euros for the month. The U.K. Office for National Statistics reported that construction output declined more than expected in August. Construction output dropped 1.5 percent in August from July, when it rose by a revised 0.5 percent. Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed Europe's passenger car sales volume rose to its highest September level on record. Passenger car registrations increased 7.2 percent in September from the prior year to 1.45 million units. Nonetheless, the pace of increase was slower than the 10 percent growth seen in August. U.S. Economic Reports After reporting a modest drop in U.S. retail sales in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing that sales rebounded in line with economist estimates in the month of September. The Commerce Department said retail sales climbed by 0.6 percent in September after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in August. Economists had expected sales to rise by 0.6 percent compared to the 0.3 percent drop originally reported for the previous month. Excluding a jump in auto sales, retail sales still rose by 0.5 percent in September after dipping by 0.2 percent in August. The increase in ex-auto sales also matched estimates. A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices increased by slightly more than anticipated in September. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand climbed by 0.3 percent in September after coming in unchanged in August. Economists had expected prices to edge up by 0.2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices rose by 0.2 percent in September after inching up by 0.1 percent in August. Core prices had been expected to show another 0.1 percent uptick. The Commerce Department will release its business inventories report for August at 10 am ET. Economists expect a 0.1 percent increase in business inventories. Business inventories remained virtually unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Annually, inventories climbed 0.5 percent. Business sales edged down 0.2 percent month-over-month and were 0.8 percent lower than last year. The business inventories/sales ratio rose to 1.39 in July from 1.37 in the year-ago period. Also at 10 am ET, the University of Michigan is set to release its preliminary U.S. consumer sentiment index for October. Economists expect the index to rise to 92 from 91.2 in September. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester will participate in a roundtable discussion with Common Good Ohio, which is affiliated with the Center for Popular Democracy's Fed Up Campaign, in Cleveland at 12 pm ET. Fed Chairman Janet Yellen is scheduled to give the luncheon keynote address at a Boston Fed conference at 12:30 pm ET. Stocks in Focus JPMorgan Chase reported third quarter earnings that fell year-over-year but exceeded analyst estimates. The company also reported better than expected revenues. Citigroup and Wells Fargo also reported third quarter results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. HP (HPQ) announced 2017 non-GAAP earnings guidance of $1.55-$1.65 per share and free cash flow guidance of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. The earnings per share guidance was in line with the consensus estimate. The company raised its planned quarterly dividend by 7 percent. HP also said it will trim workforce by 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next 3 years, citing volatility in its markets. McDonald's (MCD) announced that it expects to incur after-tax charges of 12 cents per share related to its global G&A and refranchising initiatives. HCP (HCP) announced that its board has approved its previously announced spin-off of its HCR ManorCare portfolio of skilled nursing and assisted living assets and certain other assets into Quality Care Properties (QCP).

Large class sizes. Untreated drug addictions. A ballooning deficit in state pension accounts. What if you could tackle several of Oregon’s chronic funding issues in one shot? About The Measure 97 Project This fall, voters will consider higher taxes on companies that do more than $25 million in Oregon sales each year. Proponents say it is the solution to a generations-old problem and will provide needed revenue to schools and other basic public services. Opponents say it’s a thinly disguised sales tax that will hurt large and small businesses.   This week, OPB and The Oregonian/OregonLive are teaming up to take a deeper look at Measure 97 — and what it means for you. 1) Measure 97: How We Got Here 2) How Measure 97 Would Impact Oregon Businesses That’s what the backers of Measure 97 have in mind with a one-of-a-kind tax engineered to make large corporations pay the bills for several state programs. They say the $3 billion in new cash expected each year would build up the state by forcing businesses to contribute taxes more equitably. The money doesn’t come out of thin air, though, and it may not be just large corporations paying the bills. Consumers across Oregon will wind up paying, too — even if how much, and for what, remains entirely unclear. Utilities, for example, have a legal right to pass along higher costs to their customers. But some academics and economists expect consumers will end up paying more for everything from cable TV to gas and groceries. “I think that’s almost certainly the case and I don’t think anyone really disagrees with that. The issue is: How much?” said Fred Thompson, a professor of public policy at Willamette University. Because of the way initiative backers wrote the tax, exempting certain businesses while taxing others, some prices may rise more than others. Predictions, though, vary considerably. ‘A Giant Step In The Dark’ A study by the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office last spring estimated the total cost to a typical Oregon family might be $600 a year in higher prices and, for some kinds of jobs, diminished wage growth. Supporters have countered that prices set nationally are unlikely to change. “It really is a giant step in the dark,” Thompson said. “There is no tax anywhere in the world that works like this one.” Ben Unger, the former Democratic lawmaker now leading the Yes on 97 campaign, argues the tax is “designed to be a noticeable reinvestment, to restore what’s wrong.” “And in order to do that,” Unger said, “everyone knows we’re talking about billions of dollars in reinvestment, not millions.” Here’s what makes the measure unusual: The initiative creates a 2.5 percent tax that applies to most sales in Oregon above a $25 million annual threshold. Few other states have a gross receipts tax like this, and no one has a tax rate this high. Most sales taxes, which are similar to a gross receipts tax, exempt wholesale trades, like when a grocery store purchases beer from a distributor. Measure 97 has no such exemption, so that could create a “pyramiding” effect, with new taxes piled atop one another at each level of the supply chain – potentially triggering price hikes greater than the 2.5 percent tax. A conventional sales tax charges the tax at the cash register, and consumers see it every time they make a purchase. Measure 97 embeds the tax in the cost of the product, so it’s not apparent how much – if any – of the added cost retailers pass on to consumers. Sales taxes generally exempt food from taxation. Measure 97 does not, though its supporters insist grocers would not pass their higher taxes to consumers. Some businesses are exempt from the tax – partnerships, for example, and companies organized for “public benefit.” If two companies in the same industry are taxed at different rates, what happens to prices? Neither New Seasons nor WinCo would pay the tax, for example, but Safeway, Fred Meyer, Walmart and Costco all would. RELATED COVERAGE Measure 97: How We Got Here So if WinCo keeps its prices fixed, does that mean Fred Meyer has to absorb the cost of the tax to remain competitive? Or does it mean that Fred Meyer raises prices to cover its higher costs and WinCo matches, taking a higher profit? At this point, Thompson said, the answers are theoretical. He said academics would love to study Measure 97 in action, but warns consumers may not be pleased. “I really find it intellectually exciting,” said Thompson, who said he will be voting against the tax. “I just wish these exciting experiments were carried out somewhere else, rather than where I live.” Oregonians Split Polls show Oregonians closely split on the measure as they weigh the benefits of boosting state support for schools and other key services against the initiative’s implications for businesses, and its impact on pricing. Though lawmakers will face pressure to spend the new money as directed, that’s not guaranteed.                                                       Dairy farmer Bobbi Harold Frost thinks Measure 97 is simply a sales tax in disguise. She'll vote against it. Kristian Foden-Vencil/OPB To Bobbi Harrold Frost, a dairy farmer in Creswell, Measure 97 is a sales tax in disguise. She’s opposing it, worried the tax would compound down the supply chain and eat into her family’s budget. “It’s like being able to go and visit my husband’s family in Utah at the holidays,” Harrold Frost said. “That’s travel money. That’s plane-ticket money.” Monmouth retiree Patty Taylor-Dutcher is all in, lamenting the current state of Oregon schools. “I’m just such a believer in education, because I’ve seen the benefits of education among my own family,” she said. “And I’ve seen the sad outcomes when kids aren’t well educated and aren’t prepared for any jobs.” Her husband, Don Dutcher, is wary of what the measure would mean for prices. But he said he’s leaning toward supporting it, even if he’s not happy about it. “I suspect deep down that I will support the measure. But I’m going to be thinking of every reason why I shouldn’t,” he said, right up until he marks his ballot. Retired Monmouth couple Don Dutcher and Patty Taylor-Dutcher think they'll probably end up voting for Measure 97. Kristian Foden-Vencil/OPB Opponents are quick to assert consumers will pay more under Measure 97 – tossing out numbers as high as a 6 percent spike in grocery prices. It’s all guesswork, though, and the measure’s backers scoff at the notion of any price hike at all. The Yes on 97 campaign points to newspaper ads that show groceries advertising the same prices across states, and say big retailers aren’t likely to create a separate pricing structure just for Oregon and won’t raise prices in the rest of the country to offset a new tax in a relatively small state. “They set their prices nationally so I doubt it’s really going to have an impact on the consumers,” agrees Roberta Mann, a tax law professor at the University of Oregon who supports the measure. She testified about the initiative’s impact before a citizens commission that voted narrowly to support Measure 97. Pressed on the measure’s benefits, backers will talk only in general terms. How many more school days each year? How many fewer kids in the average class? Supporters won’t even guess. But they insist families will enjoy real, tangible benefits. “They might notice that their kids are in school a bit more and they might notice they can reach the teacher a little bit more readily because the teacher isn’t trying to juggle 35 to 45 kids in the classroom,” said Tonia Hunt, executive director, Children First for Oregon. “They might notice that they can get into the doctor’s office for preventive care, not just for emergency care.” Pyramids And Offsets Yet nothing about Measure 97 is undisputed. Take the utility taxes: Oregon law allows a regulated utility like Portland General Electric to pass along its costs to customers. In a filing with Oregon’s utility commission, the utility says it plans to do that if Measure 97 wins — passing along not only the cost of the tax, but also added costs from the “pyramiding” effects as suppliers and contractors hike their own prices to cover the tax. By the utility’s reckoning, that works out to a 3 to 4 percent increase altogether — $30 a year for a typical electric customer. Of course, the utility has an incentive to make its estimate as high as possible, leaving it to regulators to deny an increase if they find it unjustified. RELATED COVERAGE How Measure 97 Would Impact Oregon Businesses Still, with taxes driving up costs, it might seem clear that families will pay for that on their electric bills. Not so, Measure 97 supporters insist. The initiative’s backers say they will ask regulators to offset every penny of the added costs. Regulators can do that, supporters of the measure say, by collecting deferred taxes they feel the utilities should already pay. Some of the measure’s backers, including Gov. Kate Brown, say it should be obvious to voters that they will bear some of the initiative’s costs. Mann acknowledged companies with significant market power and little competition, like Comcast, would probably pass along at least a portion of the cost. The state study of the initiative’s impacts found the retail and wholesale sectors would bear the biggest impacts from the tax hike, more than $1.1 billion a year. Wholesale taxes alone would increase nearly sevenfold, adding a major new cost to the supply chain for products sold in Oregon. “It will work its way to consumers,” Mann. “The pyramiding issue is that it just multiplies as it works its way to consumers.” Still, Mann said, businesses in Oregon pay relatively low taxes. She said she would have structured the initiative differently but will vote for Measure 97 in the absence of an alternative. “It’s worth a try because these are corporations that are getting away without paying taxes, or paying a low, low amount of taxes,” Mann said.

Families weigh uncertain costs, benefits Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 14, 2016 at 5:11 AM, updated October 25, 2016 at 3:35 PM comments "It really is a giant step in the dark. There is no tax anywhere in the world that works like this one." — Fred Thompson, a professor of public policy at Willamette University By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive and Kristian Foden-Vencil | Oregon Public Broadcasting Short school years. Large class sizes. Untreated drug addictions. A ballooning deficit in state pension accounts. What if you could tackle several of Oregon's chronic funding issues in one shot? That's what the backers of Measure 97 have in mind with a one-of-a-kind tax engineered to make large corporations pay the bills for several state programs. They say the $3 billion in new cash expected each year would build up the state by forcing businesses to contribute taxes more equitably. The money doesn't come out of thin air, though, and it may not be just large corporations paying the bills. Consumers across Oregon will wind up paying, too — though how much, and for what, remains entirely unclear. Utilities, for example, have a legal right to pass along higher costs to their customers. But some academics and economists expect consumers will end up paying more for everything from cable TV to gas and groceries. "I think that's almost certainly the case and I don't think anyone really disagrees with that. The issue is: How much?" said Fred Thompson, a professor of public policy at Willamette University. Because of the way initiative backers wrote the tax, exempting certain businesses while taxing others, some prices may rise more than others. Predictions, though, vary considerably. A study by the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office last spring estimated the total cost to a typical Oregon family might be $600 a year in higher prices and, for some kinds of jobs, diminished wage growth. Supporters have countered that prices set nationally are unlikely to change. "It really is a giant step in the dark," Thompson said. "There is no tax anywhere in the world that works like this one." Ben Unger, the former Democratic lawmaker now leading the Yes on 97 campaign, argues the tax is "designed to be a noticeable reinvestment, to restore what's wrong." "And in order to do that," Unger said, "everyone knows we're talking about billions of dollars in reinvestment, not millions." An unusual tax Here's what makes the measure unusual: The initiative creates a 2.5 percent tax that applies to most sales in Oregon above a $25 million annual threshold. Few other states have a gross receipts tax like this, and no one has a tax rate this high. Most sales taxes, which are similar to a gross receipts tax, exempt wholesale trades, like when a grocery store purchases beer from a distributor. Measure 97 has no such exemption, so that could create a "pyramiding" effect, with new taxes piled atop one another at each level of the supply chain — potentially triggering price hikes greater than the 2.5 percent tax. A conventional sales tax charges the tax at the cash register, and consumers see it every time they make a purchase. Measure 97 embeds the tax in the cost of the product, so it's not apparent how much — if any — of the added cost retailers pass on to consumers. Sales taxes generally exempt food from taxation. Measure 97 does not, though its supporters insist grocers would not pass their higher taxes to consumers. Some businesses are exempt from the tax — partnerships, for example, and companies organized for "public benefit." About this series The Oregonian/OregonLive and Oregon Public Broadcasting have teamed up to examine Measure 97, a controversial proposal on the November ballot that would raise $3 billion a year by increasing taxes on certain large corporations. Sunday: A look at the tortured tax road -- and decades of budget choices -- that have Oregon voters staring at Measure 97's politically toxic fight. Wednesday: For some local businesses that sell in high volumes, but have low profit margins, the new tax could be very painful. Today: Consumers across Oregon will chip in for Measure 97, too. But precisely how much remains a mystery. If two companies in the same industry are taxed at different rates, what happens to prices? WinCo would not pay the tax, for example, but Safeway, Fred Meyer, Walmart and Costco all would. So if WinCo keeps its prices fixed, does that mean Fred Meyer must absorb the cost of the tax to remain competitive? Or does it mean that Fred Meyer raises prices to cover its higher costs and WinCo matches, taking a higher profit? At this point, Thompson said, the answers are theoretical. He said academics would love to study Measure 97 in action, but warns consumers may not be pleased. "I really find it intellectually exciting," said Thompson, who said he will be voting against the tax. "I just wish these exciting experiments were carried out somewhere else, rather than where I live." Oregonians split Polls show Oregonians closely split on the measure as they weigh the benefits of boosting state support for schools and other key services against the initiative's implications for businesses, and its impact on pricing. Though lawmakers will face pressure to spend the new money as directed, that's not guaranteed. To Bobbi Harrold Frost, a dairy farmer in Creswell, Measure 97 is a sales tax in disguise. She's opposing it, worried the tax would compound down the supply chain and eat into her family's budget. "It's like being able to go and visit my husband's family in Utah at the holidays," Harrold Frost said. "That's travel money. That's plane-ticket money." Monmouth retiree Patty Taylor-Dutcher is all in, lamenting the current state of Oregon schools. "I'm just such a believer in education, because I've seen the benefits of education among my own family," she said. "And I've seen the sad outcomes when kids aren't well educated and aren't prepared for any jobs." Her husband, Don Dutcher, is wary of what the measure would mean for prices. But he said he's leaning toward supporting it, even if he's not happy about it. "I suspect deep down that I will support the measure. But I'm going to be thinking of every reason why I shouldn't," he said, right up until he marks his ballot. Opponents are quick to assert consumers will pay more under Measure 97 — tossing out numbers as high as a 6 percent spike in grocery prices. It's all guesswork, though, and the measure's backers scoff at the notion of any price hike at all. The Yes on 97 campaign points to newspaper ads that show groceries advertising the same prices across states, and say big retailers aren't likely to create a separate pricing structure just for Oregon and won't raise prices in the rest of the country to offset a new tax in a relatively small state. "They set their prices nationally so I doubt it's really going to have an impact on the consumers," agrees Roberta Mann, a tax law professor at the University of Oregon who supports the measure. She testified about the initiative's impact before a citizen commission that voted narrowly to support Measure 97. Pressed on the measure's benefits, backers will talk only in general terms. How many more school days each year? How many fewer kids in the average class? Supporters won't even guess. But they insist families will enjoy real, tangible benefits. "They might notice that their kids are in school a bit more and they might notice they can reach the teacher a little bit more readily because the teacher isn't trying to juggle 35 to 45 kids in the classroom," said Tonia Hunt, executive director, Children First for Oregon. "They might notice that they can get into the doctor's office for preventive care, not just for emergency care." Utility hikes Nothing about Measure 97 is undisputed. Take the utility taxes: Oregon law allows a regulated utility like Portland General Electric to pass along its costs to customers. In a filing with Oregon's utility commission, the utility says it plans to do that if Measure 97 wins — passing along not only the cost of the tax, but also added costs from the "pyramiding" effects as suppliers and contractors hike their own prices. By the utility's reckoning, that works out to a 3 to 4 percent increase altogether — $30 a year for a typical electric customer. Of course, the utility has an incentive to make its estimate as high as possible, leaving it to regulators to deny an increase if they find it unjustified. Still, with taxes driving up costs, it might seem clear that families will pay for that on their electric bills. Not so, Measure 97 supporters insist.  The initiative's backers say they will ask regulators to offset every penny of the added costs. Regulators can do that, supporters of the measure say, by collecting deferred taxes they feel utilities should already pay. Some of the measure's backers, including Gov. Kate Brown, say it should be obvious to voters that they will bear some of the initiative's costs. Mann acknowledged companies with significant market power and little competition, like Comcast, would probably pass along at least a portion of the cost. The state study of the initiative's impacts found the retail and wholesale sectors would bear the biggest impacts from the tax hike, more than $1.1 billion a year. Wholesale taxes alone would increase nearly sevenfold, adding a major new cost to the supply chain for products sold in Oregon. "It will work its way to consumers," Mann. "The pyramiding issue is that it just multiplies as it works its way to consumers." Still, Mann said, businesses in Oregon pay relatively low taxes. She said she would have structured the initiative differently but will vote for Measure 97 in the absence of an alternative. "It's worth a try because these are corporations that are getting away without paying taxes, or paying a low, low amount of taxes," Mann said. Correction: This article has been corrected to note that Safeway is subject to Measure 97's taxes. The original version of the article stated, correctly, that Safeway is subject to the tax. Safeway then issued a statement that it was exempt. The grocer now says its statement was incorrect, and that it is not exempt from the tax. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway -- Kristian Foden-Vencil kfv@opb.org 503 293 1977 @KristianOPB Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

Rich Barlow weighs in on big agriculture, small farms and the food dilemma facing America and the world. Pictured: Central Illinois farmers harvest their corn crops Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016, in Loami, Ill. (Seth Perlman/AP) Here’s a problem that’s gotten scant attention in the presidential campaign despite being as fundamental as breathing: How will we, and the world, feed ourselves? The question arises because of two challenges. First, the Obama administration, for all the good it’s done, has failed to tame the agricultural industrial complex, which harms our health, environment, wallets and livestock. Second, the United Nations says that we’ll have to double food production to feed the 9 billion humans expected to be on the planet in 2050. Guess who wants a piece of that action? That’s right: the ag industrial complex. While vanquishing government regulation, Big Food has had to bend, however gradually, to the marketplace. Writing in The New York Times, Michael Pollan offered a litany of the Obama administration's setbacks in dealing with Big Food, including having to drop proposed regulations against anti-competitive practices, despite public testimony from small ranchers and farmers; watching pliant congressional Republicans kill voluntary guidelines curbing the marketing of unhealthy food to kids; and, “for whatever reason,” as Pollan wrote, a decision to exempt agriculture from Obama’s effort to regulate greenhouse gases. Pollan noted one bright side: While vanquishing government regulation, Big Food has had to bend, however gradually, to the marketplace. The giants oppose requirements to label genetically modified food, but consumers overwhelmingly support such transparency. Meanwhile, reformers leaned on big food retailers — Walmart, McDonald’s, Burger King, Subway, Chipotle — to sign an agreement to raise wages and improve working conditions for Florida tomato pickers, “some of the most underpaid and ill-treated workers in the country,” according to Pollan. That capitalism is nudging the public interest in this instance will shock corporate apologists and Bernie Sanders’s fans alike. Still, it’s clear that regulators will have to step up their game in the future if Big Food’s big sins are to be rectified. Those are the hurdles on the domestic front. What about the international arena and the coming challenge of 9 billion mouths to feed? Doesn't bigger demand call for bigger production? Well, no. As the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C.-based advocate of healthy, environmentally benign food and consumer products, points out, “Agribusinesses such as Monsanto sometimes cite the so-called ‘moral imperative’ to feed a world in order to defend the status quo farm policy and deflect attention from the destruction that ‘modern’ agriculture is inflicting on the environment and human health.” The deputy-general of the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization would seem to agree, arguing that, in fact, future needs render current agricultural practices unsustainable: “What we are still mostly seeing is a model of production that cannot prevent the degradation of soils and the loss of biodiversity — both of which are essential goods, especially for future generations.” The answer, then, is to help struggling countries feed themselves by aiding small farmers to up their production with environmentally sustainable practices. Big Food won't have a big role in feeding those hungry nations; UN data show that, measured by monetary value, a mere one-half of one percent of U.S. agricultural exports go to 19 countries with chronic hunger. What about the international arena and the coming challenge of 9 billion mouths to feed? Doesn't bigger demand call for bigger production? So if domestic and foreign needs demand reform, will the next president deliver? Donald Trump’s website ignores the issue, while Hillary Clinton’s calls for expanding existing programs to train future farmers and create local and regional farmers’ markets and food supply chains. Pollan is pessimistic. “Donald Trump professes to love fast food,” he wrote, “and Hillary Clinton has longstanding ties to Big Food: Tyson was one of Bill Clinton’s first political patrons, and as a lawyer in Arkansas, Hillary Clinton served on the board at Walmart. (Though as a New York senator, she worked hard on behalf of small upstate farmers, so perhaps there is hope.)” The question stands: How will we feed ourselves and the world? By electing a president who offers hope for reform; by leaning on a newly-elected president and Congress to embrace needed changes; and by exercising our rights as both consumers demanding better food, and as voters demanding better governance over how that food is produced.

 The 10 things in advertising you need to know today Lara O'Reilly Oct. 14, 2016, 5:05 AM 1,385 facebook linkedin twitter email print Brian Gleason, CEO of Xaxis. Xaxis Good morning. Here's everything you need to know in the world of advertising today. 1. YouGov BrandIndex shows consumer perception of the entire Samsung brand has tumbled over its exploding phones saga. The brand's "recommend" and "purchase consideration" scores have both declined statistically significantly since explode-gate began. 2. Discovery Communications is making a $100 million investment in an entity called "Group Nine Media," a new holding company that ties together media brands Thrillist, NowThis, The Dodo, and Seeker (Discovery's digital network). Ben Lerer, Thrillist's CEO, will be the CEO of Group Nine. 3. Xaxis, WPP's programmatic advertising division, has acquired Triad Digital Media in a deal worth $300 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Triad helps retailers including Walmart, eBay, Asda, Toys "R" Us, CVS, Sam’s Club, Staples, and Kohl’s sell ads on their websites. 4. mParticle, a data company that has investment from rapper Nas, just raised another $17.5 million. The funding round was led by Bain Capital Ventures and brings the company's total funding to $37 million. 5. Verizon might be trying to back out of the Yahoo deal over the latter company's handling of its huge hack. "I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material and we're looking to Yahoo to demonstrate to us the full impact," Verizon's lawyer Craig Silliman said in a statement to reporters. "If they believe that it's not then they'll need to show us that."  6. Someone has found evidence that appears to vindicate Apple in its public fight with a programmer. The saga surrounding the reason why Dash was really booted from the App Store rolls on. 7.

Since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013, apparel companies have scrambled to ensure their supply chains can become more responsible and free of labor and human rights abuses. While some progress has arguably been made, much work needs to be done if the fashion industry can genuinely say it is concerned about human rights. This is particularly true when it comes to child labor. Two mobile telephone systems, Laborlink and LaborVoices, address the problem. The systems allow workers to anonymously report signs of human trafficking, delayed wages and child labor. Garment workers simply call and reply to simple questions by pressing 1 for “yes” and 2 for “no” on a mobile device. Based on data recently released by LaborVoices, “1” has been pressed frequently enough to warn several of the world’s leading apparel brands that the clothes they source in Bangladesh have ties to child labor. LaborVoices’ data, which is collected by a platform called Symphony, covers worker reports from January to June of this year. So far, the information LaborVoice gathered includes about 85 factories in the system’s database, or approximately 3 percent of Bangladesh’s garment exports. That data is now the foundation of a heat map that pinpoints which factories score moderate, elevated or even high risks for use of child labor. Most of the factories are located around the country’s capital and largest garment-producing region, Dhaka, as well as Chittagong, a city of 2.5 million in Bangladesh’s southeast. LaborVoices’ data reveals that over 5,200 workers dialed into the system to date, reporting at least 500 incidents of child labor. The brands that could be affected by such abuses in their supply chains include Walmart, Target, C&A, Zara, Columbia, Nike, Adidas, H&M, Levi’s, Louis Vuitton and Tesco. The advantages of these systems is that they provide real-time information that is much faster than third-party audits, which the garment industry touts as a way to monitor their operations in Bangladesh. This data also helps Bangladesh garment workers locate factories that have a better reputation for working conditions and prompt payment in contrast to their current employers. Furthermore, LaborVoices and Laborlink provide valuable data for apparel companies as they seek to allay their stakeholders’ fears about clothes coming from factories with dubious human rights records. More data will be released in the next few weeks, one of LaborVoices’ team members (who wished to remain unnamed) told TriplePundit in an email. A larger sample size should help workers, and companies, identify which factories are more respectful of workers and which ones should be avoided. LaborVoices’ goal is to cover 10 percent of Bangladesh’s garment factories by 2016, with updated data released to the public every six months. LaborVoices recently launched a similar tool in Turkey, which has emerged as another global center for garment manufacturing as its garment exports approach $20 billion annually. Bangladesh’s garment sector is worth at least $24 billion, and according to the Economist, the country seeks to quadruple that value over the next two decades. Those figures alone should serve notice to the world’s clothing brands that they need to pay close attention to systems such as LaborVoices or Laborlink if they want to ensure their supply chains indeed have the integrity many of them are quick to claim. It is true that attitudes toward child labor vary by country, as the controversy over soccer balls made in Pakistan two decades ago revealed. But LaborVoices told TriplePundit that all of these reports of child labor occurred in Bangladeshi factories, not in homes. Considering the billions of dollars fashion brands score by sourcing from a country where the average worker does not even earn $100 a month, this is not just a wake-up call for companies to mitigate their risks. They also need to invest in training, social enterprise programs and education programs for these workers, who are the drivers behind an industry that is still rapidly growing and is immensely profitable.

Postman was launched in September 2013 by Abhinav Asthana (CEO), Ankit Sobti (CTO) and Abhijit Kane (product architect). Asthana, a former Yahoo intern, ran a panoramic photo app TeleportMe before launching Postman. Sobti is an ex-employee of Adobe while Kane had worked with Walmart Labs earlier. The firm has offices in Bangalore and San Francisco Since its inception, the firm claims to have more than three million active installations and a customer base that includes more than 1.5 million active monthly users at 30,000 companies. “We created Postman to address issues that I confronted personally as a developer, and our overwhelming market acceptance shows that this was a critical need. The need for Postman in an API developer’s workflow will only grow as this market expands,” said Asthana in the statement. The freemium version of the tool includes an app for Chrome, Mac and Windows, while it’s paid product, Postman Cloud, is a subscription service that provides additional collaboration, testing and documentation tools for both small and large development teams. Box, Walgreens, Intuit, IBM, VMware and Apigee are some of Postman’s clients. Postman had previously raised funds worth $1 million from Nexus Venture Partners in May 2015. Nexus Ventures’ previous investments this year include on-demand logistics service provider GoPigeon in September where it had put in $1.5 million (around Rs 10 crore) in a pre-Series A funding round. Nexus was also part of a funding round led by Sequoia Capital India in Silicon Valley-based cloud backup and data protection firm Druva Inc. The startup secured $51 million (Rs 340 crore) from new and existing investors. In August, Blume Ventures along with Nexus put in $7 million (Rs 47 crore) in food delivery platform Runnr.

News Sports Opinion Life Obituaries Classifieds Jobs Garage Sales November 14, 2016 | Today's Paper | Submit News | Subscribe Today County man has probation revoked at hearing Cops & Court Report Oct 14, 2016 A Warren County man had his probation revoked Thursday after a hearing before Judge Gregory Hammond. Jason Allen Seybert had been arrested on July 20 for probation violations, and was placed in the Warren County Jail. On Thursday, in the Warren County Main Courtroom, Assistant District Attorney told Hammond that his sole witness for the hearing would be Officer Mike Walters from the Warren County Adult Probation department. Gnage said the underlying charge from Seybert’s original sentencing on May 30, 2014, was theft by unlawful taking. He asked Walters if Seybert had probation violations, and Walters replied, “Yes.” Gnage then asked Walters to state the violations. Walters said a violation of Condition One of his probation was a failure to report to probation on May 11, 2016, after he had been instructed via voice mail to do so by Walters on May 10. A violation of Condition Two, was o be living at the residence of record on State Street in North Warren, when he had been staying with a friend for about one month at a different location without notifying his probation officer. Walters said Seybert violated Condition 4, requiring him to obey local, state and federal laws. Condition 3 required Seybert to not associate with individuals participating in criminal activities or with known criminal records, and he was associating with his former girlfriend, whom he knew to have a criminal record. Finally, by committing 24 counts each of retail theft and defiant trespass at WalMart, he was in violation of another condition. Seybert’s attorney, Alan Conn, asked Walters if he recalled the phone number he called on May 10 to schedule a probation appointment, and Walters testified that the defendant had changed phone numbers several times, so he wasn’t sure of the number he had called. Later in the hearing, Seybert testified that the phone he had been using at the time was a prepaid cell and had run out of minutes. Judge Hammond asked Walters if Seybert had contacted him at anytime between May 11, 2016, and his arrest date of July 29. Walters said he had not. Seybert admitted to the judge he had gone to a friends house for “a little bit,” and Hammond asked how long that was. “About a month,” Seybert replied. Hammond asked him if he had spoken with his probation officer. “I never talked to a cop until I turned myself in,” he answered. Gnage continued, “After May 30, 2014, were you at WalMart at any time?” “Yes,” Seybert said. “Did you tell your probation officer you were staying at a friend’s?” “No,” he answered. After Gnage and Conn said they had no further testimony, Hammond said, “Clearly the Commonwealth has met the burden of proof. I found the testimony of Officer Walters credible. You did not report over two months. From your own testimony, you were at a friend’s for a month.” He added that Seybert clearly knew his former girlfriend had a criminal record, in part because Seybert had participated in some of the criminal acts with her. Hammond said Seybert not only violated the rules and conditions of his parole, he also violated Judge Maureen Skerda’s sentencing order for him to have no contact with WalMart by committing 24 counts each of retail theft and defiant trespass while on probation. “You disappeared for months, with no contact with your probation officer,” he added. He then revoked Seybert’s parole and re-imposed the sentence of six months to one year in jail for theft by unlawful taking, with credit for 86 days served, and eligibility for early release and work release. Hammond added that if Seybert was paroled, he would have to make bail on the 48 new counts against him.

A deputy along with several other units was dispatched to the Walgreens pharmacy in the 22900 block of U.S. 59 in reference to a witness observing a suspect breaking into a vehicle by smashing a rear window, stealing items, and then fleeing north on U.S. 59. Both Woodbranch and Patton Village Police Departments had units in the area and spotted the suspect vehicle, which crashed into a pillar under U.S. 59 at Creekwood. The driver was immediately detained, as the passenger fled into the city of Patton Village, where he was later located and detained. An investigation revealed that these subjects, a 29-year-old man and a 30-year-old man had been waiting in the area of Walgreens and Chase Bank in search for an opportunity to commit a criminal act. When a woman made a deposit at the bank, she put her bank bag in the car before going into the Walgreens next door, leaving her car unattended. The suspects, after witnessing this, burglarized the vehicle. After being cleared medically from a local hospital, both suspects were taken to the Montgomery County Jail where they were booked on various charges including engaging in organized crime, which is a felony. North County A man was arrested Oct. 4 for an DWI. A deputy observed a vehicle traveling on FM 3083 turning his high beam lights off and on at the vehicle in front of him. The deputy conducted a traffic stop and found the vehicle to have an expired registration. While speaking with the male driver, the deputy could smell a strong odor of an alcoholic beverage. A man was arrested Oct. 4 for an assault. A deputy responded to a disturbance call in the 11600 block of Browder Traylor Road. The female complainant told the deputy she had been assaulted by a man she had recently ended a relationship with. He had assaulted her after he found she was talking with another man. A woman was arrested Oct. 4 for an assault. A deputy responded to a panic alarm in the 5600 block of Buffalo Circle in Willis. Upon arrival, the deputy met with a woman on location who told him she was sleeping when she was assaulted by her husband. She told the deputy she had tried to leave but her husband wouldn't let her. The woman advised that because her cell phone was off she pressed her panic button on the security system. After speaking with the man and an investigation, it was determined that the woman was the aggressor in the disturbance. A man was arrested Oct. 5 for possessing marijuana. A deputy responded to a suspicious vehicle call in the 12500 block of Pegasus Drive in Willis. A Panorama Police Department officer arrived on scene and found a man in the vehicle and the vehicle smelled of marijuana. After identifying the man, the deputy found he had active warrants. The male was arrested for possession of marijuana and the warrants. A man was arrested Oct. 5 for an assault. A deputy responded to a disturbance call in the 13100 block of Skyline Drive in Willis. Upon arrival, the deputy met with a woman. She advised her two sons were having a verbal argument when she attempted to break up the argument. She asked her 25-year-old son to assist her in removing groceries from the vehicle when he refused and struck her in the face and back of the head. A man was arrested Oct. 6 for possessing marijuana. A deputy was conducting routine patrol in the 18000 block of Texas 105 East when he observed a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed. The deputy found marijuana in the vehicle which belonged to the male driver. A woman was arrested Oct. 8 for a DWI. A deputy was dispatched to the 500 block of Stephen F. Austin, in reference to a crash. Upon arrival, the deputy met with a woman who had hit a mail box and did not know how she had hit the mailbox. The deputy could smell an odor of alcohol on the woman's breath. A woman was arrested Oct. 8 for an assault. A deputy responded to an assault call in the 13400 block of Bert Brown Road. The deputy met with a woman who said she was helping a friend move and was waiting outside because she knew she was not welcomed inside the home. When the woman who resides in the home came out, the suspect began a physical altercation. A man was arrested Oct. 10 after he hid drugs somewhere inside his body. A deputy conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle with a defected license plate light. The male driver did not have a valid driver license and was arrested for driving while license invalid. The male was transported to the Montgomery County Jail. During a search at the jail, the male was found to have methamphetamines hidden on his body. An additional charge of possession of controlled substance was added to the man's arrest record. East County A 28-year-old man was arrested Oct. 3 for an assault. A deputy was dispatched to the Porter Wal-Mart Fuel Station in reference to a disturbance. Upon arrival, an investigation revealed an offense had occurred in the 16800 Block of Live Oak Branch. It was found that a man had used a belt and his hands to assault his wife over night during an argument. Two 21-year-old men were arrested Oct. 3 for a criminal trespass. A deputy was dispatched to the Porter Wal-Mart in reference to a theft in progress. Upon arrival, the deputy was told of subjects attempting to break into a cash register in the automotive section of the store. Upon approach by a deputy and several other deputies assisting, three males attempted to evade. One of the three suspects was immediately detained. Deputies were able to detain another one of the suspects, another 21-year-old man, shortly later. A 23-year-old man was arrested Oct. 4 for unlawfully carrying a gun. A deputy was dispatched to the 14500 block of Kyle Lane where the sheriff's office had received several calls for a vehicle disturbance. The deputy was able to locate a man riding on an all-terrain vehicle, which did not stop immediately after emergency equipment was activated. The driver instead continued on to a residence. Once at the residence, the subject complied with deputy's orders and upon a pat down for officer safety, a handgun was located on the subject in his waistband. A 24-year-old man was arrested Oct. 5 for possessing marijuana. A deputy was patrolling the Kings Mill Subdivision. The deputy located two suspicious men hanging out along the roadway in front of a residence on Kings Hill. Upon making contact with the men, the deputy immediately sensed the distinct smell of marijuana coming from their vehicle. An investigation revealed that a man, who was the owner of the vehicle, was in possession of marijuana. A 34-year-old man was arrested Oct. 6 for an assault. A deputy was dispatched to the 24900 block of West Christine Drive to investigate a disturbance where many have occurred before. An investigation revealed that a man had repeatedly abused his wife by physically striking her causing injuries, along with threatening to kill her and burn her clothes after he cut most of them up with a knife. A 23-year-old man was arrested Oct. 9 for assaulting a deputy. A deputy was dispatched to the 24700 block of Sorters Road in reference to a disturbance in progress. Upon arrival, deputies met with two woman who said their brother was out of control acting aggressive. When deputies began to speak with the man, he became more aggressive balling up his fist. When deputies requested to pat him down for officer's safety, the man stripped his clothes off acting very irrational. Deputies attempted to detain the subject, when he struck one of the deputies and fought them. A 42-year-old man was arrested Oct. 9 for assault and retaliation. A deputy was dispatched to the 24100 block of U.S. 59 in reference to a welfare check of a man. Upon arrival, it was determined that the subject was intoxicated and had assaulted his spouse. The suspect was arrested for assault. The suspect then threatened the deputy who had arrested him. Neighborhood News Celebrations in Liberty, Dayton show respect for nation's...

Behind the scenes, she dispenses copies of the self-help book “The Untethered Soul” to her contestants, trying to calm them down before live performances. On camera, she showcases an eclectic style — like an outfit covered in paper flowers — meant to counteract any last-minute jitters. “I think it makes the contestants feel safer,” says Cyrus of her colorful wardrobe. “When I turn around, people laugh and feel lighthearted. I think they get to see that side of me.” For many years, Cyrus had a different public persona. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. “My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” It’s hard to keep a straight face when Cyrus uses that line — she’s only 23. Then again, she’s been on television since grade school. At 11, Cyrus was cast as the squeaky-clean face of Disney Channel’s “Hannah Montana,” which made her the Hayley Mills of her generation. The role brought intense tabloid scrutiny, particularly as she tried to grow up. “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus says. “And you see what I did — I chose weed.” In 2013, the Miley media circus reached a tipping point at the VMAs, where she gyrated alongside a row of teddy bears. She insists that the moment was misunderstood. “That was a joke,” she says. Cyrus has taken a U-turn since then. Her new career path revolves around her foundation: Happy Hippie, dedicated to supporting at-risk LGBTQ and homeless youth. “I am only doing ‘The Voice’ because that helps Happy Hippie,” Cyrus says about engaging the show’s audience to promote her cause. Cyrus has headlined such films as: “The Last Song” and “Bolt,” but she’s ambivalent about making movies now. “I know that acting is boring,” she says. “People get paid way too much for what they are doing.” She almost turned down the Woody Allen TV series “Crisis in Six Scenes” but was eventually won over by the role — playing a 1960s activist. Over a vegan lunch in Los Angeles, Cyrus talked about what drives her, recalled how she struggled with her pansexual identity as a teenager (she’s currently dating Liam Hemsworth), and shared her thoughts on the election.

We’ve written about some truly haunting documentaries before (see here and here); here are another 10 to add to your queue. 1. CRAZY LOVE (2007) One sunny day in the Bronx, Burt Pugach met a girl. They fell in love, and soon made plans to get married. The only problem? He already had a wife. After Linda Riss broke off their affair, Pugach became obsessive. He harassed her, threw rocks at her window, and threatened that if he couldn’t have her, no one else could. He wasn’t kidding: in 1959, he sent hired men to throw lye in her eyes, permanently scarring her face and almost completely blinding her. That didn’t stop Riss from marrying Pugach after he was released from jail in 1974. Crazy Love delves into this twisted romance, seeking to answer how Riss could wed a man who had so viciously attacked her. Why it’s so creepy: Burt and Linda’s courtship is often presented as a sweet romance from a bygone era. The film mixes in Smokey Robinson tunes, pin-up photos, and Johnny Mathis footage as friends fondly reminisce about the pair’s meet-cute. This wholesome treatment only makes the real-life details more horrifying—especially since Linda, who passed away in 2013, likely viewed her marriage through this rosier, nostalgia-tinged lens. 2. JESUS CAMP (2006) Jesus Camp follows children attending a Christian summer camp in Devils Lake, North Dakota. Only the young campers at Kids on Fire don’t make friendship bracelets or tell ghost stories around the campfire; instead, they fill their days with sermons preaching Islamophobia, homophobia, and a militant call to action against anyone opposing Christian beliefs. Kids on Fire received so many outraged calls and emails after this movie was released that camp director Becky Fischer had to shut it down. She didn’t quit, though; she just rebranded. Why it’s so creepy: Watching brainwashed children recite hateful beliefs they can’t possibly understand is bad enough. But a cameo from disgraced pastor Ted Haggard will leave you feeling extra queasy. 3. MADNESS IN THE FAST LANE (2010) This BBC documentary opens on a highly disturbing image: two women, standing on the highway shoulder with police officers, suddenly make a determined dash into oncoming traffic. Swedish sisters Ursula and Sabina Eriksson wreaked havoc on the London roads in May of 2008 when they repeatedly bolted across busy highways. After cops arrived on the scene, they fought them off to continue their suicidal runs. They were finally subdued and taken to an ambulance. But when Sabina was released a day later, she stabbed a man to death. The explanation for the twins’ bizarre behavior remains murky to this day, but this documentary attempts to make some sense of it all, with the help of criminal psychiatrist Dr. Nigel Eastman. Why it’s so creepy: Those early images are terrifying, but so is the footage of Sabina in the police station after she’s been apprehended for her highway sprints. She’s chatty, friendly, almost flirty with the cops passing by. There’s no trace of the woman who just struck those same cops for trying to save her life—nor the woman who would murder a kind stranger the very next day. 4. KIDS FOR CASH (2013) At the heart of this tale of corruption, greed, and wrongful imprisonment is Mark Ciavarella. The Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania judge was convicted of fraud (along with fellow judge Michael Conahan) for sending 3000 kids to juvenile detention centers in exchange for kickbacks. What crimes were these kids accused of committing? Making fake MySpace profiles and stealing DVDs from Wal-Mart. Kids for Cash plays on real fears that will resonate with parents especially. One is that children’s lives can be irrevocably altered by a single youthful impulse. Another is that elected officials will do truly heinous things for money. But the most sobering is that you can’t completely trust the people who have sworn to judge you fairly in the eyes of the law. Why it’s so creepy: Ciavarella is a natural villain, especially since he maintained throughout the trial that he was blameless. One highly upsetting scene where the mother of a teen boy he imprisoned confronts him outside the courtroom is bound to stay with you. 5. DREAMS OF A LIFE (2011) Joyce Carol Vincent was a glamorous, ambitious woman who kept a social circle that included Stevie Wonder and Isaac Hayes. But when she died alone in her apartment in 2003, no one noticed for three years. Director Carol Morley was spurred to make a film about Vincent after learning about the discovery of her body—found decomposing in front of the television, surrounded by unopened Christmas gifts—and wanting to know more about the woman’s life. The question repeated again and again in the film is how could a person as vivacious and well-liked as Vincent end up so alone? Alternately eerie and heartbreaking, this documentary will make you wonder who would notice if you were gone. Why it’s so creepy: This isn’t some sketch of a stranger. Through interviews with Vincent’s friends and former lovers, she becomes a fully-drawn human being. This is also aided by Zawe Ashton, the actress who plays the fictionalized version of Vincent in several sequences. Once she becomes real, the sinking feeling that this could happen to anyone really takes hold. 6. TITICUT FOLLIES (1967) Thought American Horror Story: Asylum was scary? Then you won’t be able to sleep after seeing this true-life look at a Massachusetts mental institution. Frederick Wiseman’s unflinching documentary of abuse shows naked patients being mocked, force-fed, and generally treated like animals. Roger Ebert called it “one of the most despairing documentaries” he had ever seen in 1968—and he was one of the few who had even seen it at that time. The documentary was banned for 24 years over an injunction filed by the Massachusetts state government, citing concerns over the patients’ privacy. By the time it was lifted in 1991, Titicut Follies had already helped close several psychiatric wards. Why it’s so creepy: The starkness of the footage is what makes Titicut Follies so unsettling. Shot in black-and-white, this documentary features no narration and no sympathetic onscreen presence to guide you through the horrors of Bridgewater State Hospital. You’re essentially locked up with the patients, and no one is coming to help. 7. GOING CLEAR (2015) Scientology has been the butt of jokes ever since its posterboy Tom Cruise bounced off Oprah’s yellow couch. But this HBO documentary makes one thing clear: you shouldn’t be laughing at Scientology. You should be disturbed by it. Over the course of two hours, director Alex Gibney paints a picture of a cult that threatens its members, drains their bank accounts, and exiles them from their families should they dare complain. Although Scientology is secretive by nature, Gibney managed to unearth tons of clips that reveal the disturbing dynamics of the community—plus all their awful ‘90s sweaters. Why it’s so creepy: Have you ever listened to someone who escaped a cult tell his or her story? It’s really upsetting, and it happens over and over again in Going Clear. Through interviews with ex-members and archival footage, Gibney makes the specter of Scientology leader David Miscavige loom large. 8. THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE (2012) The so-called Central Park jogger case electrified New York City in 1989. After Trisha Meili was raped and beaten in the middle of her nighttime run in the park, the NYPD moved quickly to put the perpetrator behind bars. Too quickly, it turns out. Five juveniles were charged on faulty evidence and sentenced to prison. They would remain trapped behind bars until 2002, when the real culprit confessed and cleared the boys (by then, men) with his DNA match. In covering the case, The Central Park Five isn’t just interested in exposing the horrors of the judicial system. It also digs into the racism and media bias that convinced the courts a group of black and Hispanic boys had to be guilty. Why it’s so creepy: It’s a somber reminder of the precarious position minorities live in each day. In an eerie case of deja vu, Donald Trump is also involved, giving offensive statements to the press. 9. CATFISH (2010) The documentary that launched an MTV series and a fun new term for conning people online, Catfish examines an Internet flirtation gone wrong. Nev Schulman (whose brother Ariel co-directs) believes he’s chatting with a young dancer named Megan. She has a Facebook network of parents, siblings, and other friends who seemingly back up her identity. But “Megan” is actually a cover for a very different person, whom Nev unmasks in the movie’s climax. Some critics—including Morgan Spurlock—believe that Catfish was dramatized. But as anyone who’s been on social media for five seconds knows, it’s alarmingly easy to pretend you’re somebody else. Why it’s so creepy: Millions of people rely on dating apps and websites to meet their future partners. The thought that they might be talking to an avatar is horrifying. Nev drives that point home during the scenes featuring his more, uh, intimate encounters with Megan. 10. ROOM 237 (2012) Room 237 is ostensibly about The Shining, Stanley Kubick’s mega-famous horror movie. But it isn’t Jack Nicholson’s crazed grin that gives this documentary its frights. Several Shining obsessives spend their screentime detailing theories about what the movie really means—and their explanations range from reasonable to “the moon landing was fake.” (No seriously, one of them connects The Shining to that.) As their narrations go on, you can feel their minds descend into a madness not unlike Jack Torrance’s. Why it’s so creepy: You never see any of the commentators onscreen, but you can hear their voices catch as they describe the amount of time and resources they’ve wasted chasing a crazy thought. These people have an unhealthy obsession, and what starts as a farcical look at fandom grows troublesome by the end.

Similar events have been occurring all around the country since mid-August when a man was dressed as a clown in a woods in South Carolina and it was reported that he tried to lure kids with candy. Since that incident, a man in Kentucky was arrested for dressing up as a clown and hiding in the woods. In Alabama, a woman called 911 because she was scared after seeing a clown in a Wal-Mart parking lot.  A teen was chased out of a subway station by a clown in New York City. More than two dozen states have been affected by this clown epidemic. Young kids are being terrorized by what was once a person in a funny costume blowing up balloon animals at an 8-year-old’s birthday party. Having coulrophobia, or a fear of clowns, was once easily avoidable. Now, anyone who is afraid of clowns can see a clown anywhere at any time. At Penn State, hundreds of students took to the streets to create a massive clown hunt. A Connecticut school district is banning any kind of clown costumes as a “symbol of terror.” An armed clown hoax put a Massachusetts college on lockdown. Here in upstate New York, the Village of Phoenix’s police department has been asking that people do not dress as clowns for Halloween. No deaths had actually been reported until a 16-year-old boy was stabbed to death by someone wearing a clown mask in Reading, Pennsylvania, at the end of September. After seeing posts on YikYak of clowns being on campus and on a floor in Onondaga Hall, this is not funny. Wearing a clown mask and scaring people, is that really how you want to spend your free time? This clown epidemic has multiple people “clown hunting,” which involves being extremely loud and carrying around hockey sticks, golf clubs, baseball bats and anything else they can find. They are not carrying hockey sticks, golf clubs and baseball bats because they are on their way out the door to play a sport at 11 p.m. and they will not be politely asking you to join.  This “trend” needs to end as quickly as the Pokémon Go trend did. Think of all the things someone could be doing instead of hunting clowns or dressing up as the clown. Maybe completing assignments that should have been done the night before that are already late. How about making dinner and eating some really good food or even catching up on the latest season of your favorite show on Netflix. Once again, who wants to spend their free time wearing a clown mask, scaring people and risking students attacking you with hockey sticks? This is unsafe. This is not funny. For peope with phobias, this is scary. Stop it. It is not funny anymore and people are starting to get hurt. Please, make a nice dinner, do your homework, watch more Netflix and go to McDonalds.

"It’s just trying to please too many people." On Wednesday, Pandora unveiled its newly redesigned logo. In a blog post on the site announcing the change, Tony Calzaretta, VP Creative Services, wrote, "We’ve been with you for years. We’ve adapted to your musical tastes, served up your favorites, and surprised you with unexpected discoveries." So, the post continued, in celebration of the "milestone" that is Pandora Plus -- the new subscription-based option with no ads, unlimited skips and offline listening -- "we’re unveiling a new brand to enhance your Pandora experience and help bring your music to life." Notwithstanding the substantial improvements in the service itself, how does that new logo stack up? Well, graphic design experts who spoke with Billboard all echoed similar sentiments: It doesn't really do much to propel the streaming radio service forward. Armin Vit, editor of the corporate and brand identity blog Brand New and principal of graphic design firm Under Consideration, penned a review of the new logos, in which he described both the wordmark and monogram as simple and "easy to embrace," if a bit bland and generic. "It’s not offensive, it’s easy to reproduce, it looks good because it’s so simple and clean, so it’s kind of like a recurring trap," Vit tells Billboard. "It's not a bad trap, it’s just something clients fall into because it looks so effortless." He added that it works well on the end of the designers, too, in that it's both easy to create and easy to sell to a client, as there is a certain comfort that comes with a simple design solution, and he says such logos can often be sold as "a good pair of jeans" because they go well with anything. John Caserta, department head of graphic design at Rhode Island School of Design, agrees. "In the landscape of music brands, it just doesn’t seem particularly innovative," he says. He adds the redesign isn't particularly in line with the extent of the improvements in the service "because it certainly doesn’t have the weight of some massive overhaul." Both the new Pandora Plus platform and the new logo arrive less than 12 months after Spotify revealed its own redesign back in summer 2015, which Caserta says isn't uncommon. He says if you look through hundreds of company logos, there will be noticeable trends in certain fields, using the example that once Kmart redesigned, Walmart followed suit 12 months later. "You’ll realize, 'OK, somebody clearly reacted to somebody else,'" he says. Within the music industry in particular, he says, there's so much competition surrounding software, licensing, exclusives and price points that the logo is far from the biggest factor. However, it should still encapsulate and represent a unified and unique vision -- which is where Pandora's redesigned logo falls short. Both Caserta and Vit point to the visual accompaniment for the new P monogram -- a 30-second clip of flashing colors and concert footage set to electronic beats -- as being reminiscent of the early MTV logo, in the sense that its ever-changing and easily adaptable. Pandora claims the variations in which the P can exist "embraces the dynamic range of sound and color, visualizing the energy and emotion that artists pour into the creation of music, and that we feel as listeners." The Pandora blog post also placed a heavy burden on the new logo's shoulders, stating it will serve as a "portal into the unique and diverse range of music you love" -- a goal Vit says is too wide-reaching. "This P can be everything for everyone and it can represent any kind of music genre," he says. "So it’s an easy way of adding visual diversity so that anyone can identify with it and feel that their tastes are being catered to in one way or another." However, he adds, it doesn't make a bold statement. "I think that that’s where this falls short: It’s just trying to please too many people without really having a unique statement." This is most likely why the space in the P is filled in, he says, which created "one big shape" and allows for more creative freedom since it can be filled in and/or laid over various backgrounds. Such endless adaptability proves to be too much here, though, which is why Vit says Spotify's redesign was generally more successful, since it built a consistent visual language, while Pandora's redesign is more of a free-for-all. "This is the right time and the right amount of change for Pandora," says Sam Becker, executive creative director, New York, for design agency Brand Union. "Unfortunately, the whole thing feels skin-deep."   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.

Rosemary O’Hara and Andrew Abramson, from the Sun Sentinel editorial section, discuss the pros and cons to medicinal use of marijuana with panel guests. Sun Sentinel Editorial Board Elect Tom Lonergan, John Perez and Mitchell Stollberg-Appleyard to Oakland Park commission Privacy Policy While full of potential, Oakland Park is still trying to find its best self. The downtown for years has struggled to find tenants although there's finally some life. Funky Buddha, one of the state's top breweries, has brought a fun new vibe and an influx of visitors. Its presence has encouraged other new businesses, including Switchbox Coffee Roaster, a craft coffee shop that opened nearby this summer. The city's downtown, spurred by the culinary district, is improving. There are now 20 retail shops in addition to restaurants. But downtown, near the railroad tracks along Dixie Highway north of Oakland Park Boulevard, remains a work in progress with plenty of space available. Besides growing businesses, one of Oakland Park's greatest challenges is attracting homebuyers. The average home value is only $177,600, significantly less than in neighboring cities. Commission candidate John Perez, a former city engineer, estimates more than 60 percent of the city's home inventory are rentals. Nine good candidates are running for the city commission. The top three vote-getters will win. The choices include Commissioner Tim Lonergan, who currently serves as mayor, and Commissioner Sara Guevrekian. Six are newcomers. A seventh candidate, Steven Arnst, formerly served on the commission and is hoping for a comeback. Lonergan is an enthusiastic and informed commissioner who was first elected in 2013. He deserves another term. We also endorse Perez, who has an engaging personality and a strong command of how the city works. Our third recommendation is Mitchell Stollberg-Appleyard, who's been involved in numerous Oakland Park civic organizations and has a good grasp of the challenges. Guevrekian declined to be interviewed by the Sun Sentinel Editorial Board. Lonergan, 54, says there's "many things in my first term I want to see completed and continued." He believes Oakland Park is a "diamond in the rough" and "we are just starting to polish the diamond." He knows there's only so much the commission can do about the city's rental dilemma, but he believes commissioners can play a large role in bringing businesses to the city. He wants Oakland Park to be a "self-sustaining community" — similar to neighboring Wilton Manors, which has higher home values and a thriving downtown. "We need the homes, we need the businesses, we need the entertainment values," Lonergan said. "We need to be more of a walking community. We want to welcome people to Oakland Park." Lonergan wouldn't comment on the proposed Wal-Mart supercenter at Oakland Park Boulevard at Northeast Sixth Avenue, one of the city's most contentious issues. He's recused himself from discussion because he works for United Health Care, which provides insurance to Wal-Mart employees. His decision to sit out the votes has made it more difficult for Wal-Mart to receive the approval. It's an issue that could arise again since United Health Care is a major insurance provider here. Lonergan should get a second opinion from the county's Office of Inspector General because it doesn't help residents if he sits out important votes. Perez, 68, has vast knowledge of the city after 11 years as a project manager in its engineering department. He's uniquely qualified to serve on the commission. He wants to help the city develop a long-term strategic plan, something it hasn't done in the past. After speaking with residents, Perez favors the Wal-Mart project, believing it will create jobs and provide "high demand products to the community." Stollberg-Appleyard, a 62-year-old mail room supervisor at Service America, has been active in Oakland Park neighborhood associations since 1985. He was an inaugural member of the Oakland Park Business Group and helps clean up graffiti across the city. He attends nearly every commission and planning and zoning board meeting. He has a firm grasp of city issues. He opposed the Wal-Mart project because of potential crime issues at a store that could be open 24 hours a day. But after the company agreed to certain concessions, he now believes the city should work with Wal-Mart. He also favored the city's controversial decision to shut down a Catholic church's soup kitchen. "I would have done it sooner," he said. "We lost so many businesses on Powerline Road. It was considered a blighted area. Banks would not give loans to businesses." Oakland Park still has a long way to go, but Lonergan, Perez and Stollberg-Appleyard have strong ideas for moving it forward.

Daniel Sparks (TMFDanielSparks) Oct 15, 2016 at 7:03PM Image source: Getty Images. A head-to-head comparison of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is likely to show up more and more in the future. While at their cores, Amazon is still an e-commerce company and Netflix is a streaming-video giant, Amazon's ever-expanding flywheel of benefits for its Prime members is increasingly crossing paths with Netflix's streaming business. Not only does Amazon now have its own streaming video subscription service, which it calls Prime Video, but the company is rolling out a growing library of original content and exclusive TV, akin to the Netflix Originals and content deals that have made the streaming company a must-have entertainment destination for 83 million paying members.  As these two companies inevitably duke it out, which stock is a better buy? Company Market Capitalization Trailing 12-Month Revenue Growth P/E Forward P/E Netflix $43.5 billion 25% 317 128 Amazon $390.6 billion 26% 205 71 Business potential Investors who buy shares of either company are getting a fast-growing company with enduring growth prospects. With trailing 12-month revenue increasing by 25% year over year in the trailing 12-month period, Netflix is benefiting from its ongoing international expansion, as well as from well-justified price hikes for its streaming service. As Netflix Originals prove to be driving value for customers, and as the company continues to benefit from the secular growth of streaming video, both of these catalysts for growth look poised to continue driving revenue for years to come. Amazon's trailing 12-month revenue similarly increased 26% year over year, driven primarily by rapid growth in e-commerce, but also helped out by a notable 58% jump in the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) division, which accounts for about 9% of total revenue. As a leader in both of these segments, there's no sign of either slowing in the near future. Valuation Given that Amazon stock has skyrocketed 63% and Netflix stock increased a much less 16% since I compared these two stocks in February, it might seem like Netflix stock would be the better buy today. AMZN data by YCharts. But choosing between these two stocks isn't so cut and dried, as Amazon stock still appears to be the less risky bet of these two -- even after its massive rise. Sure, trading at 71 times estimates of next year's earnings, Amazon stock certainly isn't cheap. But Netflix's much higher price-to-forward earnings ratio of 128 highlights how investors are betting on much greater earnings growth for the streaming giant than they are for Amazon. And it's worth noting that, while Netflix is the undisputed leader in streaming movies and TV shows, competition looms in the media space as far as other companies with powerful video content. Powerful companies like Disney, Time Warner, and Alphabet's YouTube look like potential threats. Amazon, on the other hand, has unprecedented scale in e-commerce, and is highly differentiated from other large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Costco. Despite's Amazon's soaring stock price since I last picked it over Netflix in February, I'm still betting Amazon is the better buy. This is a particularly timely topic because both companies report earnings this month. Netflix reports third-quarter results after market close on Monday, October 17, and Amazon reports third-quarter results after market close on Thursday, October 27. Investors can look for more color on both businesses when the results go live. Daniel Sparks has no position in any stocks mentioned.

In her complaint, a native of Delhi, Priya Arunachalam, who lives in New York, has told Thane police that on Sept 22, 2015, a person claiming to be an "IRS treasury inspector" threatened and extorted $44,587 (nearly Rs 30 lakh) from her. Arunachalam has lodged the complaint, saying the culprits caused her family untold stress and that they lost sleep for nearly a year. Another 24-year-old girl from Las Vegas has informed Thane police that the impersonators extorted $1,500 from her by accusing her of violating immigration rules. Her complaint says, "I received a call from 1800-375-5283 on September 19 (from a person) claiming to be an immigration officer from USCIS. He said I am under a strict protocol and I cannot speak to anybody during the call." The caller asked for all her personal details like passport, visa information and then told her that a criminal case was pending against her back in India. The caller threatened her that she could be "deported, put behind the bars for 72 hours..." He then convinced her to go to the nearest Walmart store and buy a $1,500 Apple iTunes card after which a number would be generated, which she could give to the "police officer" who would be visiting her place. Anantsingh Dhillon, an Indian based in Victoria in Columbia, too shared details with police. He said, "I got numerous calls from unknown numbers asking me to call back as the Canada Revenue Agency had something against me. It was always in a threatening tone and as I called back numerous times, they may have thought I was following up." Twice he called local police and found out that it was a scam, Dhillon told TOI. Back in October 2013, the US Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration had estimated that roughly 8.9 lakh victims had paid up over $26.5 million to phone scammers. Investigators are now slowly coming to grips with the size of this underground industry although scamsters have managed to cover up their tracks well so far with the use of technology. Will this tarnish the image of BPOs operating from India, is a question that lingers. A joint Indo-US probe involving the FBI and other US agencies is currently underway and promises more action.

(Oct. 12, 2016) Fernando Salazar The Wichita Eagle i By Daniel Salazar dsalazar@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When Marcey Gregory knocks on doors, campaigning for a Sedgwick County Commission seat, she makes sure to tell residents her personal cellphone number. “I’m very responsive. I’m very concerned about knowing what is important to the people that I serve,” Gregory said. “That has been my approach as (Goddard) mayor. And that will continue to be my approach as a county commissioner.” Gregory is running as an independent candidate in District 3. She faces retired Air Force Col. David Dennis, who defeated Commissioner Karl Peterjohn in the Republican primary. She lost a 2008 commission race to Peterjohn as a Democrat. Gregory says she’ll use her experience as a small-business owner and the mayor of Goddard to attract businesses to Sedgwick County. District 3, which is heavily Republican, includes large parts of west Wichita and small cities Goddard, Cheney, Colwich, Garden Plain, Andale, Mount Hope, Bentley and Viola scattered across the western half of the county. You are responsible for those communities, so you need to know what’s going on with them, what their concerns are and how best to serve them. Marcey Gregory, Sedgwick County Commission candidate Gregory, 54, says she would attend meetings hosted by all of the smaller cities, which she says have been neglected by county government. “You don’t have to be invited: It’s part of your job description,” Gregory said. “You are responsible for those communities, so you need to know what’s going on with them, what their concerns are and how best to serve them.” Business owner Gregory is a native Wichitan who attended North High School. She went to Wichita State University for a couple of years, then moved with her husband, Gary, to California, where he had an opportunity to run with the Santa Monica Track Club. She was an officer manager for several land investment companies while they lived in the Los Angeles area for five years. They returned to Kansas in 1988 after their first child was born. After a brief stay in College Hill, they settled down in Goddard. Gregory owns MG Ventures, which is in commercial and residential real estate. She ran for the Goddard City Council in 2005 and lost a close race to Craig Bassett and Todd Wentz. “First time I ever ran for office, I lost by six votes. Every vote counts,” she said. “I’m living proof of that.” She ran again two years later, winning by 42 votes over Bassett. “I had gotten well-enough known by a lot of people in the community,” Gregory said. Tenure in Goddard Gregory became mayor in 2007. Shortly after that, the Goddard City Council unanimously passed a property tax increase because staffing levels hadn’t increased since 2000 despite a large population increase. “It was not just me. It was all of my council,” Gregory said. “We had to increase the mill levy to be able to bring in enough police officers and enough public works people to be able to serve that huge population increase.” She ran for the county commission in 2008 as a Democrat, hoping to take Commissioner Tom Winters’ seat. Winters was defeated in the Republican primary by Peterjohn. Gregory lost in the general election to Peterjohn. She says he successfully used the Goddard tax increase against her in the campaign. Everything worked out for the best, because I still had a lot to do in Goddard. Marcey Gregory, Sedgwick County Commission candidate “Everything worked out for the best, because I still had a lot to do in Goddard,” she said. Gregory says Goddard has grown significantly during her tenure, pointing to more green space and retail outlets such as Wal-Mart. She also touts an aquatic complex that will open soon. “That’s going to be so fabulous for not only our economy but the entire region,” Gregory said. Wendy Ramirez, the Goddard Chamber of Commerce’s director, said Gregory pays close attention to citizen input. She goes out of her way to make sure that she’s there for the city. Wendy Ramirez, Goddard Chamber of Commerce director “She goes out of her way to make sure that she’s there for the city,” Ramirez said. “She’s very community-oriented.” ‘Quality-of-life issues’ Gregory decided to run for the commission again this year to try to unseat Peterjohn. She gathered more than 3,000 signatures from District 3 voters to qualify for the general election as an independent candidate, which she said would allow her to pursue nonpartisan solutions and cooperate more easily with other commissioners. Peterjohn and Commissioners Richard Ranzau and Jim Howell form the current commission majority. They want to limit the county’s debt, focus on core government services like roads and public safety and reduce government spending on services that can be provided in the private sector. Like Dennis, Gregory is concerned about the majority’s use of cash reserves to pay for road and bridge projects. “We cannot continue to deplete our reserves, or we’re going to be in a bad financial situation,” Gregory said. Gregory says the county forced unpopular cuts in the 2016 budget process last summer. She says she’s a strong supporter of quality-of-life attractions like the Sedgwick County Zoo and Exploration Place. “We have a majority that is more concerned with keeping taxes low than they are about pushing quality-of-life issues,” Gregory said. “Their focus has been entirely on lowering taxes, not just keeping taxes low, but continually lowering taxes.” We have a majority that is more concerned with keeping taxes low than they are about pushing quality-of-life issues. Marcey Gregory, Sedgwick County Commission candidate That budget lowered the property tax levy from 29.381 mills to 29.359 mills. She says taxpayers did not gain much savings from that decision. “It’s so insignificant that it doesn’t even buy a pizza for my household,” Gregory said. “People are not seeing a significant tax decrease.” Gregory also opposed a recent change to plumbing code that allows plumbers to choose between two different standards. She wants Goddard to be exempt from the code change, which was opposed by the county’s plumbing board. “Our current county commission, especially the majority, are putting good people in place and then they’re not listening to them,” Gregory said. “They’re going with their own particular agenda and not listening to their experts. That’s a worry for me.” She also opposes a recent deregulation of the county’s wastewater inspections. Unlike Dennis, she opposes placing gun lockers in the courthouse lobby. Gregory said she hopes to form a new majority with current Commissioners Dave Unruh and Tim Norton, should Norton defeat challenger Michael O’Donnell in the District 2 race.
