Cross-workplace organization of any kind is exceedingly rare in China, because the government normally cracks down hard on the whisper of any such organizing, even the work of “labor NGOs” that give legal or health and safety advice. Increasingly since 2014, such fledgling groups have found their leases canceled or, in worse cases, organizers have been threatened or beaten by police. Labor lawyers have been jailed, and academic supporters of worker organizing are not immune: in 2014 a pro-labor university research center in Guangdong province was shut down, and one of its founders, who was teaching abroad, was warned not to return to China (http://on.wsj.com/1E3kGJq). The repression makes the task that the China on Strike editors have set themselves even more daunting:  to teach the world’s most restive working class how to win a strike. Strike-Happy Despite the suppression of almost any ongoing worker organization, the Chinese working class is the most strike-prone in the world. According to China Labour Bulletin, workers protested publicly 4,153 times in 2014-2015, and 949 of those incidents were strikes, with 116 involving more than 1,000 workers apiece. The Hong Kong-based Bulletin gets its information from media and social media reports. But occasional statistics issued by the Chinese government make the group think that its figures account for only 10-15% of all incidents of worker collective action. (For comparison, in 2014-15 the U.S. saw a total of 23 strikes involving more than 1,000 workers each. See http://bit.ly/1KKbU75.) The editors note that strikes have spread from factory workers to teachers, transport workers, street cleaners, and retail and white-collar workers, and from “traditional hotbeds” like the Pearl River Delta north of Hong Kong to interior provinces. As factories have moved west seeking cheaper labor, they write, “worker resistance has followed.” All of China’s 770 million workers, urban and rural, are effectively without a workplace union, much less sectoral or national unions. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and its factory branches are arms of the government. In the stories told in China on Strike, workers were far more likely to seek the aid of the local government labor bureau than of the ACFTU. So, as the preface to the English edition makes clear, the 15 stories gathered here are meant as an “instruction manual for other workers considering direct action.” Workers can learn, sometimes by negative example — because defeats and partial victories are common — “how to formulate demands and select representatives, the various strategies bosses use to coopt representatives, what to look for as signs that the boss might flee with unpaid debts, and even how to distinguish different categories of police.” To produce the book, a network of activists led by Hao Ren, a university graduate now a factory worker, interviewed workers who’d struck a range of factories in the Pearl River Delta — “the factory of the world” — in the 2000s or early 2010s. Some interviewees were minor participants; some were organizers and leaders. The activists first disseminated their stories in industrial zones as a series of magazines. China on Strike brings together these workers’ voices with a wealth of recent history and analysis. The history puts their stories in the context of the cataclysmic changes that rocked China, and thus the world, as it industrialized, but it is the close-grained accumulation of information from smack on the shop floor that makes these stories come alive. We learn about actions that are part of world historic events, and we get the homely details. For example, in a Hong Kong-owned pocket-calculator factory in Dongguan: “The food in the canteen was gross. Once the steamed rice was found to be too raw to eat, so three or four workmates from Shanxi Province carried the rice barrel into the manager’s office. We all followed them. They dumped the rice on the desk of the manager. They cursed the manager, complaining that while they could bear poorly cooked food, they couldn’t handle a raw meal. The manager later bought each of them a bag of instant noodles. We felt so happy about this. “For the next few days, a little bit more meat appeared in the dishes. The rice had been really foul, since they used diesel as fuel to steam the rice. On the spring festival menu, there was a dish of “stir-fried pork with ginseng” (actually it was stir-fried pork with radish), which everybody was really happy about. The food in the special canteen for management was rather good, with abundant fish and meat all day. We sometimes ate the leftovers brought by a fellow villager who was a manager.” What can we learn from this tale? We see the importance of hometown connections, which are key to getting a job in the first place and enabled the instigators from Shanxi Province to take the lead in the protest. Such connections also make a material difference if you have a manager-fellow villager who will bring you meaty leftovers. We see the prominence of food, which is always at the front of the brain in a country where starvation is not a distant memory. It is remarkable how often canteen food is an issue in the stories in this volume. When this same worker struck at another factory, over unpaid wages, management offered a monthly gathering where cake would be served. We see a lack of respect for authority that is common in the China on Strike case studies. Once on strike, cursing managers is standard. And we get a glimpse of the pitiful living conditions management expects workers to bear. After this mini-action, a larger strike broke out over unpaid wages. Far from a tale of heroic workers, fists high (I always think of the socialist-realist posters from the Mao era, though that type of worker-hero would have been a Stakhanovite, not a striker), this worker’s story shows the muddle that is often part of any collective action: “Workers were prevented from going to work by some senior workers at the gate that day...the personnel manager asked them to resume work and promised there would be something delicious for them to eat later (noodles with pork). Those senior workers were quite familiar with each other for they had been working in the factory for a long time. Other workers saw them blocking the gate and stood there watching. It seemed really fun and I thought, 'If they don’t go to work, I won’t go to work. After all, I hadn’t had a break for such a long time.' “The managers called the team leaders to get their workers back on the line. I thought it was kind of awkward to go against the manager who was a fellow villager of mine, and began to think about resuming work. My team leader made token moves to call us back to work without really pushing. The factory threatened us, saying that it’s our business to decide to stay or leave since it would be easy for them to get new workers... “Instead of going to work, I went to watch TV with some other workers that morning. Strikers from the same assembly line got together and complained about the hard work.” The strike ended when workers were paid, and “since our factory wasn’t the worst, everybody was relatively satisfied.” Drawing Out the Lessons The editors draw lessons for their Chinese readers. Some would seem a bit obvious to a seasoned U.S unionist — “choose representatives among the workers from each department, section, work team.” But the intended reader here is the potential leader of green Chinese workers who might say things like, “With no previous experience, I didn’t know it was a ‘strike,’ and just thought we would stop work.” Other lessons are those that many American unions have yet to learn. How many unions here have acceded to management’s insistence on negotiating only when the union stops exerting pressure — “go back to work and we’ll talk”? A young woman named Xiao Lan, who worked in a Shenzhen phone factory, learned the hard way that strikers “shouldn’t disperse but should instead gather together and continue to exert collective pressure during negotiations.” At her plant, two to three thousand workers marched away from the factory toward the labor bureau over low overtime pay, too much overtime, poor food, and no hot water in the dorms. But after they chose bargaining representatives, the strikers scattered, and management came back with a pay increase that was eaten up by newly imposed deductions. Another lesson is not to rely on the low-level managers who, apparently, often lead Chinese strikes. The editors give a sophisticated analysis of such managers’ position in production and in the factory hierarchy, and of why they might start strikes. It’s a mistake, they say, to think that department leaders have the company’s respect. In fact, they argue from experience, that layer is “more prone to compromise and betrayal...they usually lack the stamina to withstand open confrontations. When leading a strike, [they] are clever in dealing with small problems, but they don’t follow things through to the end.” The simplest yet most profound lesson is offered by a worker who led a two-day strike in a factory that had not paid wages for two months. He arranged with colleagues that when he made a move, they would pull the factory’s main switch, cutting off power to the production lines. “Some workers had taken long sticks with them,” he said. “Nobody then dared to turn it back on again for fear of being beaten.” He sums up what he learned: “Given China’s current system it is better to cut off the boss’s production. Going to the relevant government departments, they would say there is little they can do....If you halt production, you’ll cut off the factory’s earnings. That will cause panic among management, and that way the problem will be solved quicker.” The editors agree. They note that Chinese workers’ resistance has grown as fast as production has grown, because “try as it might, capital cannot expand without constantly reproducing its historical antagonist, the working class.” They go further, in particular dismissing “ethical consumerism,” to say that “collective action is politically and socially the only sound basis for the development of a labor movement in China.” Although China on Strike was written as a handbook for Chinese workers, there was good reason to bring out an English edition. For one thing, it’s simply fun to read about workers refusing, collectively, to suffer one more humiliation, from wage arrears to diesel-steamed rice. And it is good to be reminded once again that certain truths of labor-capital relations remain true across decades and national boundaries. It is good to read about Chinese workers as they learn: Hold leaders accountable, keep the strike democratic. Don’t let up, don’t be bought off. Hit the boss where it hurts, in the pocketbook.

It's not Kroger or Costco but a division of Wal-Mart that has been quietly crushing the competition -- the Neighborhood Market. Wal-Mart launched its first Neighborhood Market in 1998, but it began aggressively expanding the concept a few years ago, more than doubling the number of stores between fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2015. The pace of expansion peaked in fiscal 2015 with 235 Neighborhood Markets opened, but the company plans to open about 90 stores this year, bringing the total to around 750 stores, about as many as Costco.  Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.26 -0.95 -1.37% At an average of 42,000 square feet, Neighborhood Markets are about the size of a typical Whole Foods, and are dedicated grocery stores, unlike Wal-Mart's Supercenters, which carry a wide variety of general merchandise in addition to a full line of groceries. Wal-Mart does not break out results from its Neighborhood Market chain, but the quick acceleration in expanding the format and its same-store sales growth show how promising the concept has been. For the last five years, including this one, the chain has made up a majority of the company's U.S. store openings.  There are a couple of reasons Neighborhood Market has found success: 1. Grocery is hard to disrupt Grocery now makes up the majority of Wal-Mart's U.S. segment, and it's been its best performing one in recent years. The company has doubled down on the segment with the rapid expansion of Neighborhood Markets and by bringing its grocery pick-up service to 400 store in 60 markets, which allows customers to order online and then pick-up groceries from a kiosk in the parking lot. On the most recent earnings call, management noted the impact the pick-up service was having on overall e-commerce growth as last quarter was the first time in more than two years that e-commerce growth accelerated.  Grocery is also one of the few retail categories that rivals like Amazon.com have struggled to penetrate. As department stores and other traditional retailers have fallen under pressure from the e-commerce giant's low prices and convenient service, delivering perishables to your doorstep remains difficult and expensive. Sales per square foot at Walmart U.S. averaged $435 last year, but they appear to have been higher in Wal-Mart's grocery segment than the rest of the store. Using the $435 figure would mean Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Markets generated about $11 billion in revenue last year, though the actual number is probably higher.© Danny Johnston/AP Photo   2. Urban penetration Wal-Mart began its life catering to rural customers and has long struggled to penetrate markets. The company is still without a store in New York and only recently opened its first in Washington, DC. The Neighborhood Market concept, however, has given it the ability to open up in dense cities where real estate may not be suitable for a Supercenter. Wal-Mart opened its first Neighborhood Market in Chicago in 2011, and now has five of them in that city. In Atlanta and the surrounding area, it now has 12 such stores.  Wal-Mart's Neighborhood Markets can also take advantage of food deserts in such environments, neighborhoods where residents have little access to fresh food. With its economies of scale and price advantage, Wal-Mart has the ability to create a low-priced supermarket chain that is hard for competitors to match.  While the pace of Neighborhood Market openings has slowed down over the last two years, I'd expect the concept to be a continuing source of growth for the retailer, especially as management has signaled a desire to expand in groceries. With comparable sales consistently in the mid-to-high single digits, that should be one reason for investors to believe in the company's future.

(WDRB) - LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- Four Walmart stores in the metro Louisville area have started a free grocery pickup service. Store managers say it offers more convenient options for customers. "It's great for people who can't get out of their house, elderly, soccer moms, just basically everybody,” said Walmart grocery home shopping manager Jackie Kho. “Everybody's out of time." The service allows customers to shop online and then drive to the store to pick up their groceries. On Walmart’s website, shoppers enter their zip code to find the nearest store offering the service, then fill their shopping carts. "There are about 30,000 products that people are able to choose from on the website,” said Kho. “So if they’re looking for a specific thing, they can type it into the search menu." Shoppers can build their cart and make the purchase in one day or build over time before finalizing the purchase. As long as you spend $30, the pickup service is free. "Say you're buying spaghetti, there's a suggestion that will come up saying do you also need Parmesan cheese. So in that way, there are some impulse options available to customers,” explained Kho. “But we found lots of customers like it, because they can concentrate while they're building their basket.” Meanwhile, personal shoppers will go through the store to check off your list. If something is out of stock, they will substitute the higher-end option for the product, as long as you authorize substitutions. The price you paid when you made your list will not change. Walmart managers say online shoppers are purchasing more fresh food items and making bigger purchases than the average in-store shopper. One mother shopping with her young daughter in the Middletown Walmart said the new service would be very convenient to use. "Shopping online would mean we would stick to the healthier items and less kids fighting and screaming in the aisles,” said Cassie Fertig, nodding to her daughter Mila. “It would be a quick game changer." Pickup times run from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. In order to pick your groceries up in a morning timeslot, you must submit your list by 1 a.m. If you want to pick your groceries up during the evening, you must submit your purchase by 10 a.m. A half-hour before your scheduled pickup time, a Walmart personal shopper will give you a courtesy call to see if you will still make it on time. The pickup location is marked on the side of the buildings. There are phone numbers to call in each designated spot to alert the personal shoppers to bring your groceries out. If customers are not satisfied with any items, they can bring back the receipt for a full refund. The online grocery service is available at the following stores: 7101 Cedar Springs Blvd, Louisville, KY 12981 Shelbyville Rd, Middletown, KY 2910 Grant Line Rd, New Albany, IN 1015 New Moody Lane, La Grange, KY The Middletown Walmart is hiring two more personal shoppers to meet the growing demand for the service. The Walmart grocery chain intends to expand the service to more markets in the coming year. Copyright 2016 WDRB News. All rights reserved.

(CBC) A bomb threat at the Walmart store in Kindersley, Sask., had emergency crews scrambling Wednesday morning. However, nothing was found and nobody was hurt. It started at 9:45 a.m. CST when a man called a store employee, demanded a large sum of money and said there was a bomb in the building.

Which one would you choose for the long term? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 31, 2016 at 12:25PM Don't look now, but over at investment banker JPMorgan, there's been a shake-up among the analysts covering Chinese stocks -- with significant implications for the stocks the company covers. After all, according to our data on Motley Fool CAPS, JPMorgan is one of the best-rated stock pickers on Wall Street, ranking in the top 10% of investors we track, and outperforming the S&P's record by nearly 5%. And now we're hearing that something on the order of a dozen Chinese companies just got "assumed" at JP with new ratings, price targets, or both. Here's what the banker has to say about three of the hottest Chinese stocks on the market: Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). JPMorgan says one of these three stocks is going down. Image source: Getty Images. JP's optimistic on Alibaba I won't keep you in suspense. Out of the three big Chinese stocks named above, the one JPMorgan like best is "the Chinese Amazon.com" -- Alibaba. As detailed in a write-up on TheFly.com today, JPMorgan sees Alibaba as a buy. And with a new analyst on the case, it's even more optimistic about the stock, raising its previously published price target by $6 to $135. Alibaba has "solid" prospects for growth in its core e-commerce division, says JP, while cloud computing services and the company's new UCWeb acquisition both have the potential to turbocharge the company's growth over the medium to long term. But not so on JD.com JP's less excited about Alibaba's biggest rival in the e-commerce space, JD.com. Last month, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) announced that it is selling its own "Yihaodian" Chinese e-commerce stake to JD.com, and taking a 5% stake in JD in exchange. In effect, Wal-Mart is making a $1.5 billion investment to tie up with JD in hopes the company can steal market share from Alibaba and help Wal-Mart make a bigger dent in the Chinese market. Up until now, JPMorgan has been similarly enthusiastic about JD's ability to challenge Alibaba, rating JD overweight. But today's shake-up sees JP taking its rating down one notch to neutral with a $29 price target. JP worries that while free cash flow looks good at JD.com, profit margins may be weakening. To avoid getting caught off guard, the analyst is pulling back on its recommendation, and adopting a neutral stance for the time being. And bailing on Baidu But what about Baidu, the Google of China? JPMorgan is more pessimistic about this one than most. According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, 17 out of 32 analysts surveyed believe Baidu will outperform the market over time, while only four analysts rate the stock a sell. JPMorgan is now one of those four. Downgrading the shares to underweight this morning, and lowering its price target to $164, JPMorgan warned that Baidu's core market for internet search is under attack and facing increasing pressure as advertisers move away from desktop search platforms toward new business on mobile. JP sees few other growth drivers available to take the place of vanishing search revenue, meanwhile, and believes this indicates it's time to not just hold, but actually sell Baidu stock. The most important thing: Valuation Is JPMorgan right? With a share price of $171 today, and no ongoing dividend payments to ease the pain, the prospect of Baidu stock falling to $164 certainly does indicate that a sell rating is appropriate. On the other hand, JPMorgan's prediction of no growth at Baidu stands in stark contrast to the consensus view on Wall Street, where most analysts predict the stock will grow earnings at better than 30% annually over the next five years. I have to say (and mind you -- I'm biased here, because I own Baidu stock myself) that 30% seems like a nice growth rate for a stock currently priced at just 12.7 times earnings (and 11.6 times its debt-adjusted market cap of $55.3 billion). Granted, there's a big caveat to that valuation argument, inasmuch as Baidu's reported free cash flow for the past four reported quarters totals just $2.3 billion, which is less than half the company's reported $4.8 billion net income for the period. But it still works out to an enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 24. If Baidu truly can achieve 30%-plus growth from current levels, the stock seems more like a buy than a sell to me. At the same time, I have reservations about JPMorgan's full-throated endorsement of Alibaba (which coincidentally, I also own). There, reported net income of $7.2 billion is much more in line with actual free cash flow of $7.1 billion, indicating much higher quality of earnings than we see at Baidu. The resulting enterprise-value-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 33.5, however, is starting to look aggressive relative to consensus expectations of only 24% long-term earnings growth at Alibaba. The JPMorgan recommendation I most disagree with, though, is its contention that JD.com is still worth holding onto. Priced at $37.2 billion, the stock has never earned a profit, and JD reported negative free cash flow in three of its past five years. (JD was last clocked burning cash at the rate of $690 million per annum, by the way.) Fact is, if there's one recommendation on JPMorgan's list that I'd bail on, it would be JD.com.

Study: The “Better” Walmarts Are In Higher-Income, Whiter Areas Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Study: The “Better” Walmarts Are In Higher-Income, Whiter Areas Image courtesy of Will August 31, 2016 11:47 am EST By Kate Cox@kcoxdc that's a problem walmart race discrimination customer satisfaction All Walmarts are, bluntly, not created equal. Some have better customer service than others and are just plain more pleasant shopping experiences. And if you’ve felt like the Walmarts in richer ZIP codes are more likely to be the nicer ones, well, one study says you’re right. A study published this year took a look at Walmart customer satisfaction by analyzing the 35,000 total Yelp reviews for all Walmarts nationwide. And the trend the researcher found is… disquieting. The reviews covered a total of 2.840 stores. Among them, the study found, reviews for stores in areas with a lower average income were significantly worse than reviews for stores in areas with higher incomes. And worse: even controlling for average area income, the higher the percentage of black or Latino residents in a certain ZIP code, the worse a Walmart there would rate. The researcher running the study didn’t just look at the numerical ratings stores got; he also looked at the words reviewers were using to describe them. Stores in areas with predominantly black residents tended to be “negative,” “nasty,” “terrible,” “unorganized,” and, mainly, “worst.” Stores in areas with mostly white residents tended to be “friendly,” “typical,” “clean,” and even “pleasant” or “amazing.” Now, it seems incredibly unlikely that anyone at Walmart is actually sitting around twirling their handlebar moustache and trying to figure out how to make life miserable for low-income or minority customers on purpose. Still, the trend in the data is there — so what’s going on? The researcher who conducted the study points to chronic understaffing and poor working conditions as probably causing the poorer service. In a series of interviews, he and his student-assistants talked to 89 Walmart workers around the country. Employees across the board reported a lack of support, but it seemed “particularly acute,” he writes, for employees working in low-income communities of color. And all of that — Walmart’s ability to cut corners and generally suck while still drawing in customers — is tied to competition, the researcher suggests, or specifically, the lack of it. Walmart is able to compete so aggressively on price that it drives other retailers out of an area and establish a local monopoly, the researcher suggests. It’s called a “monopsony”: “Instead of raising prices and lowering product quality and quantity to increase profits, profits are increased by lowering wages and staffing levels, worker effort, and employee retention. All companies trade-off lower turnover and effort for lower wages; Walmart is distinct for the extent to which it has chosen a strategy in which low-wage workers do not stay very long, do not invest much effort, but are paid such low wages that Walmart is still making a profit.” Walmart, of course, thinks the study is bunk. In a statement to Business Insider, a spokesperson for Walmart called it “flawed and without merit.” “Our customer traffic and overall customer satisfaction scores have been improving and we’re focused on continuing to do better,” the representative told BI, tacitly acknowledging that the company has some pretty serious customer satisfaction problems overall. The statement continued: “Our associates play a critical role in the company’s success and that’s why we’ve invested $2.7 billion on associate education, training and wages. We’re also proud to provide communities across the country, regardless of social or economic background, access to affordable goods and career opportunities to help them better provide for their families.” And, as BI points out, the study itself may be flawed: using Yelp alone, though it generated a fairly high sample of reviews, can’t account for other biases or outside influences. The Yelp-using population may not be representative of the broader population, or it may be predisposed to perceive any store in a ZIP code mainly populated by people of color as low-quality, regardless of the reality. On the other hand, the Yelp reviewers aren’t the first to notice a significant absence of staff at Walmart stores, either: staff cutbacks have led to increased crime across the board at Walmart locations.

The coalition, formed in July 2015, is now aligning with the cross-sector goal of creating one million opportunities by 2021. The group will continue to capture and share new recruiting and human resources practices tailored to hiring, retaining and advancing the Opportunity Youth demographic. “A first job is the way many young people start their path in America. The creativity and commitment of the coalition to use our collective scale and convening power have taught us all many lessons as we reach an initial milestone to hire more than 100,000 Opportunity Youth,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and ceo of Starbucks and co-founder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “But, this is not a victory lap; our work is far from complete. This is just the beginning as we accelerate our efforts to build a network to reconnect one million Opportunity Youth in the next five years. By continuing to expand our coalition and leveraging the power of technology and hiring events, we will invest in solutions that further support the young people of America who are our future workers, customers and citizens.” To date, more than 100,000 young people have found jobs with participating companies and more than 3,000 on-the-spot job offers were received at a series of employer-organized Opportunity Hiring Fairs in Chicago, Phoenix, Los Angeles and Seattle. In partnership with community leaders and elected officials, the innovative fairs help prepare young people for employment by teaching them interview techniques, resume-writing and advice regarding interview-appropriate clothing. The coalition is also building and sharing best practice models to engage young people in apprenticeships, internships, training programs and both part-time and full-time jobs. “By using our scale and strengths, Walmart and the Walmart Foundation work to improve the lives of millions of people through creating economic mobility,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, President of the Walmart Foundation. “Through our Retail Opportunity initiative, we are working to not only advance our own 1.2 million associates, but elevate the entire retail sector. We are very pleased with the progress made to date through the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative and excited to continue working with other employers to hire, retain and build career pathways for opportunity youth.” “It is encouraging and exciting to see companies rethinking traditional hiring practices in ways that benefit youth and provide business value to employers,” said Judith Rodin, president of The Rockefeller Foundation. “The Rockefeller Foundation is proud to support the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative, and we look forward to continuing to work with these corporations committed to impact hiring. Together, we can grow these efforts to attract and retain qualified young people in a way that generates sustained impact, building a more inclusive economy that works for everyone.” The latest companies to join the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative include Five Guys, Gene Juarez, Greyston Bakery, MOD Pizza, PCC Natural Markets, Savers and Swiss Post Solutions. The initiative is generously supported by the Alaska Airlines, Arizona Community Foundation, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, California Endowment, Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, Delaware North, Dominos, FedEx, Hilton, HMS Host, JPMorgan Chase Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Macy’s, Medina Foundation, Microsoft, My Brother’s Keeper Alliance, Nordstrom, Papa John’s, The Prudential Foundation, The Rockefeller Foundation, Seattle Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Starbucks, Starbucks Foundation, Taco Bell, Target, T-Mobile, Walmart Foundation and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. This work is supported by grants and led by The Aspen Institute’s Forum for Community Solutions and FSG. “Improving life outcomes for Opportunity Youth is a moral imperative and economic necessity, and we are thrilled to see the terrific response to this national effort from employers, community leaders and the young people themselves,” said Melody Barnes, chair of Aspen Institute’s Forum for Community Solutions. “We must stay the course and accelerate and deepen its efforts to provide opportunities to a million young people in the United States over the next five years so that we can make meaningful progress for this population.” The Aspen Institute’s Forum for Community Solutions has served as an important intermediary for the initiative, leveraging its national Opportunity Youth Incentive Fund, which supports collaborative efforts focused on Opportunity Youth in 23 communities around the country. The Aspen Institute provides direct funding, leadership, technical assistance, and programmatic support to the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative in Chicago, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Seattle and future cities.

What better way to find out than by looking at six icons of retail, three from the US (Macy's, Walmart, Walgreens) and three from the UK (John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, and Boots). Here are their digital transformation journeys, as they fight to compete with online and agile competitors. 1. Macy's We have to start with Macy's, a retailer that is closing 100 of its 728 stores by early 2017, and in August announced a 5.7% decrease in year-to-date sales. The press release that says as such is probably the best document for describing the state of retail in 2016, and the impact of ecommerce. Here are the key points to note: Destination retail "Macy’s will operate fewer stores and concentrate its financial resources and talent on our better-performing locations to elevate their status as preferred shopping destinations. "Stores will remain critical customer touchpoints for Macy’s, along with online shopping and mobile apps, as omnichannel retailing continues to evolve." Not all stores are created equal. Look at the two examples below.    The second store pictured is part of a mall, which aren't as popular as they once were, with new fast-fashion competitors from overseas prioritising high-street, flagship style stores. Macy's recognises that with online shopping maturing, customers need more reasons to visit a physical store. Boring real estate won't cut it. This is part of a change across retail, where stores must offer a rich experience to compete. Experiential retail That rich experience I mention is flagged up prominently in the Macy's store-closure press release: "...increasing the size and quality of staffing through programs such as My Stylist personal shopping services, infusing new technology, accentuating high-potential businesses such as fine jewelry, and creating new in-store events and experiences." There you go, more reasons to visit. Without them, customers will simply shop online more often. Investing in web, app and click-and-collect The Macy's website and mobile website (m.macys) are perfectly okay. I had a whizz through both and found no difficulty in finding an item and adding it to basket, then checking out. However, neither is up to the standard of some of Macy's competitors. For example, there could be much more product imagery (and video), a mobile menu that's easier to use and everything could be quicker and with a cleaner design. Macy's addresses this in its strategy for 2016/2017: "To foster continuation of [double digit] growth [online], the company is investing in capacity-building on its sites and apps, improvement in natural language search, faster page loading and simpler procedures for placing and fulfilling orders. "Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s successful Buy Online Pickup in Store offering, introduced in 2013, is being refined to improve speed and convenience of the customer experience." 2. John Lewis The multichannel sales mix 2015 sales figures are an eloquent summary of the changes happening at John Lewis. Sales at stores were down 0.1% but online sales were up 17.3%. Online now accounts for a third of all sales. Sales via mobile & tablet grew 34% in 2015; smartphone sales in isolation growing by a staggering 86%. Looking at the Christmas trading period, the nature of evolving multichannel retail becomes clear. Footfall was down but online sales grew 21.4% (31% growth in tablet and mobile) and click-and-collect was up 16%, accounting for around half of online orders. Overall this meant Christmas 2015 sales were up 5.1%, despite the aforementioned lack of footfall. Looking at these types of patterns, it's easy to see why retailers like Macy's are closing stores that don't represent attractive shopping destinations. The impact of TV and social media  Christmas is probably what John Lewis is best known for (at least lately). The fact that Christmas 2015 was a story of online success is testament to the retailer's strategy of big creative and social media. Though some think such spend on creative is risky, the annual John Lewis Christmas ad of course continues to makes a significant impact via TV, but is also phenomenally successful on social media. This combined reach has so far kept John Lewis front of mind when online shoppers are deciding where to go for their click-and-collect purchases at Christmas. The mobile boom John Lewis’ online product director, Sienne Veit, told Marketing Week earlier this year of the impact mobile is having on the company’s fashion division in particular. “56% of orders for fashion are now on mobile at the company and mobile is now the first point of interest even if the purchase is made elsewhere,” she revealed. John Lewis has been investing in its mobile web and mobile app experiences for some time and regularly tops polls of mobile-friendly online retailers. Sienne Veit also highlights that app customers are the most loyal, with on average nine visits per user to the IOS app over a 12-week period, compared to 2.1 visits per user on mobile web. Loyalty can, of course, be a mobile UX bête noire - by which I mean, a digital replacement for the loyalty card has proved difficult to master for many, outside of the food and drink sector. John Lewis is playing a waiting game here, too, since adding loyalty functionality to its app in August 2015. Chris Bate, Head of Customer Marketing, told Marketing Week that: "Loyalty is heading [towards digital] but it will take time to become mass market." We are appealing to early adopters and with an active marketing plan we’ll get more people although it will take time to wean some people off the plastic cards. But undoubtedly, advancements in this area are welcome, with in-store purchases tied up to a customer's online account when the mobile loyalty functionality is used. The loyalty scheme (across digital and physical card) had 1.6m members in September 2015, with 1.5m extra purchases made over the scheme's two-year history. This shows that loyalty is an area retailers cannot dismiss. A John Lewis loyalty card on mobile International expansion Online international sales increased by 50% in 2015, with interntional traffic up by 15%. John Lewis now delivers to 40 countries through its website, with payment possible in 10 different currencies. The startup incubator JLab is John Lewis' own incubator scheme and it has also invested in TrueStart, alongside other retailers. The first graduate of JLab (a digital peephole for doors) wasn't exactly a gamechanger for retail, nevertheless John Lewis is taking the lead in this area of startup/corporate cross-culture and fruit may yet be borne. Multichannel growing pains Of course, it's not all good news for John Lewis. There have been relatively high-profile growing pains with its multichannel offering. Both its outsourced customer management (call centres run by Capita) and its smaller-item delivery (by myHermes) have been subject of much criticism. This shows the difficulty when integrating infrastructure, with view of stock and customer history particularly tricky across warehouse/online and store. 3. Walmart There have been thousands of articles written about Walmart's attempts to fight back in the face of declining growth. 2015 was the first year out of 45 as a public company that Walmart made less money than the year before. The chart below from Bloomberg shows change in annual revenue (-0.7% in 2015). As Bloomberg details, this decline in revenue over 2015 can be partly explained by closure of Express stores and declining gas sales (as prices fell). Over the same period, Walmart unveiled new stores (400), remodelled many more and revamped parts of its ecommerce infrastructure. Looking at second quarter sales for 2016, this appears to have had an impact. Revenue is up 0.5% year-on-year, sales at established stores are up and footfall is up. This store remodelling and an increase in minimum wage aimed to improve customer service have done their trick. So what's the big deal? Walmart still accounts for a tenth of all US retail sales, but it is the growth of Amazon that is of concern.  Amazon saw 20% growth last year, accumulating $107bn in annual online sales. Walmart's online growth in 2015 was 12%, up to $13.7bn. The Jet purchase - changing online shopping? Walmart's latest advance on Amazon has been its $3.3bn purchase of Jet.com. It's not dissimilar to Amazon – it sells a wide variety of goods ranging from groceries and household products to tech and toys. In a recent article about the acquisition on Econsultancy, Nikki Gilliland details the unique features of Jet.com: "...one of its most distinct features is its real-time pricing algorithm which offers customers lower prices if they add more items to their basket. Likewise, it gives extra discounts if a customer forfeits the right to return an item.  "Nicely aligned with Walmart’s position as a low-price, bulk-buy retailer, Jet will also help Walmart streamline its delivery and online logistics. The algorithm identifies vendors closest to the consumer to help minimise shipping costs." Nikki goes on to suggest that these features, once integrated into the Walmart ecommerce experience, may fundamentally change the way shoppers look for bargains online via Walmart. The website would offer a USP in line with the brand. Fewer and larger orders would replace impulse purchases. Jet.com Uber delivery tie-up In June of this year, Walmart announced it would be trialling partnerships with Uber and Lyft in Denver. Walmart customers would pay the standard delivery charge and be able to choose a same-day slot. This is a direct response to the pressure for improved delivery that Amazon is putting on almost every market, even groceries after the launch of Amazon Fresh. The app experience (including Walmart Pay) Walmart's ecommerce app also looks to increase customer loyalty and engagement in-store. The app has 22m monthly active users and is one of the most impressive in the market. Neil Ashe, head of ecommerce at Walmart, told the FT that of almost half of online orders in 2015 were in-app, a 100% increase on 2014. The recently-launched Walmart Pay is incorporated into the app, allowing payment in store using a QR system at the till, similar to Starbucks. This foray into mobile payment as well as loyalty is a bold move, with the retailer unwilling to implement Apple Pay or Android Pay, presumably because of uncertainty in the mobile payment space, and the urge to own the entire experience. The Walmart app 4. Marks & Spencer Marks & Spencer is the classic British clothing retailer that has wilted under the pressure of fast fashion from the likes of Primark and Topshop. Whilst the company's food business is doing well, clothing sales declined for 14 consecutive quarters before seeing some growth in Q2 of 2015. Recent results in July 2016 have seen an 8.9% fall for the quarter, the biggest drop in 10 years, in the midst of an overall fall in the clothing market in Britain. Digital has been one weapon in M&S's attempts to improve clothing sales. We looked at the retailer's digital transformation efforts back in 2014. Website replatforming pains Website sales were up 23.4% in the year to March 2016. M&S had well publicised difficulties with its new website in 2014, part of a £150m investment in digital, but the retailer's approach of combining content and commerce online is sound. Marks is in a good place to succeed with its improved infrastructure. Next-day collect-in-store is offered, as is return-to-store, and stock-level indication is given on the website. Attribution of online sales to stores where they are picked up is one notable strategy of a progressive multichannel retailer. One agency to rule them all M&S has awarded Grey London its creative account, meaning Grey is in charge of both advertising and digital strategy at M&S. This is a first for the retailer, and seems promising from a multichannel point of view. Having one agency in charge of TV and OOH adverts, media buying and online marketing is surely a route to more coherent and impactful campaigns, online and off. A new focus on customer experience M&S's current strategy is 'putting the customer at the heart'.  Expanding on what this actually means, the company details many customer experience improvements that aren't necessarily digital, but all make stores more attractive in the face of increased competition (some of it online). More staff on higher wages will improve customer service, and clearer ranges with better availability will prevent disappointing sellouts of popular items. However, it remains to be seen how fewer sales will be received by the customer. It has helped re-establish margins and increase revenue in the past, but is surely dependant on an improvement in product range. Overall, Marks & Spencer is perhaps the most interesting retailer on this list - its brand is still strong and it has not fallen behind as far as new ecommerce and digital tech is concerned. But it is still seeking a differentiator on product (something that department stores like John Lewis have to worry less about). 5. Walgreens Walgreens is a pharmacy (as is Boots, part of the same group, which we look at below), so including it in a piece on retail transformation is a bit tricky as this market is very different. However, Walgreens retails, too. Retail sales in 2015 were up 1.9% year-on-year and though the pharmacy market has seen consolidation, it is likely to grow as the population gets older. Walgreens has excelled at innovating the customer experience, often through digital initiatives, and this makes it a useful comparison for the department stores discussed above. To understand the impact that online has had on Walgreens, one need only look at some widely reported stats from 2015, with the company claiming 48% of digital visitors would visit a store as their next action. Those customers interacting with Walgreens online and in store spend 350% more than solely in-store customers. Adding digital revenue streams Quick Prints is the perfect example of a retailer adding a revenue stream that is mobile-first and also drives visitors to store. Using the Walgreens app, users can select photos to print from either their camera roll or their social media photo albums. The printed photos can be picked up in an hour, with the app allowing customers to choose their most convenient store. With Walgreens operating c.8,000 stores, this kind of 'buy online/mobile, collect in store' service works well, and the retail pharmacy is attributing mobile sales to individual stores, in a bid to encourage multichannel customer service. The value of mobile To build on the aforementioned stat about the value of multichannel customers to Walgreens, those who visit in store, via web and mobile typically spend 600% more than store-only visitors. The Walgreens app is a big success store for in-store use, too, accounting for fully 50% of the multifunctional app's usage. Some features include:  Personalised coupons redeemable in app (that 'learn' as you spend).  Connecting the rewards programme with your fitness apps, to earn points for a healthy lifestyle. Refill by Scan - a barcode scanner that allows users to scan their medicine and automatically order a refill.   Omnichannel service Other digital services outside of the mobile channel include email & text reminders to refill or take medicine (shown to produce a 2% increase in adherence), Pharmacy Chat (a webchat facility to ask your local pharmacist a question), and a virtual doctor service that allows video-chat consultations. What all these services show is how well-suited a retail pharmacy is to digital technology. The use cases for digital and mobile are numerous. As adoption of these services increases and Walgreens further refines the customer experience, there is the potential to dramatically change the business. One only need look at the number of active Balance Reward (loyalty card) members, currently 85m, to see the possible future uptake of mobile among the customer base. 6. Boots I did think about profiling Burberry, a revered British fashion retailer that is reaping the dividends of linking catwalk to high street using social media. But, I've gone with Boots instead, to provide a UK counterpoint to Walgreens. Boots is a pharmacy founded in 1849 in Nottingham, England. At the end of 2014 it became a subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, but it still bears further investigation here as a retailer undergoing change. Preparing for omnichannel In June 2015, Boots announced 700 jobs would be cut, many at head office. It was reported at the time that some of these roles would be cut by retraining in digital sales. There was also an emphasis on improving order-and-collect services, which now allow customers to order until 8pm and collect the next day after 12pm. Further investment in digital occurred in spring 2016, when BT began overhauling in-store IT infrastructure, preparing the systems for better integration with online technologies. Part of this is improving WiFi across all stores, a key element of improving use of mobile in-store. The past two years have seen Boots move from so-called 'point solutions' (projects designed to fix a problem and be rolled out quickly, but without proper integration) to be in a better position to provide omnichannel retail. This emerging digital strategy has necessitated a change in structure, with centralised digital expertise evolving into a more hub and spoke model. Digital services that add value  Boots has worked with IBM to launch SalesAssist in every store across the UK in June this year. The app is designed to improve customer service, letting staff help customers through a slick interface that provides product and stock details, as well as reviews and ingredients. Boots, with its perfume and makeup concessions, wide range of healthcare products and electronics is in a unique position to improve with this type of assisted selling. Customers may want to understand how products work, what the alternatives are, how they compare, and whether they can get them shipped to their home. Rather than simply referring customers to 'the website', Boots staff can make use of this improved functionality to directly drive sales, either online or in-store. Away from store, Boots offers an online service called Beautiful You, which offers personalised skincare advice. This approach to improving product information by providing content-rich experiences is designed to help loyal customers, in whatever channel they are in (online, in-store, or on mobile via relevant offers). The Boots mobile app, similar to Walgreens, allows for photo print and collect, appointment booking, and online shopping, too. Boots is only halfway along its journey of digital transformation - expect to see more innovation as new tech beds in, with the pharmacy mirroring Walgreens in its pursuit of new revenue, multichannel sales and greater loyalty.

E-Magazines Close Pablo Martinez Monsivais File photo by ASSOCIATED PRESS President Barack Obama and Wal-Mart have formed partnerships on issues such as the Affordable Care Act and climate change. Obama had a negative view of Wal-Mart as a U.S. senator. Obama finds an ally in Wal-Mart, whose stores he once shunned By TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA and SHANNON PETTYPIECE Bloomberg News Aug 30, 2016 0 Pablo Martinez Monsivais File photo by ASSOCIATED PRESS WASHINGTON — As a freshman senator with his eye on the presidency, Barack Obama said he’d never shop at a Wal-Mart and held the company up as an emblem of corporate greed. Today, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is one of Obama’s most reliable corporate allies, a go-to partner that’s backed the White House on more than a dozen business initiatives, particularly the Affordable Care Act and climate change. The pairing benefits both. Obama can point to Wal-Mart’s support to beat back Republican charges that he’s hostile to business. Wal-Mart can point to the president’s embrace to lure squeamish shoppers who, like Obama of old, have stayed away out of a belief the company hurts workers and undercuts competition. This is a key part of the company’s effort to spur continued growth. “It only makes sense for the president to be willing to strike a partnership with the nation’s largest retailer,” said Dwight Hill, a Plano, Texas-based partner with retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. “And Wal-Mart has made more strides of late to try to be more transparent about worker pay and benefits. They have certainly seen the light.” The president completed the turn from Wal-Mart antagonist to fan when he visited one of the retailer’s stores in Mountain View, Calif., in 2014 to praise its use of renewable energy. Obama’s visit represented a “major milestone” for the company and its public image, said Jib Ellison, whose consulting firm worked on Wal-Mart’s sustainability program. “When he got elected, his rhetoric was very anti-Wal-Mart,” said Ellison, who continues to advise Wal-Mart on environmental policies. “So it’s reaffirming.” The partnership between the president and the retailer is especially strong in two areas: health care and climate change. Obama’s view of Wal-Mart shifted early in his presidency when he realized he needed business support to advance his health care overhaul, which Republicans claimed would kill jobs and drive companies out of business. Wal-Mart was one of the first major employers to sign on to the plan. In June 2009, as debate raged in Congress, Wal-Mart publicly released a letter to Obama saying it supported requiring employers to offer health insurance to their workers, a keystone of the law. For Wal-Mart, the Affordable Care Act resolved a major gripe about the company: that it provided weak health benefits for its more than 1 million workers in the U.S. Obamacare created a system of subsidized insurance for middle-income Americans and expanded the Medicaid program for the poor to cover people earning poverty-level wages. Pressure subsided on Wal-Mart to provide coverage. When government-run insurance exchanges opened in 2014, Wal-Mart stopped offering health insurance to 30,000 part-time workers. “Obamacare is great for Wal-Mart workers; it was a huge transfer of wealth,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor, and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote a book on Wal-Mart. “The pressure is off Wal-Mart to provide better health insurance to its own employees. If you’re a single mom and work at Wal-Mart you now qualify for Medicaid.” Wal-Mart and the White House have cooperated on Obama’s climate agenda, which current and former company executives described as a natural gelling of interests rather than a political calculation. Wal-Mart began pushing to cut its carbon footprint in 2005 as a way to not only help the environment, but also improve its public image, and is now the largest corporate user of solar energy. Last year, the company endorsed the global accord Obama negotiated in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. Leslie Dach, who ran Wal-Mart’s government relations and corporate affairs department from 2006 until 2013 before joining the Obama administration, published a piece in the Huffington Post shortly before leaving the company titled: “Wal-Mart Agrees With the President: The Time for Renewables Has Come.” × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Libert is the CEO of OpenMatters, a firm specializing in business model science, and Beck is the chief insights officer. Wind is a Wharton marketing professor and director of Wharton’s SEI Center for Advanced Studies in Management. They also wrote a book called The Network Imperative: How to Survive and Grow in the Age of Digital Business Models. The authors would like to thank LiquidHub for sponsoring the research that informs this series. In a February 2016 letter to shareholders, Sears Chairman Edward Lampert reflected on a sea change in the competitive environment for retailers: “2015 has proven to be the year where the impact of [digital] changes … has spread more broadly to retailers that had previously proven to be relatively immune to such shifts,” wrote the head of Sears and Kmart. “Walmart, Nordstrom, Macy’s, Staples, Whole Foods and many others have felt the impact of disruptive changes from online competition and new business models.” For the retail industry, store location has always been key. But in a mobile-first world where transactions are borderless, location can become a liability. These digital tectonic shifts affect every industry, but arguably none feel their impact more than retail. Digital natives such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Alibaba are all impacting the wellbeing of every part of the retail supply chain. The result: No company will be left unscathed — including the once indomitable Wal-Mart. So far, responses to these digital competitors has been varied. According to Lampert, they included the following: Mergers (Office Depot/Office Max/Staples, Walgreens/Rite Aid), joint ventures (CVS/Target Pharmacy), market exits (Target Canada, Tesco’s Fresh and Easy), company divestitures (Safeway, Saks), bankruptcies (RadioShack, Wet Seal, American Apparel, Sports Authority), unique leasing arrangements (Finish Line/Macy’s, Best Buy/Macy’s, Sephora/J.C. Penney) and asset spinoffs (Sears stores). Each of these strategies is an attempt to mitigate the impact of this tidal wave of digital platforms and virtual networks. However, it is increasingly clear that the digital tsunami will not be overcome with ‘physical only’ tactics. Moreover, physical and financial strategies only highlight how ‘sticking to the knitting’ is a sure road to the bottom as evidenced by continued lackluster traditional (non-e commerce) retail sales growth. According to a February 2016 story in The Wall Street Journal, comparable store sales — a key metric in retail — for the holiday quarter fell by 7% each at Sears and Gap, and dipped 4.3% at Macy’s. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores only saw a 0.6% bump and Kohl’s went up by 0.4%. As the year went on, sales continued to stagnate. In July, the seasonally adjusted U.S. retail sales came in flat from the prior month, according to the Commerce Department. Autos and e-commerce were the main bright spots, up 1.1% and 1.3% respectively. Others were up at most 0.3% or in the negative. “It is increasingly clear that the digital tsunami will not be overcome with ‘physical only’ tactics.” In his letter, Lampert described the difficulty of competing with digital disruptors. “Companies are creating new business models or adapting old ones to adjust to fundamental shifts in technology, competitive landscapes, government policies and regulations, or macro trends to serve their customers in new ways. While few people may have heard of Uber five years ago, now it’s become almost a household name. It has reportedly raised over $10 billion in capital since it commenced operations at progressively higher valuations, in some cases exceeding $50 billion in value. … In an environment where new companies like Uber can raise almost unlimited capital, what are the implications for older companies that are held to a very different standard when it comes to profitability and regulation?” It is clear from our research, as profiled in this monthly column, that capital allocation that prioritizes physical assets such as stores can be a key detriment of growth and value. In the case of Sears, focusing its capital on physical stores, which by its own admission is a losing proposition, strains resources and hampers the hiring of the best teams with the digital skills it needs. In contrast, Amazon and its web peers are growing faster, with far less physical assets (as a percentage of the total asset base), as customers shop from websites, smartphones and tablets. Sponsored Content: The result? Traditional retailers are shrinking their physical footprints. Even Wal-Mart, the largest and one of the most successful retail chains, is shuttering stores all over the world as the retailer rebalances its investments towards digital. In fact, the company’s recent purchase of Jet.com for more than $3 billion is further proof of its desire to rebalance the spending to insure their long-term success. By all measures, this large scale purchase is a clear sign that Wal-Mart now acknowledges the need for more outside help to guarantee its business model pivot, setting the stage for others to do the same. And the numbers tell all — last year, only 3% of Wal-Mart’s sales come from e-commerce ($14 billion out of $482 billion). Retailers Must Be Digital-first Technology, online shopping and cybersecurity are clearly becoming top of mind for CEOs of major retailers. “We have to embrace digital,” said Target CEO Brian Cornell at the Boston College’s Chief Executives Club luncheon. “No matter what industry we’re in, or what point of disruption we’re facing. We have to all be thinking about digital first. It’s really the innovation that’s going to drive the future.” “Capital allocation that prioritizes physical assets such as stores can be a key detriment of growth and value.” Still, Cornell said it’s important to remember that consumers are still embracing Target’s bricks-and-mortar stores. “Our guests still love the ease and convenience that comes in the digital channel but they also love to touch and feel and interact with product,” he said. “They love that sense of discovery that comes with shopping.” However, given that Amazon is gaining ground by capturing nearly 40% of online retail sales during the holiday season, according to a December 2015 story in Bloomberg News, it is not clear there are enough ‘touch and feel’ customers to keep Target healthy. To be sure, Wal-Mart Stores has long set the standard when it comes to traditional, store-centric retailing — leveraging technology to help the company squeeze every cent out of its costs in order to offer customers low every day pricing. But while the formidable capabilities of this asset-centric giant used to dominate the bricks-and-mortar world, it is clear that having all these stores may be more of a liability than an asset. Amazon, once a small player in the retail industry, found its start in 1994, and is now outpacing all retailers leaving only Wal-Mart to battle it. To avoid the fate that so many failed retailers have experienced, Wal-Mart has poured billions of dollars into a digital transformation initiative that is the largest by size and scope in the retail industry — 15 acquisitions and 3,600 new hires – according to a November 2015 story in the Journal. Then came the purchase of Jet.com, a fast-growing shopping site co-founded by one of the entrepreneurs behind Diapers.com. The newspaper said Wal-Mart is also in the process of making its new Silicon Valley development center the foundation upon which to upend the company’s historic business model. At the crux of Walmart’s digital transformation is an ambitious program to overhaul its business – Pangaea — led by Jeremy King, its CTO of Global eCommerce. The Journal said his charge was to reinvent the retailer: “Mr. King’s team has remade everything from how Wal-Mart’s website works and looks to underlying transaction software, databases and servers, and the backend data center tools to manage it all. Wal-Mart built new cloud infrastructure and data centers and wrote its own search engine in its all-out effort to develop the technological wherewithal to compete with Amazon.” King told the paper that “Pangaea replaces everything” that has been traditionally done at Wal-Mart. “My peers, they think I’m out of my mind. Most people don’t replace entire systems in one shot, especially with from-scratch development. But given how rapidly this place is changing, we didn’t have time to screw around.” “To become a successful retailer today, it starts with having the right mindset: … embrace of new business models and development of network orchestration including the digital platforms and customer co-creators who come with it.” We think he is right. The retail sector doesn’t have time to waste. Sticking to the tired, old retail bricks-and-mortar business model only hurts retailers. The opportunity before the industry is to have a hyper-focus on the customer by leveraging an unprecedented amount of data now available, build a virtual network around them, encourage them to co-create the future — in terms of data, products and services — and use that network to catch up to their now increasingly entrenched and growing digital rivals. But none of it is possible without a digital platform, which is as essential as roads and bridges were to the industrial world. It All Starts with Mental Models To become a successful retailer today, it starts with having the right mindset from which flows the following: an embrace of new business models and development of network orchestration, including the digital platforms and customer co-creators who come with it. Then comes the process of continually re-examining one’s core beliefs about retail with an eye towards adapting them to the current digital landscape. But changing mental models can be difficult especially with entrenched legacy thinking and systems. We recommend five steps to change one’s mental models in any industry: Identify some of your common habits and perspectives about how the retail sector should function, including guiding principles, time and capital allocation patterns, primary skills and capabilities, and the key metrics and outcomes that you track. Uncover the core beliefs about retailing that motivate your behaviors, and are the priorities of your firm and board. This step usually takes some ongoing reflection and added perspective from your peers. Industry best practices likely influence your thinking greatly. Invert your core beliefs about retailing and consider the implications for your firm and board. There are many possible inversions in each instance. For example, all retailers should ask themselves, ‘Is digital our first priority? How about our customer network — do we put them in front of merchandise and do we have an entire department dedicated to mobilizing them?’ Extrapolate what implications these new core beliefs, and the various ripple effects, would have for your organization and board. Observe what is happening in your industry and, more broadly, how different core beliefs might help you get ahead of digital disruption by companies like Amazon. Act on your new retail core beliefs (preferably with digital as the center) by sharing them broadly with your customers, employees, suppliers and investors. Purposely changing your business actions, particularly when it comes to time and capital allocation, is an important part of the process and helps reinforce the changes in mental models you are trying to achieve. Surviving and growing in the age of digital networks and technology platforms require new ways of thinking and acting. To prosper as a 21st century retail executive in a fast-changing world, you need to reimagine retailing completely. The first step, however, is to ask yourself if your way of thinking, your core beliefs about retailing, are still working in the networked world of platform companies. If not, invert your core beliefs, test them on your peers, and develop more modern retail beliefs that will create differentiated success today. Indeed, Wal-Mart’s acquisition of Jet.com to take on Amazon clearly showed that it didn’t have the required people, board and processes to prevail in a digital-centric world. What’s next?  Reports of lackluster retail sales do not signal doom and gloom for the future of the sector because there is good news on the digital side of the chasm. And a unifying theme binds companies in retail and other industries: digital platforms and virtual network business models are a prerequisite to success. Although that might not seem like good news to bricks-and-mortar retailers, it is actually an opportunity for executives and boards willing to change. But they need to acknowledge reality and shift gears — now. After all, they have the intangible assets to succeed in the digital era: brand awareness, customer following, experienced workforce, and deep industry knowledge. All they need are new mental and business models to ensure a bright future.

It can be done. It takes a 90 degree mind shift. That’s digital. Joe Willis I’m not sure online will fully replace local. I certainly cannot imagine buying a suit (or even a tie) from a web page. While I do buy hard to find stuff on Amazon, probably the only thing I buy exclusively there is music. There is something about walking out of a store with product in hand. A shopping trip to Walmart usually involves bringing home a goodly supply of groceries and other items, in the long run probably more convenient than dealing with a host of vendors and shipping costs. When I need lumber or hardware for a home project, or components for an auto service project it makes a lot more sense to hit local Home Depot or Autozone than to put the project aside until the products arrive. Claudio Pestana I think to create a new model, to face the new era of customers, it should be done for a new way of thinking, and this is not really possible with the old experienced people. Jacqueline Sosa Buying online is the last thing that appeals to me after working in front of my laptop all day. Very rarely do I buy anything online unless forced to by the very retail stores I visit because inventory in the brick & mortar has dramatically decreased. For example, buying Bose earplugs at Best Buy and they only have two colors in-stock which resulted in me buying a pair but not the feminine color that interested me. After going to the store spending my precious time, gas, and putting mileage on my car, left with the product but not the exact color that attracted me. Didn’t have the heart to leave without buying after the kind people working there spent their time helping me. See, I want people in my hometown to have JOBS. Helping the kid in town by buying at the store so that he/she has a job…a purpose in life. It doesn’t matter which store, it seems nowadays, that inventory is low. Here is what happens when they don’t carry my size, which is 0 in shorts & 5 1/2 in shoes, I leave with $1,000 in my pocket very unhappy and frustrated. Oh, and my guests that visited the stores with me eager to also drop a ton of money, left feeling the same way. If you think I am going to go home and sit in front of that freaking laptop, which I hid under the bed after my week of work was finished, you are fooling yourselves. And here is the other thing people in the retail world need to WAKE-UP to which is foreigners come to the U.S. from as far away as Argentina to SHOP!!!! They come with a ton of money and set aside weeks (not days) but weeks to SHOP because inflation is so high and the quality of products are so poor in their part of the world. Cater to the foreigners because they want to spend their money here! Europeans fly in for weekends and go straight to Bloomingdales in Manhattan to buy Joe (brand name) Jeans. Not kidding. So, you think the option of buying online is going to increase the bottom line when it’s the very thing that can hurt the bottom line because people like to shop in brick & mortar. Discount stores will always get my business if they keep good inventory because I never pay full price for anything. So happy to see this article because the brick & mortar is the way it should be and always be as shopping is like walking into a candy shop after working all day. Jeff Garner A few thoughts… “But in a mobile-first world where transactions are borderless, location can become a liability.” I believe, as Amazon is dipping it’s toes into various forms of a physical presence, the 4000+ Walmart Stores are an incredible asset. One that not only can serve those who want to or need to shop, but more importantly can provide Walmart a competitive advantage over Amazon satisfying web and mobile orders within minutes. An example there is the not so secret Project X’ a drive-up asset grocery store in Seattle’s Ballard neighborhood where Amazon is looking to compete with Walmart’s Grocery Pick-up. For Amazon to provide a similar level of service, in as many areas, as Walmart could cover overnight will take Amazon years and hundreds of millions of dollars. They’re also opening 4 more book stores in cities like Portland and Chicago though there too competition is keen but it seems Amazon sees brand awareness, through a physical store, as a benefit not a liability. “It is clear from our research, as profiled in this monthly column, that capital allocation that prioritizes physical assets such as stores can be a key detriment of growth and value. In the case of Sears, focusing its capital on physical stores” Here I’m surprised your research took you there as Sears, other than some too little too late store within a store initiative, has done anything BUT invest in its stores while being led by a non-retail minded CEO. They are, in my opinion, an unfortunate outlier in retail with, what seems like, little or no desire run a retail business. Over the last 5 years they have closed and sold off assets to build their “Shop Your Way” program all while allowing their remaining stores to deteriorate with little if any investment. For many years a walk through Sears has been like attending a Wake for an old friend with empty shelves and damaged fixtures. This inattention, to what could have been an extension of the online experience and brand builder, instead pushed customers further away from Sears all together neutering their digital investments. “But while the formidable capabilities of this asset-centric giant used to dominate the bricks-and-mortar world, it is clear that having all these stores may be more of a liability than an asset.” Again, how so? Your central argument seems to be that because Amazon has grown bricks-and-mortar will fail. Sort of like “Post hoc ergo propter hoc” which I’m not as confident. The reality may be that there are some situations, for a segment of customers that prefer and feel comfortable, a total digital solution to their shopping needs. No doubt there! However the majority of customers, based upon the whole retail wallet still seem to still prefer going to the store…for now. “The first step, however, is to ask yourself if your way of thinking, your core beliefs about retailing, are still working in the networked world of platform companies.” Are they not working? During the last 20 years, from 1995 to 2014, Amazon has generated revenues of $409 billion where Walmart generated $486 billion in 2014 alone. During that same period Amazon has generated a combined net profit of $1.96 billion. Here Walmart generated $16.18 billion in 2014 alone. So, Walmart generated eight-times more net profit in 2014 than Amazon could during the last 20 years. While 2015 had some challenges for Walmart, 2016 is looking pretty good, so where exactly is this “liability”? In a rush to digital gold where have business fundamentals gone? Don’t misunderstand, I believe much of what you have said in your guidance is correct and I agree with, just perhaps not for the reasons you cite or in the ways you recommend them. Bricks-and-mortar stores, like Sears, that neglect their physical presence in search of digital parity, I feel, like Sears, will fail at both. What separates the winners in retail will be those that can leverage a TRULY transparent omni-channel, not cross-channel, business and customer experience. On-line is just “on-line” but the retailer that can create awesome shopping and service experiences, at a competitive price, across the board, will win. IMHO!

Suburbs Aurora Beacon-News Aurora News Wal-Mart to close West Plaza store in Aurora Wal-Mart to close West Plaza store in Aurora Steve Lord / The Beacon-News Wal-Mart will close its store in the West Plaza Shopping Center in Aurora this fall. Wal-Mart will close its store in the West Plaza Shopping Center in Aurora this fall. (Steve Lord / The Beacon-News) Steve LordAurora Beacon-News Privacy Policy Wal-Mart will close its store in the West Plaza Shopping Center in Aurora by the end of October. The company announced the closing publicly Tuesday, which is also when employees, the building landlord and city officials found out. Delia Garcia, Wal-Mart spokesman, said there were "many factors" involved in the decision to close the store at 2131 W. Galena Blvd., but one of the main ones was that the West Aurora store was a "discount center" instead of a Supercenter. "There are six Supercenters within 10 miles of the Galena location," she said. "This is a discount store, and there was not a line of groceries. Many Aurora customers have already started shopping at these Supercenters because of the one-stop shopping ability." Wal-Mart has Supercenters on the far East Side of Aurora, at Kirk and Butterfield roads, and in Montgomery, Oswego, Naperville, Batavia and Plainfield. The announcement said people can shop at the West Aurora store and pick up prescriptions there through Oct. 28. "Our pharmacy staff will be working with customers to transfer their prescriptions to another convenient location," the announcement said. "The decision to close a store is never easy and we will be working with our store associates to identify suitable transfer opportunities to other area Wal-Mart stores." Carpentersville Wal-Mart customers overcharged due to system glitch Erin Sauder Refunds could be in order for several area shoppers who purchased items at the newly opened Carpentersville Wal-Mart between July 1 and 11, officials said.

Refunds could be in order for several area shoppers who purchased items at the newly opened Carpentersville Wal-Mart between July 1 and 11, officials said. Located at Route 25 and Lake Marian Road, the big box store opened its doors June 22. Walmart charged the 9 percent sales tax rate applicable... (Erin Sauder) Garcia said closing a discount center also is a reaction to the growing number of customers who purchase goods from Wal-Mart online. "Our goal is to provide a seamless shopping experience," she said. "People can shop when they want, where they want, how they want." Another factor was that Wal-Mart does not own the property on West Galena, but leases it. That means the store will be empty after October, and city officials already have scheduled a meeting next week with West Plaza Shopping Center owners to discuss the situation. David Hulseberg, chief executive officer of Invest Aurora, the city's economic development not-for-profit corporation, said Mayor Tom Weisner requested he get a meeting together between the city and West Plaza property owners. The center is unusual in that is has several different property owners, including the owner of the Wal-Mart building. "We want to get a game plan that has all the various property owners working together," Hulseberg said. "How do we move this in the right direction." Wal-Mart launches scheduling system to improve predictability Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz Wal-Mart has rolled out a new scheduling system that aims to give employees more control and predictability in their hours, but advocates who have been calling for such changes as a key step in the fight to improve low-wage workers' lives expressed concerns that it falls short.

(WSMV) MURFREESBORO, TN (WSMV) - Police are investigating a possible rape at a Walmart in Murfreesboro. A woman said she was raped early Sunday morning after leaving Walmart at 2900 S. Rutherford Blvd. Police are now investigating her claims. According to a police report, the alleged rape happened around 3:40 a.m. in the store’s parking lot. A woman said she was inside the store when a man approached her. She said when she walked out of the store, the man grabbed her arm, pulled her into his car and raped her. When she got out of the car, the alleged victim took a picture of the vehicle’s license plate and gave it to police. There are no security guards at this location, but shoppers said they would like to see that change. “You need to have more security, more police, whatever,” Wilma Miller said. “I live very close to here and I’ve never heard something like that before,” Bryner Enriquez said. The tag is registered to a gray, four-door Volkswagen. It was registered to a man in Shelbyville who police believe may be the suspect. Murfreesboro police would not answer Channel 4’s questions about the suspect or the alleged rape. They would only say it’s under investigation. Walmart has issued the following statement concerning the incident: Police alerted us to the report of what happened in our parking lot, and we immediately pulled the surveillance video for review. We’ll continue working with detectives until their investigation is completed. Copyright 2016 WSMV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.

In-depth look: Judges throw out appeal, Walmart a go By Jill Barnes Nelson, Tehachapi News Aug 28, 2016 City of Tehachapi An artist's rendering of a proposed Tehachapi Super Walmart. The third time may be the charm. After three appeals concerning an environmental impact report, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Fresno last week ruled the City of Tehachapi has adequately addressed environmental issues related to the proposed Walmart. The decision of the three-panel judge issued Aug. 24 was unanimous, and followed a hearing on the case held July 26. The judges made no comments at the time of their decision but did issue a written ruling. “It appears the city and Walmart have prevailed in the appeals court,” City Manager Greg Garrett said. “They still have 60 days to appeal after the decision became public, but it’s my understanding they would have to go to the California Supreme Court.” Garrett said Walmart already has contacted the city and plans to move forward on the 165,000-square-foot center at the southeast corner of Tucker Road and Tehachapi Boulevard. “Walmart is probably at least a year away from starting anything,” Garrett said. A group called Tehachapi First, which emerged after the city approved Walmart in 2011, challenged the adequacy of environmental reviews related to the proposed Walmart through its attorney, Mark Wolfe of San Francisco. Following the Aug. 24 appeals court decision, Tehachapi News tried to contact Wolfe, but received no response. However, Tehachapi First posted this statement on its Facebook page: “As most of you doubtlessly know, the appeals court in Stockton (sic) has ruled in favor of Walmart and the Tehachapi city government — though the ruling is no favor to the people of Tehachapi. We have lost this battle — but we do not know what the aftermath will be. We have kept Walmart out of Tehachapi for five years — and what cancer victim would not be thankful for a five-year lease on life? But as of yet, we don’t know if Walmart will actually build in Tehachapi.” It continues, “Five years may have been enough time for Walmart to change its mind about our valley — especially as it appears Walmart has entered its period of decline and needs its resources to engage in its absurd godzilla struggle with Amazon. If Walmart doesn’t build, our struggle has not been in vain. And if Walmart builds? Well, then, the result will not be what we wished, but better than if we had never taken up the fight at all. Better to have fought and lost than never to have fought at all.” The fight to stop Walmart had been brought before courts twice before by Tehachapi First. Along the way the city made additional revisions to its environmental reviews. The last time it went to court was in July 2015 after Kern County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Twisselman ruled the City of Tehachapi had adequately addressed environmental concerns related to the project. Three main issues were brought up in this latest appeal by Tehachapi First. The court said in its report that the plaintiff contends the revised EIR’s treatment of cumulative noise impacts violated the California Environmental Quality Act on three separate grounds. The first had to do with a claim of error relating to the location on residential lots where measurements were taken to establish the baseline noise level. “We reject this contention because plaintiff has not shown that a general or specific rule of law dictates where such measurements should be taken. Thus, we conclude that the identification of the proper location presented a question of fact committed to the discretion of City in its role as the lead agency.” The second claim related to the revised EIR’s decision to evaluate roadway segments containing hotels by using the noise thresholds applicable to commercial property, rather than residential property. “The plaintiff has not established the foundation for its argument that the roadway segments should have been subject to the noise standards used for residential property.” The third claim of error related to the standards or thresholds used to determine whether cumulative noise impacts were significant and whether the project’s incremental contributions to significant cumulative noise impacts were “‘cumulatively considerable’” for purposes of CEQA. The court ruled this claim also failed. “We therefore affirm the order discharging the writ of mandate.” Garrett reported that Walmart has paid for all the court costs involved in the appeals and that the company could attempt to recoup its costs from Tehachapi First. Mayor Susan Wiggins also was happy the appeals process could be at an end. “I’m really happy to hear this,” Wiggins said by phone. “I listened to both sides and also from some 350 senior citizens who said they needed the Walmart. They said didn’t want to drive to Bakersfield anymore to get lower prices on the things they need. I’m glad this finally could be over.” For a full account of the court’s decision, go to appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/case/mainCaseScreen.cfm?dist=5&doc_id=2118001&doc_no=F072149 To join the lively discussion of this decision and what it could mean for the community, go to the Tehachapi News’ Facebook page.

 A study reveals a disturbing trend about Walmart locations across the US Kate Taylor Aug. 30, 2016, 3:48 PM 23,427 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle/Getty Images The worst Walmarts are located in low-income, minority communities. That's according to a study published in May by Contexts, a quarterly publication of the American Sociological Association. A Walmart store's location is closely related to how good or bad the store's customer service is, the study found. The study, which was recently highlighted by The Atlantic's CityLab, evaluated customer service by analyzing the Yelp reviews of 2,840 Walmart locations across the US. Stores in areas that have lower average incomes have significantly worse customer reviews than locations in higher-income ZIP codes. Additionally, locations in areas with higher proportions of black or Latino residents have worse reviews than those in areas with more white residents. The study's author, Adam Reich, an assistant professor of sociology at Columbia University, analyzed approximately 35,000 reviews of Walmart locations and found that there was a consistent correlation between a neighborhood's majority race and socioeconomic status, and a location's Yelp reviews. Reich blames the disparity on Walmart's decision to understaff stores in certain areas. In the early 2000s, Walmart implemented cost-cutting policies that reduced the number of necessary employees per store and resulted in a drop in stores' quality. This study provides evidence that a decrease in store quality was not consistent across the board, but instead affected some customers more than others. "Walmart is the largest retailer and largest employer in the world; moreover, it has consciously branded itself as a champion of and boon for disadvantaged communities," Reich wrote. "Its underinvestment in these communities is thus particularly notable." A Walmart spokesperson told Business Insider that the company found the analysis to be "flawed and without merit."  David McNew/Getty Images "Our customer traffic and overall customer satisfaction scores have been improving and we're focused on continuing to do better," Walmart spokesperson Lorenzo Lopez said in a statement to Business Insider. "Our associates play a critical role in the company's success and that's why we've invested $2.7 billion on associate education, training and wages. We're also proud to provide communities across the country, regardless of social or economic background, access to affordable goods and career opportunities to help them better provide for their families." The study may in fact have a few holes. The reliance on Yelp means that researchers can't examine reviewers' biases and outside influences. For example, a store's location in a lower-income or predominantly black or Latino neighborhood may affect how its quality is perceived by some reviewers, regardless of the store's customer service. However, this isn't the first time Walmart's apparent understaffing has been called into question. Reports of Walmart saving money by reducing staff members have also gotten the retailer into hot water with police. Earlier in August, Bloomberg reported that more than 200 violent crimes had been committed this year at Walmart locations across the US. Bloomberg reported that the rise in crime is a result of corporate policies. The cost-cutting policies resulted in a drop in quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," a Walmart representative said in an email to Business Insider earlier in August. While Walmart's cost-cutting policies have had negative — and, at times, dangerous — outcomes for customers, they have also driven profits: Bloomberg found that sales per employee in the US grew 23% in the last decade, to $236,804. Joe Raedle / Staff / Getty Images Reich writes that the retailer can turn a profit despite providing poor customer service because Walmart's super-low prices have helped put local competition out of business. As a result, Walmart becomes some customers' only option — no matter how poor the shopping experience is. However, Reich argues that the retailer may suffer in the long term if it doesn't make some major changes. A poor shopping experience could be increasingly damaging for the brand as online shopping grows and competitors increasingly invest in providing quality in-store experiences. "For Walmart and other retailers, providing a pleasant customer service experience seems likely to be increasingly important to corporate profitability," Reich wrote. "For its own sake, then, Walmart should hire more employees, particularly at stores in low-income communities of color, and give all Walmart employees more reasons to smile through better wages and working conditions."

They are excellent points to take if you choose not to shop at Walmart, but they are fallacies of distraction which pull us away from the true argument — does Walmart have a right, in capitalistic society, to open and operate a business? You see, the argument is not whether we like or dislike Walmart, but rather, whether we believe in a command market economy or a free market economy. A command market economy is a “socialist economic system in which production and distribution of goods and services are controlled by the government;” and a free market economy is “an economic system in which a country’s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit.” Personally, I have moral issues with companies like McDonalds, Starbucks, and Carl’s Jr. even though I disagree with the causes these companies support. As a true capitalist, I would never deny them the right, in a so called “free-market” society, to operate and sell product wherever they choose to do so. My response, as a “patriotic American” (I use your terms), is to choose not to patronize those businesses. I find these businesses distasteful for some of the same moral issues that “Walmartophobes” find, but, in a society that fosters a free-market economy, it would be illogical for me to do anything against those companies, other than refuse to shop at them. My final thought about this whole Walmart issue is that Adam Smith (author of “The Wealth of Nations”) must be rolling in his grave!

By Laura Rice • Aug 30, 2016 TweetShareGoogle+Email Liquor sales are a $14 billion business annually but state policies that prevent Walmart from selling liquor date back to the end of Prohibition. The big-box giant argues those rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination. Bill Lile/Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) From Texas Standard: Walmart sells everything from guns to grapefruit. But right now, it can't sell liquor – at least not in Texas. The mega-retailer is going to court to change that, but liquor store owners are fighting the effort, alongside the state of Texas. Some of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission's rules preventing Walmart from selling liquor date back to the end of Prohibition. But the big-box store corporation argues the rules amount to unconstitutional discrimination.   Listen Listening... / 5:30 Associated Press reporter Michael Graczyk says there's a big market for liquor in Texas. "The Comptroller's office says it's worth about $14 billion in sales," he says, "so we're talking big bucks in booze." Walmart stores, which number in the 600s including Sam's Club stores, already sell beer and wine, but Texas law restricts them from selling hard liquor. "They [sell liquor] in 31 other states," he says. "Texas is among the few they don't. And Texas is the only one where they're suing to try to get in." In Texas, publicly traded companies are not allowed to hold liquor licenses, Graczyk says – a policy that dates back to the 1930s. "Despite the bar on publicly traded companies... hotel corporations are allowed," he says. "Another issue is liquor licenses are limited to five per holder. But that rule is out the window if you have a blood relative [who has a license]." Licenses can be consolidated among close blood relatives, like parents and children or siblings. "That accounts for the growth of family-owned liquor chains in Texas," Graczyk says. Walmart, in their lawsuit, says these laws are discriminatory. "[Walmart executives] don't have any blood relatives who fit this template," he says, "so it's unfair to them, and ultimately to Texas consumers, because they're saying they can provide liquor, presumably, at a cheaper price." A statewide stores' association with about 2,500 members appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to join the lawsuit on the side of the state. Last session, bills introduced in the Legislature that would help Walmart earn the right to sell liquor died in committee. "Presumably, the lobbyists for the Texas Package Stores Association are pretty convincing," he says. "It was supposed to go to trial next month but the whole process got stopped when the Package Stores Association appealed the ruling... now it's up to the federal judge to set a new court trial date."

Jacob's three year-old sister Sophia and seven year-old brother Liam help guide him into the hospital. next play/pause pre Ottawa South News By Michelle Nash Baker Jacob Randell loves dinosaurs. Apparently he’s a big fan. So when four Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaurs met him in CHEO’s parking lot, the 12 year-old said he thought it was pretty cool. “I started to think something big was going to happen,” he said. Something big did happen. Jacob will be this year’s new CHEO’s Children’s Miracle Network Champion. A campaign sponsored by Walmart Canada, a champion has the unique opportunity to advocate for the hospital and encourage people to donate to the CHEO Foundation. Jacob said he intends to take the job seriously and although he finds it hard to pick one thing about the hospital he loves (he loves everything) he is quick to say they saved his life. “CHEO is my life. CHEO is one of the best hospitals ever. The doctors and nurses are amazing,” Jacob said. Jacob will also travel to Orlando, Florida, to be part of a Children’s Miracle Network Momentum conference at Disney World. There Jacob will have a chance to meet other champions from pediatric hospitals across North America. On hand to welcome Jacob as the new CHEO champion was last year’s champ, eight year-old Hodan Osman. Hodan had the pleasure of handing over the reigns – in this case Mickey Mouse ears – to Jacob. “I think Jacob is going to have an amazing time,” Hodan said. Like Hodan, Jacob will now represent CHEO throughout the coming year as the face of the 2017 Walmart campaign. According to Walmart, this campaign is one of the easiest to have nearly all of its 94,000 associates across Canada participate in.   After a seven-year battle with a rare brain cancer and Schwannoma, a genetic condition that causes tumours to grow on nerve endings, Jacob continues to inspire and amaze his mother, Liliane Randell. “He’s got this connection with everyone he meets,” she said. “He’s seen more than he should and has lived beyond his years, and just when you think he can’t do something – he goes and amazes you.” That is why she said he is the perfect choice to represent CHEO. The champions program honours children who have triumphed over various medical challenges. Children are selected as ambassadors and represent the 17 million children treated each year at Children’s Miracle Network member hospitals in Canada and the U.S.   | (0) Comment Join The Conversation Sign Up Login Latest Local News News Ottawa looking to replicate banner film, TV successes of 2016 Snapshot News Crews prepare Rideau Canal for 47th season of skating Snapshot News Police to host meetings on service delivery changes Snapshot News Youth Experience Project launches to give Ottawa kids backstage pass to fun Snapshot PHOTOS AND VIDEOS View All Photos View All Videos National Research Council of Canada Trudeau says ISIL mission, Keystone came up in chat with Obama Photo Gallery The balance of nature never was Photo Gallery Passing the torch into 2017 The Hot List: Top 10 cottage rental locations in Ontario Sponsored content Most Read SEE MORE Crews prepare Rideau Canal for 47th season of skating The ‘grocery girls’ are the meat in Dunrobin City grants Bayview buyer extension to finalize sale ‘They are not alone at all’ Ottawa looking to replicate banner film, TV successes of 2016 In Your Neighbourhood Today Party Planning 101: Informing neighbours in a rental building You may love to celebrate with your close friends and family during the holiday season, but that...

"We're not going to run out of these items," said Aaron Klein, store manager for Walmart's Secaucus location. In the holiday designated section of the store - which in about two weeks will be abundantly supplied with Halloween items - the shelves are stocked with back-to-school products like notebooks, crayons, themed backpacks, pens, pencils and just about any other school item you could think of.  "This coming week is our peak," Klein added. "We have to restock every day at all hours of the day." And just in case parents are running short on time, Walmart also offers in-store pickup. Customers can order items they need online at Walmart.com and depending on if the item is in stock, it will be ready for pickup within 24 hours. "We want to make the shopping experience seamless," Klein said. Customers say Walmart provides a certain convenience for their back-to-school shopping. Elizabeth, a resident of Secaucus whose children go to the Clarendon Elementary school, says she goes to Walmart for the prices. "Everything's always here. It's local, convenient and close to home." "If I can't find it here I go somewhere else," said Danielle Martinez, a resident of Secaucus shopping for her children's school supplies. "But I usually find it here."

 CommerceHub extends Walmart partnership to third-party marketplace BI Intelligence Aug. 30, 2016, 12:30 AM 1,271 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Here's why omnichannel consumers are more valuable Fabletics expands its brick-and-mortar operations Walmart acquires ShoeBuy for $70M This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. E-commerce integration and fulfillment provider CommerceHub has expanded its partnership with Walmart beyond managing its drop-ship fulfillment, reports Chain Store Age. The new agreement allows CommerceHub retail clients to seamlessly integrate with Walmart to sell goods on its third-party e-commerce site, Walmart Marketplace. CommerceHub boasts over 9,000 retail clients, including major players like Sears, Costco, and Best Buy. This partnership makes it easy for retailers like these to sell via Walmart and leverage its expansive online platform.  Walmart's e-commerce business is growing and adding new third-party retailers will likely boost it further. During Q2 2016, global online sales on Walmart's e-commerce sites grew nearly 12% YoY. CEO Doug McMillan pointed out the growth of Walmart Marketplace on the earnings call, noting that since the start of the year, it has added nearly 7 million new items available for purchase. This was likely partially driven by a partnership with marketing firm ChannelAdvisor in April to easily onboard merchants to Walmart Marketplace. Adding CommerceHub retailers will only lend more strength to Walmart Marketplace, which currently counts about 550 total merchants. However, Walmart still has a long way to go before it can catch up to other third-party sites. Most notably, Amazon has nearly 2 million third-party merchants, which offer close to 365 million products online, greatly outnumbering those on Walmart Marketplace. There is also a longer vetting process for Walmart merchants than for those on other platforms. On average, it takes six weeks for Walmart to accept a third-party vendor, compared to only one day for competitors Amazon and eBay. Should Walmart fail to keep up with competitors in the third-party marketplace arena, we expect that the company's focus would shift instead to growing sales on Jet.com, which the company acquired earlier this month for $3 billion.   To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the E-Commerce Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images As a freshman senator with his eye on the presidency, Barack Obama said he’d never shop at a Wal-Mart and held the company up as an emblem of corporate greed. Today, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is one of Obama’s most reliable corporate allies, a go-to partner that’s backed the White House on more than a dozen business initiatives, particularly Obamacare and climate change. The pairing benefits both. Obama can point to Wal-Mart’s support to beat back Republican charges that he’s hostile to business. Wal-Mart can point to the president’s embrace to lure squeamish shoppers who, like Obama of old, have stayed away out of a belief the company hurts workers and undercuts competition. This is a key part of the company’s effort to spur continued growth. “It only makes sense for the president to be willing to strike a partnership with the nation’s largest retailer,” said Dwight Hill, a Plano, Texas-based partner with retail consultancy McMillan Doolittle. “And Wal-Mart has made more strides of late to try to be more transparent about worker pay and benefits. They have certainly seen the light.” The president completed the turn from Wal-Mart antagonist to fan when he visited one of the retailer’s stores in Mountain View, California, in 2014 to praise its use of renewable energy. Obama’s visit represented a “major milestone” for the company and its public image, said Jib Ellison, whose consulting firm worked on Wal-Mart’s sustainability program. “When he got elected, his rhetoric was very anti-Wal-Mart,” said Ellison, who continues to advise Wal-Mart on environmental policies. “So it’s reaffirming." Health Care The partnership between the president and the retailer is especially strong in two areas: health care and climate change. Obama’s view of Wal-Mart shifted early in his presidency when he realized he needed business support to advance his health-care overhaul, which Republicans claimed would kill jobs and drive companies out of business. Wal-Mart was one of the first major employers to sign on to the plan. In June 2009, as debate raged in Congress, Wal-Mart publicly released a letter to Obama saying it supported requiring employers to offer health insurance to their workers, a keystone of the law. For Wal-Mart, the Affordable Care Act resolved a major gripe about the company: that it provided weak health benefits for its more than 1 million workers in the U.S. Obamacare created a system of subsidized insurance for middle-income Americans and expanded the Medicaid program for the poor to cover people earning poverty-level wages. Pressure subsided on Wal-Mart to provide coverage. When government-run insurance exchanges opened in 2014, Wal-Mart stopped offering health insurance to 30,000 part-time workers. “Obamacare is great for Wal-Mart workers; it was a huge transfer of wealth,” said Nelson Lichtenstein, director of the Center for the Study of Work, Labor, and Democracy at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who wrote a book on Wal-Mart. “The pressure is off Wal-Mart to provide better health insurance to its own employees. If you’re a single mom and work at Wal-Mart you now qualify for Medicaid.” Toluse Olorunnipa and Alex Wayne Wal-Mart and the White House have cooperated on Obama’s climate agenda, which current and former company executives described as a natural gelling of interests rather than a political calculation. Wal-Mart began pushing to cut its carbon footprint in 2005 as a way to not only help the environment, but also improve its public image, and is now the largest corporate user of solar energy. Last year, the company endorsed the global accord Obama negotiated in Paris to reduce carbon emissions. Leslie Dach, who ran Wal-Mart’s government relations and corporate affairs department from 2006 until 2013 before joining the Obama administration, published a piece in the Huffington Post shortly before leaving the company titled: “Wal-Mart Agrees With the President: The Time for Renewables Has Come.” The retailer seized upon an offhand comment by the president during a speech that week at Georgetown University, in which he said “Wal-Mart deserves a cheer” for reducing carbon pollution. Obama’s senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said the White House has found in Wal-Mart a willing partner as its reached out to various businesses to embrace administration’s initiatives. “We recognize that the private sector is the economic engine of our country,” Jarrett said in an interview. “It’s not enough just to have these policies on the books.” Working with the administration helps the retailer address the social and environmental issues that the company’s customers care about, said Kathleen McLaughlin, Wal-Mart’s chief sustainability officer and CEO of the Wal-Mart Foundation. “It’s so essential that we have these collaborations,” she said. Dialing McMillon When Wal-Mart announced it would raise its minimum wage for employees in early 2015, after some encouragement from the administration, Obama called Wal-Mart Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon from Air Force One to congratulate him and told a crowd in North Carolina that “once Wal-Mart is paying people more, then you know that something is happening, right?”   The pair have also worked on veteran employment, financial security, workforce training, gun control, criminal justice issues and First Lady Michelle Obama’s healthy lifestyle campaign. As Obama was urging Congress to pass tougher restrictions on guns, Wal-Mart removed military-style rifles from its stores in August 2015, citing declining demand. For Wal-Mart, all of this is aimed at bolstering its standing with a key demographic of shoppers it must reach for continued growth -- upper-income families in traditionally liberal areas like Chicago, Los Angeles and the East Coast. “Given the fact the company isn’t growing that much, they really need to expand, in these coastal cities,” Lichtenstein said. “There has been a certain percentage of Americans that just won’t shop there for political reasons.” Key Demographic The company’s warm ties with Obama don’t seem to bother its base of customers in redder parts of the country. In Elizabeth, Colorado, a fast-growing area about 46 miles (74 kilometers) southeast of downtown Denver where just 13 percent of voters identify themselves as Democrats, some shoppers recoiled at a reporter’s mention of Obama’s name. Others said they didn’t care. Betty Erickson, 82, a retired cashier, said she cares more about whether Wal-Mart’s shelves are fully stocked and their prices stable than the company’s decision to discontinue selling rifles or other politically controversial products. “But I am glad that they are paying their workers more,” she said. Money has followed Wal-Mart’s embrace of Obama. The company increased its political spending during his presidency, with donations to Democrats no longer trailing Republicans by huge margins. Political Giving Wal-Mart’s political action committee gave $1.2 million to federal candidates during the 2012 cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington nonprofit that tracks campaign spending. Democrats claimed about half that money, up from 21 percent in 2004 and only 14 percent in 2000. So far this cycle, Democrats have received about 41 percent of Wal-Mart’s $1.1 million in contributions, with Republicans getting the rest. Alice Walton, the daughter of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton, gave $353,000 to Hillary Clinton’s joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee. The détente, however, does not include some Democrats who continue to criticize Wal-Mart -- as Obama once did -- for its labor practices and relatively low wages. The retailer is still a favorite target for attacks by party activists. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders continues to hold the company up as the epitome of inequality and has said it should “get off of welfare, pay your workers a living wage.” ‘Viciously Anti-Union’ Robert Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton, said he was upset that Obama had visited the “viciously anti-union” retailer’s Mountain View store. But he said he understood the rationale for working with the company. “It is the largest employer in America and I think it’s understandable that a president would want to work with them and coax them along,” Reich, now a public policy professor at University of California, Berkeley, said in a telephone interview.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Aware of the criticism he would face from his base for building closer ties with Wal-Mart, Obama’s outreach was part of a broader strategy to court a range of businesses during a time of heightened congressional gridlock. The president in 2014 partnered with companies on initiatives including finding jobs for the long-term unemployed, improving worker training and fighting climate change. Wal-Mart was often part of those projects. Wal-Mart still has work to do before coastal liberals brave its Supercenters, said Allen Adamson, founder of BrandSimple Consulting, and it will likely have to continue to cozy up with Democrats to sway opinions. “They are starting to make some progress, but it is very hard if you are very big to change people’s perceptions,” Adamson said. “Once consumers categorize you as big, but not necessarily good, it is hard to change that perception.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Police said the gun was used in a crime spree Sunday. But, the trio of suspects didn't get away with it. The crime spree started at Home Depot on Stage Road, where three people are accused of lifting two nail guns worth $800. Then, it was off just after 6 p.m. to Walmart on Germantown Parkway.  It was there that police said Randy Johnson and Nadle Burrow were seen loading a shopping cart with more than $1,200 worth of baby clothes. Johnson tried to walk out of Walmart with the clothes, but security saw him. Police said Johnson, with Walmart staff on his trail, left the baby clothes in the shopping cart and ran across Germantown Parkway. Investigators said he jumped into an older model Maroon Lincoln with 22-inch rims. Burrows was driving the car.  Their next stop was Kroger, just down the road, where they were seen stealing more than $500 worth of meat and groceries. They put it in the trunk of the Lincoln, according to police. Police said Tony Fason was the getaway driver for that theft. Shopper Stephanie Camacho said she's angry that people would steal items that she works hard to purchase. "Very angry. We work hard, you know, and everybody should have to pay for what they need," Camacho said. When officers caught up with the trio, they found Johnson had nine warrants. Those warrants included aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking.  Police discovered a bag of crack in Fason's pocket and officers found a silver handgun under the gas cap flap in the Lincoln when they processed it. The trio faces several charges, including felony shoplifting and unlawful possession of a weapon. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

City Council President Kenny Thompson says it has come up four or five times in the last fifteen years, and that the vote continues to get closer. But now, talk around town is that not selling alcohol could make them lose one of their biggest retailers: Walmart. "We have not heard that from Walmart," said Thompson. "But we have heard that rumor. I heard that three times just yesterday. I don't think they would do that, I would hope they wouldn't do that. If they did, we couldn't operate. Almost half our revenue comes from Walmart. If they did close, we'd be in serious trouble." Thompson says the store supports the town going wet. Calls to Walmart leaders went unanswered. Meanwhile, a group, Hartselle Citizens for Economic Development, is working to get a petition to the council to get a possible wet vote on the ballot. That petition would have to be signed by 30% of the population, that's 812 registered voters. If done in time, it could put it on the ballot during a very important election. "In November, during the presidential election, which would be a great turnout, you'd get a lot better sampling of the voters," said Thompson. And once again, the longtime issue would once again be decided in voting booths. Thompson explains the council would have the complete ordinance dictating the limitations of liquor sales in place before the election.

Several others were phoned in to stores in the Anchorage area. By ELIZABETH EARL Peninsula Clarion Police in Kenai responded to a bomb threat at the Kenai Walmart on Monday morning. Employees and customers chatted and enjoyed the 75-degree, sunny weather as the Kenai Police Department swept the building after a bomb threat was phoned in. Walmart employees called the threat in to the Kenai Police Department at 10:09 a.m. as the managers were in the process of evacuating the store, said Kenai Police Chief Dave Ross. “We had officers search the building and nothing was found,” Ross said. “We’re still investigating.” Employees and customers returned to the store around 11:15 a.m. For any future leads, the Kenai Police Department will coordinate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Anchorage, which handles bomb threats because they are federal felony offenses. Several bomb threats were also phoned in to Anchorage-area stores around the same time. Staci Feger-Pellessier, a spokesperson for the FBI in Anchorage, said there was no additional information available Monday about the threats in Anchorage. Ross said it wasn’t clear whether the calls in Anchorage and the call in Kenai were connected, though they occurred around the same time. Walmart spokesperson Charles Crowson said in an email that the company would continue to work with law enforcement agencies to find those responsible. “What happened (Monday) is frustrating, and we recognize the seriousness of someone making any threat against our stores,” he said. “Our customers and associates deserve to shop and work without worrying about their safety being threatened, even when that threat turns out to be a hoax. We’re grateful local law enforcement has been responsive to these calls and has ensured the safety of everyone at our stores until the matters have been resolved.”   Reach Elizabeth Earl at elizabeth.earl@peninsulaclarion.com.

The US Department of Labor accuses construction company Phaze Concrete of hiring underage laborers to do excavation jobs, operate forklifts and saws, and build concrete forms for long hours with little pay in dangerous condition. The company used teenagers for work on new stores for Wal-Mart in Missouri, Scheels All Sports in Kansas and Hobby Lobby in Nebraska, among other jobs, court documents filed Tuesday show. Utah-based Phaze Concrete (pictured) is the target of a federal lawsuit on accusations of using teenagers to work on a number of constructions sites Underage laborers built new stores for Wal-Mart in Missouri (not pictured), Scheels All Sports in Kansas and Hobby Lobby in Nebraska, among other jobs, court documents show Phaze Concrete had been accused previously of paying their workers below minimum wage so it could funnel money to the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints,The Salt Lake Tribune reported.  The controversial church's disgraced former leader, Warren Jeffs, is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting two underage girls, 12 and 15, whom he called his 'spiritual wives.' The FLDS Church split from the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints largely because of its polygamous doctrines.

Share this article Share Federal investigators said they believe Phaze pulled many teenage workers from the group's home base along the Utah-Arizona border over the decade. Two teens who grew up in the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints said in court documents they were pulled out of school to go to work at ages 12 and 14. The teens said they were paid $200 every two weeks for working construction for 12 hours a day or more, though those payments could be irregular.  Phaze Concrete was previously accused of paying their workers below minimum wage so they could throw money to the polygamous Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose disgraced leader Warren Jeffs (pictured) is imprisoned Jeffs is serving a life sentence in Texas for sexually assaulting two underage girls, 12 and 15, whom he called his 'spiritual wives' (pictured) Phaze workers were also often told to sign over their paychecks so the money could be used by leaders of the group, according to court documents. U.S. Department of Labor lawyers want a judge to order the company to pay back wages and stop using child labor. The case filed Tuesday marks the latest move by federal investigators to rein in the secretive group tied to abuses from underage marriage to discrimination against non-members.  U.S. Department of Labor lawyers also filed a child labor case against another Utah-based company accused of putting hundreds of children to work for long hours with little food on a pecan farm in 2012.  Paragon Contractors denied it, but in June a judge found it had violated the law. In Arizona, a jury found this spring that the twin polygamous towns on the Utah border violated the constitutional rights of nonbelievers by denying them basic services such as police protection. The FLDS Church (members pictured) split from the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints largely because of its polygamous doctrines Several church leaders have also been charged in Utah with conducting a multimillion-dollar food stamp fraud scheme. Leader Lyle Jeffs escaped home confinement in that case and remains on the run.  Wal-Mart, Scheels All Sports and Hobby Lobby did not immediately return messages from the Associated Press seeking comment on Wednesday. A lawyer for Phaze, Blake Hamilton, said Wednesday the company hasn't yet been served and he couldn't comment on the allegations.  Read more: How Utah concrete companies, using underpaid workers and teens, send money to a polygamous church | The Salt Lake Tribune Share or comment on this article e-mail 57 shares Most watched News videos Dan Bilzerian show off glitzy lifestyle as 'King of Instagram' Cyclist forced off the road by dangerous braking driver Blind man attaches GoPro to guide dog to record his commute Heartbreaking moment horse cries at owner's funeral 'I thought he was going to hit me': Ann Widdecombe on Philpott Great White shark breaches the water in pursuit of a tasty treat "UFO" has been filmed demonstrating highly unusual behaviour Stepdaughter surprises stepmom with adoption papers at Christmas Meryl Streep arrives at Debbie Reynolds' and Carrie Fisher's memorial Dangling kid rescued from a ski lift at Whistler Mountain Police Video Shows Rescue Of Kidnapped Man Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds are buried together Pictured: The Fort Lauderdale 'air rage' gunman who 'argued...

Things to do in the Lehigh Valley this weekend News Local News East Penn Movie Tavern pulled from tonight's agenda in Lower Macungie Movie Tavern tower approved The Lower Macungie zoning hearing board granted a variance for a 60-foot tower in July 2016, after earlier rejecting a 65-foot tower.  The Lower Macungie zoning hearing board granted a variance for a 60-foot tower in July 2016, after earlier rejecting a 65-foot tower.  Andrew WagamanContact ReporterOf The Morning Call No compromise in sight between Jaindl, Lower Macungie on eve of Movie Tavern vote TREXLERTOWN — The Trexler Business Center, which includes the Movie Tavern, has been pulled from the agenda for tonight's Lower Macungie commissioners meeting. The township did not immediately give a reason for postponing the much-anticipated vote for a third consecutive meeting. But developer David Jaindl said officials wanted more time to review his team's most recent letter, submitted to the township Wednesday, on why his development should be exempt from a transportation impact fee.   Movie Tavern's future in Trexlertown hinges on that very fee, about $770,000. Jaindl believes Lower Macungie Township is illegally charging him. The township Board of Commissioners were expected to vote tonight on the final development plan approval for the Trexler Business Center, a 17-acre commercial development along Hamilton Boulevard next to the Wal-Mart Supercenter. But given the stalemate, it was unclear if a decision would resolve or perpetuate the conflict.  Act 209 of 1990 enables municipalities to assess fees on new development based on the amount of traffic the development is expected to generate during the worst point of daily traffic. Lower Macungie adopted an ordinance that allowed it to implement the impact fee in 2009. Fast facts about Movie Tavern and the Trexler Business Center Andrew Wagaman Fast facts about Movie Tavern and the Trexler Business Center: Movie Tavern announced last October it would open its first Lehigh Valley cinema-eatery at a proposed Jaindl Land Co. commercial center on Hamilton Boulevard. The Dallas-based company offers patrons food and drinks served at their seats... Fast facts about Movie Tavern and the Trexler Business Center: Movie Tavern announced last October it would open its first Lehigh Valley cinema-eatery at a proposed Jaindl Land Co. commercial center on Hamilton Boulevard. The Dallas-based company offers patrons food and drinks served at their seats... (Andrew Wagaman) Jaindl, along with his project engineer and attorney, have insisted that his development plan is exempt from the fee because it predates Lower Macungie's ordinance and because he's already paid for significant road improvements in the area. The township's proposed resolution on Thursday's agenda calls for Jaindl to pay a binding $905,000 fee, though it would be closer to $770,000 after a few credited improvements. Despite a month's worth of exchanged arguments and two previously postponed votes, no ground had apparently been made toward a compromise by Thursday.  Lower Macungie plays hardball with Jaindl over Movie Tavern plan, traffic impact fees Andrew Wagaman TREXLERTOWN — Developer David Jaindl and Lower Macungie Township have not budged from their opposing positions on whether the Movie Tavern-anchored Trexler Business Center should be subject to traffic impact fees. Jaindl insists the law is on his side. But township officials know time is on theirs.... TREXLERTOWN — Developer David Jaindl and Lower Macungie Township have not budged from their opposing positions on whether the Movie Tavern-anchored Trexler Business Center should be subject to traffic impact fees. Jaindl insists the law is on his side. But township officials know time is on theirs.... (Andrew Wagaman) If the township eventually approves the resolution as-is, Jaindl must provide written acceptance of the resolution within three weeks and pay the fee before obtaining building permits. Movie Tavern, the anchor tenant of Jaindl's commercial center, has threatened to abandon its first Lehigh Valley project if it becomes clear the cinema-eatery cannot open by next summer. Jaindl said Wednesday that he would clarify Movie Tavern's deadline prior to Thursday's meeting. Kade Pittman, Movie Tavern's director of real estate, was not available for comment Wednesday or Thursday.  Strife over the traffic fee did not begin until days before Lower Macungie was expected to approve the final development plan Aug. 4. The conflict accelerated Aug. 11, when the township told Jaindl that it wasn't going to budge. A 2004 rendition of the Trexler Business Center plan included a Lowe's Home Improvement as the anchor tenant. When Lower Macungie adopted its traffic impact fee program in 2009, it apparently excluded Jaindl's property from a list of sites on which future growth would trigger the fee. Jaindl says this indicates the township recognized it as an already-developed property. But Joseph Fiocco, a traffic engineer who helped Lower Macungie develop its impact fee program, wrote in an Aug. 10 letter that Jaindl should pay the fee because the current plan features a new main tenant with different traffic characteristics. Bud Newton, Jaindl's project engineer, said in a seven-page retort that even if Jaindl concedes the change triggers a new traffic study, a fee should only be assessed if Movie Tavern generates more trips than "existing traffic counts" projected when Lowe's was the main tenant. He argued that Movie Tavern will bring less traffic. Newton added that the site is part of an originally larger Jaindl property on which the Wal-Mart and West Valley Marketplace were developed in the late 1990s. He said the cost of the combined traffic improvements developers made at the time, and have to agreed to make now, exceed $3 million. The township also agreed last year to review the latest development plan under a former zoning ordinance after determining that this plan is "substantially similar" to the original. Per the same motion, commissioners agreed that "with the offsite improvements, the applicant will meet or exceed, with either in-kind or with cash, the amount of the current traffic impact fee ordinance." Fiocco disagrees that Movie Tavern will generate less traffic than Lowe's. He also said that shouldn't matter. The impact fee, Fiocco said in another letter Friday, should not merely reflect the difference in estimated traffic trips of Movie Tavern and of Lowe's because the home improvement store never actually existed. "The lot was not developed and constructed as initially approved [in 2004]," Fiocco said. "In my opinion, no trip credit can be taken for a site that was not physically constructed." Jaindl said Wednesday that Fiocco, not involved in the plan review until this month, has "a ton of misconceptions" and "inaccurate assumptions" that Newton would address.  During an Aug. 11 committee meeting, Jaindl told the township it does not have "a leg to stand on" legally. "If we lose Movie Tavern, I think the township is going to have a much bigger problem," he said. The Board of Commissioners is expected to revisit the final approvals Sept. 15.  awagaman@mcall.com Twitter @andrewwagaman 610-820-6764 FAST FACTS ABOUT MOVIE TAVERN In October, Movie Tavern announced plans for its first Lehigh Valley cinema-eatery at proposed Jaindl Land Co. commercial center on Hamilton Boulevard. The Trexler Business Center calls for up to five new buildings plus existing Bastian Carpet One east of the Wal-Mart Supercenter and West Valley Marketplace. Plan includes strip retail building, casual dining restaurant and quick-service restaurant with a drive-thru. Handful of sycamore trees planted by U.S. Rep. Fred Gernerd in the 1930s will be removed for new driveways. Arborists said deceleration lanes may jeopardize up to eight others. Project has gone before various township boards more than a dozen times this year. One major source of debate: township planning commission's request for common architectural scheme fitting its larger vision for the Hamilton corridor. Planning commission questioned proposed height and lighting of the Movie Tavern but ultimately recommended the Zoning Hearing Board approve 65-foot tower, 15 feet taller than maximum height allowed. Zoning board rejected the 65-foot tower, and Movie Tavern said it would likely walk away from the project because of the time and cost needed to redesign the building. But it ultimately reapplied for a variance for a 60-foot tower, which zoning board approved. If built, the Trexler Business Center will have an access drive from Mill Creek Road past the Wal-Mart. A roundabout was originally planned for the main entrance on Hamilton Boulevard, but PennDOT didn't think it was an appropriate location.

Officers checked the area for the suspect, but did not locate him. Suspicion, Mayfield Road: A Circle K clerk left the store at 8:13 p.m. Aug. 22 telling someone he "could not do it anymore." The store was left unsupervised and officers responded to turn off the pumps and secure the store until an employee arrived. The clerk was found on Stafford Drive and did not seem to make much sense when officers spoke to him. They spoke with the man's grandma and learned he was suffering from a migraine and it was causing him to act oddly. The man, 19, declined medical attention. Suspicion, Ranchland Drive: A woman reported at 2:24 a.m. Aug. 21 she felt like she was just raped and she had a dream she was raped at gunpoint. Responding officers found no cause. Disturbance, Mayfield Road: A man reported at 12:44 a.m. Aug. 21 he was assaulted at Panini's Bar & Grille by a woman that kicked him several times for no reason. Responding officers spoke to the woman, 35, who said she was talking to the man for about 30 minutes until he wrapped his arms around her and thrust his pelvis into her. She told him that was not the way men in this country come on to women and she said she then kicked him in the chest and pushed him away from her. She said he then punched her in the mouth so she took him to the floor and several men took him and threw him outside the bar. The man, 25, denied thrusting into her and was given a ride to his apartment. He was told not to return to the bar. Neither of them wished to pursue charges. Animal bites, Marsol Road: A woman, 54, was bit on her left knee and right inner thigh by her dog Aug. 18 while she was grasping for its leash. She was able to gain control of it and place it inside its cage. She said the puppy was given to her earlier in the year by her son and it has been vicious at times. She was taken to the hospital and the dog was taken to the city kennels to await further action. Cocaine possession, Mayfield Road: Officers responded to the 7 Eleven parking lot Aug. 18 for a report of a suspicious vehicle with the occupants possibly using drugs. They found the vehicle unoccupied but ran a registration check and found the owner, a 37-year-old woman, to be a known heroin user. She emerged from another vehicle, which began to leave the parking lot but was stopped by officers. Inside that vehicle, officers found what turned out to be 2.6 grams of cocaine under a rear bench seat. The backseat passenger said he had no knowledge of the cocaine. The Cleveland man, 20, was arrested for possession of cocaine. The driver, a 21-year-old Mayfield Heights man, was cited for driving under suspension and possession of an alcoholic beverage in a vehicle. Robbery, Mayfield Road: Two male suspects stole seven video game consoles and an undetermined amount of cash in an armed robbery at Game Stop around 9 p.m. Aug. 19. Employees said the suspects pointed a gun and demanded all the money. One of them had an employee take him into a back room and place the consoles, valued at a total of $1,900, into a bag. The suspects left the store from a back door and were not located by responding officers. Theft from building, Mayfield Road: A woman said Aug. 21 she believed her wallet was stolen from Giant Eagle while she was shopping. Her husband returned to the store after she realized she did not have it, but did not locate it and the staff said it was not turned in to them. There was no fraudulent activity on any of the credit cards that were in the wallet. Burglary, Maplewood Road: Officers responded to an apartment at 5:46 a.m. Aug. 22 after a woman saw a resident's door kicked in. They confirmed there was forced entry and found the resident asleep in bed. He was confused as to why they were there. He checked and found two laptop computers and an iPad had been stolen. There were no suspects identified. Burglary, Maplewood Road: A woman reported at 9:34 p.m. Aug. 23 she returned home to find someone had broken into her apartment and stolen a purse, jewelry and a laptop computer. Officers believe the suspect entered the apartment through a bedroom window. They found some contents of her purse on the ground outside the window. A bike was located outside near a gas well and believed to have belonged to the suspect. Harassment, Circle Drive: A woman said Aug. 22 her ex-boyfriend left threatening messages on her phone and she feared for her safety. Officers spoke to the Youngstown man, 30, who denied making threats and said he was upset over their breakup. He said he would stop contacting the woman, who said she would sign charges against him if the threats continued. Theft, Mayfield Road: A man said Aug. 23 he was standing at the bus stop in front of Master Pizza looking at his phone when a male bike rider came by and snatched it from his hands. He said the suspect continued riding towards the highway bridges. The phone was in a wallet case, which contained $50 cash. He said he waited 12 hours to report the incident because he didn't have a phone and didn't know where the police station was. See more Mayfield Heights news at Cleveland.com/hillcrest.

While the company sells misshapen or discolored fruit at discounted prices in some states, the program doesn’t exist in Colorado. According to the food waste reduction organization ReFED, uneaten food emits greenhouse gases and takes up one-fifth of landfill space. Farmers know the ugly fruit won’t sell so unless a company buys it, it’s composted or disposed of. John Forrest Ales, a spokesman for Wal-Mart, wouldn’t say how much unwanted produce is picked out at the company’s distribution center. Ales wouldn’t commit to any plans to include Colorado in the program but he did say Wal-Mart will consider it.

The call went out and the community answered. Empty rooms at the House of Lazarus (HOL) in Mountain are now filled from floor to ceiling with food thanks to the generosity of the community. The second annual Fill-The-Bus event, held on Aug. 26, brought in $872 and 1,787 pounds of food for the HOL food bank. Two buses, donated by Lannin Bus Line and Wubs Transit, were stationed outside Jonsson’s Independent Grocer and the Kemptville Walmart. “Food-wise, we did phenomenal at Walmart,” explained Kim Merkley, manager of client services at HOL. “At the Independent, we got a lot more money.” Volunteers handed out a card with needed items listed as shoppers entered both stores. “Everything that was on our list was on sale,” said Merkley. “People were coming out with cartloads. It was just amazing.” One older couple pushed out an entire cart full of food and removed one bag. Merkley assumed they were donating the bag, but instead they said everything in the cart was for the food bank. Another woman, with three young kids, brought out one of everything on the list for the food bank. “We’ve always had great success in Kemptville; it’s such a giving community,” Merkley noted. Last year’s Fill-The-Bus event brought in $559 and 679 pounds of food, about a third of what was collected this year. “It was a huge success because of the community,” said Merkley. Very rarely did people pass by the volunteers without taking a card or exit the stores without making a donation of some kind. “The whole reception of what we were doing was phenomenal. I couldn’t believe it,” she said. The food bank is now well-stocked with needed back-to-school items for local kids, including juice boxes and granola bars. “The food bank is full again,” said Merkley. Upcoming events for HOL The 30th anniversary supper, in support of the HOL, will be held at the Mountain Township Agricultural Hall on Sept. 14. All funds raised through ticket sales for the dinner, which cost $25 each, will go directly to the HOL thanks to generous sponsorship from the Scotiabank in South Mountain and Leather Works Catering. Tickets are available at Scotiabank and at the HOL. The event will feature live music and a roast beef supper. For more information about upcoming events, or to donate, visit the House of Lazarus at 2245 Simms Street in Mountain or call 613-989-3830. You can also visit the HOL website at www.houseoflazarus.com. Jennifer Westendorp is the reporter for the Kemptville Advance. She studied journalism-print at Algonquin College.

By Maia Zewert, Lincoln County News Posted Aug. 31, 2016, at 11:48 a.m. NEWCASTLE, Maine — After almost 12 years of leasing farm land, the owners of Morning Dew Farm are ready to put down permanent roots with the purchase of a 68-acre property on Route 1 in Damariscotta that was nearly the site of a Wal-Mart. Brendan McQuillen and Brady Hatch, of Newcastle, have launched an online fundraiser to assist in their purchase of the property. Morning Dew Farm is a certified-organic vegetable farm run by the husband-and-wife team. In addition to selling produce at the Damariscotta Farmers Market and offering a community-supported agriculture program, Morning Dew Farm also supplies local food pantries, stores, and restaurants with vegetables, including Rising Tide Community Market, Newcastle Publick House, and the Damariscotta River Grill. All food grown by Morning Dew Farm is eaten within 30 miles of the farm, Hatch said. McQuillen and Hatch got their start in farming 12 years ago, when Hatch’s family leased the couple a quarter-acre of property. The couple realized soon after that they would need to expand their operation in order to meet their goals. “After a few years, we realized that in order to grow the food for the community that we wanted to and that there was a demand for, we would need to find more field space,” Hatch said. Over the years, the couple has leased space on a year-to-year basis from neighbors. McQuillen and Hatch also looked for space outside of Lincoln County, but they were always drawn back to the area. “We do truly feel connected to the Damariscotta community,” McQuillen said. “We both worked at the (Damariscotta) River Grill when we moved here and got to know the people. Now we’re working with the businesses here, and we want to be around and be a part of the development of this community over the next 10, 15, 20 years.” “The community building here has always been part of what motivated us to be farmers in the first place,” Hatch said. The 68-acre property was purchased by Maine Farmland Trust in June 2011 after the land was targeted by Wal-Mart for the development of an 186,800-square-foot supercenter in 2005. A successful effort by the organization Our Town Damariscotta to pass a 35,000-square-foot retail size cap blocked the development. Since purchasing the property in 2011, Maine Farmland Trust has been working with the Damariscotta River Association to place agricultural conservation easements on the property. Once Maine Farmland Trust sells the property, a final easement will be put in place, ensuring that the land will forever remain farmland, Hatch said. In the three years past three years, the size of Morning Dew Farm’s business has nearly doubled, McQuillen said. “It’s really been a blessing to be able to try it out for these three years and see if it is right for us,” Hatch said. “You can look at a soil map and see what’s out there, but you won’t know for sure until you dig into the ground.” Purchasing the property would allow McQuillen and Hatch to invest more in the land and plan for the future, including for crop rotation and soil practices. “Farming is a multi-year endeavor,” McQuillen said. “If we owned it, we can do be a bit more forward thinking about what we want to do.” The 68-acre property does pose some unique challenges. The land, which cannot be subdivided, includes 5 acres that can be used for farming and approximately 15 acres of wetland. The rest of the land is wooded, Hatch said. McQuillen and Hatch hope to raise 25 percent of the $106,000 asking price through the online fundraiser. As of Tuesday, Aug. 23, the online fundraiser has received 87 donations totaling $10,829, 34 percent of the $32,000 goal. The remaining amount of the purchase price will be financed through a grant and a mortgage, Hatch said. McQuillen said the online fundraiser has received donations from a number of the farm’s supporters and some of its former employees. “What’s been really nice with the campaign is to see people from our past coming out and supporting it,” McQuillen said. “There are some people who were 24-year-old kids when they worked for us and now they have a real job and are donating money. It’s nice to hear from these people you crossed paths with in your history.” The couple will host an open house and barbecue to kick off the final 10 days of the online campaign at Morning Dew Farm’s Newcastle location, at 5 Trails End Road, at 5 p.m., Friday, Aug. 26. The open house is free to attend with donations suggested for the food. For more information or to donate, go to https://goo.gl/7uUESx. The campaign will close Sept. 5.

Not only has "Cowboy" rebounded from a disappointing failed bid at the UFC lightweight title by jumping up to welterweight and capturing three straight victories in increasingly impressive fashion, but he also has made several key changes to his training regime down in New Mexico at Jackson-Winkeljohn. And among the most notable of those changes is that Cerrone cut hard sparring out of his life completely. "Sparring is all I did, that's what I used to do. I thought that was getting ready for a fight, would just be f*cking throwing down," Cerrone said Tuesday on the Joe Rogan Experience. "Now I don't spar at all, and all I do is drill, because drilling is the most important thing you can do." After 11 hard years spent in the fight game, Cerrone admitted that worries about brain damage prompted the move. "I feel like the little guy at the Wal-Mart check-in, clicking. Every time you take a hit to your head, he pushes the button," Cerrone said. "How many people go into Wal-Mart before it's full? I don't know. I have no idea. How many more do I got? How many epic f*cking brawls did me and (teammate) Leonard Garcia have in the training room? I don't know. So, like, I'll get in there and move around with Andrei (Arlovski) and move around with all of the heavyweights, but light, MMA sparring. Heavy takedowns and grappling, but real light striking. But the days of putting the big gloves on and throwing down? Hell no." Thus far, the shift in philosophies appears to be working wonders. At 33 years old, Cerrone looks better fighting at welterweight than he ever has before. What started as a change of pace after a tough loss has turned into a referendum on the cons of extreme weight cutting, as Cerrone has notched a trio of impressive finishes over Alex Oliveira, Patrick Cote, and Rick Story at 170 pounds, all while looking faster and sharper than he ever did at lightweight. "I used to walk around (at) 174," Cerrone said. "That was like my deep training camp, and I noticed when I'd start to cut, I'd get down to 168, 170, but I had nothing in the gas tank, man. It was all mental at that point. Like, my body felt real thin and brittle. At 170, I feel good. I got the extra tank, you know? "Another big part of it is, 170-pounders, don't think you can just come take [me down with] body shots anymore, because I got a little more biscuit now." Cerrone pointed to his latest win over Story at UFC 202 as an example of his growth as a fighter. Cerrone said he felt the "worst I've ever felt in my whole life" in the lead-up to the contest, and that he had "the worst headache and was legitimately sick all day" in the hours before his walkout. However, coach Greg Jackson told Cerrone that this is what they trained for, to beat somebody on your worst day, and ultimately that is what happened, as "Cowboy" ended Story's night with one of the most spectacular striking combinations of his UFC career. The win subsequently vaulted Cerrone all the way up to No. 7 on the UFC's media-generated welterweight rankings and set him up for a potentially big fight in his new division. "The whole time I was at 155, you know how I like to fight, so I would call (the UFC), ‘hey, a 170-pounder fell out, I'll take that fight,'" Cerrone said, laughing. "You know what Joe (Silva) and Dana (White) would tell me? ‘Cowboy, you're a 155er. Those guys are f*cking monsters.' So now I'm at 170 and I want to fight at 155 and they say, ‘no, you're f*cking so great at 170, you don't want to go down to 155.' Like, goddamnit, will you guys make up your f*cking mind of what I can do." With his name now ranked in the top-10 of two UFC weight classes, and an acting role on the new Netflix show ‘Godless' in the works, Cerrone appears to be hitting his stride as a fighter and a brand within the sport. He recently re-signed with the UFC on an eight-fight extension that will keep him in the company for the foreseeable future, and although he balked when asked if he was thrilled with the terms of the deal, he teased that he could have an "epic" announcement coming soon for his next fight to take place at UFC 205 against a fan-favorite. "It's not 100-percent yet, but it's going to be f*cking good," Cerrone said. "Hopefully, today we get the double thumbs up."

A Storm Water Solutions case study details how a well-engineered stormwater management system allowed a Walmart Supercenter in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to maximize water storage and minimize the project footprint. This allowed for additional parking and reduced the overall cost. Walmart hired SMC Consulting Engineers P.C. to engineer about 17 acres of watershed, including the building, parking areas, driveways and landscaping. Building a Supercenter on the previously undeveloped site would increase the impervious area of the site and thus increase runoff volume and rate of flow. The development didn’t have space for an above-ground stormwater management system so engineers had to develop an underground system. Additionally, Santa Fe faces sever drought conditions so collecting the runoff water to use for irrigation purposes was a top priority. This would allow Walmart to reduce its potable water use and comply with water rationing restrictions. After reviewing various underground storage systems, engineers chose a modular precast concrete DoubleTrap system, manufactured by StormTrap LLC. The company provided one DoubleTrap system for storm water detention and a second system for rainwater harvesting. Both were tested extensively before commissioning. The rainwater harvesting system is composed of 50, 10-feet DoubleTrap pieces and holds more than 15,000 cubic feet of storm water runoff collected from the roof catchment area. The stored water is later used for irrigation. In addition to maximizing storage and reducing cost, SMC Consulting Engineers found that both systems were easy to install and all walk-through access for future inspection and maintenance, the case study says. Meanwhile, General Motors says its new stormwater capture project at the GM Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly will save the plant nearly $2 million annually. It will also save water: the plant will reuse captured rainwater for manufacturing processes throughout the 4-million-square-foot facility.

Moreover, is it even a phrase? For instance: I went to Walmart yesterday to buy groceries. More particularly, I bought tomatoes and lettuce. word-choice share|improve this question asked Aug 31 '16 at 4:27 user321210 1011 add a comment |  1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 2 down vote 'More particularly' is not an expression used in common English. I would call it ungrammatical. 'More specifically' is a grammatical phrase. 'Particularly' implies that you are being more specific than your previous statement so to say 'more particularly' sounds redundant. As well, the way the word 'specific' is used is often to express different levels or extents of specificity. This isn't generally so for being particular. With 'specific', it is common to indicate how specific you are being. For example, one can be 'very specific,' 'not specific enough,' or even 'too specific.' It is grammatical to ask 'Can you be a bit more specific?' In summary, specificity can be used if you are already being specific, as long as you are as specific or more specific than before. 'Particular' implies that you were not already being specific and that you will be more specific now. It is possible to become more specific in layers (I.e. Mammal, cat, ginger tabby). share|improve this answer edited Aug 31 '16 at 4:40 answered Aug 31 '16 at 4:34 Symbio 616      I certainly grant that it is common" to indicate how specific you are being," but I don't understand how you can more specify something. So my view about "more specific" and "very unique" is that I avoid these phrases even though the rest of the world holds that they are acceptable. – Airymouse Oct 30 '16 at 15:38 add a comment |  Your Answer   draft saved draft discarded Sign up or log in Sign up using Google Sign up using Facebook Sign up using Email and Password Post as a guest Name Email Post as a guest Name Email discard By posting your answer, you agree to the privacy policy and terms of service.

Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Earnings under pressure at yet another retailer. Wal-Mart warned that its moves to improve customer service will bite into its bottom line, prompting the U.S.' largest retailer to cut its earnings forecast for the year. It's increasing worker hours and wages. Also hurting the owner of Walmart and Sam's Club warehouse stores: the stronger dollar, higher-than-expected theft at its stores, and lower margins on its pharmacy business. Its archrival, Target, is existing that business. It wasn't all bad news. Revenue was flat, but more people shopped at its U.S. stores, and lower gas prices helped boost comparable sales for the fourth straight quarter. Telsey Advisory Group senior analyst Joseph Feldman said, "When you look at how the quarter shook out for product categories, they were all positive, positive traffic, and that's all great. I guess investment spending was a little bit heavier than we had anticipated." Wal-Mart's shares, down 16 percent this year, fell further in early trading.

A new partnership evolved from a meeting of CEOs that Wal-Mart held two years ago at its Arkansas headquarters. The topic: how the companies could help support agriculture in the Midwest. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Cargill, General Mills, Wal-Mart and several other giant food, agricultural and environmental groups will announce a partnership on Wednesday to accelerate programs and research to improve soil health and water quality on farms. The idea evolved from a meeting of CEOs that Wal-Mart held two years ago at its Arkansas headquarters. The topic: how the companies could help support agriculture in the Midwest. Among other things, it was clear that companies were increasingly making commitments to customers that their products would come from fields or barns where farming is done sustainably with minimal damage to the environment. “More and more consumers want to know where their food came from and what on-farm practices took place in row-crop ag and animal ag,” said Jill Kolling, senior director of sustainability at Cargill and co-chair of the collaborative. “That’s definitely a trend.” The announcement Wednesday will call for accelerating field-scale research in three states to reduce fertilizer runoff and groundwater pumping for irrigation. The participants also will create case studies so that farmers, crop consultants and ag retailers can learn what conservation measures make economic as well as ecological sense in particular geographic areas. The effort, called the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative, will follow several strategies. One will raise $4 million over the next five years to assist an initiative already underway in Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska. The National Corn Growers Association has enrolled 65 farms already to quantify the economic benefits to soil health from practices such as growing cover crops, tilling fields differently or not at all to minimize soil loss, and using innovative fertilizer management techniques so that fewer nutrients are wasted. The extra financial clout from the collaborative will expand that to 100 farms. The idea is to take knowledge that’s learned on the ground in the three states and use it to “move the needle faster” and expand conservation practices throughout the Midwest, Kolling said. “Scale is what we’re looking for,” she said. “We feel that with very large corporations involved, and with a lot of us having supply chain draw areas in the region and a lot of assets in this area, and conservation groups having a lot of on-the-ground and state level support, that we will be able to scale this uniquely compared to other programs that are out there.” The collaborative also will create a Sustainable Agriculture Resource Center, to be launched in about a year, where farmers can look at case studies of successful conservation measures near them, including economic information about how healthy soil benefits both their bottom line and natural resources. “We’re going to be pushing out information to farmers,” Kolling said. “At the end of the day, some of these conservation practices can help yields.” The center would also be a resource for consumers to learn more about sustainable farming. Many-pronged approach Leaders say the collaborative will initially focus on improving soil health, reducing nitrogen and phosphorus into rivers and streams in the Mississippi River basin, maximizing water conservation to reduce demand on the Ogallala aquifer beneath Nebraska and other states and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Kolling said the collaborative will not set its own goals for environmental improvements, but endorses the science-based goals already established by groups such as the Gulf Hypoxia Task Force. That national group of experts has recommended that the three states reduce nitrogen loading to the Mississippi by 20 percent by 2025, along with similar goals for phosphorus reductions and for other farm states in the basin. Since the 1970s, excessive nutrients have created a dead zone each year where the Mississippi empties into the Gulf of Mexico. This year, the dead area is expected to be about the size of Connecticut. Mark Tercek, president and CEO of the Nature Conservancy, said in a statement that the collaboration “should lead to significantly ramped-up water conservation in the Midwest,” and that it can potentially “accelerate solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face in the region, such as improving water quality across the Midwest and addressing the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.” The conservancy is another founding member of the collaborative. So are Monsanto, PepsiCo, Kellogg Co., the Environmental Defense Fund and the World Wildlife Fund. Different groups, including some at the state level, have set goals of having 50 percent of all Nebraska irrigation units maximizing water conservation by 2025, and having 75 percent of row crop acreage in the three states change tillage and other practices to improve soil health. Many of the goals, Kolling said, can be achieved as more farmers adopt precision agriculture, which involves using sensors and other technology to apply just the right amount of fertilizer at the right time to different parts of fields, for example, or to gauge soil moisture levels more precisely so that irrigators apply adequate but not excessive water. While the collaborative is new, Kolling said, there’s no reason it can’t grow to include additional corporate members, and to involve states such as Minnesota more directly. “The idea is that learnings and activities will be applicable elsewhere and we could conceivably formally expand to additional states once we get going,” she said.   tom.meersman@startribune.com 612-673-7388 StribMeers View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Published Aug 30th, 2016 3:55 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Wal-Mart Stores CEO Doug McMillon recently said the retailer would ramp up its price rollback strategy a quarter or two earlier than planned. In the process, the retailer also abandoned its competitor price matching policy, then used in about 800 stores. And more recently, Walmart U.S. CEO Greg Foran said price reductions will continue. “We spend a lot of time looking at the role of national brands, role of private label and overlay the everyday low price strategy into our rollback strategy,” Foran told reporters during the retailer’s media call on Aug. 18. “Price is not something that happens immediately, it’s a gradual approach.” When asked to explain the rationale behind a price rollback, Foran said if it’s done right the first thing he expects to happen is top line sales decrease. “When the price is lowered on a can of soup, sales go down because of the price investment. We also bet you will tell family and friends and then we will gradually sell more units. We are focusing on what is happening with unit sales,” he added. While the everyday low price is part of Walmart’s DNA, price rollbacks have become necessary in an increasingly discounted market. Analysts attribute this to consumers who became cost-conscious during the Great Recession and though many can afford to pay more, most consumers would rather not. Some analysts argue that price rollbacks are temporary in nature and somewhat redundant from a retailer that claims to have an everyday low price strategy – requiring bottom line pricing from suppliers in the process. Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail, believes price rollbacks work in a discount-minded retail landscape. “Walmart and other retailers have better data these days. As such, they are able to be more strategic about which items are discounted and which items will bounce back to regular price more easily. Walmart has an advantage in that its discounts are ‘branded’ as rollbacks, making it easy for its customers to understand and act upon. Walmart shoppers know that rollbacks are temporary which drives urgency while mitigating any expectations for long-term discounts,” Spieckerman said. DOLLAR GENERAL PRICE MOVES Walmart competitor Dollar General is also known for low prices and recently vowed to reduce prices by an average of 10% on about 450 popular items in 2,200 of its stores. Like Walmart, the price rollback strategy is geared toward competitive markets where the retailer is losing market share to one another and other discounters. Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos told analysts on Aug. 26th the price reductions would focus on consumable categories. He said the aggressive price strategy is aimed at increasing market share by growing item units and store traffic. “We believe that these price reductions are meaningful and recognizable to our consumers. We are committed to further price moves as appropriate over time. We are being strategic as we look to proactively address our pricing actions across our store base. These targeted price investments are in high household penetration, fast turning categories. At the same time, we are investing to communicating these price breaks to our consumers through incremental store signage, ad circulars, digital coupons, email and digital media,” Vasos said. He pledged to monitor the pricing actions and assess the opportunity for ongoing preemptive moves in line with competitive positioning. Dollar General management said its core customers are constantly trying to stretch their budgets as many of its loyal shoppers skew toward the lower income households, according to Nielsen data. Vasos said Dollar General has been testing price reductions for some time in a subset of stores on items that drive additional traffic into stores. He said while low prices are important, the chain must also give consumers value items needed in their households. “What we see by these items, it helps round out that basket with the non-consumables once she gets in the store and we get her to pick up the consumables, that basket rounds up pretty nicely because of our compelling non-consumable offering,” he added. Analysts have asked Dollar General about the low price competitor Walmart and its efforts to reduce prices in lieu of price matching and if the low price wars are worth the trouble. Many of the items on price rollback are lower margin consumables. Vasos said the retail landscape has become aggressive and Dollar General competes with many discounter retailers. He said Dollar General is taking a proactive step and is not following in anyone’s footsteps. He admitted there are risks to taking price reductions, but said his company has the wherewithal to do it. Foran said Walmart’s price rollbacks are designed to help its customers add to their baskets, but there is also the hope that lower prices might attract new customers to the retail chain. He said it takes time for price reductions to gain traction with customers.

Brian Scott and the No. 44 Twisted Tea team will have a special fan photo riding along on the car at this weekend’s Bojangles’ Southern 500, thanks to a promotion with Twisted Tea. Through the “Get Your Face in the Race” promotion from Twisted Tea, fans sent in photos to be featured on the quarter panels of the No. 44 Twisted Tea Ford. Paige from Lewiston, New York was chosen out of the many submissions and will have her photo featured on the yellow and blue No. 44 Twisted Tea Ford Fusion this weekend at Darlington Raceway. She will also be able to see her face in the race this weekend and meet Scott as she attends the Southern 500 with three of her closest friends. Scott will also be making his Sprint Cup Series debut at Darlington Raceway this weekend. Scott has seven starts in the XFINITY Series, recording one Top-10 and four Top-15 finishes at the 1.5-mile oval. The No. 44 Twisted Tea Ford will hit the track for first practice on Friday, September 2 at 1:30 p.m. ET. Fans can meet Scott at the Walmart in Florence on Saturday, September 3 prior to qualifying for Sunday’s Bojangles’ Southern 500. Scott will be available for photos and autographs with fans. Where: Walmart, 251 South Main Street, Darlington, SC 29532 When: Saturday, September 2 from 11:00 – 11:30 a.m. Fans can also see Scott on Sunday prior to the race on Sunday at the Ford Display in the Fan Area. Scott will be partaking in a question and answer session at the Ford Display. Where: Ford Display, Darlington Raceway When: Sunday, September 3 from 2:40 – 2:55 p.m. “I’m really looking forward to getting to Darlington this weekend. We’ve been starting to find a groove in our cars the last couple of weekends, and while Darlington is a really tough track to handle, I’m definitely ready to get out there and see the type of speed we can find. We’ve been decent on the intermediate tracks so far this year, but Darlington is so unique not only in the history of the track, but in the shape and speeds you can reach there. We’ve also got a fun promotion in which we have Paige’s photo on the car through the ‘Get Your Face in the Race’ contest, so it’ll be really cool to meet her and have her ride along with us, so to speak, for 500 miles on Sunday night.” No. 44 Twisted Tea Ford Fusion Famer Richard Petty and successful business entrepreneur Andrew Murstein, is one of the most recognized brands in all of motorsports. With a history of over 200 wins and business partnerships with national and global leaders, today the race operation fields two teams in competition in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with drivers Aric Almirola and Brian Scott. Almirola will return to the iconic No. 43 Ford with partners Smithfield Foods, STP, United States Air Force and the “Fresh From Florida” campaign. Scott will make his debut with the team and drive the Petty Family No. 44 Ford. Albertsons Companies, Shore Lodge, Twisted Tea and GoBowling.com will join Scott as he competes for Rookie of the Year in his first full-time season in the Sprint Cup Series.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Aug 30th 2016 3:27PM The worst Walmarts are located in low-income, minority communities. That's according to a study published in May by Contexts, a quarterly publication of the American Sociological Association. A Walmart store's location is closely related to how good or bad the store's customer service is, the study found. SEE ALSO: Trio allegedly killed man, drove around with his body The study, which was recently highlighted by The Atlantic's City Lab, evaluated customer service by analyzing the Yelp reviews of Walmart 2,840 locations across the US. Stores in areas that have lower average incomes have significantly worse customer reviews than locations in higher-income zip codes. Additionally, locations in areas with higher proportions of Black or Latino residents have worse reviews than those in areas with more white residents. The study's author Adam Reich, an assistant professor of sociology at Columbia University, analyzed approximately 35,000 reviews of Walmart locations and found that there was a consistent correlation between both race and class and a location's Yelp reviews. Reich blames the disparity on Walmart's decision to under-staff stores in certain areas.

Any food with a long or short shelf life According to Michael Catania, consumer savings expert and co-founder of PromotionCode.org, you'll want to stay away from Walmart foods that have longer and shorter shelf lives. Foods with shorter shelf lives tend to cost more, and foods with longer shelf lives might turn stale before consumption. "Once the cereal goes stale and you throw it away, you've also thrown away the initial savings," said Catania. But, that doesn't mean you have to avoid all of Walmart's canned and packaged foods. Catania recommends buying small and medium-sized foods at Walmart — they "will net you the best result for both cost and freshness," he said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 2. Snacks Store-brand snacks at Walmart are cheaper than at some of its retailer competitors. But Walmart just can't beat the low cost of dollar store food. Stock up on crackers, chips, cookies and other goods for only a buck at discount stores — just make sure you check the expiration dates. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 3. Organic Fruits and Vegetables Although Walmart has upped its selection of organic foods to accommodate the health-conscious subsection of its shoppers, you're usually better off buying organic foods from stores with organic roots, like Trader Joe's or Whole Foods. "Shopping at stores with organic roots makes sense when these are the items you are purchasing," said Kerry Sherin, a savings expert from Offers.com. According to Sherin, these stores tend to have better selections and lower prices on organic foods. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 4. Fresh Produce When shopping for fresh produce, you're most likely better off shopping at your go-to grocery store than at Walmart. Even you're not happy with your grocery store's offerings, try Sprouts. "I often find Sprouts has better deals on fresh produce compared to Walmart," said Kendal Perez, a savings expert with coupon and deals site CouponSherpa.com. "For example, Sprouts recently had avocados on sale for 88 cents each, compared to $1.88 each from Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 5. Brand-Name Diapers Most retailers can't beat the price of Walmart's store-brand diapers. However, if you prefer brand names, like Pampers, you'll be better off buying from Amazon where diapers tend to be just a tad bit cheaper. Plus, if you join Amazon Family, you could get 20 percent off qualifying diaper purchases. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 6. Batteries As far as batteries go, experts tend to agree you're better off buying them at warehouse stores rather than Walmart. "Batteries are always a better buy in bulk, with Costco and Sam's Club offering more batteries for less per unit," said Perez. Sherin from Offers.com agrees. "If you want to get the best deal on batteries, buy them from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club, which will have the best rate on the largest pack of batteries." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 7. Straight Talk Wireless Straight Talk Wireless aims "to get people on America's best networks without the expense — or the commitment that comes with contracts," according to its website. However, many people report Straight Talk Wireless has poor coverage and bad customer service. "The absolute worst item to buy at Walmart is their Straight Talk Wireless service," said Benjamin K. Glaser, features editor of online deals site, DealNews.com. "Every time we write about it on DealNews, our readers flood the comments with tales of terrible customer service driving them back to their old carriers. Many also received poor coverage, but even those who were happy with their phones and connections were driven away by the customer service." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 8. Music Unless you're looking for vinyl records, skip Walmart's CDs and stick to online streaming services for your music needs. Spotify Premium only costs $9.99 a month, as does Apple Music. Even Jay Z's new streaming service, Tidal, is affordable at $9.99 or $19.99 a month. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 9. Gift Bags and Wrapping Paper Don't head to Walmart for wrapping paper or gift bags — you'll find cheaper prices (and a wider selection) elsewhere. "Walmart strives on its convenience of being able to offer up everyday items at low prices," said Sherin. "But when it comes to gift wrap and gift bags, you can find the real savings at dollar stores." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty Remember: If you save money on wrapping paper, that's more money you have available to spend on gifts. 10. Gift Cards Yes, you can find a generous selection of gift cards in Walmart's checkout lines, whether you're looking for retail or restaurant certificates. Buy why buy full-price gift cards at Walmart when you can buy discounted gift cards online? "Walmart is a great stop for gifts and last-minute items," said Sherin. "However, if you have the time to plan ahead on your purchase of a gift card, look at sites like Raise and Cardpool, which offer discounted gift cards. You can find savings of 20 percent to 30 percent off what you would pay for face value at Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 11. PC Laptops Walmart sells laptops, but you'll find better, high-quality laptops somewhere. "Walmart has low prices on electronics like laptops and TVs, but the brands are also lower quality," said Perez of CouponSherpa.com. You can also find better laptop deals by doing a little comparison shopping. Glaser of DealNews.com revealed that Walmart has not had any notable laptop deals in a while. "Walmart has not had an Editors Choice laptop deal in the last two months," he said. Instead, you're likely to find better prices on laptops from Lenovo, Dell, Microsoft, eBay and Newegg. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 12. Televisions "While it can be hard to resist paying $150 for a 40-inch TV, sometimes if a deal is too good to be true, it probably is," explained Sherin. "If you are really wanting to invest in a quality TV, stick with retailers like Best Buy whose specialty is electronics." Glaser adds that you can even find better deals on high-end TVs at other competitors. "For the higher quality TVs, Dell Home and eBay consistently offer better deals," he said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 13. Books Online retailers give Walmart a run for its money in the books and music department. "When it comes to entertainment — be it books, music or TV shows — you're typically better off shopping Amazon," reports MarketWatch. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 14. Printer Ink Running out of printer ink is annoying. Not only does it happen at the worst time, but ink cartridge packages can cost as much as $60 at Walmart. However, you can usually find cheaper printer ink online. "Unless a store is doing a ridiculous sale, printer ink is always less expensive online," said Paul Moyer of SavingFreak.com. "You can purchase re-manufactured cartridges for as much as 50 percent off the price you would pay in Walmart." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 15. Jewelry With discounted jewelry at Walmart, you get what you pay for — low-quality pieces. "If you are buying jewelry at what would be deemed a discount store, don't expect to get the best quality items," said Sherin. Instead, she advised you try shopping at Macy's or Kay's, "who have experts that can walk you through the process of picking out a quality piece of jewelry." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 16. Wood Furniture Walmart is famous for the incredibly low prices on furniture — particularly bookshelves and television consoles. And although Walmart's furniture is great for college students or those who have a small budget, it's always best to invest in higher-quality furniture that will last longer — even if it will cost you extra, said Sherin. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 17. Bedding Walmart's bedding selection isn't always the highest quality, and you can often do better elsewhere. If you prefer quality over price, wait for sales and buy bedding from similar stores. "You can find similar pricing for much higher quality at a discount retailer like HomeGoods or Marshalls," said Andrea Woroch, a consumer and money-saving expert. "Otherwise, shop sales at department stores like Macy's and JCPenney, and look for coupons via CouponSherpa.com to find applicable deals to get high-quality bedding for less." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 18. Pet Food Before buying pet food at Walmart, compare the cost of buying in bulk from Amazon or a wholesale club. I compared Walmart prices with Sam's Club and found that the latter offered a generally better deal when purchasing in bulk. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 19. Small Kitchen Appliances Amazon and Walmart offer similar prices on some of their household appliances — but not on everything. A good rule of thumb is to buy smaller items in bulk online, and price compare anything bigger before buying it at Walmart. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 20. Large Kitchen Appliances If your dishwasher or fridge breaks down, fight the urge to run to Walmart. You might find a better deal at competing retailers. "If you are needing to replace that pesky dishwasher or looking for a new refrigerator, Walmart may not be the place to find the sweetest deal," said Sherin. "We see stores like Sears and Best Buy excel in the appliance department, often offering free installation, home delivery and removal of the old appliance." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 21. Kitchenware It doesn't matter if you're buying glasses, mugs or dinnerware — I've found that Walmart's prices can't beat the dollar stores when it comes to kitchenware. Try browsing Dollar General's selection — you'll get more items for your money. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 22. Tires Need new tires? Skip Walmart, and get your next set of wheels from Sam's Club or Costco. Costco, for example, even offers free tire balancing and rotations. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 23. Greeting Cards Rather than spend $2 or $3 per greeting card at Walmart, check out the selection of cards at Dollar General or the Family Dollar. I found cards for every occasion at Dollar General starting at $1. Woroch and Perez had the same experience. "The best deal for greeting cards and gift wrap is at the dollar store; you can't beat their prices," said Woroch. "While Walmart sells a few cards for 99 cents, most of their greeting cards are $3 to $5," added Perez. "I can buy two-for-$1 greeting cards from Dollar Tree, plus pay just $1 for gift wrap, bags, tissue, bows and more." Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 24. Outdoor Items You'll find ample garden supplies, lawn care equipment and patio furniture at Walmart, and the prices aren't bad, either. Unfortunately, in my experience, the quality isn't great. You might get more use out of outdoor equipment purchased from Home Depot or Lowe's, which both have a better selection and higher-quality merchandise. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 25. Hair Supplies It doesn't make sense to spend several bucks for single hair accessories at Walmart. You can get many of the same items for $1 at dollar stores. I've found that Walmart prices tend to be higher for hair bows, headbands, combs and other hair supplies. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 26. Disposable Utensils A plastic kitchen utensil set at Walmart could run you between $10 and $15 for six or nine pieces, whereas I found individual pieces at Dollar Tree for as low as $1. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 27. Office and School Supplies Walmart's back-to-school deals might be cheaper than the deals advertised by other retailers, but if you're shopping for office or school supplies during other times of the year, I've found Walmart to be far more expensive than discount stores like the Dollar Tree. There, you'll find better deals on crayons, pens, markers, tape, glue, packing supplies and storage. Woroch recommends checking other stores' sales before heading to Walmart. "During back-to-school season, office suppliers like Office Depot and Staples run lots of sales where you can find penny deals on essentials like folders, notebooks and pencils," she said. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 28. Party Supplies Walmart has an entire aisle dedicated to party supplies, but these items are more expensive than other discount retailers. According to my research, you can stock up on party supplies at the Dollar Tree for far less. Purchase invitations, balloons, party favors and decorations — all for just a buck each. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 29. Cleaning Supplies From laundry detergent to disinfecting wipes, Walmart's cleaning supplies are more expensive than the Family Dollar and Dollar General. You'll typically save between 30 cents and 50 cents by shopping at these discount retailers instead. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty 30. Personal Hygiene Products If you don't mind buying generic lotion, toothpaste or deodorant, stock up on personal hygiene products at the Dollar Tree. Walmart does have a huge selection of personal hygiene products, and in many cases it offers better deals than its big-box competitors. Still, Walmart's generic brands can't match dollar store prices. Via GOBankingRates Photo: Getty Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This HIDE CAPTION of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION In the early 2000s, Walmart implemented cost-cutting policies that reduced the number of necessary employees per store and resulted in a drop in store quality. This study provides evidence that a decrease in store quality was not consistent across the board, but instead impacted some customers more than others. "Walmart is the largest retailer and largest employer in the world; moreover, it has consciously branded itself as a champion of and boon for disadvantaged communities," writes Reich. "Its underinvestment in these communities is thus particularly notable." Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The study may have a few holes. The reliance on Yelp means that researchers can't examine reviewers' biases and outside influences. For example, a store's location in a lower-income or more predominantly Black or Latino neighborhood may impact how its quality is perceived by some reviewers, regardless of the store's customer service. However, this isn't the first time that Walmart's apparent understaffing has been called into question. Reports of Walmart saving money by cutting staff have also gotten the retailer in hot water with police. Earlier in August, Bloomberg reported that more than 200 violent crimes had been committed so far this year at Walmart locations across the US. SEE ALSO: Report: SWAT team called to Chris Brown's home Bloomberg argued that the rise in crime is a result of corporate policies. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. "In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement across the country, as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer's and associate's expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience," a Walmart representative said in an email to Business Insider earlier in August. While Walmart's cost-cutting policies have had negative — and, at times, dangerous — outcomes for customers, they have also driven profits: Bloomberg found that sales per employee in the US grew 23% in the last decade to $236,804. Currently, Reich states that the retailer can turn a profit despite providing poor customer service because Walmart's super low prices have helped put local competition out of business. As a result, Walmart becomes some customers' only option — no matter how poor the shopping experience is. However, Reich argues that the retailer may suffer in the long term if it doesn't make some major changes. A poor shopping experience could be increasingly damaging for the brand as online shopping grows and competitors increasingly invest in providing quality in-store experiences. "For Walmart and other retailers, providing a pleasant customer service experience seems likely to be increasingly important to corporate profitability," writes Reich. "For its own sake, then, Walmart should hire more employees, particularly at stores in low-income communities of color, and give all Walmart employees more reasons to smile through better wages and working conditions."

He was wearing a two-tone baseball style cap with a logo on the front and a dark colored T-shirt.  The man was seen leaving in a silver/gray Toyota with a sunroof, spoiler and gold rims.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) An international trade deal being negotiated in secret is a “turbo-charged privatisation pact” that poses a threat to democratic sovereignty and “the very concept of public services”, campaigners have warned. But this is not TTIP – the international agreement it appears campaigners in the European Union have managed to scupper over similar concerns – this is TISA, a deal backed by some of the world’s biggest corporations, such as Microsoft, Google, IBM, Walt Disney, Walmart, Citigroup and JP Morgan Chase. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments Few people may have heard of the Trade In Services Agreement, but campaign group Global Justice Now warns in a new report: “Defeating TTIP may amount to a pyrrhic victory if we allow TISA to pass without challenge.” Like the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TISA is being negotiated in secret even though it could have a major impact on countries which sign up. While TTIP is only between the EU and US, those behind TISA have global ambitions as it involves most of the world’s major economies – with the notable exceptions of China and Russia – in a group they call the “Really Good Friends of Services”. The Department for International Trade dismissed the idea that public services were at risk from TISA, adding that the UK was committed to securing an "ambitious" deal. But according to Global Justice Now’s report, the deal could “lock in privatisation of public services”; allow “casino capitalism” by undermining financial regulations designed to prevent a recurrence of the 2008 recession; threaten online privacy; damage efforts to fight climate change; and prevent developing countries from improving public services. Nick Dearden, director of group, said: “This deal is a threat to the very concept of public services. It is a turbo-charged privatisation pact, based on the idea that, rather than serving the public interest, governments must step out of the way and allow corporations to ‘get on with it’. Read more TTIP negotiations should stop, French government says   “Of particular concern, we fear TISA will include clauses that will prevent governments taking public control of strategic services, and inhibit regulation of the very banks that created the financial crash.” He suggested pro-Brexit voters should be concerned at the potential loss of sovereignty. “Many people were persuaded to leave the EU on the grounds they would be ‘taking back control’ of our economic policy,” Mr Dearden said. “But if we sign up to TISA, our ability to control our economy – to regulate, to protect public services, to fight climate change – is massively reduced. In effect, we would be handing large swathes of policy making to big business. “ The report says the widespread opposition to TTIP, a deal between only the EU and US, had not yet been repeated over TISA. “It is vital for elected representatives, campaigners and ordinary citizens to unite against this threat,” it adds. “TISA threatens public services. From postal services to the NHS, TISA could lock in privatisation and ensure that big multinationals increasingly call the shots on areas like health, education and basic utilities.” A so-called “ratchet” clause in the deal means that after a service – like trains or water or energy – is privatised, this is almost impossible to reverse even if it fails. According to the report, a “standstill” clause also means “no new regulation can be passed that gives foreign companies worse treatment” than when TISA is passed. “Taken together, the standstill and ratchet clauses could make it much harder for a future government to renationalise the railways, a move backed by a majority of the British public,” it says. “Similarly, it could mean that the creeping privatisation of the NHS becomes more and more irreversible with greater involvement of companies from countries like the USA. And forget taking control of the electricity system back from the big six energy firms.” Migrant workers could be classified as “independent service suppliers”, the report says, meaning they would not be eligible for the minimum wage or be allowed to join a union. People going to another country may find their visa is tied to their job, so if they were sacked, they would be deported. “This sort of system of modern indentured labour is wide open to abuse by unscrupulous employers who may get away with illegal practices safe in the knowledge that they can threaten any employee with deportation if they complain," the report says. “This sort of system is used in countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar and has resulted in working conditions that have been described as being close to slavery.” The global economic crash of 2008 was precipitated by the sale of complex financial products linked to unsafe "sub-prime" mortgages. The report says there was a danger the final TISA deal would “undermine efforts to regulate risky financial products” with a proposal that firms should be allowed to offer “any new financial service”. “The danger is that TISA will deter governments from limiting the use of such ‘innovative’ financial products and leave us powerless to stop the next financial crisis,” it says. TISA could also potentially prevent governments from favouring renewable energy over fossil fuels – despite the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the health effects of air pollution. Private firms would also be allowed to move online data from one country to another under one proposal being considered. While the original country’s privacy laws would have to be respected, the report said it was “not clear how this will be … enforced”. While developed countries in Europe have established public services that would not be threatened unless a state’s government decided to open them up to private firms, the same is not true of many developing countries. If they signed up to the deal, it could effectively prevent them from setting up public institutions taken for granted in the West. The TISA negotiations were held behind closed doors for about 18 months until they were publicly revealed by the global trade union group Public Services International (PSI). Information about some of the proposals has been also disclosed through Wikileaks and similar sites. Daniel Bertossa, PSI’s director of policy, said: “Anybody who’s interested in maintaining democratic control of national institutions should be very concerned about the Trade in Services Agreement that is being negotiated in secret. “It will remove large sections of national sovereignty and the ability of any government, including the UK Government, to regulate important service sectors [on issues] such as energy, such as transport, such as privacy. “The Trade in Services Agreement is part of a radical project to limit governments’ sovereign right to regulate and freeze it almost in permanence in the interests of foreign corporations.” According to the European Commission, TISA is about "facilitating trade in services". "The EU is the world's largest exporter of services with tens of millions of jobs throughout Europe in the services sector.  Opening up markets for services will mean more growth and jobs," its website says. The Independent has contacted “Team TISA”, a group of mainly American companies in favour of the deal, asking for a comment. On its website, it says: “Services are the fastest growing sector of the global economy and account for two-thirds of global output, one-third of global employment and nearly 20 per cent of global trade. “The TISA provides an opportunity to expand services trade among over 50 countries, covering nearly 70 per cent of global trade in services. “The potential expansion TISA provides will benefit not only global growth, but also US domestic growth. “As the world’s largest services exporter, with over $1.3 trillion (about £1 trillion) in annual cross-border and foreign-affiliate sales, the United States will benefit tremendously from elimination of services barriers.” A Department for International Trade spokesperson said: “Public services are under no threat whatsoever from this deal or any other trade agreement. The UK remains committed to an ambitious Trade in Services Agreement.” Independent Independent News Service Related Content TTIP negotiations should stop, French government says EU-US trade deal will not happen this year, says Francois Hollande EU-US trade deal talks have stalled, says German economy minister UK biggest investor in US, underscoring 'economic special relationship' - report TTIP: People in Republic of Ireland want referendum on trade deals TTIP: European Commission attempts to resurrect deal as countries go cold on plan TTIP far from over despite massive Greenpeace document leak, European Commission says TTIP talks are 'likely to stop', say officials, as François Hollande signals France will reject deal TTIP leak could spell the end of controversial trade deal, say campaigners TTIP: UK Parliament 'would not be able to stop NHS sell-off if treaty is passed' TTIP: UK Government found secret courts in trade deal have 'lots of risk and no benefit' in its only assessment TTIP: More than 130,000 people urge Barack Obama to kill controversial trade deal during UK visit TTIP: Big business and US to have major say in EU trade deals, leak reveals Beef industry will suffer significantly if TTIP deal between EU and US goes ahead: Michelle O'Neill TTIP could block governments from cracking down on tax avoidance, study warns Exclude NHS from TTIP appeal signed by Peter Robinson, Martin McGuinness, Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage, Nicola Sturgeon and Natalie Bennett Cut NHS from TTIP trade deal say doctors What is TTIP?

And forget taking control of the electricity system back from the big six energy firms.” The 6 reasons why we should be scared of TTIP 6 show all The 6 reasons why we should be scared of TTIP 1/6 The NHS Public services, especially the NHS, are in the firing line. One of the main aims of TTIP is to open up Europe’s public health, education and water services to US companies. This could essentially mean the privatisation of the NHS. The European Commission has claimed that public services will be kept out of TTIP. However, according to the Huffington Post, the UK Trade Minister Lord Livingston has admitted that talks about the NHS were still on the table Getty 2/6 Food and environmental safety TTIP’s ‘regulatory convergence’ agenda will seek to bring EU standards on food safety and the environment closer to those of the US. But US regulations are much less strict, with 70 per cent of all processed foods sold in US supermarkets now containing genetically modified ingredients. By contrast, the EU allows virtually no GM foods. The US also has far laxer restrictions on the use of pesticides. It also uses growth hormones in its beef which are restricted in Europe due to links to cancer. US farmers have tried to have these restrictions lifted repeatedly in the past through the World Trade Organisation and it is likely that they will use TTIP to do so again Getty 3/6 Banking regulations TTIP cuts both ways. The UK, under the influence of the all-powerful City of London, is thought to be seeking a loosening of US banking regulations. America’s financial rules are tougher than ours. They were put into place after the financial crisis to directly curb the powers of bankers and avoid a similar crisis happening again. TTIP, it is feared, will remove those restrictions, effectively handing all those powers back to the bankers Getty/Bloomberg 4/6 Privacy Remember ACTA (the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement)? It was thrown out by a massive majority in the European Parliament in 2012 after a huge public backlash against what was rightly seen as an attack on individual privacy where internet service providers would be required to monitor people’s online activity. Well, it’s feared that TTIP could be bringing back ACTA’s central elements, proving that if the democratic approach doesn’t work, there’s always the back door. An easing of data privacy laws and a restriction of public access to pharmaceutical companies’ clinical trials are also thought to be on the cards AFP/Getty Images 5/6 Jobs The EU has admitted that TTIP will probably cause unemployment as jobs switch to the US, where labour standards and trade union rights are lower. It has even advised EU members to draw on European support funds to compensate for the expected unemployment. Examples from other similar bi-lateral trade agreements around the world support the case for job losses. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the US, Canada and Mexico caused the loss of one million US jobs over 12 years, instead of the hundreds of thousands of extra that were promised Dave Thompson/Getty Images 6/6 Democracy TTIP’s biggest threat to society is its inherent assault on democracy. One of the main aims of TTIP is the introduction of Investor-State Dispute Settlements (ISDS), which allow companies to sue governments if those governments’ policies cause a loss of profits. In effect it means unelected transnational corporations can dictate the policies of democratically elected governments AFP/Getty Migrant workers could be classified as “independent service suppliers”, the report says, meaning they would not be eligible for the minimum wage or be allowed to join a union. People going to another country may find their visa is tied to their job, so if they were sacked, they would be deported. “This sort of system of modern indentured labour is wide open to abuse by unscrupulous employers who may get away with illegal practices safe in the knowledge that they can threaten any employee with deportation if they complain," the report says. “This sort of system is used in countries like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar and has resulted in working conditions that have been described as being close to slavery.” The global economic crash of 2008 was precipitated by the sale of complex financial products linked to unsafe "sub-prime" mortgages. The report says there is a danger the final TISA deal would “undermine efforts to regulate risky financial products” with a proposal that firms should be allowed to offer “any new financial service”. “The danger is that TISA will deter governments from limiting the use of such ‘innovative’ financial products and leave us powerless to stop the next financial crisis,” it says.

Private firms would also be allowed to move online data from one country to another under one proposal being considered.

Large companies like Walmart have pumped thousands of dollars into an initiative called Keep Dollars In Crawford County and canvassers have spent months securing signatures from voters in hopes of having enough to put the issue before voters in November. The initiative would let voters decide if alcohol sales should be allowed within the county. There are opposing groups that have put up signs asking voters to not allow the issue to make the ballot. According to the Crawford County clerk, more than 90,000 signatures were turned in earlier this month to be counted.  A little more than 9,000 were verified to be usable in the count and approximately 3,000 verified signatures are still needed for the initiative to make the ballot. The clerk's office will have until 5 p.m. tomorrow (Aug. 30) to decide whether enough signatures were collected. "Whatever is certified to us at that point in time will go on the ballot. If we do not have the certification from the county clerk at that time then it will not go on the ballot," said Crawford County Election Commissioner Bill Coleman. Sources said the clerk's office could see a potential lawsuit filed against it alleging some collected signatures should be counted. The clerk said some signatures were not counted because the person or persons collecting the signatures weren't certified to do so by state law. In Johnson County, the clerk there is being sued by the group Stand Strong, Stay Dry, Be Safe. The lawsuit alleges the clerk did not certify paperwork according to state law and some canvassers were also not verified correctly. According to Johnson County clerk's office personnel, whether or not the issue will make the November ballot will be decided by a circuit court judge Wednesday.

Vogue Fashion Beauty Culture Living Runway Pre-Fall 2017 Spring 2017 Ready-to-Wear Spring 2017 Menswear Resort 2017 Fall 2016 Couture Videos SUBSCRIBE 6 issues for $6 Give A Gift Renew International Most Shared 1 An American Expatriate on Why She’s Not Leaving Istanbul 2 The Trailer for the Carrie Fisher–Debbie Reynolds Documentary Will Break Your Heart 3 Step Aside Florence and Rome—Head to Bologna for the Ultimate Italian Foodie Tour Fashion An Ode to Cheap Jeans August 30, 2016 10:50 am by Liana Satenstein email Expand Paloma Elsesser Photo: Courtesy of Paloma Elsesser / @palomija In a mysterious turn of events last week mostly due to suburban boredom, I ended up returning to what once had been my high school hangout, a haven for slacker-stoners and soccer moms; what they call a “big-box retailer,” in the vein of Target, Kmart and Walmart. When I’m there, I always end up with things I don’t need, like three packs of cotton candy–flavor lip gloss, or a family-size bag of Doritos. But what I realized on my most recent sojourn was that the only thing that I’ve never shopped for there was the one thing I actually did happen to need: denim. I ventured into the men’s section of denim offerings (the straight silhouette works better for my silhouette in general), and saw a glimmer of a wide-leg pair of dark-wash jeans that were not, actually, all that different than the Céline numbers that my friend who I was with was wearing. And that wasn’t all: There were heaps and heaps of clean-cut workwear-type pieces. In 15 minutes, I had scooped up an armful of jeans, tried them on in less than 10 minutes (the fitting stalls were fantastically empty), and managed to walk out with four pairs for less than $100. This is not the norm, in the fashion world. Denim, once a workwear staple, has in recent years become a luxury item. A standard pair of skinny jeans from AG or J Brand waver around $150 to $250, while a pair of those artfully torn restyled vintage “Ass Rip” jeans from Re/Done are roughly $280. The epic Vetements jeans cost a whopping $1,450. Sure, America runs on denim—but it’s also become incredibly unaffordable.   Expand Vetements Spring 2017 Ready-to-Wear Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv And yet my return to my runway-observing office in my bulk-copped denim was entirely positive: Those high-waisted dark-wash wide-leg pants were confused with a designer label, while my light-wash 30×30 Wranglers were mistaken for tailored vintage. The throwback ’90s camouflage pair and their stonewashed brown duck version (both courtesy of Dickies), received a slew of “where did you get those” type of questions. It was refreshing, especially knowing I had snagged everything for a bargain. Kelly Connor, Vogue.com Market Editor (and a bonafide denimhead), has a soft spot for sturdy big-box jeans. Her obsession started last year when she ventured into a Walmart in North Dakota. “They have amazing normcore streetwear-type stuff. The most classic paired-down original styles,” says Connor, who also recommends buying from the men’s section (“they fit better”). These are places beyond trends. “It’s the stuff I always want, but brands are always pushing newer styles in NYC. It’s all basics at its core.” Labels are catching wind of the popularity of standard workwear denim, too. Carhartt’s younger, stylish sibling, the label Carhartt WIP (Work in Progress), which has existed for a number of years mostly in Europe, opened a New York City-based store in 2011. It’s the streetwear-based, chicly nipped and tailored version of the construction worker–, hunter-appealing Carhartt. In fact, Vetements churned out haute Carhartt WIP as part of its nearly 20-label collaborations for the Spring 2017 show. Pieces came in that synonymous rustic tan hue, including a massive halter–smock dress and a pair of hip bone–hanging slouchy pants. It’s a far cry from the original big-box retailer look, sure—and will most likely cost 10 times more than a single pair of jeans from a Walmart or Target by the time they hit the market. For now? Those on-sale Wranglers look just as good—sans the dent in the bank account.   Subscribe now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe In This Story: Denim Share Tweet Add a Comment Tweet Subscribe Now6 Issues for $6 Subscribe Recommended For You __title__ __category__ __title__ __category__ Vogue Fashion Runway Beauty Culture Living Magazine City Guides Videos Subscribe VOGUE VIP Vogue App Vogue Shop Promotions Vogue Archive Vogue Podcast Log In | Register Log Out Facebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest Instagram Sign up for Newsletter Contact Press Subscriptions Digital Editions Vogue Worldwide UK India Italy Mexico Australia Germany Korea Spain Taiwan Russia France Brazil Japan Portugal Ukraine Turkey China Reprints/Permissions Media Kits Careers Condé Nast Digital Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Backchannel Bon Appétit Brides.com Condé Nast Traveler Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ GQ Style Pitchfork Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker The Scene Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Magazine Customer Service Sitemap © 2017 Condé Nast.

(Daniel Antunes/Flickr/Creative Commons) What would happen if some sort of major national emergency caused a massive transportation disruption that stopped trucks from running? The next time you talk to a trucker, please thank them for their service, because without their hard work none of our lives would be possible. In America today, very few of us live a truly independent lifestyle, and that means that we rely on the system to provide what we need. Most of us take for granted that there will always be plenty of goods at Wal-Mart and at the grocery store whenever we need more "stuff," and most of us never give a second thought to how all of that "stuff" gets there. Well, the truth is that most of it is brought in by trucks, and if the trucks stopped running for some reason the entire country would devolve into chaos very rapidly. I came across a quote from Alice Friedemann that detailed what we would be facing during a major national transportation disruption very nicely: Within a week, in roughly this order, grocery stores would be out of dairy and other items that are delivered many times a day. And by the week, the shelves would be empty. Hospitals, pharmacies, factories, and many other businesses also get several deliveries a day, and they'd be running out of stuff the first day. And the second day, there's be panic and hoarding. And restaurants, pharmacies would close. ATM's would be out of money. Construction would stop. There'd be increasing layoffs. Increasing enormous amounts of trash not getting picked up, 685,000 tons a day. Service stations would be closed. Very few people would be working. And the livestock would start to be hungry from lack of feed deliveries. Then within two weeks, clean water supplies would run out. Within four weeks to eight weeks, there wouldn't be coal delivered to power plants and electricity would start shutting down. And when that happened, about a quarter of our pipelines use electricity, and so natural gas plants wouldn't be fed natural gas and they'd start shutting down. There is so much infrastructure that we take for granted that would suddenly become very vulnerable in this type of scenario. There are countless numbers of workers out there that never get any glory that do the hard work of maintaining our nuclear power plants, our natural gas pipelines, our electrical grid, etc. If they suddenly were not able to do their jobs, the consequences would be absolutely catastrophic. The following comes from Tess Pennington: They rarely mention the dozens of nuclear power plants that litter the United States. If no one is there to operate them, how long before they melt down and bury millions of survivors under a radioactive cloud? Then there are the 12,000 facilities around the country that store large quantities of toxic or flammable chemicals, and reside close to residential areas. 2,500 of these sites contain chemicals in quantities that, if a catastrophic accident were to occur, could affect 10,000 to 1 million people each. And let's not forget the 2.5 million miles of oil and gas pipelines that can be found in every state. They suffer hundreds of leaks and ruptures every year, and are much more likely to explode when they aren't maintained. That detail seems to be conveniently forgotten by post-apocalyptic films. And finally, most post-apocalyptic movies will forget to mention what happens when there aren't any functional fire departments. Aside from the obvious consequences, like whole neighborhoods routinely burning to the ground, who's going to put out landfill fires that are occasionally radioactive? For most Americans, a major national emergency of this magnitude may seem unimaginable right now. But the truth is that it isn't difficult to see how this kind of scenario could happen. The Yellowstone supervolcano is becoming increasingly active, a single large asteroid could change all of our lives in a single moment, a crippling pandemic could bring normal life in America to a complete standstill, a terror attack involving weapons of mass destruction would spread panic and fear like wildfire, and a historic earthquake along the New Madrid fault, the Cascadia Subduction zone or any of the major faults in California could literally change the geography of our entire continent. In addition, a massive EMP burst from a nuclear weapon or from the sun could fry our power grid and send us back into the stone age in a single moment. This is something that I have written about extensively, and those that want to minimize this threat simply don't know what they are talking about. And an electromagnetic pulse is not even required to cause very serious problems with our electrical grid. For instance, just consider what happened in Ukraine toward the end of last year: On December 23rd, 2015, the Prykarpattyaoblenergo power distribution station in Ukraine was hit by a carefully coordinated cyber-attack that was months in the making. The technicians lost control of their cursors as they watched hackers open breakers and take circuit after circuit offline, plunging 230,000 residents into darkness. <a href="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=6421ee36eb&cb=858193288" ><img src="https://charisma-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536873539&cs=6421ee36eb&cb=858193288" border="0" alt=""></a> advertisement The hackers took backup power of the stations offline, plunging the electrical workers into darkness too, and worse yet, they even rewrote the low-level firmware that controls the electrical transformers. The attack had come after months of careful infiltration and planning by a dedicated team of elite cyber-warfare specialists and the result was devastating. Even months later, technicians struggled to regain full capacity in the electrical grid due to the overwriting of firmware. With Ukrainian moves to nationalize power companies, it is possible that the powerful and Putin-connected Russian oligarchs who own large parts of Ukraine's infrastructure were sending a message: We can shut down the system anytime we want. The truth is that we are far more vulnerable than most of us would like to admit. So what would you do if "normal life" suddenly came to an end and you no longer had access to food, water or power? How would you and your family respond? Hopefully you would continue to act in a civilized manner, but history has shown that many people would not. Desperate people do desperate things, and it would only take a matter of days for some people to become violent: Before long, getting mugged or being a victim of some type of crime is as unpredictable and as common as a car accident. You'll realize everyone in the neighborhood has now beefed up security on their homes. All your family, friends, and coworkers have experienced a mugging, carjacking, or worse. You'll have no choice but to accept this new way of life and count on basic safety measures (a form of passive denial) or further learn to defend yourself and remain in a constant state of alert (a very stressful state over time). It's difficult emotionally, mentally and physically to remain on high alert 24/7 for any length of time. Most people will revert to a form of passive denial until the next incident happens to them or a family member. And even though things may seem relatively stable for the moment, concern about what is coming is one of the factors that has led an increasing number of Americans to arm themselves. According to a brand new study from the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of all American homes now have a gun. Just two years ago, a different study found that number was sitting at just 31 percent. The way that we are living our lives right now will not last indefinitely. At some point a major national emergency will strike, and when that day arrives we could suddenly be facing major power grid and transportation disruptions. Are you prepared for that? If not, you might want to do so while you still have time. Michael Snyder is the founder and publisher of End Of The American Dream.

News Sports TideSports.com Entertainment Obituaries E-Edition Jobs Cars Search Classifieds log in Police: Daughter stabbed mother in Walmart lot in Bessemer Tuesday Aug 30, 2016 at 9:00 AM BESSEMER — Alabama authorities Monday arrested a 29-year-old woman on murder charges in the slaying of her mother, who died over the weekend after being stabbed in a Walmart parking lot. The Associated Press BESSEMER — Alabama authorities Monday arrested a 29-year-old woman on murder charges in the slaying of her mother, who died over the weekend after being stabbed in a Walmart parking lot. Ashia Christine Huddleston was captured Monday morning by the U.S. Marshals Gulf Coast Regional Task Force and Bessemer police, said Sgt. Cortice Miles of Bessemer police. Huddleston had eluded authorities for nearly two days after fleeing the scene of the stabbing Saturday. Authorities have accused Huddleston of stabbing her mother, 49-year-old Tammy Lynn Huddleston, several times in the abdomen in the parking lot of a Walmart in Bessemer. Witnesses told police they saw the two women fighting before the younger Huddleston stabbed her mother and fled in a car with her boyfriend. Tammy Lynn Huddleston died Sunday morning at a hospital from her injuries. The violent slaying stunned her friends, who remembered the victim as a caring mother and grandmother, al.com reported. “She was a great mother that went far and beyond to help her kids,” said friend Kimberly Clayton. “She not only raised her daughter and her son, but she was raising her daughter’s two daughters. She ate, slept and lived for those grandkids.” Ashia Huddleston was jailed Monday with her bond set at $250,000. It was not immediately known if she had an attorney representing her. Miles said the suspect’s boyfriend had been cooperating with police. Clayton said after the stabbing she messaged Ashia Huddleston and pleaded with her to turn herself in to police. She said the young woman blocked her phone number after replying: “It was an accident.” “I hate that her daughter did this,” Clayton said. “I hope they lock her up for a long time. You don’t murder the lady that brought you into this world and always had your back no matter what.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Subscribe/Manage Account Manage Print Account Manage Digital Account Photo Reprints Corrections Contact Us Submissions Events Calendar Submit News Letters to the Editor Photos Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertise With Us Search Classifieds Search Display Ads Online Services Newsletters Mobile Apps RSS Facebook Twitter E-Edition Forum Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2017 GateHouse Media, LLC.

The store was evacuated Sunday in Millbrook, 10 miles north of Montgomery, after customers complained of irritated eyes and breathing problems. WSFA-TV reported that authorities initially blamed a piece of rotting produce for the problems. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Leslee Wright said Monday that employees later found an empty can of pepper spray under a merchandise display and suspect that caused customers' reactions. Wright credited store managers for taking the situation seriously and says the company is thankful no one was seriously hurt.

The Chicago Tribune reports that the line features peach, mixed berry and apple cobblers (each $6.98), an apple pecan cake ($9.98) and a sweet potato loaf ($4.48). All are available nationwide, except the loaf, which is only available in select stores. Shout out to Patti LaBelle! According to the press release, 6.4 million pounds of peaches go into the Patti’s Peach Cobbler. The Tribune sampled everything except the loaf, and noted that the crust of the cobbler “is covered in cinnamon, which is aromatic but actually distracts from the cobbler’s sweetness. Too much cinnamon on the interior turned the tasters off.” READ RELATED STORY: Look! Patti LaBelle and James Wright Chanel Together Eatin’, Dancin & Singin’ (VIDEO/PHOTOS) The publication also reports that Patti’s Berry Cobbler is “stuffed with raspberries, blackberries, blueberries and boysenberries,” and that it’s “the right balance of sweet to tart.” Additionally, the “cobblers are not sold frozen, so they don’t need to be heated to be enjoyed, but heating them through does offer a bit of that “fresh baked” sensation.” Patti’s Good Life Apple Cobbler has a texture that is “spot on.” The desert is made with Fuji apples that have retained a bit of their tartness, and the filling has a “more balanced mixture of cinnamon and sugar than the peach.” Patti’s Good Life Apple Pecan Cake was a major turn-off for the tasters because of the “near-impenetrable helmet of buttercream icing and too-rich caramel goo.” The cake itself is a tasty “Southern-style layer cake of Fuji apples and Georgia pecans.” Overall, the tasters aren’t sure these treats are worthy of breaking out into song over, as James Wright Chanel did after he sampled Patti’s now famous Sweet Potato Pie,  but they do offer “good value and flavor.”   Share this: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr patti labellepatti labelle cobblers and cakeswalmart Previous ArticleEagles Player Myke Tavarres Backtracks & Won't be Sitting Out the National Anthem Like Kaepernick Next ArticleJackie Robinson (in 1972) Said What Colin Kaepernick is Saying Now and More Show/Hide Comments Speak your Mind Cancel reply Follow Us Recent Videos Top Views Condola Rashad: Phylicia Rashad’s Daughter Engaged to Fellow Actor January 6, 2017 Lamar Odom Considering Reality TV Comeback, Watch Video Of Brawl At Ricky Harris’ Funeral January 6, 2017 Serial Killer Charles Manson No Model Prisoner During Decades in Jail January 6, 2017 Ciara Drops $15M Defamation Lawsuit Against Ex Future January 6, 2017 Jeanette J.

Large companies like Walmart have pumped thousands of dollars into an initiative called Keep Dollars In Crawford County and canvassers have spent months securing signatures from voters in hopes of having enough to put the issue before voters in November. The initiative would let voters decide if alcohol sales should be allowed within the county. There are opposing groups that have put up signs asking voters to not allow the issue to make the ballot. According to the Crawford County clerk, more than 90,000 signatures were turned in earlier this month to be counted.  A little more than 9,000 were verified to be usable in the count and approximately 3,000 verified signatures are still needed for the initiative to make the ballot. The clerk's office will have until 5 p.m. tomorrow (Aug. 30) to decide whether enough signatures were collected. "Whatever is certified to us at that point in time will go on the ballot. If we do not have the certification from the county clerk at that time then it will not go on the ballot," said Crawford County Election Commissioner Bill Coleman. Sources said the clerk's office could see a potential lawsuit filed against it alleging some collected signatures should be counted. The clerk said some signatures were not counted because the person or persons collecting the signatures weren't certified to do so by state law. In Johnson County, the clerk there is being sued by the group Stand Strong, Stay Dry, Be Safe. The lawsuit alleges the clerk did not certify paperwork according to state law and some canvassers were also not verified correctly. According to Johnson County clerk's office personnel, whether or not the issue will make the November ballot will be decided by a circuit court judge Wednesday.

The store was evacuated Sunday in Millbrook, 10 miles north of Montgomery, after customers complained of irritated eyes and breathing problems. WSFA-TV reported that authorities initially blamed a piece of rotting produce for the problems. Wal-Mart spokeswoman Leslee Wright said Monday that employees later found an empty can of pepper spray under a merchandise display and suspect that caused customers' reactions. Wright credited store managers for taking the situation seriously and says the company is thankful no one was seriously hurt. 0 Comments Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

My Money Blog Early Retirement Investing Guide Money Saving Tips Credit Card Rewards Advertising Disclosure Amazon Problems: Counterfeit Products August 31, 2016 By Jonathan Ping 13 Comments In my previous installment of Amazon Problems, I talked about fake Amazon product reviews. This time, I talk about fake products themselves. Thanks to lax Amazon policies, buyers now have to worry about whether their products are genuine or counterfeits. Amazon is now more of an open marketplace and less a “store” like Best Buy or Wal-Mart. Nearly 40% of Amazon’s total sales now come from two million third-party sellers. When you buy something, the website might still look like Amazon but the behind-the-scenes process could be very different. You basically have one of three options: Ships from and sold by Amazon.com. The real “Amazon store”. Amazon buys the products wholesale directly from the manufacturer, keeps them in Amazon warehouses, and then Amazon ships it you. Fulfilled by Amazon (FBA). This means a third-party bought the product from somewhere, claims that it is authentic, and then ships it over into an Amazon warehouse. You buy it, and Amazon ships it. This allows the merchant to make their products eligible for Free Super Saver Shipping and Amazon Prime. Ships and sold by Third-Party. The sellers have to follow certain rules, but you are mostly dealing directly with a third-party seller with their own warehouse and order fulfillment. This is like eBay or traditional flea markets. Because Amazon essentially allows anyone to ship them something and say “These are the real thing!”, that opportunity itself can encourage counterfeiting. In July 2016, Birkenstock announced that due to counterfeits and Amazon’s lack of response, they will no longer supply products to Amazon as of January 1st, 2017. In addition, they will no longer authorize third-party merchants to sell on the site. According to another CNBC article, other brands with questionable authenticity include Michael Kors and Canada Goose. Amazon even commingles inventory from various third-party sellers, so you end up with no idea where your product really came from: To unsuspecting consumers, fake products can appear legitimate because of the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which lets manufacturers send their goods to Amazon’s fulfillment centers and hand over a bigger commission, gaining the stamp of approval that comes with an FBA tag. Furthermore, Amazon’s commingled inventory option bundles together products from different sellers, meaning that a counterfeit jacket could be sent to an Amazon facility by one merchant and actually sold by another. I can only hope that Amazon’s own inventory is still kept separate from the Fulfilled By Amazon (FBA) inventory. Per The Counterfeit Report, here are some other brand name items with reports of counterfeit copies online: Converse Chuck Taylor All Star shoes The North Face Denali jackets Gillette Fusion Razor Blades Giorgio Armani: Acqua Di Gio fragrance Bose headphones Otterbox smartphone cases Duracell batteries It’s really hard to tell between fake and real products. Last year, a detailed teardown of a $199 Beats headphone that revealed only $17 of cheap parts went viral. That pair of headphones turned out to be fake. But wait, they did a another teardown of authentic Beats headphones and found them to be still very similar, with $20 of cheap parts. It really says something these hardware experts didn’t even recognize a fake after tearing it apart (the boxes and internal materials are also excellent copies). This counterfeit problem should be a huge concern for Amazon. Every time I look at a brand name product like Bose headphones, Nespresso coffee pods, or Ray Ban sunglasses, I have to pause and weigh the chances that I’ll get a fake product. Is the price too good to be true? Why is this other price so much lower? If another big merchant comes along with a good user interface and reliable product sourcing, then I would definitely consider shopping there instead. (You hear that, Jet.com + Wal-Mart?) What can you do? One option is to only buy things marked “Ships from and sold by Amazon.com.” This may mean you have to voluntarily pay more for the same product – so painful! – but it may be worth a few extra bucks for the peace of mind. I would also consider third-party sellers if they are the original manufacturers of the product. For example, you could buy ExOfficio boxer briefs directly from the ExOfficio seller account (although sold by Amazon is cheaper right now). Amazon’s return policies could still be considered “customer-friendly”, but only if you are an alert and active customer. It is your responsibility to examine your product for any inconsistencies. If you spend the time to contact them and complain, by most accounts Amazon will refund your money if under FBA, or at least pressure the 3rd-party merchant to refund your money. This isn’t good enough; I hope that Amazon becomes less reactionary and be more pro-active about this problem.

They have made it easy for any brand to register their product and restrict what sellers are allowed to list their products on Amazon. They have a list of their own of suspected counterfeited brands in which Amazon is restricting who can sell those brands. Now sellers need to provide at least three recent wholesale invoices with substantial quantity order, have good seller metrics and pay I ungating fees (avg $1k+ on each brand) to apply for approval. That fee is to help the cost of their counterfeit investigation operation. Most counterfeiting is coming from the merchant fulfilled sellers, but some does come from FBA sellers. AZ is applying these rules as strictly all sellers alike. AZ is a victim in these scandals too. The recent proliferation of counterfeiting has scaled up to a rate too difficult to police it all. They will no longer accept retail receipts to substantiate authenticity, which includes Walmart. Many products Walmart sells are knock offs. I am an FBA seller and these changes hurt our business. We get blocked from selling products we have been routinely selling legitimately and the current stock at Amazon doesn’t get grandfathered so there are substantial losses. Amazon’s mission is to always put the customer experience first, regardless of the fact that third party sellers are a profit center for them (they don’t make profit from their own sales). I’ve never seen a company more protective of their customers than AZ. They are a huge growing company so communication is lacking. I don’t doubt they weren’t amply communicating their efforts to Birkenstock, but that doesn’t mean they weren’t working behind the scenes. Reply SN says: September 1, 2016 at 10:47 pm well, it does sound like AMZ’s unofficial official response 🙂 Reply roger says: September 2, 2016 at 4:04 pm Amazon has become as cheap as it can get! I have stopped buying things from them. This post above is some amazon employee, forced to work long hours and made to write things praising them! They deliver via private persons, having no integrity and standards, these carriers steal packages and mark them as delivered. I was shocked to see a dirty truck pull up on my property, a nonchalantly dressed man steps out and delivers a package, grabs few others packages delivered earlier and goes away! Reply Patricia says: September 1, 2016 at 6:02 am I became aware of the counterfeiting for health supplements several months ago. I usually bought name brand company products that I trusted, but realized I couldn’t trust the products on Amazon (and now you’re telling us even things sold and shipped by Amazon might be commingled) to be real. So I went to my favorite companies and asked where I could reliably buy their products. Now I buy all my supplements from that source. A big disappointment, because Amazon used to be my one stop shop. No longer. Thanks for getting this info out there. Amazon better wake up and smell the coffee. Reply Raven says: September 2, 2016 at 5:05 am They have made it easy now for your brand to register themselves so now they can control the sellers on Amazon. The brand owner/manufacturer would have have to approve any seller other than themselves. This way they know that only the sellers and distributors they directly sold the product to can be on the listing. Reply kamal says: September 5, 2016 at 1:10 pm this is simply not true. The real problem is a security one, this website has been hacked by Chinese criminals who can freely open as many accounts as they want. Simply removing the counterfeiters doesn’t work anymore. They work by taking American third party sellers listings as bait, if they can stay open more than 14 days they then get paid by amz for their sells while there shipping will take 4 to 6 weeks, and of course very little orders they took will be shipped. Reply Christiana says: September 6, 2016 at 6:38 pm When it comes to health supplements, there are many fakes on amazon. I’ve learned to stick to brands I know and trust. Reply Joshua Katt says: September 1, 2016 at 8:24 am Even Amazon plays these games too. I bought disposable Gillette Good News razors directly from them. Packaging and item was completely different that advertised and they suck compared to what I buy at CVS. Reply H says: September 1, 2016 at 9:05 am Even products shipped and sold by Amazon can be knockoff, too. I’m surprised Ray-Ban sunglasses wasn’t on the list because they are a lot of fakes out there. Reply jim says: September 1, 2016 at 12:09 pm Yes there are certainly problems with the Amazon marketplace. Just about anyone can sell anything on the marketplace and its not really feasible for Amazon to guarantee everyting sold by the 3rd parties. On teh other hand the problem with counterfeits is not unique to Amazon and you can get them in ebay, misc. internet vendors and retail stores. Reply Joe Higashi says: September 1, 2016 at 1:42 pm Is wasn’t able to find any way to seach for “fulfilled by Amazon” or “sold by Amazon” which made it very tricky to even collect super-saver shipping, let alone worry about counterfeits. Amazon should be very concerned about this, as it has largely strangled ebay. After being burned a couple of times on ebay I’ve given on it for anything I don’t expect to be crap. Reply Christiana says: September 6, 2016 at 6:41 pm I paid $13 more for a ship and sold by amazon product earlier this summer because I didn’t want to take the risk. Also another product where I’ve read reviews with reports of counterfeits on amazon is micro SD cards. What some don’t realize is that fulfilled by amazon doesn’t mean genuine. In terms of comingling, I’ve read of it happening but people have returned these items to amazon and exchanged and what they’ve gotten in exchange seems genuine. Reply Christiana says: September 6, 2016 at 6:44 pm Oh btw, I hope you continue with these series on amazon. So far you’ve written about issues I’m aware, I’m wondering what else is next? Has anyone else noticed that pbs programs that were included with prime video no longer are? you have to pay extra for them now?

With more than 1,100 responses, the survey results are in. Among the various types of parking, survey respondents parked their trucks mostly at private trucks stops or public rest areas. Compared to other parking modes, highway on-ramps/off-ramps were prohibited by the most employers (101).  Nevertheless, ramps were the third most popular parking location. Broken down by average days per week used, the survey results revealed the following: Private truck stops – 2.45 (prohibited by 3 employers) Public rest areas – 2.44 (prohibited by 6 employers) Highway on-ramp/off-ramp – 2.19 (prohibited by 101 employers) Shipper/receiver location – 2.08 (prohibited by 15 employers) Abandoned lot/isolated area – 2.03 (prohibited by 43 employers) Temporary parking lot (e.g., Wal-Mart, casino) – 2.02 (prohibited by 22 employers) Roadside – 1.95 (prohibited by 87 employers) Weigh station – 1.56 (prohibited by 12 employers) Hotel/motel/lodging – 1.35 (prohibited by 10 employers) In terms of preferences, nearly one-third preferred private truck stops, followed by public rest areas at 13.68 percent. The least popular parking mode was “temporary parking,” which includes Wal-Mart and casino parking lots. Tied for first with 36 percent each, respondents indicated that it took either approximately 30 minutes or more than 30 minutes to find a parking space. A little over a quarter of respondents reported finding a spot in 20 minutes or less. Three-quarters of respondents said their company did not provide overnight parking, and more than 67 percent said the receiving location does not provide such parking. “Between the hours of 2 p.m. and 5 a.m. it’s virtually impossible to find any kind of ‘safe’ parking,” one respondent pointed out. According to the results, the Interstate 5, I-405 and I-90 corridors are the areas posing the greatest problem for truckers looking for a place to park. More than 43 percent of respondents named the I-5 corridor as the most difficult to find safe and legal parking overnight. The I-405 corridor came in second with 20.93 percent of responses, followed by I-90 at 18.6 percent. All other corridors were split in the single digits, with U.S. 395 in the western U.S. receiving no votes. Several comments mentioned the Seattle metro area and Snoqualmie Pass near North Bend. To highlight the concerns of truckers, more than half of respondents said that safety is a concern most days (4-7) during the week and 30 percent said they were concerned about safety 1-2 days a week. Less than 4 percent had no concern for safety. Public safety was addressed when more than half indicated they drove fatigued due to parking shortages frequently (3-5 days a week) or regularly (6-7 days a week). Similar results came about when asking the same parking shortage question regarding the challenges of driving within the hours-of-service regulations. Another question WSDOT asked was how much – if anything – truckers are willing to pay for parking. The answer: $0. More than half said they were not willing to pay a dime for parking. “We shouldn’t have to pay,” one respondent commented. “We pay fuel taxes, road taxes and taxes on goods bought there. If you want goods, you need to provide safe havens for trucks.” Of all the respondents, more than 84 percent were truck drivers, with the remainder including dispatchers, managers, and “other.” Nearly 36 percent of respondents were independent owner-operators, followed by 29 percent private company fleets, 23.8 percent for-hire, 7.2 percent long-term lease, and the rest not specified. More than half indicated that regional tractor-trailers were the most used by their company and nearly a quarter indicated “other.” The rest were split between short/local delivery, port drayage and oversize/overweight loads. “I think it’s good data, and the participation rate among drivers was pretty high,” said Mike Matousek, director of state legislative affairs for the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association. “Hopefully the information is used to improve truck parking in areas where it’s needed the most.  It won’t do any good sitting on a shelf.” Copyright © OOIDA Comments Advertiser Info Archives Special Reports Daily News Daily News By State Trucking Biz Buzz Magazine Archive Letters to the Editor OOIDA in the News Election Coverage Blogs Land Line Media Blog “The Pork Chop Diaries” Important Info Legislative Watch Federal Calls to Action Industry Calendar Join/Subscribe Join OOIDA Subscribe/Renew Unsubscribe from Magazine Daily eNews Signup Unsubscribe from eNews Other Sites OOIDA Land Line Now OOIDA Truck Insurance TRACER System OOIDA Foundation OOIDA PAC OOIDA Online Education Industry Links Contact Us Contact Us Advertiser Info Send a Letter Address Change Copyright © 2017 OOIDA Privacy Policy | Copyright 1-800-444-5791 | (816) 229-5791 1 NW OOIDA Dr | PO Box 1000 Grain Valley, MO 64029

Sabin, explains how the company is taking on competitors such as Amazon. Carrie Rengers/The Wichita Eagle crengers@wichitaeagle.com It may look like Bonvera president Jeff Selzer is in a warehouse, but he prefers the word “facility.” He said the company’s goal “is not to store things. Our goal is to move things.” Bo Rader The Wichita Eagle 1 of 2 i By Carrie Rengers crengers@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story There’s a new Wichita company that’s a cross between Amazon and Amway, though that’s not how the executives at Bonvera describe the business. They prefer the term “social selling company.” “A lot of people will compare us to companies like … Amway or Tupperware or Mary Kay because they have a similar model,” Bonvera president Jeff Selzer said. He said they’re all relationship businesses, “But their product offerings are nothing like what we do.” Bonvera is an internet-based business that offers a range of products – including toiletries, household items, pet food and snacks – that anyone can buy. However, its model is built on associates referring friends to buy those products in exchange for rebates. “When people buy from our company, they get paid to do it,” Selzer said. “This is a great opportunity for a regular person to be able to go into business for themselves.” The company, which started in March, has 400 products so far from companies such as Procter & Gamble and S.C. Johnson & Son and expects to have 500 by the end of next week. That doesn’t count the products Bonvera has through affiliate companies, such as Target and Wal-Mart. Associates and their friends can use the Bonvera website to get to the websites for those companies and then be paid for any transactions. “The larger our community gets, the more leverage we have,” Selzer said. “Our secret sauce is the fact that the company keeps a very small profit off what is purchased. We’re (a) very competitive company so our prices are very comparable to what’s online.” Bonvera also is developing house brands. So far, that includes two energy drinks and bars under the brand name Phyzix. The company is expanding into a skin care line next month. There are also Wichita products on the site, such as Tortilla King’s tortillas, and chips and salsa under the Mama Lupe brand name. “The concept is a concept I’ve never seen before, so I was kind of intrigued about it,” Tortilla King president Juan Guardiola said of Bonvera. “It will expose our products to consumers outside of the Midwest and grow our market share.” Selzer said Bonvera is an opportunity even for big-name products that don’t get the in-store shelf space they used to at chains that now have their own brands to promote. “The kings on the block are now being pushed around,” Selzer said. “You would think that they’d never talk to a company our size.” Selzer won’t discuss the size of the company in terms of sales or number of associates. Selzer sees companies such as Amazon and Jet as his chief competitors – not other direct marketing businesses. “Those are mammoth companies that we’re going up against, but I’m not scared of that,” he said. He said he’s done it before with his All Brands Distribution beverage company. Selzer said when starting All Brands years ago, he had competition from huge brands such as Coke and Pepsi, but he found a niche with off-name brands that he was able to place in stores such as QuikTrip and Kroger. “So we had to go and scrape in and just find a little seam and just grow,” he said. That’s what he’s now doing with Bonvera. “It’s not easy to do, but it’s possible.” A ‘better model’ A group of investors – some local, some national – approached Selzer about starting the company late last summer. “The majority of the founders of Bonvera have had years’ experience running similar direct marketing companies,” said Bryan Frye, a City Council member who is Bonvera’s marketing director. “They always saw the shortcomings and the challenges of those direct marketing companies, and they wanted to build a better model,” Frye said. “The beauty of Bonvera is these are products you buy every day anyway.” Michigan-based Bonvera associate Tim Jarvinen, who has worked for other direct marketing companies, said that is one of the things that sets apart Bonvera. “You’re just connecting people to something they’re already doing,” Jarvinen said. He said even if people don’t have jobs or if it’s a tough economy, there are certain products that customers always need, and Bonvera has those. Jarvinen said he uses “the power of social media” to sell Bonvera to friends, along with everyday conversations about its benefits. “It’s hard just to not bring that up in conversation,” he said. “It’s not a sales-y conversation.” While Jarvinen touts the ability to use personal connections to make sales, others can be skeptical of it. “That’s not something that a lot of people are comfortable with,” said Dorothy Harpool, who is on the marketing faculty at the W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State University. “You would think that it would be easier,” Harpool said of selling to friends, “but it’s not.” She said a friend’s referral may be a powerful influence to check out something once, though. “I wonder how long-term the behavior would be?” she said. Selzer says his goal is to eventually sell outside the United States. “This is what we’ve got done in five months. You should see where we’re going,” he said. The company’s corporate headquarters is at the former Asian Market space on East Central just east of the Canal Route. Bonvera’s products ship from a warehouse at 1659 S. Sabin. “I call that a facility, not a warehouse, because our goal is not to store things,” Selzer said. “Our goal is to move things.” With the help of associates, Selzer said that’s what is happening. “I see so many people hungry for opportunity,” he said. Selzer said Bonvera provides a nontraditional avenue to success. “We are totally out of the box,” he said. “We are so far out of the box, we don’t even see the box anymore.” Carrie Rengers: 316-268-6340, @CarrieRengers Related content Bonvera is Wichita's south-side Amazon LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:11 Urban Interiors By Farmhouse 5 opens at Eaton Place Pause 1:18 VIDEO: Wichita tech company SNT seeing rapid growth 4:23 Pet deer shot by game warden 2:20 Man talks about his brother's Christmas Day death 1:57 Downtown Wichita collision injures four 1:50 Body found in dumpster on Christmas Day 0:51 Son of Kansas lawmaker dabs, and Ryan asks, 'Are you going to sneeze?' 2:43 Raw video: Multiple deaths in shooting at Florida airport 0:40 K-State wins the Texas Bowl 0:49 Shoppers get a head start on Black Friday purchases Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 10 hours ago Check out the new products Garmin brought to CES 4:54 10 hours ago Check out the new products Garmin brought to CES 2:11 a day ago Urban Interiors By Farmhouse 5 opens at Eaton Place 1:24 2 days ago Paramount Marketplace attracts shoppers, vendors View more video Business KC-area entrepreneur starts private aviation membership service Boeing delivers fewer airplanes in 2016, but not by much Changes coming for longtime clothier in response to retail trends How good are your workplace’s benefits?

In Wheeling, the YWCA wants to make sure people are aware of the resources available to them should they find themselves in a similar situation.  The Family Violence Prevention program will set you up with an advocate who will guide you through the legal processes which Director Patricia Flanigan says can be very confusing. She says there are several misconceptions surrounding domestic violence policy in West Virginia--for instance, regarding emergency protective orders. "It is a no contact order. It doesn't mean that you and I, for say, are sisters and we have an order against one another, that we're not both in Walmart. But, you can't be in Walmart for the purpose of harassing me," says Flanigan. "There is where the difference lays. You can be at the same baseball field watching your children play ball. You can't be there for the purpose of harassing the other person." Flanigan says that things can also get confusing where the court systems are involved. If you file a protective order petition, it will go through magistrate court. If the police were involved and an arrest was made, it will be taken care of in civil court.  Again, if you are a victim of domestic violence, the YWCA will provide you with resources to walk you through any confusion. The 24-hour hotline number to call is 1-800-698-1247.  WTRF 96 16th Street Wheeling, WV 26003 Main (304) 232-7777 Fax (304) 233-5822 Can't Find Something?

The Dallas-based company offers patrons food and drinks served at their seats during the film. If built, the Trexlertown location would have 11 screens. The closest existing locations are in Montgomery and Chester counties. The Trexler Business Center calls for up to five new buildings plus the existing Bastian Carpet One east of the Wal-Mart Supercenter and West Valley Marketplace. It's just north of Shepherd Hills Golf Course. Besides Movie Tavern, the commercial center would include a strip retail building, a casual dining restaurant and a quick-service restaurant with a drive-thru. A handful of sycamore trees planted by U.S. Rep. Fred Gernerd in the 1930s will be removed for new driveways, and deceleration lanes may jeopardize up to eight others, according to arborists. The project has gone before various township boards more than a dozen times this year. One major source of debate: The township planning commission's request common architectural scheme fitting its larger vision for the Hamilton corridor. Movie Tavern pulled from tonight's agenda in Lower Macungie Andrew Wagaman TREXLERTOWN — The Trexler Business Center, which includes the Movie Tavern, has been pulled from the agenda for tonight's Lower Macungie commissioners meeting.

TREXLERTOWN — The Trexler Business Center, which includes the Movie Tavern, has been pulled from the agenda for tonight's Lower Macungie commissioners meeting. The township did not immediately give a reason for postponing the much-anticipated vote for a third consecutive meeting. But developer... (Andrew Wagaman) The planning commission questioned the proposed height and lighting of the Movie Tavern but ultimately recommended the Zoning Hearing Board to grant relief for a 65-foot tower (the maximum allowed building height in a commercial district is 50 feet). The zoning board rejected the 65-foot tower and Movie Tavern said it would likely walk away from the project because of the time and cost needed to redesign the building. But it ultimately reapplied for a variance for a 60-foot tower, and this time the zoning board granted relief. If built, the Trexler Business Center will have an access drive from Mill Creek Road past the Wal-Mart. A roundabout was originally planned for the main entrance on Hamilton Boulevard, but PennDOT didn't think it was an appropriate location.

Township officers detained the man at gunpoint at 12:45 p.m. in the Nassau Park shopping center off Route 1 and soon found there was no real threat. The man did not have a grenade, and the bandolier was filled with small bottles of perfume he was peddling. West Windsor police Lt. Robert Fow said the man, a Trenton resident he did not identify, was eventually sent on his way with a ticket for violating a local ordinance for the peddling. And he was told his appearance and grenade comment were not the best decisions, Fow said. Fow said the peddler with with two associates, and during the exchange with the woman he was propositioning for a perfume sale, a remark about his bandolier led him to say he "also had a grenade." To a person unfamiliar with firearms, such a remark by someone wearing a sling usually worn by hunters, "could be a scary situation," Fow said. The woman did the right thing by calling police. "And we handled it by the book," Fow said of the department's response. Kevin Shea may be reached at kshea@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter@kevintshea.

That’s exactly how the serial entrepreneur, now the CEO and founder of Wheels Up, got his start. But what sets Dichter apart is his track record since then: building and selling one successful business after another. In college, Dichter and a friend began creating and selling T-shirts with “Wisconsin flair” at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The apparel line started to gain traction, so Dichter moved the operation from his dorm to a nearby storefront. That business grew to three locations before Dichter sold it upon graduation. After his first success, the father of one of his friends, a clothing manufacturer, decided to back Dichter’s next apparel venture. His operation moved from Wisconsin to New York City, and he was soon fulfilling orders for the likes of Wal-Mart and Sears. As the company reached a tipping point, Dichter decided to sell it and start a new venture, a process he would repeat over and over again. His next business took him into the world of sports marketing. His friend Jesse Itzler, a jingle writer, saw an opportunity to build a business around the music that played in arenas during sporting events. Dichter provided the strategy for Itzler’s idea, and the two sold that business to SFX Entertainment for more than $4 million in 1998. By that point, Dichter had experienced substantial success firsthand, and he noticed that no one in his social circles flew commercial anymore. On one of his first private flights, the idea for Marquis Jet was born. Marquis Jet was the first aviation option that allowed members to reduce travel costs by buying blocks of hours on a pre-paid card instead of purchasing their own aircraft. Again, Dichter grew his idea and made an exit, selling Marquis Jet to Warren Buffet’s NetJets in 2010. Before returning to aviation with Wheels Up in 2014, Dichter built and sold another business, Tequila Avion, an ultra-premium brand that sold for $100 million. His latest success offers the private aviation industry a membership model without spending requirements or hourly minimums. Wheels Up raised $115 million in funding in February 2016, and according to Ditcher, it now holds a valuation of $521.5 million with a projected worth of $1 to $1.5 billion by 2020.   Clearly, Dichter knows what he’s doing. Here are his top four pieces of advice for entrepreneurial success. 1. Embrace rejection. Dichter explains that as an entrepreneur, belief in one's self is paramount. One must be able to pivot -- and realize that hearing “no” is a good thing. Why? Because it means you are innovating. “If everyone saw what you see, they’d all be doing it themselves,” Dichter says. To embrace rejection does not mean to accept rejection, however. Dichter believes that “no” just means “not now.” “Never take no for an answer," he says. "You have to have the belief in yourself that you can sit at the big table.” 2. Value relationships. Dichter often says “my friend” or “my buddy” when referring to his partners. He also emphasizes that if you want your employees to treat customers like rockstars, you need to treat your employees like rockstars. Dichter clearly values relationships, and he cautions entrepreneurs never to burn a bridge. “As an entrepreneur you touch a lot of lives," Dichter says. "Just be fair, have integrity, do what you say you’re going to do.” He encourages entrepreneurs to cherish existing customer relationships. Try to take someone who is “interested” and convert them into a “believer.” His advice for everyone trying to build the next Birchbox or Dollar Shave Club is simple: “The only thing that matters in a subscription business is, can you keep [your customers]? Retention is the number-one value metric.” 3. Create a clear map. Dichter is a huge believer in business plans. When Itzler approached him about a music business, all he had was an idea. It was Dichter’s job to make the plan turn into a business. This is a step many entrepreneurs don't execute well, Ditcher says. “Ideas are fragile," he says. "Ideas are not enough. You need to have a concrete plan that can serve as a map." 4. Know your numbers. An idea and a plan are also not enough, Ditcher says. You have to have the proof. Now that Wheels Up has 3,500 members, Ditcher can start to rest a little easier. Is there a certain number one needs to hit before a successful exit? Ditcher explains that the average life cycle of a great idea is five to seven years. If you want to maintain success, and you’ve taken outside investments, you need to prepare for your exit, Ditcher says. “If a restaurant is given five stars, sell the restaurant, because it doesn’t get any better than that.” Ditcher, like many serial entrepreneurs, is in it for the climb, not the destination. And right now, he’s on the way up.

Let's toast to all this beautiful strength we never saw coming. I thought of eating a gun at one point. At a bunch of points, to be honest. It's so hard for me to admit that in a way. I have three beautiful, young kids. I have family that loves me, or tries their best to love me. I play in a rock and roll band, and we just so happen to be one of the best bands that has ever existed.   I have a lot of reasons to live. To keep on breathing and hurting and smiling and punching myself in the face, even in the crashing wake of being told by someone I loved that they simply don't love me anymore.  giphy I drove around looking for spots to off myself. I wanted to use a gun. I wanted to punish myself for losing love, for losing the girl. And I wanted to make it forever. It sounds so stupid on the surface but that's what can happen with heartbreak. You can drown. You can choke to death on your own remorse. You can confuse loss and pain with guilt and shame. And the worst part of all of it? It all makes perfect sense. Because when it comes to loving someone else, the rules of social discipline and responsibility are nothing but a brick wall for you to piss on. People forget that. People who haven't been there are swift to judge heartbreak extremists. They label them: He was selfish. He was weak. That Serge dude. Godd*mn he was so f*cking stupid. But no. Love, even at it's very worst, is still intoxicating. That feeling of being linked to someone else, and them being linked to you, in the most ancient and true way possible, it's more powerful than all space and time.  So it's only natural that when love dies, a part of you dies with it. imgfave Sometimes that isn't the case. Sometimes people move right along from one thing to another and they never feel so sad or dejected that they envision ending their lives. Not even close. But guess what? Those people were never truly in love. So f*ck them.  *** There are tricks to getting over the person you once loved, I suppose, but I don't know any of them. Booze, maybe. Sleeping around with fresh blood? Newfound liberation in the form of your own place/one toothbrush instead of two/that sort of thing?  I have no idea. I have found that moving on and "getting over" the person you were once brave enough to love, all in, is more difficult than it seems. It's kind of purgatorial in the Old Testament way, where long periods of what feels like forever go by and the same darkness, the same exact cyclic blues, keep hammering away at you, day in and day out. It takes so long to recognize there is a way out. You get used to it all after awhile. You become adjusted to the sound of your own bones crunching down in the vises of torment.  Love used to get you off. Even when it didn't, it still did. Maybe that's where you went wrong. Maybe that's where I went wrong? Who knows. But there was a time, not all that long ago, when I understood that I would never understand.  wifflegif That period lasted like 18 million years. And it's still all over me like spiders. But at the same time, I'm still alive. I still make my kids microwave popcorn on Saturday nights when I rent Ghostbusters or The Goonies from the Apple store on the TV. I still feel the twinge of lust rise up inside of my biology when I'm alone, when I see a beautiful woman right there in the Walmart pizza aisle. I keep breathing, making coffee, smoking cigs, and changing diapers so dripping wet that I wonder how the hell I missed them for the last hour. That's the strength right there happening. That's me moving on. No rhyme or reason. No system or method. Just a fool in the rain. Just a single dad with a dirty diaper in his hands.  The trick, you see, is that there is no trick.  *** There's so much written about how to be strong and feel better these days that you could start reading that sh*t right now, right this very second — scrolling down through the endless scroll of "power of positivity" articles slamming themselves up into your phone, 50 per second. You could read them for the rest of your natural-born life, and you would never ever get through them all. Your brain would pop and flicker out before you'd conquer all that hot air. Your heart would stab itself with your final breath. Your eyes would dry up like potato chips and your nostrils would fill with blood that started pooling back behind your face long before you could ever possibly read all the words attached to all the clicks designed to fix you up right then and there. You would die the worst death possible just from trying to make yourself happy again. Isn't that weird? *** I will move on. I'm moving on as we speak. So are you. But only in the ways we have to move on, in the ways we are forced to drift away from old love merely because the unconquerable tides are pulling us out. tumblr That's the only thing we can fully depend on: Time. We have to be brave enough to trust in it. To know that it cares for us at least a little bit simply because of the dumbass fact that we're both still here.  I didn't blow my skull wide open. Neither have you. That's a thing, you know? It takes galactic strength to stay. It takes galactic strength to leave, too, by the way. But they're two very different things, obviously, and I write for the living because they're the only ones who read. Or pay.  So what then? You got your heart broken and you want to feel whole again? Or you broke someone's heart and you want to shake the heavy chains that come with that? Do what you gotta do. Hurt like hell for as long as you need to. Try to not be a major dickhead if you can help it but there will be times when you have to be a major dickhead, so there you go.  Your strength lies in each passing hour, each day floating away from you. The ether of my darkness has been a pain in the ass. It feels like I've been sucking on a tailpipe since the day I was born. But I haven't.

Amy Mayer/IPR A group of agricultural companies, food manufacturers, retailers and environmental groups plant to raise money to further conservation practices in Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska. The Midwest Row Crop Collaborative announced its launch at the Farm Progress Show in Boone Wednesday. Founding partners include Cargill, the Environmental Defense Fund, General Mills, Kellogg Company, Monsanto, PepsiCo, The Nature Conservancy, Walmart and the World Wildlife Fund. Jill Kolling, senior director of sustainability at Cargill, says the first objective is to raise $4 million over the next five years to directly fund on-farm conservation. The money will be distributed through the Soil Health Partnership, a program of the National Corn Growers Association, and will initially focus on Iowa, Illinois and Nebraska. "In these states we'll be working to optimize soil health practices and outcomes, reduce nutrient runoff into the rivers and streams of the Mississippi River Basin, maximize water conservation to reduce pressure on the Ogallala Aquifer and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Kolling says. She adds that the Collaborative will also create a sustainable agriculture resource center to collate research in one place so farmers can review case scenarios from other farms. And the group will also work to foster connections between consumers and farmers.  Larry Clemens, North American Agriculture Director for The Nature Conservancy, says his organization recognizes the considerable and increasing demand to produce food from Midwest fields. He says partnering in this way will help ensure that those needs can be met in a context that improves water quality and soil health. He says these are questions The Nature Conservancy has long been addressing. "The Nature Conservancy is eager to help the Collaborative leverage our expertise to accelerate solutions that match the scale of the challenges we face in this region," Clemens says, "such as improving water quality across the Midwest and addressing the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico." Nutrient runoff from Midwest farm fields contributes to the Gulf dead zone and has been a concern for drinking water supplies in Des Moines and other communities.

He and his uncle were harvesting the first crop of oats on this farm in decades. Before, corn and soybeans almost completely covered the landscape -- today, they account for 95 percent of crop acres in Iowa -- most Corn Belt farmers also grew oats or alfalfa. Now, the Heinemans are among the farmers taking a closer look at re-integrating the small grain into their operations. Low Prices Could Push Farmers into New Crops By Amy Mayer • Mar 7, 2016 Photo by Amy Mayer Take a road trip through the Midwest during the growing season, and it feels like you're moving through a sea of corn and soybeans grown largely for livestock feed or ethanol. But now, low grain prices and increasing pressure to clean up waterways may push some farmers to consider other options.  © 2017 Iowa Public Radio About IPR Board of Directors Contact Us Careers at IPR Terms of Use For the Press Events

Join us! REGISTER HERE. Contrary to appearances, ridesharing doesn’t have to look like Uber or Lyft. A wide variety of lesser known companies have entered the space to offer carpooling services so that individuals can share rides to and from their places of work. One of the bigger, newer players in the space is Waze, the Google-owned mobile navigation app that launched its own carpooling service in May. The service launched as part of a pilot program in the Bay Area in partnership with specific companies, including UCSF, Adobe and Walmart Global eCommerce. Earlier this month, Julie Mossler (Head of Brand & Global Marketing at Waze) told me over email that the closed pilot was "thriving” but the company hadn’t yet committed to any plans for expansion. She also clarified today that the Waze app has been accepting all users as drivers for the past month, but the company hasn't committed to a date to accept new riders. According to a new report in the Wall Street Journal, however, Google plans to open the program to all Waze users in the San Francisco Bay Area as soon as this fall. While it’s clear that any new entrant into the ridesharing space would compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft, it should be noted that Waze’s carpool service is fairly different in that it focuses simply on commutes to and from work. Additionally, the program isn’t designed to make money for drivers, though riders are expected to split the cost of fuel. The most they’re paying is 54 cents a mile, and Google/Waze doesn’t take a cut at all. Still, Uber is a multibillion dollar behemoth that has invested tons of time, money, and resources into making its name largely synonymous with ridesharing, so it’s clear that having Google muscle its way into the space is significant. And it’s not just outsiders who think so. Coinciding with the news of Waze’s impending expansion, Uber has confirmed that David Drummond (Google's Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Chief Legal Officer) has stepped down from Uber’s board of directors: "I recently stepped down from Uber's board given the overlap between the two companies,” said Drummond in a prepared statement. “Uber is a phenomenal company and it's been a privilege working with the team over the last two plus years. GV remains an enthusiastic investor and Google will continue to partner with Uber. I want to wish Travis all the best for the future." Drummond first joined the board back in 2013, when Google Ventures (today known as GV) made a $258 million investment in Uber. But now it’s clear that, between carpooling and self-driving cars and maps, the companies are going to be competitors, not partners. Interestingly, Lyft was one of the launch partners for Waze's Transport SDK early this year, further entangling the ridesharing companies with Google. With Drummond stepping down, here’s where Uber’s current board stands: Board Members Garrett Camp, co-founder and chairman of the board at Uber Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber Ryan Graves, SVP Global Operations at Uber Bill Gurley, General Partner at Benchmark David Plouffe, former Obama advisor David Bonderman, founding partner of TPG Capital Arianna Huffington, co-founder and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post (joined in April) Board Observers Matt Cohler, General Partner at Benchmark Shervin Pishevar, entrepreneur and angel investor Ed. note: Our 6th Annual Vator Splash LA conference is coming up on October 13 at the Loews Hotel in Santa Monica.

Eisenstein Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement Everyone, it seems, wants to get into the car-sharing business, even as Uber, the emerging industry's leader, reportedly lost more than $1 billion for the first half of the year. Google is the latest player to toss its car keys into the ring. The high-tech firm began a limited test in May of a carpooling project in its home base in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is expanding that venture, which relies on Google's Waze smartphone app. While not a direct competitor to Uber or its smaller rival Lyft, the carpooling project could create a future outlet for Google as it pushes forward with its aggressive autonomous vehicle development program, some observers suggest. One indication of the tech firm's possible plans comes with the decision by David Drummond to resign from Uber's board of directors. Drummond's primary job has been chairman of Alphabet GV. Short for Google Ventures, it's the company's venture capital arm and was responsible for the $250 million it put into Uber a few years back. When Google launched its carpooling venture back in May, it offered the service to only "a select group of employers" near San Francisco, including Adobe Systems, Wal-Mart and, of course, to employees at Google. The project was distinctly different from Uber, which is essentially a taxi alternative. Using the Waze app, people could connect with other commuters who might be heading in the same direction and line up a ride. They'd then pay a small fee — up to 54 cents a mile — to cover gas and vehicle depreciation.The Waze-based program is now opening up to all commuters in the Bay Area. Read More: Army Enlists GM to Develop Hydrogen-Powered Military Truck "Considering that Waze reportedly has more than 50 million users, Google is arguably more knowledgeable — and has more insight — towards driving habits than any other company on the planet," said Kelley Blue Book analyst Michael Harley, who sees the Waze project as "only natural," and just "the tip of this emerging iceberg (in the) rapidly evolving ride-sharing wave." Notably, Google hasn't been charging for the service. (And it doesn't do even the most rudimentary background checks on drivers, a topic that has become quite controversial for Uber and Lyft.) Whether Google will expand to other markets — and see Waze carpooling as a potential revenue source — remains to be seen. But the tech firm is clearly looking at ways to play a role in the rapidly changing transportation industry. Google is already considered one of the leaders in the development of autonomous vehicle systems and recently announced plans to build a pilot fleet of 100 minivans based on the new Chrysler Pacifica model. Google has made it clear that is not a monogamous relationship and is expected to seek out other possible automotive clients for its self-driving technology. But other players in the field could beat it to the punch. Automotive mega-supplier Delphi last week announced plans to partner with Israeli start-up Mobileye to develop autonomous vehicle technology that could be ready for market by 2019. Nissan plans to have its first fully autonomous vehicle in production by 2020. And Ford surprised many observers this month by announcing it would deliver fully driverless vehicles by 2021. Read More: How to Keep Your Car From Becoming a Theft Statistic For many, that's the ultimate goal, eliminating the driver entirely. Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick has outlined that target on numerous occasions, arguing that this would bring the cost of ride-sharing down so low it would make more financial sense than owning a personal vehicle. John Krafcik, the CEO of Google's autonomous vehicle program, has also said the tech firm's goal is to move beyond driver-assistance systems to fully driverless vehicles. Whether it might use its experience with Waze to then expand into the broader car-sharing arena is another unanswered question. What is clear is that any number of other contenders see opportunities in the emerging field. General Motors has invested $500 million in Lyft - and reportedly has expressed interest in buying the company outright. GM also has revived a failed San Francisco start-up, Sidecar. A number of other automakers have invested in ride-sharing services, Volkswagen, for one, purchasing a stake in Israeli-based Gett. Ford CEO Mark Fields has outlined plans to transform his company from a traditional car manufacturer into a provider of broader transportation services. New Car Sales Expected to Slide in August But how soon all this will pay off is far from certain. Ride-sharing giant Uber may be a darling among investors who have already ponied up an estimated $16 billion, but the firm reportedly lost almost $1.3 billion during the first half of this year. Competition holding down fares was a major factor, according to analysts, and with all the new entrants into the field, that's not likely to lighten up anytime soon. Paul A.

During the Farm Progress Show this morning a new initiative was announced to add more support to on-farm conservation programs and practices: The Midwest Row Crop Collaborative. One of the Collaborative’s first actions is to raise $4 million dollars over five years to support Soil Health Partnership (SHP). The initiative was created to support, enhance and accelerate the use of environmentally preferable agricultural practices. The collaboration includes environmental, food and ag companies. Founding members of the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative include: Cargill, the Environmental Defense Fund, General Mills, Kellogg Company, Monsanto, PepsiCo, The Nature Conservancy, Walmart and the World Wildlife Fund. The overarching goal is to help achieve a 45 percent nutrient loss reduction by 2035 across the Upper Mississippi River Basin, in particular nitrogen and phosphorus. “Through healthy soil, farmers can play a major role protecting water quality and the environment—while also optimizing their crop yields and economic returns,” said Nick Goeser, director of the SHP. “We’re honored to welcome the Midwest Row Crop Collaborative to our program. Their support will amplify our research and communications efforts in helping farmers find practices that work best for them.” Speaking is Nick Goeser, Soil Health Partnership. Behind him from left to right: Roger Zylstra, Iowa farmer, Larry Clemens, The Nature Conservancy, Ryan Irsilk, Walmart and Jill Kolling, Cargill. To date, more than 65 farm sites are already enrolled in the SHP program an initiative of the National Corn Growers Association. The new alliance will help SHP achieve the goal of enrolling at least 100 farms over the next two years. According to SHP’s Director, Nick Goeser, this additional support re-iterates their program as a leader in field-scale and measuring of management practices that improve soil health that include: Growing cover crops to prevent erosion and nutrient losses, Implementing conservation tillage like no-till or strip-till, and Using advanced, science-based nutrient management techniques to reduce nutrient loss. Roger Zylstra, a farmer from Lynnvill, Iowa who participates in the SHP program, added, “As a farmer, I am committed to soil health because I know we have to constantly improve how we care for our land and how we farm it. This funding commitment is significant to me because now we have more support from the large food and ag companies as well as environmental groups pushing for change. They’re showing us we don’t have to do it alone.” Midwest Row Crop Collaborative Presser 2016 Farm Progress Show Photos Coverage of the Farm Progress Show is sponsored by Agribusiness, Audio, Farm Progress Show, Soil, Soil Health Partnership 2016 ASTA CSS & Seed Expo Search ZimmCast A weekly podcast sponsored by Amberley Snyder This week I talk with Amberley Snyder, barrel racer.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Saturday January, 7, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Business Company Focus Africa Middle East Europe Americas Asia Global Markets CEO Talks Google to expand carpool service in a potential challenge to Uber By Michael Liedtke ,AP September 1, 2016, 12:04 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is preparing to expand a San Francisco carpooling program in a move that could that could set up a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber and rival Lyft. The plans will build upon a test service that Google's navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn't trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider's work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers' belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber's early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber's board because of potential conflicts with Google's ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond's departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to "continued cooperation and partnership" with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze's carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple's board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google's Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple's iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone's software to create Android.

I blinked and it was suddenly August. Another blink, and August was gone too. As I shared a cocktail last night with a couple friends at Polite Provisions — I love their Tijuana Slowdance — we talked school supplies. “I visited the Chinaberry website last week,” said Bernice, “and I ordered a little booklet full of jokes for the lunchbox. It will make the transition into the school year a little easier for Lori if I sneak a joke into her lunch each day.” Lunch Lines Lunchbox Jokes booklet of 172 jokes is $9.95. “They were also selling fruit-scented gel pens, which she loves,” she added. “Anything to inspire more writing.” A 12-count of Juicy Scented Glitter Gel Pens is $10.95. “I will never quite feel the same about school supplies after watching my cleaning lady rescue a nub of a pencil from our trash can,” said my pal Karen. “She asked if she could have it and added that she would bring it back to her family in Mexico. I felt like such a wasteful First-Worlder.” “Should I return the fruit-scented pens?” asked Bernice, suddenly feeling twangs of guilt. “Oh, heavens, no,” answered Karen. “It just changed my perspective, I notice wastefulness more. So when I went shopping last week, I bought reusable sandwich bags and snack bags. Garnet Hill is selling a two-pack with nice designs. I picked up the horse design for my daughter and the red-and-black checkered for my son. They also are selling snack-sized ones that stand upright, which I also bought.” Garnet Hill Reusable Sandwich Bags are $14.95 for a set of two 7-by-7-inch with Velcro closure. Their Reusable Snack Bags, set of two, run $12.95 for the 3-by-6.5-inch self-standing containers. Colored Marble Composition Notebook, 100-sheet, 50¢ at Walmart. “My favorite school-supply item is the composition notebook,” replied Margaret. “Nothing holds up quite as well.” Colored Marble Composition Notebook, 100-sheet, 50¢ at Walmart. The following morning, I polled some teens. Moms have their favorite school supplies, and kids have their own, I figured. “I’m not particular about anything except my pens,” offered Claire. “I like Uni-ball Signo pens, they’re smooth and you can get different ink widths depending on your preference. Micro 207 is my preference [$2.97 for two at Target].” “I like the colorful designs of the Yoobi products,” offered Maureen. “Yoobi Face Binder Clips are fun; they remind me of the Face cartoon on Nick Junior: one has a mustache, one has teeth, all different faces [Target Yoobi Funny Face Binder Clips, $2.99 for the six-count]. I’m also a fan of cork tape and Washi tape,” she added. “So many uses for it, to mark important dates on my desktop calendar, decorate my binders, I love it. Handmade Modern Cork tape, a variety set of three, is $4.99 at Target. Washi Tape is $2.99 for a roll of 32 feet at Target. “Mechanical pencils are a blessing from heaven as long as you have lead in the right size,” touted Sylvia. “The best pencils are the ones with the twist-up erasers.” Pentel Twist Eraser Automatic Pencil, 0.7mm, are $4.22 each at Walmart. Rolling white-out correction tape is very useful, but everyone will ask to borrow it,” she added. Bic Wite-out Correction Tape is $10.99 for a four-pack at Office Depot. “I like the JanSport backpack,” said Samantha. “Although it’s pricey, it has lasted me a few years. It turned out to be a good investment.” JanSport Superbreak Backpack is $45 at Kohl’s. “I also always buy the 5 Star Notebooks,” she added. The 5 Star Notebook with 2 Pockets is $3 at Office Depot. Isaac was another 5 Star notebook fan. “I like them because they don’t get all beaten up with use,” he replied, “they maintain their shape, which makes it easy to turn more pages and get to the back of your notebook toward the end of the school year [$6.99 each at Office Depot]. “Also, Zebra mechanical pencils. They’re kind of pricey but I love the weight, and the lead doesn’t break as easily.” Zebra Stainless Steel Mechanical Pencils are $3.19 each at Office Depot. “I’ve also found I have endless need for my pocket stapler,” he added. “I always need it to staple assignments at the last minute, or staple tests so I don’t have to wait my turn for the class stapler.” The Stanley Bostitch Pocket Stapler with staples is $3.69 for a set of two at Walmart.

As far as those body shots that felled him in the past? Those days are over, thanks to his bigger "biscuit," a benefit of not cutting an inordinate amount of weight leading up to each fight. Once thing he is cutting, however, is the amount of time he spends sparring inside the gym. "Sparring is all I did, that's what I used to do. I thought that was getting ready for a fight, would just be fucking throwing down," Cerrone said Tuesday on the Joe Rogan Experience (via MMA Fighting). "Now I don't spar at all, and all I do is drill, because drilling is the most important thing you can do. I feel like the little guy at the Wal-Mart check-in, clicking." A new level? "Every time you take a hit to your head, he pushes the button," he continued. "How many people go into Wal-Mart before it's full? I don't know. I have no idea. How many more do I got? How many epic fucking brawls did me and (teammate) Leonard Garcia have in the training room? I don't know." Sounds like he's following in the footsteps of this former World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) rival. "So, like, I'll get in there and move around with Andrei (Arlovski) and move around with all of the heavyweights, but light, MMA sparring. Heavy takedowns and grappling, but real light striking. But the days of putting the big gloves on and throwing down? Hell no." This former UFC champion once stopped sparring for six years. While Cerrone (31-7, 1 NC) is not yet close enough to start asking for a welterweight title shot, there exist a plethora of big-name fights that can help expedite the process. In fact, a UFC 205 showdown featuring this "Ruthless" brawler is currently making the rounds. Hey UFC, make it happen!

I figured anyone who's hiked hundreds of miles across the United States would probably have some useful advice, so I asked five Pacific Crest Trail veterans about the most essentials tools in their packs By: Joe Jackson Aug 31, 2016 Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email These PCT hikers have spent a helluva long time on the trail and have been forced by necessity to dial in their kit. Photo: Joe Jackson By the time Pacific Crest Trail hikers reach Ashland, Oregon (my hometown), they’ve walked either 1,706 miles, if they’re heading north, or 844 miles southbound. Either way, they’ve spent a helluva long time on the trail and have been forced by necessity to dial in their kit. To glean some gear tips from these masters, I chatted with a handful who were hanging out in town (all identified by their trail names). Sketch   Photo: Joe Jackson Trail name origin: “I draw sketches.” Hometown: San Francisco, California Age: 36 Tip: Pete Brook, who’s written about his time on the PCT for Outside, suggests backpacking in cheap shorts. “If you are happy hiking in shorts, it’s the one piece of gear where you don’t really have to get anything high tech. You can go to a thrift store, you can go to Walmart. The only thing I would say is to get a pair with pockets,” says Sketch. As a bonus, they’re relatively cheap and easy to replace. French Fry   Photo: Joe Jackson Trail name origin: “I really, really love french fries, specifically McDonald’s french fries. I am a pretty healthy person, but that is my Achilles heel.” Hometown: Temecula, California Age: 26 Tip: “Get big hipbelt pockets [on your pack],” says French Fry. Why? Because with big pockets, you can store your lunch and eat it on the move, which is important when you’re trying to log a lot of miles. Same goes for your water—hikers suggest using a hydration system or making sure water bottles are accessible with a pack on. Blue Cheese   Photo: Joe Jackson Trail name origin: “It had something to do with the smell of my feet at some point.” Hometown: Cologne, Germany Age: 22 Tip: Start cheap and upgrade as needed. Blue Cheese didn’t want to spend a lot of money on the wrong gear, so she started with what she already had at home and figured out what to invest in while on the trail—there are stores that carry gear along the way. So far, she’s bought a new backpack, a new sleeping bag, and a new tent, all of which meet her specific needs. Vertigo   Photo: Joe Jackson Trail name origin: “I was in Cajon Pass, 300 miles in, and I just woke up one day and stumbled around for three days.” Hometown: Winnipeg, Manitoba Age: 36 Tip: You can spend weeks in the same set of clothing. Proof: Vertigo has gone hundreds of miles in one pair of shorts, one shirt, one pair of underwear, and two pair of socks. He likes wool because it cuts down on the inevitable stink and suggests going for nice kit from brands like Icebreaker because the quality stuff will hold up better to the abuse. Cookie Scrambler   Photo: Joe Jackson Trail name origin: “I had lots of Swiss chocolate cookies at the beginning, and I was giving them to other hikers…I was also scrambling up boulders to get the best pictures, and that’s how I got the scrambler.” Hometown: Zermatt, Switzerland Age: 35 Tip: You don’t have to go ultralight when you’re backpacking or thru-hiking. “I couldn’t afford the ultralight gear. In Europe, to get ultralight gear is very difficult, so I thought I would start off with what I have,” she says. Without water, her pack weighs 45 pounds, but she’s worked up the fitness to keep up with other hikers on the trail.

Photo: Jakob Schiller Over the past few weeks, the Western half of the country has been hit by the winter’s largest storms yet. That means the skiing has been all-time, but the roads have been a mess. I’ve had to stop and help several people dig out of snowbank on the way down from my local ski area near Ashland, Oregon. While shoveling, I started thinking about the list of gear I’d suggest everyone carry in their car to ensure they get themselves—or others—unstuck when things go south. (To prevent things from going wrong in the first place, check out these tips for winter driving. Also, invest in winter tires.) Sorel Caribou Wool Boots ($150)   Photo: Sorel It sucks to dig a car out in tennis shoes. That’s why I carry a pair these classic waterproof boots. They’re high enough to keep the snow from leaking into my socks, lined with a thick felt for warmth, and come with grippy soles that ensures I don’t slip on icy roads. Bonus: they’re not too bulky to drive with. Buy Now Kinco Pigskin Leather Work Gloves ($14)   Photo: Kinco You’ll need a good pair of gloves for shoveling, pushing, and putting something under the tires to help the car regain traction (more on that below). I like Kinco Pigskin gloves because they have a lot of dexterity, can take a beating, and are cheap, so I’m not worried about getting them grimy. You can also ski with these gloves if you use a liner. Buy Now BCA B1 EXT Shovel ($50)   Photo: BCA If you drive a truck and have room, buy a $10 shovel at Home Depot. If you drive a car like me (I have a 2000 Toyota Camry) and don’t want a long shovel taking up room, look at a backcountry shovel, which is collapsible. I like the BCA B1 EXT, which is a manageable 22 inches when not in use. Once you start shoveling, the handle extends for better leverage, and the durable aluminum head bites through deep, dense snow. Buy Now Cat Litter ($5)   Photo: Arm & Hammer Throwing cat litter under your tires can help them find purchase in slippery snow or on ice, allowing you to inch out of wherever you’re stuck. If you run out of cat litter, you can accomplish the same thing by simply sticking your floor mats under your tires. Buy Now ARB Snatch Strap ($65)   Photo: ARB Recovery If digging won’t work, pulling a car out is also an option with a dependable strap like this from ARB. But a word of warning: know how to properly use this strap before you try it on a slippery mountain road. There are certain rules you have to follow—like only attaching the strap to designated tow points—to ensure everyone stays safe. Buy Now LED Safety Flare Kit ($25)   Photo: Electriduct Drivers rarely get stuck in convenient or safe places. To ensure another car doesn’t plow into you, place these reusable LED flares up the road to warn drivers. They’re visible from up to 3,000 feet away and can be set so they put out a solid or blinking light.   Buy Now Stanley Adventure Stainless Steel Vacuum Bottle 1.4 Quart ($35)   Photo: Stanley If you fill a thermos like this with coffee or hot chocolate and keep it in your car on ski days, you’ll be glad to have it for the drive down. Plus, you can also share with whoever you stop to dig out. It’s uncomfortable and embarrassing to be stuck in the snow, and some piping hot coffee or cocoa can make things a lot better.

Skis aren't the only way you can exploit gravity and snow By: Joe Jackson Jan 4, 2017 Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email Photo: Getty Images/ Imgorthand This may sound ironic coming from someone who regularly writes about expensive outdoor gear, but you do not need to spend thousands of dollars to enjoy the simple pleasures that gravity and snow can deliver. Before I became Outside's Gear Guy, with fancy carbon skis and a lightweight Gore-Tex shell, I had plastic sleds and a pair of Kmart Moonboots and had just as much fun. Here's a breakdown of the four basic sleds you can get your hands on for under $40.  Cafeteria Lunch Tray ($0) Best For: Closing down the bar.   Pros: Free Cons: The complete lack of a curved bottom bogs the front down in soft snow. No handles means you're left gripping the corners, which can lead to serious finger injuries. Maneuvering it requires great skill and body control. Tips: Start with liquid courage and plan to go straight-ish. If you are on anything but hardpack or ice, lean back. If available, lubricate the bottom with Pam Cooking Spray. Return the lunch tray after use for a cleaner conscience. Car Tire Inner Tube (From $6 to $30)  Best For: Sending it.  Pros: While it lacks handles and is more unwieldy than its slimmer, snow-specific cousin (the saucer), the inner tube has one big thing going for it: a few inches of cush separating your tailbone from the hard, frozen ground. The bottom is slightly rockered, making it the best craft on this list for powder. And it deflates and packs down well for easy off-season storage. Cons: The lack of straight surfaces makes tracking in a straight line difficult. The absence of handles makes it nearly impossible to stay connected to your tube when airborne.  Tips: If you are planning to send it in an inner tube, make sure to position yourself with as much padding as possible. Don’t plan to travel in a straight line.  Buy Now Saucer (From $10 to $30) Best For: Controlled chaos.   Pros: Shane McConkey venerated the saucer for good reason: it delivers the perfect mix of body control with lack of directional control, leading to wild, Kodak-moment-filled rides.  Cons: The lack of straight, tracking edges makes it impossible to hold a line in the snow. The sunken middle of the saucer provides no coccyx protection.  Tips: Look for pre-set tracks in snow if you want to maintain a straight line. Start out riding switch—or actively rotating—for style points and a better ride. Buy Now Plastic Toboggan (From $10 to $40) Best For: Channeling your inner Olympian.  Pros: The most capable sled on our list, the toboggan's upturned nose allows it to navigate through deep snow, while the edges along the bottom help it hold a line. Handles help you maneuver around obstacles. Cons: On hardpack or ice, these sleds can get going extremely fast. They don’t have any type of built-in brake.  Tips: Have a braking plan and check your trajectory for obstacles. I melted both the heels off my favorite pair of boots in high school trying to regain control of my sled after going way too fast on an icy, 150-yard run. I stopped mere feet from the bumper of a truck that would have re-structured my face had I not sacrificed those sweet, sweet boots.

Hit the road with this essential winter road-trip gear. By: Joe Jackson Dec 27, 2016 Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email Get ready for a winter adventure. Photo: Georgijevic/iStock Winter road trips tend to be more exciting than their warm-weather counterparts: you never know when you’ll white-knuckle it through a big blizzard. At times like those, it helps to be prepared, which is where this list comes in. Falken Espia EPZ II Winter Tires (Starting at $60 Per Tire)   Photo: Falken Even if you own a four-wheel-drive vehicle, you should have a good set of winter tires for driving in the snow. These are some of the best, thanks to the aggressive siping and special rubber that stays soft in the cold. Buy Now Maxtrax MKII ($300)   Photo: Maxtrax If your car gets stuck in the snow, use these to get out. Place this pair of plastic boards with raised plastic teeth under your tires and drive forward slowly, repeating the process until you’re off the icy patch or out of the snowbank. Buy Now G3 Avitech Shovel ($70)   Photo: G3 If you backcountry ski, you should already have a sturdy, telescoping aluminum shovel like the Avitech from G3. When you’re not skiing, it should live in your car with a set of Maxtrax (above) for the simplest way to extricate your vehicle when you get stuck in the snow. I used this shovel last week to help dig a buddy out of a three-foot snowdrift. Buy Now Rumpl Down Puffy Blanket ($200)   Photo: Rumpl If you get stuck and need to wait for rescue, stay warm with this plush 600-fill blanket. Or bring it into the place where you’re staying and use it while cozying up by the fire. Buy Now MSR Revo Explore Snowshoes ($200)   Photo: MSR Just because it’s snowy doesn’t mean you can’t get out of your car and explore. Wherever you go, find some local trails and take a walk. You’ll likely have the trail to yourself, and the cold weather makes a post-walk hot chocolate taste amazing. I like the MSR Revo Explore because the hearty injection-molded plastic deck can take a beating, and the no-pinch binding is comfortable for long hikes. Buy Now Local Hot Springs Guide ($15)   Photo: Falcon Guides Have you ever seen those photos of Japanese monkeys hanging out in the hot springs while it’s snowing? They have the right idea. Most bookstores carry guides to the local hot pools. I suggest finding a spring that’s off the road so you can use your snowshoes and get away from the crowds. The hot water also feels best after a cold hike. Buy Now Skratch Labs Apples and Cinnamon Exercise Hydration Mix ($20)   Photo: Skratch Labs Hot hydration mix? Yeah, it’s actually delicious. Pack a Jetboil Sumo, heat up some water, and then add this tasty mix with a nip of your favorite whiskey. I like to drink this out of a Miir Camp Cup because the double-wall vacuum-insulated construction keeps everything hot. Buy Now Tepui Autana Sky Rooftop Tent ($1,800)   Photo: Tepui Want to score freshies at whatever resort you’re visiting? Sleep in the parking lot. This tent sets up in minutes and shrugs off snow. It’s also supercomfortable, thanks to a built-in three-inch foam mattress. To make sure you stay warm, bring along a zero-degree sleeping bag like the Nemo Sonic 0 Long. Buy Now Spotify Premium Subscription ($10 Per Month)   Photo: Spotify A well-curated driving playlist is just as important in December as it is in July. The premium account lets you download songs onto your phone for offline listening. If you needs suggestions, check out the Outside staff’s ski hill playlist.

Photo: Voormi I’ve tested hundreds of products over the past 11 months, many of which were really, really good. But only a handful stood out as the year’s best, either because they totally rethought a category or because their design made them significantly better than the competition. What follows are eight products that I think defined innovation in 2016. Voormi FallLine Jacket ($400)   Photo: Voormi Instead of sandwiching a waterproof membrane between two sheets of synthetic material, like most high-end three-layer winter shells, the FallLine features Voormi’s Core Construction technology, which weaves wool through the waterproof membrane. The result? You get an outer layer that shrugs off snow but also breathes exceptionally well thanks to the wool, making it ideal for high-output winter activities. The wool is also softer than most synthetic materials, which helps the FallLine feel more like a sweater and less like a jacket. Buy Now Arc’teryx Procline Carbon Ski Mountaineering Boot ($1,000)   Photo: Arc'teryx The Procline boots offer a huge 75 degrees of flex in walk mode, but they also have a 35-degree side-to-side range of motion. That side-to-side movement helps you stay planted over your skis when your’re on a steep, sloping skin track. It also helps if you want to strap on crampons for a technical ascent on rock or ice (with the side-to-side motion, these feel more like mountaineering boots and less like a pair of race boots). Don’t buy the Proclines if you want to drive big powder sticks. Do invest in them if you want to climb and ski all of Colorado’s 14ers.  Buy Now Patagonia Yulex Wetsuits (Starting at $170)   Photo: Patagonia This is the world’s first neoprene-free wetsuit. Neoprene is derived from fossil fuels. Yulex, on the other hand, is made from rubber harvested from Hevea trees on a Rainforest Alliance–certified plantation in Guatemala. The suits are then built in factories that run off solar power. Those two updates reduce Patagonia’s wetsuit-production carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 percent.  Buy Now Bose QuietComfort 35 Wireless Headphones ($350)   Photo: Bose Bose did three important things with these headphones. First, their noise-canceling technology is the best out there. The headphones eliminate any ambient sounds but also cut out the low hum that noise-canceling technology sometimes leaves behind. Second, the speakers inside are top-notch, with crisp highs and thumping lows. Finally, the wireless application is seamless. They immediately connect to my phone and have 20 hours of battery life. No other piece of gear has changed my productivity like these headphones. They allow me be completely zoned in and distraction-free while I write, either at home or at the local coffee shop. Buy Now Apple iPhone 7 Plus ($770)   Photo: Apple The new iPhone makes my list because there’s no better camera for adventurers who want to travel fast and light. The 12-megapixel sensor produces sharp images with rich colors that look stunning online and make great prints. The phone can shoot in RAW, which means you get larger images that are easier to tone and crop. And then there are the two lenses: the standard 28-millimeter with a fast f1.8 aperture, which works well for landscapes and in low light, and the 56-millimeter, which you want to use for portraits. I also suggest using the portrait mode, which blurs out the background. Finally, the phone is highly water resistant, so you don’t have to worry if you drop it in the snow while skiing. Buy Now Hoka Speed Instinct Trail Running Shoes ($130)   Photo: Hoka With the Speed Instinct, Hoka moved away from the ultracushioned design that made it a running-shoe powerhouse. These shoes have a relatively neutral three-millimeter heel-to-toe drop but still carry over many of Hoka’s other standout features, like a feathery light build (8.4 ounces for the pair), an extremely breathable upper, a cushy heel, and denser forefoot. Like the best running shoes, they felt great and kept my feet happy and protected. Buy Now MSR Guardian Purifier ($350)   Photo: MSR If you’re backpacking in the United States, you only need a purifier that removes bacteria and protozoa. But if you’re traveling overseas to a place where viruses in the water are a problem, you want the Guardian. It eliminates all three of these bugs and is the surest way to stay healthy without drinking terrible-tasting water. Bonus: the Guardian is self-cleaning, ensuring you get at least 10,000 liters of clean water before it needs to be replaced. Buy Now Dagger Nomad Kayak ($1,200)   Photo: Dagger I’m a kayak geek, so this made my list. Why? Because after 12 years of using the same ultrapredictable, secure design, Dagger decided it was time to make the Nomad edgier and more fun. I was skeptical of the update, but after a full spring and summer in the boat, I agree that it’s a much better design. What you get is the same predictability with more maneuverability and speed.

Photo: Stan Moniz Photography It’s easy to get caught up in holiday consumerism and forget that this is also a time to support causes we believe in. While you’re shopping, consider spending your money at companies like the ones below that donate part of their profits to programs that protect our national parks, reduce our carbon footprint, or get young people outside. Zeal Last year, this Boulder-based optics company worked with conservation nonprofit American Forests to plant a tree in the Colorado backcountry for every pair of goggles or accessory lenses it sold online during December. Zeal ended up planting more than a thousand trees and is bringing the program back this year. In addition to the holiday event, the company commits to planting 5,480 trees—a number inspired by the elevation of its headquarters—throughout the rest of the year. Pure Cycles Pure partnered with People for Bikes to build a limited-edition $400 commuter model. From every sale, $100 helps the nonprofit fund its programs. Even better for the buyer: each simple, gorgeous single speed comes with a lifetime warranty on the frame. Royal Robbins During the holidays, Royal Robbins is donating 20 percent of all the proceeds from its Men’s Heritage Graphic T-shirts, designed in collaboration with the Landmark Project, to the Yosemite Conservancy. That organization provides grants to Yosemite National Park for projects like trail building and wildlife restoration. Bogs This maker of bomber snow and mud boots recently launched a program where 2 percent of all online sales go to a wide variety of outdoor education programs. So far, the company has funded programs including the Chicago Botanic Gardens Youth Farm, which teaches young people about growing and harvesting food, and the Hazelwood Kindergarten in Eugene, Oregon, which builds nature time into its students’ curriculum. Patagonia You might have seen that Patagonia, well known for its environmental mission, is donating all of the $10 million it earned on Black Friday to a host of environmental nonprofits over the course of the next six to 18 months. If you didn’t make your Patagonia purchases that day, don’t fret. You can still feel good about supporting the brand, because it will continue to be part of 1% for the Planet, an international organization of brands in which all members donate 1 percent of their profits to fund global environmental initiatives.

Photo: Stanley A lot of outdoor gear is prohibitively expensive, but plenty of pieces are totally useful and absolutely affordable. I’ve rounded up 20 of my favorites that won’t break the bank but will make great Christmas or Hanukkah gifts. Victorinox Swiss Army Classic SD Pocket Knife ($17)   Photo: Victorinox This knife packs a blade, file, scissors, and four other functions into a tiny package that you’ll barely notice in your pocket. Plus, part of the proceeds go to support the Wounded Warrior Project, a nonprofit that helps injured service members. Buy Now Traditional Mexican Blanket ($16)   Photo: Yoga Accessories Yoga mat, picnic blanket, seat cover—the uses are endless for what I refer to as the original adventure blanket. It’s also durable and easy to wash. Buy Now Balega Hidden Comfort Running Socks ($8) Digital Xposure Photography www.dxphoto.co.za   Photo: Balega Socks are a cliché holiday gift, but any runner on your list will love these things. The synthetic build as good as it gets for moving moisture off your feet and ensuring that your dogs stay blister-free. Buy Now Nalgene Tritan Wide-Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle (Starting at $3.50)   Photo: Nalgene The Nalgene one-liter wide-mouth water bottle might be the most iconic piece of gear ever made. Everyone loves them because they’re durable, light, and fit perfectly in almost any backpack side pocket. Buy Now HotHands Hand and Toe Warmers ($5)   Photo: HotHands I tested hand warmers last winter, and these are the best. Every skier needs them in their bag or pocket for those bitterly cold days when gloves aren’t enough. Buy Now LuxFit Premium High-Density Foam Roller ($9)   Photo: LuxFit If you’ve never foam-rolled your legs after a long day of hiking, running, or skiing, you’re missing out. The rolling hurts at first, but it helps your muscles stay loose and feel less sore. Buy Now Stanley Classic One-Hand Vacuum Mug ($17)   Photo: Stanley I tested travel mugs head-to-head last year, and this double-walled vacuum-insulated classic took home the top prize. It also looks great thanks to the old-school styling. Buy Now Polar Insulated 24-Ounce Water Bottle ($8)   Photo: Polar Bottle The wide mouth on this cycling bottle fits ice cubes, and the insulation keeps the cold inside, so you never have lukewarm water on your ride. Buy Now Coleman 5-Gallon Water Carrier ($9)   Photo: Coleman With five gallons of water in your car, you can camp pretty much anywhere you want for at least a couple days. Buy Now KT Tape Pro Elastic Kinesiology Therapeutic Tape ($15)   Photo: KT Tape KT Tape allowed me to kayak for an entire season with a sore shoulder and has also prevented nipple chafe. Read up and you’ll see it can also help prevent injuries and improve strength. Buy Now Yaktrax Walk Traction Cleats ($14)   Photo: YakTrax These cleats wrap around the bottom of most shoes or boots and add loads of traction in the snow or on ice. I used them to hike out of the Grand Canyon in January and watched as everyone else slipped endlessly. Buy Now Body Glide Original Anti-Chafe Balm 1.5 Ounce ($10)   Photo: Bodyglide Every runner should have one of these little roll-on sticks. Apply it to your thighs, nipples, and any other body part that might get rubbed raw from your clothing. Buy Now SOG Key Folding Knife Key-101 1.5-Inch Blade ($6)   Photo: SOG The knife enthusiasts in your life will appreciate this clever design. Even if they forget their everyday carry blade, they’ll still have a way to open boxes as long as this knife (which folds into a key-like handle) is on their chain. Buy Now Therm-a-Rest Compressible Pillow ($12)   Photo: Therm-A-Rest You need a proper pillow when car camping. A puffy inside a stuff sack doesn’t cut it. Therm-a-Rest’s version is slightly skinnier but just as long as your pillow at home and compresses better for traveling. Buy Now Massage Ball ($9)   Photo: Master of Muscle This spiky little ball has been essential for curing my nagging plantar fasciitis. Even if the runners on your list don’t currently have that malady, they should still roll out their arches and heels just in case. Buy Now UCO Stormproof Match Kit ($8)   Photo: UCO I tested fire starter tools, and these matches came in second for ease of use. They’ll ignite even when totally wet and burn for 20 seconds. Buy Now Gear Aid Tenacious Tape for Fabric Repair ($4.50)   Photo: Gear Aid Duct tape does the job, but Tenacious Tape is better for tent, backpack, and jacket repairs because the adhesive is stronger and the tape is more durable.

Photo: Mountain Hardwear I love to play in the snow, but dealing with all the necessary gear can be a huge hassle. That’s why I’ve dedicated lots of time to dialing in the perfect layering system that’s versatile enough to keep me warm in the most frigid conditions but also breathable enough for the skin track. Here’s what I wear. Next to Skin Socks   Photo: Darn Tough If you ski, you’ll need a thin, ski-specific sock like these from Fits. But for winter hikes, building snowmen, and shoveling the driveway, I recommend a thick, cushioned merino sock like the Darn Tough Mountaineering Over the Calf, which I like because they add lots of warmth and don’t squeeze my foot or calf, and the fabric fights stink. They’re pricey at $27, but the company backs them up with a lifetime warranty. Base Layer (Bottom)   Photo: Patagonia I’ve tested hundreds of base layers for Outside’s Buyer’s Guide but always find myself going back to Patagonia’s Capilene Lightweight tights. The recycled polyester wicks moisture almost immediately, they provide plenty of warmth under my ski pants when temps are above zero, and, thanks to a Polygiene silver treatment, they don’t stink until the fifth straight use. Base Layer (Top)   Photo: NW Alpine The NW Alpine Black Spider Hoody, made in Oregon, is beautifully simple and built with Polartec High Efficiency Power Dry fabric, which is about as good as it gets when you’re talking moisture management. You sweat, and the fabric makes it disappear. I also like the balaclava hood, which I can pull up when a regular beanie isn’t cutting it. Hat   Photo: Coal Headwear I like a subdued beanie like Coal’s Scout. There’s no pom-pom on top or any fancy tech inside. Made from synthetic materials, it’s warm enough to ski in and doesn’t look goofy at the bar. Buff   Photo: Buff USA I keep two of these buffs in my jacket at all times, just in case a friend needs one. I like to pull it below my chin and over my ears, and I wear it under a trucker hat on the skin track and under my helmet for the descent. It’s also great for sun protection. Outer Layers Midlayer   Photo: Mountain Hardwear My favorite midlayer is Mountain Hardwear Men’s Monkey Man. The hairlike Polartec High Loft fabric doesn’t add a lot of weight—the entire jacket weighs just 14 ounces—but traps lots of heat. The fabric wicks moisture once you start moving. Shell   Photo: Columbia I run hot, so I use a shell to stay dry only when the weather is puking or when it’s windy and the chilly air is cutting through my midlayer. You can spend a month’s rent on a high-end shell that you would use for mountaineering or backcountry skiing, but for general winter use, you can get away with something like Columbia’s Watertight II Jacket, which is waterproof and breathable but costs less than $100. Puffy   Photo: Marmot On the coldest days or when you’re not in constant motion, you’ll need a down jacket like Marmot’s Guides Down Hoody. The 700-fill down is plenty for most of us. I also like that the down has a hydrophobic treatment, meaning it’s water resistant and won’t wet out immediately. Boots   Photo: Sorel Don’t be the guy wearing tennis shoes while trying to get his car out of a snowbank. Invest in a good pair of winter boots like Sorel’s 1964 Premium Wool. You’ll understand why you need winter footwear the first time you wear these heavily insulated, waterproof, good-looking boots. Gloves   Photo: Give'r There’s no better all-around winter glove than the Four Season Give’r. The leather is tough as shit and great for chopping wood. They’re soft and pliable, so you retain lots of dexterity for things like putting on chains. They’re also insulated, so you can use them skiing.

Photo: Jason Thompson Full disclosure: I’ve been a gaper. I’ve committed every faux pas in the book. (Just watch this video and look at how I’m wearing my helmet.) Personally, I hate that skiing has so many cultural rules about how we’re supposed to act and look, but it turns out that some of these rules have value beyond public shaming. To help you better understand ski hill etiquette, either official or unofficial, here are some basic commandments to live by. Don’t Suffer Gaper Gap Gaper gap is the space between the top of your goggles and the bottom of your helmet. If you have forehead showing at all, that’s gaper gap. People get teased because it looks weird, but it’s also an indication that you’re not wearing your helmet correctly. More than likely, it’s too loose and riding back on your head, which is bad news if you take a tumble. The best way to combat any gap is to buy your goggles and helmet at the same time in a ski shop. Make sure the helmet fits properly, and then make sure the goggles fit under the rim. Carry Your Skis Correctly You can carry your skis however you want, but here’s my suggestion: watch this video, and then start using “the local” method, where one front binding rests against your shoulder blade while you hold onto both tips with one arm. Why do I like this method over the others? Because it’s the most efficient way to haul your boards. Your arm can rest on the tips and serve as a counterweight to the back of the skis, so there’s less stress on your body. It also frees up your other hand to carry your poles or boots. Tip: Do not use this method indoors or in a crowded area—it’s easy to whack the people behind you. Don’t Ski for Instagram. Ski for You. If you want to commemorate your day on the mountain with some action-cam footage or a slo-mo pow slash for your Insta feed, I say go for it. Just don’t obsess over the shot. It sucks for your ski partners if they constantly have to stop instead of sending it from top to bottom. And it sucks for you if you can’t enjoy the moment because you’re worried about social media. Note: Parents get a pass on this one. Go ahead and shoot as many cute photos of your little ripper as you want. Be Prepared (Don’t Ski in Jeans) I recognize how elitist it sounds to expect that everyone has nice ski gear. I also get that skiing in jeans looks cool and actually works on costume day in the spring. But for the rest of the season, it’s a bad idea to shred in your Wranglers. Ski hills are frigid and wet, and cotton is your enemy in those conditions. It holds onto the moisture and makes you colder. Jeans don’t cover your ski boots, either, which means snow can pour in. Stay in Control Jerry is another word for gaper, and all those Jerry of the Day videos are full of wrecks because the people in them are out of control. Skiing wildly, folks, is the quickest and easiest way to get labeled a gaper. You’re endangering yourself and others. Keep the throttle at a manageable speed, and don’t pick terrain you can’t handle. Pro tip: Remember to keep your turns tight on a powder day. Don’t destroy the entire run.

Lofoten is a Norwegian archipelago above the Arctic Circle.   Photo: Brody Leven Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email The iPhone is a great camera for ski season as it's light and portable. To help you win Instagram all winter, I asked a group of pro skiers and photographers for their top tips and tricks on making the snow look pretty.  Use Burst Mode Press and hold the iPhone’s shutter button, and the camera shoots a series of sequential photos, just like a DSLR shooting multiple frames per second. Pro skier Sierra Quitiquit relies on this feature because it’s the best way to capture fast-moving action. Afterward, go in and pick the best photos from the bunch. Tip: Quitiquit has her subjects wear bright colors, which makes them pop against the snow. Always Bring an Extra Battery Pro photographer Christian Pondella always brings extra batteries for his DSLR. Anyone shooting with an iPhone should carry a portable charger, especially if you’ll be in the backcountry all day. I like the Enerplex Jumpr Mini L because it’s slimmer than a pack of gum and only a few inches wide. And keep your phone in airplane mode to extend the battery life. Keep Your iPhone and Portable Charger Warm Most of you have probably witnessed your iPhone go dead because the battery got too cold. Pro skier Lexi DuPont keeps this from happening by always storing her iPhone in her midlayer chest pocket. Unlike a hard shell, she keeps her midlayer on and her body heat keeps the battery warm, too. Keep the phone in your pocket until you're ready to capture the image, then immediately throw it back in your jacket again.  Get a DXO One Camera Attachment Pro skier Cody Townsend swears by the small DXO One camera ($500), which slots into the charging plug of his iPhone and is controlled by the phone’s touchscreen. He prefers the DXO over the iPhone camera because it has a much bigger sensor for higher resolution photos, a better dynamic range for bright- and low-light conditions, and shoots in RAW. Learn How to Use Third-Party Attachment Lenses Pro skier Brody Leven always brings a wide-angle 18-millimeter iPhone Moment Lens that attaches to the phone and allows him to capture a wider field of view. Each lens is made from high-quality glass, so it shoots crisper photos with more detail.  Clean Your Lenses Carefully Pro photographer Liam Doran says snow can scratch the lenses if you try to wipe it off with your sleeve. Instead, he breathes on the snow to turn it to water, then uses a soft cloth to dry it.  Filed To: Skiing, Photography Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email 8 Rules for Scoring the Best Ski Swap Deals These preseason events can be overwhelming. Here are some simple suggestions for how to get what you need. By: Joe Jackson Nov 17, 2016 Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email How to make the most of your local swap. Photo: Nathan Morgan Ski swaps are great for scoring affordable gear before the season starts, but you need a game plan to successfully negotiate the scrum. For tips and tricks, I interviewed Jesse Hunt, director of Park City Ski Team, who puts on a giant swap in Park City with up to 50,000 pieces of gear. I also called up my friend Ryan Pyles, who’s been ski bumming for years and has mastered the art of finding deals. Here’s what they said. Pinpoint What You Want Beforehand Don't go into a swap with your heart set on a specific model of boot, ski, or binding: you get to choose only from what shows up. But you can be scrupulous about size, brand, and type. Before going in, decide whether you want an inbounds setup, a touring setup, or one that does both. (If you want either of the latter, you’ll probably have to buy new skins.) You should also have an idea of how stiff you want your boot. Do you need a 130 flex or just 100? Figure out your boot size and know which brands work best for your foot by trying some on at a local ski shop or your friends’ houses beforehand. The same goes for skis. Demo a few pairs to get an idea of what kind you want (frontside, all mountain, etc.) and the length range that works for your size, weight, and skiing ability. Ask a Friend for Help Even if you know what you’re looking for, swaps can still be overwhelming. The first time I hit a swap, I bribed Pyles with coffee and a six-pack for his help. He helped me narrow down the exact ski I needed after I gave him some general parameters. Pyles also helped me assess the condition of the ski, so I knew what kinds of dings mattered and which were just cosmetic. Tip: Avoid skis with severely damaged edges and top sheets that are delaminating. Scuffed top sheets and minor scratches on the bottom, however, are no big deal. Show Up Early Most swaps happen on weekends, and some, including the one Hunt runs, let you in on Friday night if you pay a little extra. If that’s not an option, plan on getting up early on Saturday so you’re among the first in line. The best gear goes first, and it goes fast. The best deals are worth the lost sleep or extra $20. If You Don’t Need the Best Gear, It’s OK to Show Up Late If you just need a basic setup—say, for a beginner—you can take your time and show up after breakfast on Saturday. Swaps like the one Hunt runs have plenty of middle-tier gear that sticks around all day. Showing up later also helps with the crowds. Expect the swap to be busy but not a total nightmare. Don’t Socialize Just as there are no friends on a powder day, there are no friends at a ski swap. Once you’re in the door, stay focused. You know what you’re looking for, so go find it. You didn’t lose sleep so you can talk to your friends. You lost sleep to find a pair of skis and boots at a killer value. Be Greedy Pyles says if you can’t decide between two or three pairs of boots, grab them all, find a corner, and try them on. Same goes for skis: If two or three pairs might work, grab them, find a corner, and look them over—or ask your swap buddy to help you decide. This feels like a jerk move, but everyone does it, and it gives you time to think over your purchase. If you don’t grab everything, those other pairs will be gone once you’re done assessing your first pick. Set a Price Range, but Be Flexible Before you head into the swap, do some research. Look on the internet to find out what your ideal setup costs new. Then see if you can find it used. Also ask your ski buddies what they would expect to pay. (I try to find deals at the swap that are at least 50 percent off the initial sticker price.) Then, once you’re inside, be a little flexible. I’ve found that if I’m willing to pay $100 more than my initial budget, I can walk away with what I wanted and still feel like I got a deal. Never Buy a Used Helmet. Do Buy Used Kit. Some used helmets look like they’re in perfect shape but still might be compromised. Always buy new when it comes to head protection. When you’re shopping for ski jackets and pants, however, just make sure the zippers work, that they’re hole-free, and that they aren’t discolored, which is a sign of heavy use and signals they probably won’t keep you dry.

Photo: Kota Longboards For Veterans Day, which is on Friday this year, I want to highlight outdoor gear companies that are owned or run by U.S. veterans. Not only do these brands make bomber products, but they also work to get former soldiers good jobs when they return to civilian life.  Liberty Bottleworks   Photo: Liberty Bottleworks This Yakima, Washington–based company makes durable recycled-aluminum water bottles and gives hiring preference to veterans, calling the practice “ethical discrimination.” The result? More than a third of its workforce served in the armed forces. Combat Flip Flops   Photo: Combat Flip Flops Founders Matthew Griffin and Donald Lee both served as Army Rangers. Combined, they have been on seven tours in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now they’re using their business to help war-torn countries. The company makes its sandals in Colombia to support the local economy, employs Afghan women to make sarongs (a chunk of those profits go to women’s schools in that country), and sells bracelets from Laos that help fund the cleanup of unexploded bombs.  GoRuck   Photo: GoRuck GoRuck, based in Jacksonville, Florida, builds military-inspired rucksacks, employs veterans, and donates some of its profits to veterans’ organizations such as Team Red, White, and Blue and the Green Beret Foundation. The company also puts on events, including local “rucking” hike meetups and War Stories gatherings, where veterans can connect and share experiences.  Kota Longboards   Photo: Kota Longboards Kota Longboards, like GoRuck, employs veterans and supports a host of veterans’ organizations, such as the Navy SEAL Foundation and the Wounded Warrior Project. The company, based in Denver, Colorado, uses military designs on its boards. It’s also in the process of forming its own nonprofit, called Carve It for Life, that will use longboarding as a form of healing for veterans and first responders with post-traumatic stress disorder.  Sword and Plough   Photo: Sword and Plough Run by two sisters who grew up in a military family, Sword and Plough takes old military surplus gear and repurposes it into fashionable bags. Veterans are employed in every part of the business—as designers, sewers, models, and more. Ten percent of all profits go to help veterans’ organizations. Ranger Coffee   Photo: Ranger Coffee Ranger Coffee is a veteran-owned coffee company that donates a full 50 percent of its profits to nonprofits that help former soldiers. The coffee’s good, too.

Photo: EMS Outdoor gear is expensive. It’s even more expensive if you’re buying a name-brand product from someone like The North Face, Patagonia, or Canada Goose. While those companies all make great stuff, you can find generic gear at outlets like REI and even Walmart for much cheaper. But I always wonder: Am I sacrificing performance by not buying from one of those big, well-respected manufacturers? This article aims to answer that question. Over the years, I’ve stumbled onto a few great buys from off-label brands, all listed below. Some things are worth spending a lot of money on from the outdoor world’s most widely recognized companies. These six products don’t fall into that category. Kirkland Signature Men’s Trail Socks ($12 for 4 pairs)   Photo: Kirkland I have a lot of Darn Tough and Fits socks in my drawer, but I also have several pairs of Kirkland socks from Costco that were gifted to me years ago. They’re 70 percent merino, 30 percent nylon and spandex, and so thick that they’re ideal for shoveling or hanging out in the snow. I’ve washed them dozens of times, and they still show no sign of wear. Buy Now EMS Men’s Thunderhead Jacket ($80)   Photo: EMS For $80, you get a 2.5-layer waterproof-breathable jacket with some nice touches, like pit zips and a well-tailored fit. Buy one and keep it in your car in case you unexpectedly get stuck in a blizzard. Buy Now Ozark Trail Folding Chair ($7)   Photo: Ozark Trail No, I wouldn’t take any of Walmart’s Ozark Trail gear on a fast-and-light mission, but the products are ideal for car camping. Case in point: this basic folding chair. I kept one of these in my truck for years. It survived dozens of campouts and backyard barbecues. Buy Now Cabela’s Alaskan Guide X-White Headlamp ($30)   Photo: Cabela's I like this 78-lumen headlamp because it uses AA batteries, so I can carry extras and not worry about running out of juice in the backcountry. Branded by Cabela’s but actually built by Princeton Tec, it’s waterproof and runs for 90 hours. Buy Now Trader Joe’s Kentucky Bourbon ($15)   Photo: Trader Joe's You can’t go wrong with this bourbon, which is distilled and bottled by Buffalo Trace. It’s a good bottle of liquor at a fair price and won’t give you gut rot the next day. Target Market Pantry Knapsack Trail Mix ($8)   Photo: Market Pantry I’m picky about most of my camp food, but I’ll scarf down pretty much any trail mix. And $8 for 42 ounces is a screaming caloric deal. One of these bags kept my friend and me from getting hangry during a six-day road and kayaking trip across British Columbia.

Photo: Nathan Morgan Many of us have garages stuffed with old gear—kit we love but don’t use anymore. It’s time to let go. You need the extra space, and there are a lot of other people who can put that dusty gear to good use. Before you start cleaning house, check out these five donation sites that will ensure your equipment finds a proper new home.  Gear for the Homeless Box and ship old gear to this nonprofit based in Fort Collins, Colorado, which has distributed more than $6 million worth of products to people across the country to help them stay warm and dry. In particular, Gear for the Homeless needs sleeping bags, sleeping pads, tents, backpacks, daypacks, coats, footwear, and blankets. Your Local Outdoor Education Program I believe in the mission to get young people outside, so I donate lots of gear (camp stoves, base layers, water bottles) to Feather River College’s Outdoor Recreation Leadership Program. Google “outdoor education program,” and you’ll likely find one nearby. DSUSA Chapters Disabled Sports USA, a Maryland-based nonprofit with chapters all over the country, organizes activities for people with disabilities. After touring its headquarters and volunteering at its Mount Shasta chapter, I can vouch for DSUSA’s life-changing programs. Different chapters have different needs, so reach out and ask before you send anything. Right now they'll likely need ski gear such as jackets and warm gloves. Free Bikes 4 Kidz I spoke with MiiR founder Bryan Pape about where to donate bikes. (The Seattle-based gear company donates 5 percent of its revenue to projects like local bike co-ops.) If you live in or near Atlanta, Minneapolis, or Salt Lake City, you can donate to Free Bikes 4 Kidz, which has given 32,000 bikes to children in need over the past eight years. If you don’t live in those cities, Pape says you can usually find a local nonprofit that fixes up used bikes and gives them to people in need.   Sponsor a Dirtbag When I was younger and working as a river guide, I constantly used worn-out, low-end gear. It was like Christmas whenever someone gave me a used piece of gear: it was a way for them to clean out and an upgrade for me. Now I’m the one passing forward gear that I’ve tested to people who want to get outside but can’t afford new stuff.

Seven affordable items you should always have packed and ready to go. Just in case. By: Joe Jackson Nov 1, 2016 Share This Facebook Icon Share Twitter Icon Tweet Pinterest Icon Pinterest SMS Text Email Icon Email Be prepared. Photo: da-kuk Lots of people call emergency survival kits “bug-out bags,” which is a military reference to getting out of somewhere fast. They’re popular with preppers, but even the federal government recommends that everybody should pack one in case of natural or human-caused disaster. It’s also handy to have one in the back of your car if you get stuck or end up spending the night somewhere unexpected. The supplies in the bag are intended to help keep you safe and alive for 72 hours. I’ve written about bug-out bags before, but I wanted to try building one for less than $100. To find out if that’s possible, I called Mark Puhaly and Joel Stevens*, the founders of the website Survival Cache who were featured on National Geographic’s Apocalypse 101 television show. Here are their top suggestions. Backpack ($10): Stevens likes ALICE (an acronym for All-Purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment) backpacks, which you can usually find at a local surplus store. They’re easy to find, durable, and big. “This was the backpack of choice pretty much throughout the ’80s and ’90s for the U.S. military,” he says. If you’re buying used, check for tears and broken zippers and buckles.  Flashlight ($7): This waterproof flashlight from Dorcy isn’t super powerful (it's only 55 lumens, or fewer than your standard outdoor headlamp), but you can use it in the rain, and it comes with a carabiner clip so you’ll never lose it. Fire Starter ($3): An inexpensive set of stormproof matches like these from UCO will ensure that you can get a fire going. Just make sure to practice at home.  Water Purification Kit ($7): I always hedge my bets with a chemical purifier like these iodine tablets. They taste awful, but ensure clean water no matter where you are. Be sure to include an old small pot from home to boil water.  MREs ($10): Military surplus stores carry MREs, the self-heating meals that soldiers eat in the field. They’re cheap—often just $3 each—and packed with calories. Tip: Puhaly and Stevens says it’s fine to buy expired MREs, which are even cheaper. If you can’t stomach MREs, go to your local grocery store and buy $10 worth of trail mix that’s heavy on protein-rich nuts. Swiss Army Knife ($20): Skip a giant blade and go with something like the Classic SD Swiss Army Knife that’s more versatile and includes scissors, a screwdriver, and a file.   Shelter ($40): There are various ways to build a shelter outside. You can buy $5 worth of paracord and a $10 tarp and string it up between trees. A $4 space blanket will keep you warm. Or you can buy a used tent and sleeping bag, which I’ve found for $20 each after some digging in thrift stores. Research (Free): Once you have your kit ready, Puhaly and Stevens suggest looking at survival websites like Gray Wolf Survival and Survival Cache, both of which will help you learn how to use your gear in an emergency.

Photo: Bass Pro Shops Earlier this month, Bass Pro Shops bought Cabela’s and its 85 locations across the United States and Canada for $5.5 billion. The news had me—an avid Pacific Northwest runner and kayaker—asking: What’s the best way to shop at these giant big-box retailers that dominate the Midwest and South? What should I buy? What should I avoid? To find out, I called two Outside editors who used to shop there all the time: Bryan Rogala, who grew up Arkansas, and Jonah Ogles, who grew up in Michigan. Then I spent hours perusing the shops’ websites looking for the best deals. Here’s what I learned. Tips Check Out the Aquarium Both Bryan and Jonah suggested checking out Cabela’s in-store aquariums, which are stocked with local fish. If you’re new to the area, this is a great place to get a look at the kind of quarry you’ll be chasing.  Take Your Time Both stores are huge, so don’t expect to rush through, especially if you’re looking for deals. Bryan recommends digging through the discount bins to find screaming deals on crucial items like camp chairs, tents, stoves, and jackets. Purchase Rods and Reels, Skip the Flies Bryan and Jonah both say the stores carry great fly rods and reels, and the employees don’t try to upsell you. “No one is going to talk you into a $900 rod when a $250 model is all most people need,” Jonah says. But heads up: do not buy the flies. “I can’t tell you how many times they’ve fallen apart on me,” says Jonah. The Car-Camping Gear Is Gold You’ll need to hit up a store like REI for fast and light backpacking gear, but if you’re spending the night near your car, these two stores have great deals on everything you need. The Best Gear Deals Bass Pro Shops Eclipse 6-Person Tent ($100) Car camping with kids and dogs? This affordable tent has plenty of room for the whole family. I suggest stringing a $12 tarp above the tent as extra insurance in a rainstorm—the fly looks a little iffy—but otherwise this shelter should hold up just fine. Bass Pro Shops 200 Lumen 3-Pack Flashlight Combo ($25) Get three flashlights for the price of one headlamp. Put one in your glove compartment, one in your camp box, and another in your tent. The 200-lumen beam isn’t crazy powerful, but it’s enough to cook or read by. Coleman Lassen 20-Degree Sleeping Bag ($50) I wouldn’t trust this bag down to 20 degrees on its namesake Lassen Peak, but it’s certainly warm enough for summer and fall car-camping trips. The rectangular shape and cotton liner will make for a more comfortable night’s sleep than squeezing into a traditional mummy bag. Reliance Aqua Tainer Jug ($20) Get one of these jugs, then stow it in your car. Whether you use it to fill up a Nalgene at the trailhead or boil pasta at camp, it’s handy for always having plenty of water at hand. Brunton TruArc 3 Base Plate Compass ($13) Heading into the backcountry? Bring a compass. With a little know-how (get it free at learn-orienteering.org), this $13 investment might save your life, or at least the embarrassment of being pulled from the woods by the local search-and-rescue team.

Photo: Becca Skinner Like any person who's had a panic attack about being stuck in the wilderness alone for a night, I always carry some kind of fire starter when I go into the woods. I spent the past two weeks testing five of the most popular tools, ranking them based on ease of use, price, and packability. Just be sure to practice with whichever you choose so you’re not learning in the field during an emergency. #5: Leatherman Signal Multitool with Fire Starter ($100) Best For: Being prepared for all kinds of backcountry emergencies. How It Works: There’s a ferrocerium rod inside this Leatherman. Use the back of one of the tool’s blades to scrape the rod and get a spark. Results: I found this ferrocerium rod more difficult to use than the Aurora Fire Starter because it was smaller and produced fewer sparks. It took me a full 30 minutes to get a dry fire started. That said, the Leatherman comes with a sharp saw and blade for cutting kindling, plus a host of other useful backcountry tools. Buy Now #4: Aurora Fire Starter ($23) Best For: Backcountry ounce counters. How It Works: This is a magnesium rod that sends sparks flying when it’s scraped with the included striking blade. It doesn’t work well when wet, but comes in a waterproof case. Results: It took me six strikes to scrape the rod correctly, but once I did, it sent a powerful flame onto the cotton ball I used as fuel and immediately set it ablaze. I like that the whole kit comes in a ChapStick-size tube and weighs just 1.7 ounces. Buy Now #3: Cotton Balls Covered in Vaseline ($.25) Best For: Cheap, lightweight insurance. How It Works: No, this isn’t a fire-starting tool, but I wanted to include this concoction anyway because these swabs are so useful in the field that I always carry at least a dozen with me. I let the balls soak in the jelly for about an hour, then pack them into a plastic container. Since Vaseline is petroleum-based, and petroleum is extremely flammable, these balls catch fire as soon as they come into contact with a spark. Results: The balls will burn for more than 30 seconds when it’s not raining and up to 20 seconds during a drizzle. The petroleum adds extra fuel and burns hot, making these useful for lighting damp wood. #2: UCO Titan Stormproof Match Kit ($10) Best For: Pyro novices. How It Works: Like normal matches—they’re just waterproof. Results: To test the waterproof claim, I dunked each of these matches in water for 30 seconds. Each one still lit immediately and went on to burn for more than 20 seconds—plenty of time to ignite a well-prepared kindling-and-paper fire. The matches are also wind resistant. Buy Now #1: Pocket Bellows Weatherproof Kit ($25) Best For: Starting a fire in the rain. How It Works: This is a full fire kit that includes a waterproof ferrocerium rod and striker (for sparks), waterproof beeswax/olive oil wicks to catch the sparks, and a metal tube that you blow through to aim your breath and fuel the fire. Results: This kit worked flawlessly. The rod and striker were easy to use. The wicks, which burn for more than three minutes, caught fire even after I’d soaked them in a glass of water. Blowing through the metal tube made the wicks roar with enough heat to catch sticks and grass on fire almost instantly.

Photo: Justin Bailie I have a garage full of water bottles and reservoirs. I do my best to keep them mold-free, but recently I started wondering if there’s a proper cleaning technique for each. To find out, I hopped on the phone with representatives of several top hydration brands. Here’s what they said. Plastic Water Bottle I’m guessing you’ve thrown your Nalgene in the dishwasher, hoping you wouldn’t ruin it. Eric Hansen, the company’s marketing director, says the dishwasher is just fine so long as the bottle is on the top rack and away from the heating element, which can melt the lid. Warm water and soap will also do the trick. If you accidently leave juice or something else in the bottle for a few days, Hansen suggests soaking your Nalgene overnight with a tablespoon of bleach or baking soda per cup of water. Cycling Bottle I called Addie Bash, marketing manager at Polar Bottle, about this, and she echoed Hansen. You can throw Polar bottles in the top rack of the dishwasher (the same goes for CamelBak's Podium bottles), but keep them away from the heating element. If you leave a sugary hydration mix in there for too long, you’ll need to soak it in soapy water. If the stank still won’t go away, Bash suggests using a scrubbing brush or adding rice to soapy water and shaking the bottle to remove any gunk left behind. Hydration Bladder Jonathan Austen, director of sports and military product at CamelBak, says you should immediately drain and dry your reservoir after every use. Empty all the water and then use a dish towel or paper towel to wipe the bag dry. Austen also recommends rolling up your bag and storing it in the freezer. “Very few things can grow at the temperatures of your freezer,” Austen says. If you’re using hydration mixes with sugar, CamelBak suggests a deeper clean after every couple of uses. The brand sells cleaning tablets, or you can fill your reservoir with two tablespoons of baking soda or bleach per liter of hot water. Run that cleaning solution through the tube and into the bite valve as well, let it sit for 30 minutes, and then drain and rinse everything with hot water. A little squeeze of lemon juice will freshen the taste of the tube and bite valve. Finally, make sure you dry everything. Vacuum-Insulated Stainless-Steel Bottle Phil Notheis, director of product at Klean Kanteen, says the company’s bottles are dishwasher safe (So are Yeti's. Hydroflask bottles are not.). For hand washing, he likes unscented dish soap because it won’t leave any taste residue. Just remember: stainless-steel bottles use precise welds to maintain the vacuum insulation. Throwing these bottles in the freezer or heating them over a flame could cause the steel to contract or expand, ruining those welds and thus the bottle’s ability to insulate liquids.

Photo: Jakob Schiller Multitools entered our world when Leatherman released its Pocket Survival Tool back in 1983. Since then, these devices have become ubiquitous standard-carry kit. We use them to fix bikes, open beers, start campfires, and cut kindling. If you’re creative, their usefulness doesn't need to stop there. Just look to these seven athletes, who have each found brand-new ways to take advantage of their multitools in times of dire need.  Eric Porter Mountain Biker Porter was on a three-day trip in British Columbia when his new pair of mountain bike shorts started popping open at the button whenever he had to hike-a-bike. Frustrated, he pulled out a Lezyne multitool, punched some holes in the waistband of his shorts, and then roped them shut with a piece of dental floss.   Hilaree O’Neill Climber and Ski Mountaineer “For some reason, on bigger trips, I often forget to bring eating utensils,” O’Neill says. As a result, she often finds herself gingerly using the knife, can opener, or entire outside of her Leatherman Wingman to eat hot food. (She always carefully washes the Leatherman afterward, so the food doesn’t gunk up the tools.)  Eric Larsen Polar Explorer Larsen, who got his start as a dog musher, used his Leatherman Juice like a hammer to remove ice that accumulated on his gear. During an exploration trip on Baffin Island, he stuffed his ski into an ice crack to guy out his tent. Eighteen inches of sea ice formed on the tail overnight, thanks to a high tide. “I took out my Leatherman and chiseled for a half-hour,” he says. Without the tool, Larsen thinks the ski would have been permanently stuck. Caroline Gleich Skier and Climber Gleich likes to climb and ski in spicy spots, and she’s constantly using the knife on her Leatherman Squirt PS4 multitool to remove old rope or webbing other people have left on anchors. Last season, Gleich cut the webbing out of the anchors along the Heart of Darkness ski-mountaineering route. (Those anchors are designed specifically to hold rope.)  Anton Krupicka Ultrarunner Krupicka doesn’t carry a multitool while running, but last winter he was on a ski tour when the tech fittings on the front of his friend’s ski boots filled with ice and dirt, making it impossible to click back into a binding. Instead of trying to dig out the depressions with a rock or finger, his friend used a Leatherman Juice multitool. “It was such a silly little detail, but without the awl or a knife, we would’ve been pretty stuck,” he says. Brody Leven Skier Back in 2013, Leven accidentally brought two different-size ski boots on a Denali expedition. One was too big for his ski bindings—something he didn’t realize until after the airplane dropped him at base camp—so he used a Leatherman Skeletool CX multitool to turn screws and make the binding as large as possible. Even then, Leven had to ram the boot in to make it fit. Luckily, the binding still worked flawlessly.  Ben Stookesberry Kayaker Jungle rot and ant infestation caused the tunnel on Stookesberry’s spray skirt to fall apart during a first descent of Chiapas, on Mexico’s Santa Domingo River. He sewed it back on using a multitool, the tine of his fork, and dental floss. He then made it watertight with Aquaseal.

Photo: Ron Koeberer Sleeping well on the road can be hard. Take what happened to me earlier this month, when my buddy Matt and I spent ten days in Utah on a reporting trip. The guy snores like a gas-powered chainsaw, and the only way I could sleep was to fill my ears with plugs. I called in several different nonelectric styles. Here’s how they stacked up. Alpine SleepSoft ($18 for 1 Pair)   Photo: Alpine Best for: Making sure you get to work on time These earplugs don’t block all the noise coming into your ears. Instead, they use a small cylindrical filter in the middle to dampen the sound. The point? You should be able to muffle the noise but still hear your alarm in the morning. They worked as advertised. I could hear Matt doing his thing, but I was still able to rest and wake up on time. They were also the most comfortable by far of any set I tested, thanks to soft rubber cones that slide into your ears. Side sleepers, take note. Buy Now Etymotic ER 20XS ($25 for 1 Pair)   Photo: Etymotic Best for: Concertgoers Etymotic designed these earplugs to evenly turn down the volume from both high and low sounds. They’re heavier-duty than the Alpines, above, and are best for standing in the front row of a concert. As a result, they weren’t as comfortable as the Alpine plugs. Buy Now Mack’s Snore Mufflers ($10 for 6 Pairs)   Photo: Mack's Best for: Cheap efficiency Mack’s makes these plugs from a moldable silicone to ensure a custom fit. They take a little work to mold and squeeze, but once you get the fit right, they’re highly effective—and cheap. Matt’s loud snores were turned into distant ambient noise, and I conked out immediately. Tip: Mack’s also make a waterproof version of these silicone earplugs, which are great for surfing and kayaking because they prevent water from getting into your ears. Buy Now Mack’s Ultra Soft Foam Earplugs ($9 for 50 Pairs)   Photo: Mack's Best for: Last-resort backups These are the cheap foam earplugs you might get free on an airplane. You squish them down and shove them into your year, and they expand to block noise. I like that they’re inexpensive and fairly comfortable for sleeping, but they were not dense enough to cut out Matt’s snoring, forcing me to swap them with the Snore Mufflers after 20 infuriating minutes. Buy Now Hearos Ear Plugs Xtreme Protection Series ($6 for 14 Pairs)   Photo: Hearos Best for: Sleeping through a car race Like the Snore Mufflers, these plugs blocked almost all of Matt’s nonstop snoring. They’re made from a super-dense foam that acts as a better filter than the materials of the other earplugs on this list. The only downside: the denser foam was harder to shove into my ear, making these the least comfortable earplugs I tested.

The next step is to begin negotiating their first contract. (Retail Action Project/ Facebook)   This article was first posted at Labor Notes. The high turnover in retail makes organizing a huge challenge. But a thousand workers at eight Zara stores in Manhattan beat the odds and unionized. It’s a first for Zara workers in the U.S. The Spanish-owned fashion outlet had agreed to recognize the union after a majority of workers signed cards, a milestone they reached in July. They’ll be members of Retail Workers (RWDSU) Local 1102. Their win relied on international solidarity, in the form of an agreement between the retailer’s parent company and a global union. But equally crucial was the help of a New York City worker center, the Retail Action Project (RAP), that specializes in building workers’ skills, including action on the job. Just-in-time retail Retail organizing has drawn national attention with the Fight for 15 movement and Walmart worker strikes. But despite the slogan “$15 and a union,” the goal of widespread unionization seems far off. Over the past decade RAP has seen workers get pushed even further to the margins. Mid-range stores like the GAP are struggling, while both luxury retailers and low-priced “fast fashion” ones—like Zara, Forever 21, and H&M—are expanding. In this just-in-time industry, “as soon as you see it on the runway, in a matter of days you see it in the store,” said Stanley L. (he asked that his last name not be included), who works in a Manhattan Zara store. These companies compete on cheap production and quick turnaround of inventory. “We’ve seen an even greater dip in wages,” said RAP Director Rachel Laforest, “and absolutely no training in any kind of customer service. Workers are told the clothes will sell themselves.” Besides just-in-time scheduling and the growth of part-time hours, violations of wage-and-hour laws are common. Laforest estimates that 75 percent of people who attend RAP programs have experienced wage theft. The issues are ripe for organizing. But is it possible in an industry with so much turnover? “People are in a job three months, six months,” Laforest said. “How do you organize when critical members of the committee are gone and then working somewhere else?” Trained leaders RAP, a partnership between RWDSU and a community organization called the Good Old Lower East Side, was formed in 2005 to take on this challenge. It works with the Center for Frontline Retail, a worker center with a training focus, to offer classes that help retail workers get higher-paying jobs, like training in product display and luxury selling. RAP organizers also do outreach—talking to workers on their breaks, sometimes asking them to fill out surveys—at what Laforest describes as “retail hotspots”: the Soho and Herald Square corridors in Manhattan, and various malls in Queens and the Bronx. It runs a 12-week leadership training program where workers map out the global retail industry and their role in it. They also learn to identify workplace issues, recruit others, and organize on the job. “After 12 weeks, they really get a sense of the weight and power behind them if they step up and decide to take action,” said Laforest. Protection in unity To start making changes, one tool workers often use is to form a workplace committee—a group of even a few co-workers who agree to address problems together in a coordinated way. They rely on their right to concerted activity under federal labor law—a right that’s legally protected whether you’re a union member or not. RAP often helps a committee put together a petition to present the issues to their boss in writing. “If you do a petition delivery, you realize that if you know the law and are organized and coordinated with each other, you can get the manager and the employer to respond,” said Laforest. “There is a lot of protection in that unity.” RAP organizers tell workers about the advantages of forming a union. If workers decide to go that route, the worker center puts them in touch with RWDSU. But it’s key to have flexible strategies, Laforest said. “There is no cookie-cutter approach.” Even when a committee has formed, there are many factors to consider when planning an action, she said. “How confident do they feel? How much do they want to reach out to others? How often do they want to step out?” Because of the high turnover, RAP encourages members to join its committees that cross multiple retailers, like the art committee or the leadership committee. It also plugs members into policy campaigns, like the Just Hours campaign for fair scheduling. “We have a long-term approach to organizing,” said Laforest. “We are developing leadership in the retail sector regardless of where people are.” Changing Zara In 2014, Zara workers launched the #ChangeZara campaign with support from RAP. They drew attention to the differences in work life between U.S. retail workers and their European counterparts who are unionized, such as access to benefits and representation at work. After workers presented petitions to their managers and held public rallies, in 2014 Zara agreed to increase the number of full-time positions, end on-call shifts, and give workers a raise. But Zara workers said they wanted more. “This isn’t enough. Management can easily take away these small improvements, because there is no union contract,” said Sharlene Santos in a YouTube video RAP produced. “Zara workers in New York must continue organizing until we get what we deserve.” The framework agreement between global union UNI and Zara’s parent company, Inditex—the largest fashion retailer in the world—opened the door for workers to organize a union. It affirms Inditex’s commitment to freedom of association. Using this framework, Inditex and RWDSU agreed on a “fair process” for New York City store workers to unionize. The company promised not to interfere in the union drive and to recognize the union once a majority signed cards. “They were upfront,” Stanley said of the company. “They posted up a flyer when the (union) meeting was going to be.” He encouraged his co-workers to come to the meetings and to sign cards. Contract next For a thousand Zara workers, a union is finally real. The next step is to begin negotiating their first contract. Stanley is excited about joining the “union family.” In stints at other retailers, he’s already seen the difference a union makes. He worked for several years at the nonunion Uniqlo, then went to a unionized H&M store. Dozens of New York H&M stores unionized with RWDSU between 2007 and 2011, relying on a neutrality agreement with the Swedish company. “The communication was immediately much better,” Stanley said. “The respect was much more there.” Janna Pea, deputy communications director for the union, hopes competitors take note of the message Zara is sending: “There is a way that you can operate a company, remain profitable, and recognize workers' rights to respect on the job.” Never has independent journalism mattered more.

(Supplied) RELATED ARTICLES Google's Waze app to alert kidnappings in LA Facebook eyes $1bn Waze deal Uber lost at least $1.27bn in first half of year - report San Francisco — Google is preparing to expand a San Francisco carpooling program in a move that could that could set up a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The plans will build upon a test service that Google's navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn't trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider's work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers' belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber's early investors. It invested $258m in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber's board because of potential conflicts with Google's ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond's departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to "continued cooperation and partnership" with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze's carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple's board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google's Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple's iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone's software to create Android.

Apple Pay Could Lose Leverage in U.S. from Spat Down Under By Kate Fitzgerald August 31, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Apple Pay is perhaps the most ubiquitous mobile payments service, but it is too early to say if banks, device makers or merchants control the system. IMAGE: Bloomberg News Related PNC Adds Support for Microsoft Wallet Payment Gateways Must Open Up to Bots Don't Take Tech Giants' Payments Ambitions Lightly Why B of A Is on the Fence About Mobile Wallets How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue Australian banks are pushing Apple to loosen its grip on the technology that enables mobile payments. The result could bode well for U.S. banks as they look to re-up agreements with the tech giant. Apple has maintained tight control over Apple Pay since its October 2014 launch, forcing participating U.S. banks to pay a toll of 10 to 15 basis points per transaction to access the near-field communication antenna, or controller, according to industry sources. Banks grumbled, but they paid up. Many of the contracts U.S. banks initially signed to support Apple Pay are coming up for renewal, and financial institutions hoping to renegotiate terms are closely watching the Australia situation for signs of a thaw in Apple's policy of blocking third-party access to its mobile payments solution. "Some believe Apple has been courting conflict with the payments industry by acting monopolistically in the way it restricts access to its NFC controller, and Australia is turning out to be the most public of these collisions," said Doug Parr, chief revenue officer at Prairie Cloudware, a software developer based in Omaha, Neb. Apple declined to discuss the matter and U.S. banks continue to be tight-lipped about their arrangements with the tech company. But the issues are stirring up familiar tensions surrounding the tug of war over who ultimately controls mobile payments — banks, device makers or merchants — and it's too early to predict a winner, Parr says. So far NFC has emerged as the dominant channel for mobile wallets, because of its smooth user experience and the security it offers when combined with tokenization from payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. Plus, it's minimally invasive to merchants by riding on existing payment infrastructure rails, Parr pointed out. But merchants like Walmart are developing their own apps using alternative approaches like QR codes, and because consumers still have not broadly embraced NFC-based wallets, the future direction of mobile payments isn't certain. "At some point, consumers will vote with their feet, but the parties supporting mobile payments will need to cooperate, and that's what's at the heart of the goings-on in Australia," Parr said. Australia's largest banks recently applied to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to fast-track a request for permission to collectively negotiate with Apple, claiming the company's restrictive policy around Apple Pay is stifling mobile payments innovation in the country. The Australian Retailers Association pledged support for the banks' request, along with the Australian Payments Clearing Association. On Aug. 18 the regulator responded that it needed time to consult with parties and said it would issue a draft decision on the matter in October. U.S. banks are closely watching the outcome, Parr said, because it could provide clues to how much leverage Apple can exert over banks in various markets. "Banks in the U.S. don't like paying a toll to use Apple Pay, but it's worse in other markets where interchange is skimpier," he said. U.S. banks typically earn about 200 basis points in interchange on each transaction, but outside the U.S. interchange often ranges between 40 and 70 basis points per transaction, Parr said. "In many countries, there isn't much interchange left, and if Apple is potentially asking banks to give up a third of it, they are going to push back." Third-party developers like Prairie Cloudware are busy building mobile wallets for banks that leverage host card emulation (HCE) to store payment card credentials in the cloud, but their solutions can only support mobile payments for Android devices because Apple requires banks to confine Apple Pay within an app that uses a secure element built into the handset. As a result, banks like Capital One and Wells Fargo that have developed HCE-based mobile wallets are forced to offer Apple Pay as a separate service. "If I'm a Wells Fargo customer with an iPhone, I don't get the full functionality of the bank's mobile app, because I can't use it to make an NFC payment," Parr explained. In backing Australia's banks, local retailers struck a similar note. "In our view, for as long as Apple Pay remains the only app that can use the iPhone's NFC functionality, the potential for innovation in mobile wallets and mobile payments will be limited." Apple shot back in its response to Australian regulators that local banks were exhibiting "cartel-like" behavior and attempting to stifle competition and create security risks.

Laura Goode August 31, 2016, 3:30 PM Photographed by Tayler Smith. It is at my family’s little wooden cabin in rural northwest Wisconsin, one August Wednesday of my 29th year, that I wake up all alone and feeling funny. This particular day is the 29th of my cycle. I feel tired. I feel distracted. The novel I’m supposed to be writing won’t write. I don’t bleed. I need an answer. Braless, with unwashed hair, in jean shorts, I haul myself 27 miles in my mother’s car to the Ladysmith, WI Super Walmart, a major destination in the surrounding lake and farmland, and the only place I can think of where a pregnancy test can definitely be obtained. (I left the Midwest after high school to live in places where you can walk to the nearest drugstore — New York, San Francisco.) I scan the rack of EPTs and Clearblue Easys. I briefly consider stealing a pregnancy test so as not to have to face the cashier; then, I remember I am no longer 16. I pay and trot off to the restroom, faking casual confidence with my stride. Nothing to see here, folks. In the empty Super Walmart bathroom, I tear open the package. I pee on the stick. I hyperventilate for 90 seconds, awaiting the result. It materializes in one bold, all-caps word, telegrammatic and unmistakable: PREGNANT. I scream out loud, my yowl echoing off the bathroom tiles. I drop the stick with a clatter. How many times had we even had unprotected sex? Shouldn’t it take longer than the two months I’ve been off the Pill for my body to refertilize? Am I actually prepared to gestate and raise a baby? I feel somehow betrayed by this situation I have so obviously manifested. I’ve never felt like more of a big-city sinner than in this moment, pregnant and alone in a small-town Walmart. And yet, a seed of excitement. Advertisement “ It materializes in one bold, all-caps word, telegrammatic and unmistakable: PREGNANT. ” But then, back to dumbfounded: Can the principles of reproduction be this unapologetically simple? In a hormonal haze of shock and anxiety, I wander out of Walmart feeling bizarrely compelled to confirm this discovery with a medical professional immediately. Surely a Walmart test could be wrong. I spot a free pregnancy counseling clinic right across the street. Is it located adjacent to Walmart for exactly this purpose? I register the Christian connotation of the term “pregnancy counseling clinic” only when I reach a sign adorned by an angelic, soft-focus fetus. I gulp. Here I am, pro-choice to the core (regular donor to Planned Parenthood, organizer of my university’s delegation to the 2004 March for Women’s Lives, foaming-at-the-mouth liberal who hightailed it out of the deep Midwest to join the ranks of the urban left at the earliest possible opportunity), about to avail myself of the kind of Christian-right clinic that intimidates vulnerable preggos out of abortions. In other words, about to walk into exactly what I’ve been protesting for years. Can I do this? A bilious anxiety rises in my throat again. The only thing I want, so viscerally in this moment, is not to be alone. The clinic is free, I reassure myself, blind with emotional need, and they’ll be nice, since I’m not looking for an abortion. (At least, I don't think I am. Am I?) This is all happening so fast. Desperation acquaints a woman with strange bedfellows. Sometimes that’s where babies come from. Driven onward by that anxious loneliness — and some extremely Midwestern instinct, like not wanting to be impolite — I knock on the door and am met by a smiling, extremely perky, late-middle-aged woman. “Can you tell me if I’m really pregnant?” I ask breathlessly. “I sure can,” she says. “I mean, I already took a test at Walmart, and it was positive,” I ramble on. “But I guess I just wanted to confirm.” “You bet, honey,” the nice lady says. “Come on in.” She takes me into a pleasant room and gives me a test almost identical to the one I’ve just taken at Walmart. Obedient in my farce, I pee again, presenting the stick: PREGNANT. “Congratulations!” she says, hugging me, beaming. “Were you trying?” “Um,” I say, unsure how to answer this question honestly. “I guess it’s more like God’s sent my husband and me a happy surprise.” These are carefully chosen words, meant to convey that I’m already married and saved and not currently in need of recommendations from her on either issue. “Doesn’t He just do that?” the lady replies evenly, beaming again. “You can keep this,” she hands the test back, wrapped in a Kleenex, and tells me a story of a woman she knows who stuck her positive test in her husband’s French fries. You know, to surprise him. I laugh, but that’s disgusting. “ They’ll be nice since I’m not looking for an abortion. (At least, I don't think I am. Am I?) ” “Do you have kids?” I ask. “Four.” “Do you like them?” “A lot,” she nods emphatically. I am powerfully grateful for her effervescent Midwestern assurance. She reminds me of my aunties: their lilting accents, their maternal gravitas, their frank, hearty laughs. I can’t explain what it is I need in this moment, or why I need it, but whatever it is, any greater regional or political framework feels momentarily irrelevant to it. My choice in this moment happens to be one she supports — and certainly this interaction could have been very different, had I been seeking another option. But it’s also true that right now, I need someone to bear witness to me, and she does. She is kind to me. She treats me like kin, and for a moment, we coincide. She is my adversary and my family. Something in that simultaneity moves me. There seems no symbolism in it; I am, for a moment, overtaken by oceanic feeling. That, or it could be the progesterone surge. The woman chatters on, taking out a calendar wheel — it is incredible to me that medical science has not yet advanced past this gestational slide rule — to determine my conception and due dates: May 15. My baby is due May 15. I giggle. She giggles. I still can’t believe I’m here, but the Midwesterner in me loves this woman. I love her for being with me at this surreal, bewildering crossroads. I love her for making sweet-tempered small talk and, in doing so, taking me out of my own swirling, keeling, pregnant brain. Only in retrospect does something else clarify to me: This was the moment I chose to keep my baby. Nine months later, I give birth to a healthy baby boy, three weeks before his due date. We name him Josiah, called Jed. The Bible, and The West Wing. The intersection I have always lived. The next July, I find myself driving again to Walmart for a few groceries, with the baby in the back seat, and I spot the clinic. It’s a weekday; I’d bet anything the same woman is there. Before I can reconsider, I pull into the gravel driveway, angelic soft-focus fetus still supervising it all, like T.J. Eckleburg in utero. “Do you remember me?” I ask, smiling shyly as the baby wriggles on my hip, three months old, ripe and tender and beautiful. “Oh, honey,” she says, her hands flying up to her mouth as she gasps. “Of course.” Advertisement Body • Wellness More from Body What You Need To Know About That New Organ In Your Body Body Kimberly Truong Jan 5, 2017 I'm Doing Dry January For The First Time — & Here's How It's Going Body Rebecca Smith Jan 5, 2017 Here's What's Actually Happening When You're Bloated Body Sarah Jacoby Jan 5, 2017 This Video Answers A Crucial Question About Egg-Freezing Body Sarah Jacoby Nov 15, 2016 Trans Teen Bravely Documents Gender Confirmation Surgery On Camera Body Amelia Edelman Jan 5, 2017 70% Of America Stands With Roe V.

A pilot program in San Francisco uses the app to connect carpoolers. Waze Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email SAN FRANCISCO -- Google is preparing to expand a San Francisco carpooling program in a move that could that could set up a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber​. The plans will build upon a test service that Google’s navigation app Waze​ launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Play Video CBSN Uber to introduce self-driving cars Uber has announced that they will introduce self-driving cars on their app in Pittsburgh later this month. CNET senior editor Scott Stein joins C... Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber​, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn’t trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider’s work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber​ touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers’ belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Play Video 60 Minutes: Segment Extras Google's plan for its self-driving car Chris Urmson, Director of Google's self-driving car program, says Google is looking for a partner to deliver its technology to consumers. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber’s early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet’s senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber’s board because of potential conflicts with Google’s ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick​ confirmed Drummond’s departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to “continued cooperation and partnership” with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze’s carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars​ for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple’s board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google’s Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple’s iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone’s software to create Android. © 2016 The Associated Press.

The search for Jo and Noble had a happy ending, thanks to the good instincts of Bob Wurtele. The Manchester man said he read a story in the New Hampshire Union Leader about the search for the horses and his gut told him that they were likely in a grassy clearing on top of Middle Mountain. Wurtele used to run through the area and was familiar with the mountain, which is located in the area of Round Pond Road where dozens of searchers had been looking for the past few days. Wurtele said he also read in the story about how the horses like apples and that anyone who finds them could entice them with the fruit. He said he stopped at the Hooksett Walmart Wednesday when it opened at 6 a.m. and bought some apples. He then headed off to the state park in hopes of finding the horses. “I knew they would be there. I had that feeling. I figured they would be up there or down by the water,” he said. Wurtele reached the top of the mountain and found the horses around 7 a.m. He said they appeared to be in good shape. “They were together. They were just standing there, probably 40 yards off the logging trail,” he said. Wurtele said he cut one of the apples in half. “They just walked over to me and took the apples,” he said. Wurtele then removed the saddles, tied the horses to a tree, and waited for volunteer searchers to arrive after he called 911. Nearly two dozen people soon came to assist as the horses were taken off the mountain and reunited with owner Shaune Horan of Nottingham. “It was a great way to start the day,” Wurtele said. Horan and many others spent hours searching for the horses after they took off Sunday afternoon while she and her boyfriend were riding on a trail at the park. The horses got spooked by a group of bicyclists. By late Wednesday morning, the horses were grazing at Riverside Farm Stables in Lee, where they’re kept. “There are no words to describe how thankful I am,” Horan said. jschreiber@newstote.com .

News People 24 people who became highly successful after age 40 Get inspired by those who show it's never too late Richard Feloni, Business Insider Wednesday 31 August 2016 14:47 BST Click to follow The Independent Online Betty White has joined Instagram Getty Images For the more neurotic among us, a birthday can be a reminder of how another year has passed and our loftiest aspirations have faded further into the distance. There are plenty of examples, however, of successful people across many industries who prove that you don't need to have it all figured out by the time you turn 30. We'll take a look at some of them, from renowned fashion designer Vera Wang, who didn't design her first dress until she was 40, to writer Harry Bernstein, who authored countless rejected books before getting his first hit at age 96. Get inspired by those who show it's never too late. Stan Lee created his first hit comic, “The Fantastic Four,” just shy of his 39th birthday in 1961. In the next few years, he created the legendary Marvel Universe, whose characters such as Spider-Man and the X-Men became American cultural icons. Donald Fisher was 40 and had no experience in retail when he and his wife, Doris, opened the first Gap store in San Francisco in 1969. The Gap's clothes quickly became fashionable, and today the company is one of the world's largest clothing chains. Vera Wang was a figure skater and journalist before entering the fashion industry at age 40. Today she's one of the world's premier women's designers. Vera Wang (Getty Images) (Getty Images) Gary Heavin was 40 when he opened the first Curves fitness center in 1992, which ended up becoming one of the fastest-growing franchises of the '90s. Robin Chase cofounded Zipcar at age 42 in 2000. She left the company in 2011 and continues to build and advise startups, as well as serve as a member of the World Economic Forum. Samuel L. Jackson has been a Hollywood staple for years now, but he'd had only bit parts before landing an award-winning role at age 43 in Spike Lee's film “Jungle Fever” in 1991. (2016 Getty Images) Sam Walton had a fairly successful retail-management career in his 20s and 30s, but his path to astronomical success began at age 44, when he founded the first Wal-Mart in Rogers, Arkansas, in 1962. Henry Ford was 45 when he created the revolutionary Model T car in 1908. Jack Weil was 45 when he founded what became the most popular cowboy-wear brand, Rockmount Ranch Wear. He remained its CEO until he died at the ripe old age of 107 in 2008. Rodney Dangerfield is remembered as a legendary comedian, but he didn't catch a break until he made a hit appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” at age 46. Momofuku Ando cemented his spot in junk-food history when he invented instant ramen at age 48 in 1958. Charles Darwin spent most of his life as a naturalist who kept to himself, but in 1859 at age 50 his “On the Origin of Species” changed the scientific community forever. () Julia Child worked in advertising and media before writing her first cookbook when she was 50, launching her career as a celebrity chef in 1961. Jack Cover worked as a scientist for institutions including NASA and IBM before he became a successful entrepreneur at 50 for inventing the Taser stun gun in 1970. Betty White is one of the most award-winning comedic actresses in history, but she didn't become an icon until she joined the cast of “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” in 1973 at age 51. Tim and Nina Zagat were both 51-year-old lawyers when they published their first collection of restaurant reviews under the Zagat name in 1979. It eventually became a mark of culinary authority. Taikichiro Mori was an academic who became a real-estate investor at age 51 when he founded Mori Building Company. His brilliant investments made him the richest man in the world in 1992, when he had a net worth of $13 billion. Ray Kroc spent his career as a milkshake-device salesman before buying McDonald's at age 52 in 1954. He grew it into the world's biggest fast-food franchise. Wally Blume had a long career in the dairy business before starting his own ice cream company, Denali Flavors, at age 57 in 1995. The company reported revenue of $80 million in 2009. Laura Ingalls Wilder spent her later years writing semi-autobiographical stories using her educated daughter, Rose, as an editor. She published the first in the “Little House” books at age 65 in 1932. They soon became children's literary classics and the basis for the TV show “Little House on the Prairie.” Harland Sanders, better known as Colonel Sanders, was 62 when he franchised Kentucky Fried Chicken in 1952. He sold the franchise business for $2 million 12 years later. A KFC with the image of Harland Sanders (Getty Images) (Getty Images) Anna Mary Robertson Moses, better known as Grandma Moses, began her prolific painting career at 78. In 2006, one of her paintings sold for $1.2 million. Harry Bernstein spent a long life writing in obscurity but finally achieved fame at age 96 for his 2007 memoir, “The Invisible Wall: A Love Story That Broke Barriers.” Read more: • Sweden's economy is on fire – but that's not good • Amazon sign a major deal that threatens Ocado • Mervyn King: 'Germany faces a terrible choice' Read the original article on Business Insider UK. © 2015.

Google will soon launch a carpooling service in the city using its Waze app, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The company has been using employees of Google, Adobe, and Walmart to test a program that allows Waze users to connect with nearby commuters heading in the same direction and plans to make it available to all San Francisco users this fall, a source says. Should Uber and Lyft be worried? Perhaps not yet. For now, riders can take only two rides per day—the idea being that the service be used solely for commuting. And though anyone can sign up as a driver—drivers won't be vetted, but users will leave reviews, the source says—they won't earn much: Riders are charged a maximum of 54 cents per mile. Google doesn't take a cut, though that could change in the future, the source adds. In other words, the program "is less about making a commercial driver out of every casual driver and more about helping drivers offset the costs of car ownership or gas," writes Johana Bhuiyan at Recode. "It's not the always-there, on-demand service Uber is spending billions to perfect." Uber and Lyft have tested similar carpooling services, but not with much success.

The plans will build upon a test service that Google’s navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn’t trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider’s work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers’ belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber’s early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet’s senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber’s board because of potential conflicts with Google’s ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond’s departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to “continued cooperation and partnership” with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze’s carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple’s board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google’s Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple’s iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone’s software to create Android.     Tags: service, google, request, drivers, people, rides, Other stories from today: High Schools prep for election changes: Sequoia Union board to pave way for redistricting and calendar realignment Whale carcass from deep water species found beached in Point Reyes Bailiff accused of pointing gun at janitor found not guilty     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   How many people do you keep in touch with from high school?

Founded in 1971 with a $5,000 loan by five friends and University of Texas graduates, Steve and Bill Gurasich, Tim McClure, Judy Trabulsi and 2016 Ad Hall of Famer, Roy Spence, the agency has become one of the preeminent agencies in the country, representing iconic brands including Southwest Airlines, PGA TOUR, Hilton, Chipotle, Dodge, the U.S. Air Force, John Deere and Popeyes, among others. The founders learned early on that the best clients to work for were ones that genuinely wanted to make a difference in their customers' lives. This belief in purpose led GSD&M to meaningful partnerships and iconic work from taglines like "Don't Mess with Texas" for the Texas Department of Transportation to "These Guys are Good" for the PGA TOUR (which is still the longest-running slogan in sports marketing history). It's also what launched the now 35-year partnership with Southwest Airlines that took it from a regional carrier to the largest domestic airline with campaigns like "Wanna Get Away?" and "Ding. You are now free to move about the country." And it's the ideal that led the agency to successfully relaunch the AT&T brand in 2006 and help Walmart grow from an overlooked regional retailer to the largest corporation in the world. "Forty-five years ago, the founders came at advertising differently," says GSD&M's CEO, Duff Stewart. "They weren't seasoned, so they didn't know the rules or the status quo. It was their unconventional approach that made them the agency you didn't want to pitch against and today it's that competitive, entrepreneurial spirit that continues to set us apart." Today, the agency is led by a new generation of relentless idea seekers. CEO, Duff Stewart; President, Marianne Malina; Chief Creative Officer, Jay Russell; and CMO, J.B. Raftus amplify the curious and restless spirit that GSD&M was founded on and have an unwavering calling to explore uncharted waters, build brands and catapult the agency and industry forward. In 2016, the agency is made up of a wildly diverse bunch who double as professors, artists, volunteers and entrepreneurs. What they share is a passion to solve courageously and never settle for anything less than an idea that makes a difference. Most recently: GSD&M has taken three consecutive trips to the Super Bowl beginning with RadioShack's famed mea culpa, "The '80s called and they want their store back" in 2014, which won Bronze at Cannes Lion Festival. Two laugh-out-loud spots from Avocados from Mexico followed in 2015 and 2016, helping boost brand sales by 35 percent after the first year alone. With 22-year partner Lennox, GSD&M created Degrees of Perfect, a first-of-its-kind experiential event that bridged the gap between art and engineering and broke the mundane mold that is the HVAC industry. Popeyes pioneered usage of Facebook Live when GSD&M created a virtual drive-thru to celebrate National Fried Chicken Day and delivered fried chicken straight to fans' doors. With Cannes Lion-winning campaigns like The Collaboratory and the redesign of airforce.com, GSD&M's 16-year partner, the U.S. Air Force, leads innovation in today's military space with immersive, personalized and experiential recruitment tactics. This year, Fiat Chrysler's Dodge named GSD&M its brand agency. A new tagline was created, "Domestic. Not Domesticated." This new partnership with Dodge continues the agency's expertise in the auto category following its four-year partnership with Land Rover and five-year relationship with BMW. In 2015, GSD&M helped Southwest Airlines coin Transfarency, a bold stance against unfair airline fees. Proving its dedication, it followed with #FeesDontFly Day, a social media campaign where Southwest responded to disgruntled travelers by reimbursing them for other airlines' fees. GSD&M remains one of the few agencies with both a fully integrated media planning and buying discipline and full-service multicultural capabilities. It's an agency born and raised in Austin, Texas-a city that shares GSD&M's love for authenticity, entrepreneurism and restlessness. About GSD&M Founded in 1971, GSD&M is a creatively driven, full-service agency headquartered in Austin, Texas, that believes when you pay the price to understand the problem and apply that insight to solve courageously, the reward is ideas that make a difference. With a restless culture and purpose as a guiding force, GSD&M builds brands with a fully integrated creative, media and analytics approach. For more information, visit GSDM.com.

Miserably. “We felt the tools and technology weren’t good enough for our use case,” said Bryan Leach, founder and CEO of the Denver-based shopping app. “You had to pinch and zoom. Customers weren’t getting an immediate notice on their reward. It was not seamless. We were unhappy.” Leach is much happier today because the company took a different route to encourage mobile-app users to buy online: through another app. In a week-long soft launch of the new program — which goes live Wednesday — a tiny portion of Ibotta’s 20 million users tried the new feature and wound up spending more than $1 million while using other apps, booking rooms on Hotels.com app, ordering beer from Drizly’s app and buying coupons with Groupon’s app. Ibotta integrated “deep linking” technology from New York’s Button to connect other apps to its own. Adding some custom technology, Ibotta’s app offers personal deals for users — and retailers, which can now change the rebate depending on the user.

Heck yeah, Fluid is from Denver! “On the web, everyone starts with Google. But in mobile, that’s not where commerce starts anymore,” Leach said. “Ibotta is positioning itself as the front door to all mobile commerce.” Ibotta’s app typically rebates cash based on a percentage of a user’s in-store purchase, like 25 cents for buying Bar-S Bologna at Walmart. To get the cash, Ibotta users must scan in a print receipt in the app and when they reach $20, Ibotta pays up. The new app-to-app feature is similar, but cash credit is automatic with payouts still coming in $20 increments. Some retailers credit accounts instantly while others, like Groupon, have a 45-day wait period. Ibotta’s approach could help turn app users into actual buyers, which is not common, said  Andrew Lipsman, vice president of marketing and insights for market researcher comScore, Inc.  In comScore’s first-quarter report on U.S. retail, it found that two-thirds of consumers use a mobile phone to browse on a retailer site but end up buying on a PC or tablet. Mobile commerce made up just 20 percent of the $83.5 billion spent digitally that quarter. “People are more likely to shop on mobile than buy on mobile,” Lipsman said, calling it the mobile-commerce gap. “Mobile has a lot more friction.” Friction includes security concerns, inability to see product details, difficulty of navigating between screens and slow or spotty connection speeds. “But we should see that gap narrow. People will get over security issues over time. Screen sizes are getting bigger and that’s helping dollars flow more quickly,” Lipsman said. But the other boon for the app economy is the promise that Ibotta’s app will encourage people to try new apps. On average, says comScore, mobile users have no more than three retail apps, with the top one being Amazon. Button CEO Mike Jaconi agreed that it may be a pain to download a new app, add a credit card number and remember to start using the app. But this isn’t about downloading a new app. It’s “the means to an end,” he said. “As an example, with Ibotta we are seeing an install rate north of 59 percent, while industry averages are in the order of 15 to 20 percent,” Jaconi said. “The beauty of Button’s marketplace is that after the install, a significant number of these new users end up purchasing and becoming repeat purchasers.” Current Ibotta rebates: Groupon: 5% Jet: 5% Boxed: 15% Hotels.com App: 5% Spring: 15% Drizly: 7.5% Door Dash: 10% Ticketmaster: 1% Handy: 10% delivery.com App: 10% Ibotta’s tech team helped build an ad-targeting-like feature known as Dynamic Segmentation. That means Ibotta users who frequently use Groupon, for example, may get a 5 percent cash rebate.  Through the soft launch, some users saw a 40 percent offer on Groupon. Now that the new feature is official, Ibotta said that current cash rebates are between 1 to 15 percent. For this first week, however, Ibotta shared that users who don’t have a Groupon app may also get the 40 percent offer. But a key point, Jaconi added, is that buying on an mobile app is much easier than buying on a mobile website. App users have already logged in and stored a credit card and a shipping address. “The reason mobile proved challenging for retailers was that checking out in mobile wasn’t easy — whether it was the slow loading and constant re-entry of credit card and address details,” Jaconi said. “Mobile web experiences were and, in many cases, still are terrible.” Updated Aug. 31, 2016 at 9:32 a.m. to mention the different cash-rebate percentages currently available on the new Ibotta feature, plus specifics about the 40 percent rebate on Groupon purchases.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Danielle Paquette August 31, 2016 Follow @dpaqreport (Washington Post illustration; iStock) Researchers have known for decades that women tend to beat men on environmental metrics. They generally use less fuel and energy. They eat less meat. They're more concerned about climate change. James Wilkie, a business professor at the University of Notre Dame, wanted to understand what drives this gender eco-friendliness gap. After years of exploring psychological bias, he and his colleagues developed a theory. "Men’s resistance may stem in part from a prevalent association between the concepts of greenness and femininity and a corresponding stereotype (held by both men and women) that green consumers are feminine," they assert this month in the Journal of Consumer Research. "As a result of this stereotype, men may be motivated to avoid or even oppose green behaviors in order to safeguard their gender identity." The researchers conducted a set of experiments, each designed to gauge if we actually do ascribe gender to green products and whether such perceptions impact our willingness to use them. They found people consistently connect environmentally conscious goods to their idea of femininity. [Is a vegetarian diet really better for the environment? Science takes aim at conventional wisdom.] The first survey of 127 college students asked respondents if they thought green products appeared masculine, feminine or neither. Most participants, both men and women, said items designed to protect the planet seemed feminine. Another group of 194 students took an online quiz instructing them to imagine two grocery store shoppers, one carrying a green reusable bag and another toting a plastic sack. The quiz asked: Which seemed more eco-friendly, wasteful, masculine and/or feminine? The green shoppers seemed to respondents more eco-friendly and feminine, regardless of their gender. The plastic shoppers came off as more wasteful and masculine. The researchers next gave a group of men phony gift cards and told them to pick from a selection of batteries, which included a green option. In both a faux Walmart and an online shopping scenario, the men avoided the green choice. “Self-perceptions of femininity suggest that threats may also influence private behavior,” the authors wrote. Wilkie’s team also found men in the studies were more likely to donate to an environmental nonprofit group that had a “masculine” logo — one with darker colors and bold fonts — than to an organization that displayed lighter tones and “frilly” letters. Logos didn’t have an impact on where women said they’d want to donate. A similar trend emerged in an experiment at a BMW dealership. When presented with two versions of the same “green” car, men favored the one called the “Protection Model” over the “Eco-friendly Model.” Women, meanwhile, weren’t particularly swayed by either title. “Stereotypical feminine behavior and attitudes are more in parallel with taking care of the environment,” Wilkie said of the findings. “Male traits tend to conflict with this idea of maintaining a nice environment for other people.” Wilkie blames stereotypes. People who care about the environment are perceived as nurturing, gentle caretakers. Pop culture says they're barefoot hippies with long hair and flower crowns. That image clashes with traditional masculinity. Previous research, Wilkie noted, suggests that men are socially penalized more for breaking gender norms when it comes to the products they use — or even the drinks they order. “If a man at a bar were to order a girlie drink, he might get some looks,” Wilkie said. “He might get some snickers. He might even get into a fight.” [New study finds that men are often their own favorite experts on any given subject] A woman requesting something that reads masculine, such as, say, a whiskey on the rocks, probably wouldn’t encounter that problem. “Some people might even be impressed,” he said. Carrie Preston, director of the Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Program at Boston University, said it’s concerning that feminine-seeming goods or actions repel some men. “That says what’s feminine is bad, is lesser, is second class,” she said. “Although men’s and women’s roles have changed significantly, masculinity hasn’t changed as much.” Caring about what people think of your drink choice or grocery bag may seem silly. There’s nothing inherently feminine about recycling, and some would argue that femininity itself (and how it’s marketed) is a cultural creation. Still, a 2011 survey from the global marketing firm Ogilvy and Mather found 82 percent of adults in a nationally representative sample said “going green” is more ladylike than manly. Marketers are unlikely to shatter gender expectations overnight — or nix the belief that feminine is lesser — but a packaging or messaging tweak could draw more men to the green movement. "Despite a prevalent stereotype that green consumers are more feminine than non-green consumers," the researchers wrote, "we show that men’s inhibitions about engaging in green behavior can be mitigated through masculine affirmation and masculine branding."

This is true not only at grocery stores and seaside eateries, but also at places where food is provided by foodservice companies. Foodservice companies supply a wide array of clients, including theme parks like Disney World, colleges like George Washington University, top chains like Walmart and Subway, and even the U.S. Congress. These companies purchase a hefty amount of seafood, but they don’t stack up when it comes to sustainable and ethical sourcing, a recent Greenpeace report reveals. Greenpeace assessed 15 large foodservice companies for sustainable and ethical seafood purchasing. Only three (Sodexo, Compass Group and Aramark) received passing scores — and even those scores are low. Sodexo, which ranked No. 1, received a score of only 41.8 out of 100. Compass Group and Aramark ranked No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. Compass Group’s score was 40.3 and Aramark’s was 40.1. Those three companies were the only ones to participate in Greenpeace’s survey. The failure to respond and engage with Greenpeace is “troubling,” the organization points out in its report. It also increases concerns about the transparency of the seafood supply chains of U.S. foodservice companies, the group said. “The U.S. foodservice industry procures billions of dollars worth of seafood every year from seafood giants like Thai Union, often putting profits over environmental and social impacts,” Greenpeace oceans campaigner and report author David Pinsky told TriplePundit. “Some seafood companies, including Thai Union, are known for ocean destruction and even human rights abuses in some supply chains.” The foodservice industry is a big one, accounting daily for almost half of all food-dollar spending outside the home. The industry has annual sales over $700 billion and “significant growth” is predicted, Greenpeace noted. This is one industry, the group says, that has “a tremendous impact on the environment and workers worldwide.” The seafood industry’s impacts on the environment and workers is significant. Consider that a third of all global fish stocks are overfished, and the fishing pressure may be too high for many of the 60 percent of stocks considered fully exploited. Production is expected to increase by nearly 20 percent by 2025. Recent investigations into the seafood industry found workers are exploited. And the U.S. State Department reported forced labor and human trafficking on fishing vessels or processing facilities in over 50 countries. Foodservice industries have a big opportunity to influence the seafood industry. Take Sysco, the largest broadline distributor in the world. The company ranked No. 4 on Greenpeace’s list, scoring 14.1. It is a company that has a big impact among foodservice providers, with Aramark procuring over half of its products from Sysco. Sysco’s seafood sales were almost $2.5 billion in 2015 and are more than the annual revenue of some management companies profiled in the report. “Larger companies have more resources to invest in improving the sustainability and social equity of their supply chains, and to identify alternative suppliers,” Greenpeace stated in its report. What companies can do to make their seafood supplies more sustainable and ethical “Consumers are demanding change, and foodservice companies must answer the call immediately,” Pinsky said. So, what can companies do to bring about the change that consumers are demanding? Greenpeace lists five ways that foodservice companies can lead: Transparency: Creating a strong, publicly-available sustainable seafood policy is key to bringing about change in the seafood industry. Companies that have “sensible” guidelines that cover their seafood practices “are better able to ensure that they are not causing undue harm to the oceans or people throughout their operations,” Greenpeace advised. The guidelines should be time bound, measurable and transparent. Progress should be publicly reported to allow both clients and consumers to know they are buying sustainable and ethical seafood. Address labor and environmental concerns: Foodservice companies need to take action to stop forced labor, labor abuse, and illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. One way is to demand that companies like Thai Union, which has been linked to labor and environmental abuse, improve. Foodservice companies need to require third-party supplier audits, ban purchases of seafood trans-shipped at sea, and ensure that workers throughout the supply chain are ethically treated.  Support positive change: Companies need to support initiatives and advocate for positive change for both the oceans and workers in the seafood industry. Engaging in the political process regarding ocean conservation is key.  Move from transparency to traceability: Overall transparency needs to be increased through key data elements, chain of custody and education. Traceability has to be carried through from fishing vessel or farms to the point of sale, which allows seafood clients and end consumers to make educated purchasing choices. Use third-party rating systems: Companies should only purchase species that are green-rated, meaning they are more sustainable, and avoid yellow and red rated species, or less sustainable species. They also need to avoid seafood that is connected to overfishing, destructive fishing and farming and unethical treatment of workers. “We must continue to shine a light on this massive industry urgently in need of reform,” Pinsky said. And hopefully that light will force foodservice companies to make changes in order to ensure their seafood supply chain is sustainable and ethical.

Kantar Worldpanel's statistics for the year to August 14 said the Walmart-owned company's share was up 1.8%, so that it now claimed 17.5% of spending in supermarkets and multiples. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments German discounter Lidl also increased its market share, but at the slightly lower level of 1.6%, giving it a slice of the total market of 5.1%. Sainsbury's recorded a market share of 17.5%, putting it in joint second position with Asda, although Sainsbury's market share continues to fall and was down by 0.6% on the 12 months to August 2015. Tesco remains Northern Ireland's dominant supermarket player, with its share of the market steady at 34.6%. By growing its market share in Northern Ireland, Asda has bucked the trend felt in the UK as a whole. The chain posted a 7.5% fall in like-for-like sales in the second quarter of this year - its worst quarterly performance on record. A spokesman for Asda told the Belfast Telegraph that Northern Ireland, where it has 17 stores, is one of its strongest markets. Lidl has 38 stores here - though its regional director Conor Boyle has said the market is big enough to open another 12. Tesco has around 50 stores of varying sizes, while Sainsbury's has 13.

The plans will build upon a test service that Google's navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn't trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider's work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers' belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber's early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber's board because of potential conflicts with Google's ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond's departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to "continued cooperation and partnership" with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze's carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple's board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google's Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple's iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone's software to create Android.

Staff reports / Published: August 31, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Police: Drunken thief ate meth SAINT CLAIR — A 31-year-old woman was arrested by Saint Clair police after an incident about 11 p.m. Aug. 16 at Wal-Mart. Police said Nicole Porter, who has no known address, was charged with one misdemeanor each count of possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia as well as one summary offense each of disorderly conduct, retail theft and public drunkenness. Police said officers were called to the store after Porter was seen placing clothing items into a backpack. At the store, officers approached the woman near the entrance but she dropped the backpack and walked back into the store. The woman refused to stop and then threw herself onto the floor and began to mumble, appearing to be under the influence of a narcotic, police said. Porter began to yell, said she had eaten methamphetamine and was taken to a hospital for treatment by EMS. A subsequent search of the backpack found merchandise valued at $13.78 along with 35 wax paper bags marked with the word “recession” and containing an off-white powder that field tested positive for heroin, police said. Also found were blood-covered tissues, about 30 new and used needles and empty wax paper bags containing a powder residue, also marked “recession.” Police said that Porter will now have to answer to the charges before Magisterial District Judge David A. Plachko, Port Carbon.

OPM offers guidance for feds who telework from home with children, dependents Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 gained 1.0 percent, South Korea’s Kospi lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was down nearly 0.1 percent. The Shanghai Composite gained 0.2 percent. Advertisement Tuesday on Wall Street, the Dow fell 49 points to 18,454, amid extremely light trading. The S & P 500 fell 4 points, to 2,176 and the Nasdaq composite fell 9 points, to 5,223. THE DAY AHEAD Business and economic news scheduled for Wednesday WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Association of realtors will today say how many Americans signed contracts to buy homes in July. Last month’s pending home sales index comes as the housing market sees strong buyer demand and a shortage of properties being listed for sale. Pending sales contracts are a barometer of future purchases. Also today, Germany — Europe’s biggest economy — will release August unemployment figures. MONSANTO-WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD SEC: Former Monsanto exec to get $22.5M as whistleblower ST. LOUIS (AP) — A former Monsanto executive who tipped off regulators about the agribusiness giant’s accounting practices involving rebates for its Roundup weed-killer will get nearly $22.5 million as a whistleblower. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Tuesday the payout comes out of the $80 million penalty the St. Louis-based company agreed to pay under a February settlement with the agency. That agreement resolved allegations that Monsanto Co. misstated its earnings by improperly disclosing the costs of a rebate program for Roundup. That had the effect of distorting Monsanto’s earnings reports for 2009, 2010 and 2011. The whistleblower’s name wasn’t released. That person’s attorney only identified his client as a former Monsanto financial executive. Tuesday’s award is the second-biggest the SEC has given a whistleblower since a $30 million payout in 2014. GOOGLE-CARPOOLING EXPANSION Google to expand Waze carpooling service in San Francisco SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google is set to expand a San Francisco carpooling program that could morph into a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The plans will build upon a test service that Google’s navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. Waze says anyone with its app will be able to request a ride within the next few months. Riders reimburse the drivers in the program for gas and wear on their vehicles. Google was an early investor in Uber. NOVARTIS-AMGEN-BIOSIMILAR Novartis wins US OK for biosimilar version of Amgen’s Enbrel U.S. regulators have approved the first near-copy of Enbrel, drugmaker Amgen’s pricey biologic medicine for treating rheumatoid arthritis and other immune system disorders. The follow-up version of Enbrel, dubbed Erelzi, was developed by Swiss drug giant Novartis, which would not disclose the planned list price for Erelzi. Novartis also couldn’t say when the new medicine will be launched by its Sandoz unit, which makes generic drugs and “biosimilars” — nearly identical versions of biologic drugs produced in living cells. Erelzi is the third biosimilar drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration. It’s also the second approved biosimilar developed by Novartis, and the second that will compete with an Amgen drug. Enbrel was first approved in 1998. It can cost about $4,000 per month without insurance. FARMWORKER OVERTIME California farm workers on edge over historic overtime bill MENDOTA, Calif. (AP) — Many California farmworkers are praising a move that brings them closer to receiving the same overtime pay as other hourly workers. The legislation is headed to the desk of Gov. Jerry Brown. He has not said if he will sign it. If he does, farmworkers will get overtime after eight hours in a day or 40 hours a week. Farmworkers now are not eligible for overtime until they have worked 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week. Tomato picker Florentino Reyes said Tuesday the overtime law would give him an extra $60 weekly and boost his purchasing power. But others fear their farmer bosses will respond by cutting back on working hours. Dairy worker Juan Valencia says his boss might do that to avoid paying more in overtime. DAVID’S BRIDAL-CEO David’s Bridal says its CEO has stepped down NEW YORK (AP) — David’s Bridal says its CEO Pam Wallack has left the company and chairman Paul Pressler will replace her. The company declined to comment on the reasons for Wallack’s departure after three years on the job. Pressler is a partner at the private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice that acquired David’s Bridal from another private equity firm in 2012, and has also served as president of Walt Disney’s retail division and CEO of Gap Inc. He brings an “extensive background in retail and a deep understanding of the brand, our customers and what it will take to continue to make David’s Bridal the ultimate destination for brides,” the company said in a statement. The Conshohocken, Pennsylvania-based chain operates more than 300 stores in 45 states. TRIBUNE TOWER-SALE Los Angeles developer buys iconic Tribune Tower in Chicago CHICAGO (AP) — The iconic Tribune Tower on Chicago’s Michigan Avenue will have a new owner. Los Angeles-based CIM Group has agreed to buy the tower for up to $240 million. Chicago-based Tribune Media announced the deal Tuesday. It’s expected to close by September’s end. Officials didn’t specify development plans for the 1925 neo-Gothic tower. Tribune announced last year that it had hired a real estate investment banker to explore a sale or partnership for redevelopment. The Chicago Tribune reports Tribune Media employees were told “operational headquarters” will remain in Chicago. Staff will be moved to a new space likely in the second quarter of 2017. The deal is part of Tribune Media’s ongoing efforts to sell its entire $1 billion real estate portfolio. The tower was named a city landmark in 1989. BOOZIER BEER Law takes effect scrapping cap on alcohol content for beer COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Craft brewers in Ohio now have the freedom to make boozier beers. A new state law takes effect today, scrapping caps on alcohol content for beer. Ohio is following the lead of other states in getting rid of its 12 percent cap that has been on the books since just after Prohibition. Craft brewers have flinched at anything restricting their ability to be creative and make stronger ales. Legislators say the law levels the playing field and makes Ohio even more attractive to smaller breweries looking to locate to the state. Craft beer is a $22 billion industry in the U.S., and sales were up last year nearly 13 percent over the previous year.

Asda, which boasts numerous stores across the city and throughout the surrounding region, is recalling its egg salad sandwich. The move comes after the company, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, discovered the product contains milk which is not mentioned on the label. The supermarket says this makes the product a possible health risk to anyone with an allergy or intolerance to milk or its constituents. A spokesman said: "It has come to our attention that a small number of packs of Asda egg salad sandwich with a use by date of August 29 may contain milk which is not declared on the packaging. "This could pose a risk to those customers with an allergy or intolerance to milk. "Our advice to consumers is that if you have bought the above product and have an allergy or intolerance to milk or its constituents do not eat it. "Instead, return it to the store from where you bought it for a full refund or contact Asda Customer Relations on 0800 952 0101." Read More Lidl recall lemonade over "undesirable odours and flavours" No other Asda products are believed to be affected. Asda has numerous stores across the city, including in Brade Drive and in Daventry Road. Last week, Ben & Jerry's have issued a safety warning over its products, with the company urging ice cream lovers to check their freezers and see if they are affected. Hundreds of Cookie Dough flavour ice cream are feared to have been contaminated with dangerous shards of metal. Customers across Coventry and Warwickshire who have bought 500ml tubs are warned there could be metal filings inside and should check the base for the batch number.

Related 'Hidden Figures' Counting To $20M+ In Another 'Rogue One' Marketplace - Midday B.O. Update Disney Rather than just unbox toys across several international time zones like last year’s “Force Friday” – which earned an estimated $1B in Star Wars Force Awakens merchandise retails sales – Rogue One toys are being revealed in #GoRogue, a four-part series of fan-made stop-motion animated shorts that spotlight the action figures. The shorts are rolling out throughout September on the YouTube Star Wars channel. However, unlike last year, when Force Awakens toys hit store shelves on the Friday of Labor Day weekend and created action figure sellouts at Walmart and Target within hours, fans will have to wait until Sept. 30 to pick up their Rogue One toys. (They can pre-order Rogue One goods starting this Friday.) Analysts reported that Star Wars merchandise rang up an estimated $5B in worldwide retail sales in the last year. #GoRogue was shot, directed and written by a team of Star Wars fans and features 40+ new toys; 300+ shots; 20K LEGO bricks and a line of merchandise from Hasbro, FUNKO, JAKKS Pacific, Mattel and the Disney Store. With stop-motion, it takes about 10 hours of shooting time to create 6 seconds of video. #GoRogue also kicks off a global shorts contest that commences Sept. 30 whereby fans can share their sketches online. Winning entries will be selected by a panel including Rogue One director Gareth Edwards. Grand prize: a screening of Rogue One as well as the winner’s short at Lucasfilm in San Francisco. All of this is a means by Disney to connect with the online social fervor of Star Wars fans prior to Rogue One. According to ZEFR online, when Star Wars news breaks, fans react by sharing videos online and in the last year they’ve posted 838K Star Wars-related content on YouTube. That translates into over 2K posts a day and about 96 posts an hour. Star Wars content yielded 16.3B views in the last year, equivalent to everyone in the world viewing at least two fan-created videos. “These fan-created shorts are a tribute to the incredible content that the Star Wars community posts online every day,” said Jimmy Pitaro, Chairman, Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media in a statement. “The Go Rogue campaign was designed with Star Wars fans in mind – we want them to be front and center in the run up to Rogue One by imagining and creating their own Rogue Stories.” Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 for $4B. Last year, the studio reignited the beloved sci-fi film franchise with the long-awaited Episode VII, Star Wars The Force Awakens, which posted a slew of B.O. records including highest domestic opening of $247.97M before becoming the highest-grossing film at the domestic B.O. with $936.7M. Worldwide Force Awakens is the third-highest title of all-time with $2.07B. Rogue One hits theaters on Dec. 16.     Filed Under: Business Breaking News Disney Lucasfilm Rogue One: A Star Wars Story Star Wars: The Force Awakens Subscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy 3 3 Comments Riga • on Aug 30, 2016 9:31 pm This is genius marketing Anonymous • on Aug 31, 2016 3:41 am Love it.

The plans will build upon a test service that Google’s navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Walmart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn’t trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider’s work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers’ belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber’s early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet’s senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber’s board because of potential conflicts with Google’s ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond’s departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to “continued cooperation and partnership” with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze’s carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple’s board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google’s Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple’s iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone’s software to create Android.

She was the editor of Reason magazine and a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, the Atlantic, the New York Times and Forbes. Her books include “The Power of Glamour” and “The Future and Its Enemies.” Read More. @vpostrel Aug 30, 2016 11:08 AM EDT a | A By Virginia Postrel The scandal that has devastated the business and reputation of Welspun India Ltd., India’s largest maker of home goods like sheets and towels, may also end up wrecking the prestige of Egyptian cotton. On Aug. 19, Target Corp. said that 750,000 Welspun sheets that were supposedly premium-priced Egyptian cotton were made of some other material. Target dropped Welspun as a supplier, immediately depriving the company of about $90 million in annual sales, or around 10 percent of its total revenue. Other Welspun customers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. are now investigating. Welspun admits it’s at fault. “There has been a failure on our part, without an ambiguity,” Managing Director Rajesh Mandawewala said in a conference call. “The error is on our side so we have to take responsibility for it.” But he declared that the problem was “fiber provenance,” not cotton quality. He's right. Legally, “Egyptian cotton” means exactly what it says. Not better, not softer, not stronger. Just grown in Egypt. People assume that Egyptian cotton is better because Egypt was an exotic place where cotton with long fibers was raised, beginning not in ancient times but in the early 19th century. Such cotton is known as long staple or extra-long staple, depending on the fiber length. It accounts for only about 2.5 percent of global cotton consumption. Longer fibers make for stronger, smoother thread, and “Egyptian cotton” sounds special, like Moroccan leather or French perfume. But it’s the long fibers, not some unique attribute of Egyptian soil or climate, that makes the cotton better. Not all Egyptian cotton has long fibers and not all long-staple cotton comes from Egypt. In fact, farmers there are decreasing the acreage devoted to producing it, because the demand for shorter staples is so much higher. In the past year, Egyptian cotton production has plunged more than 50 percent in response to changing government policies, with almost all of the lost acreage formerly devoted to long-staple crops. The U.S. has long surpassed Egypt as the world’s largest producer of long-staple cotton, known here as Pima, some of which is exported to, yes, Egypt. According to a March report from the Foreign Agricultural Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture: Egyptian extra-long staple cotton is not suitable to manufacture most of the fabrics produced in Egypt, as most of the yarns produced require medium and short staple cotton. Even those who manufacture yarns that come from extra-long staple cotton see U.S. pima cotton as [a] better alternative due to the latter’s higher quality. Although the prices of U.S. Pima cotton are higher than Egyptian extra-long staple cotton, the deterioration of the Egyptian extra-long staple cotton forced local spinners to rely on Pima cotton to produce high quality yarn. Since 1954, U.S. cotton producers have offered their own quality guarantee, using the Supima trademark to indicate not only provenance but extra-long staple cotton. The label lacks Arabian Nights glamour, but it’s a much less ambiguous term than “Egyptian cotton.” Target paid more for Egyptian cotton, so it’s rightly angry. But it’s not clear that customers should care. In fact, they’d be better off ignoring the Egyptian cotton label and just feeling the sheets for themselves. If they are equally soft and durable, Xinjiang or Queensland — or the San Joaquin Valley — is as good as the Nile Delta.

Police believe the suspects drive through neighborhoods after dark looking for open garage doors.  Ward Worley is one victim. He left his garage door open on the evening of August 19.  "I noticed I left the garage open, but I didn’t think anything about it," Worley said. "Then around 8 a.m. I got an alert from Chase.” Surveillance video from the Walmart near 133rd and State Line Road shows one suspect walking out with a flat screen TV. He used Worley's credit card to spend $852. Leawood police are looking for these two men in connection with multiple thefts. Later, the suspect swiped Worley's card again at the QuikTrip on Southwest Boulevard.  "According to the Leawood police, there are people that drive through our neighborhoods late at night, looking for open garage doors," Worley explained.  Police confirmed to 41 Action News they are also investigating two vehicle thefts from a neighborhood near 143rd and Mission Road. One of the stolen vehicles was recovered in Missouri.  ------   Lexi Sutter can be reached at lexi.sutter@kshb.com.

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) San Francisco • Google is preparing to expand a San Francisco carpooling program in a move that could that could set up a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The plans will build upon a test service that Google's navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn't trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider's work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers' belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber's early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber's board because of potential conflicts with Google's ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond's departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to "continued cooperation and partnership" with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze's carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple's board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google's Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple's iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone's software to create Android.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY 2 photos VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Garrison Keillor: Done.

Photo via Google. Uber, Lyft, and now, Google? The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Alphabet-owned Google is set to “take on Uber” with its own ride-sharing service that would charge “far cheaper rates” than competitors. Via Shutterstock. Earlier this year, Google piloted its service with employees at different companies like Walmart and Adobe from within its Waze navigation app. It now plans to allow any Waze user in San Francisco to use the new feature this fall, The Journal reported. However, as Recode noted, Google’s service won’t directly compete with Uber — not yet, at least. The key difference between Google and Uber/Lyft is its focus on carpooling versus an on-demand taxi business. The beta program, which lets drivers pick up passengers heading in the same general direction, charges riders 54 cents a mile — cheaper than Uber and Lyft — and Google does not take a cut. The idea seems to be less about drivers making money, and more on helping people carpool and cover gas costs. But Google could expand this into something that looks more like Uber or Lyft, and regardless, this would present a cheaper alternative to the existing services. This is the latest chapter in an ongoing relationship between Uber and Google, which was an early investor in Uber, pouring $258 million into the then-young startup back in 2013. The two companies also partnered on different features, like Google Maps telling you where the closest Uber driver was, for example. But last week, longtime Alphabet exec David Drummond left Uber’s board over concerns about conflict of interest. That conflict is now becoming more clear with Google set to expand its carpooling service. Uber is also developing its own maps software. Driverless vehicles are also important to keep in mind as Google, which has recorded more than 1.8 million miles of autonomous driving, and Uber, which is investing heavily in a self-driving fleet, are both committed to the new technology. Both Uber and Lyft have experimented with their own carpool-like services over the past several years.

Bailey Fendley says it happened as he drove his pickup down a part of Highway 78 that's in the Anniston city limits. The Glencoe man says he was in town to help a friend move to Heflin, and was on his way to the Oxford Walmart to have an extra key made. Fendley says as he passed an RV park and sales lot, and the Anniston Industrial Park, both on Highway 78, someone in an oncoming small, black car fired a shotgun one time. That one shot was enough to leave the driver's windshield of his Ford pickup riddled with holes. Fendley says it appeared to be one shot, with the multiple holes coming from buckshot. "Simultaneously, when we passed each other, I heard a loud clang noise," Fendley said. "And pulled off to the side less than a quarter mile down the road. I even pulled my shirt up and made sure I wasn't hit, you know." Fendley says he saw no obvious signs of road rage or any other motive, and assumes the incident was random. "I mean a lot was going through my head, really, like who it could've been, if I was a target or if it was just random, um, the reason for it, just, a lot of stuff was going through my head all at once," Fendley said. Anniston police Captain Curtis McCants tells WBRC his investigators were going over the report today and double checking a few items. He did not say whether there were any suspects.

The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said. Inviting more people to hitch rides could undercut Uber, which allows people to request drivers who provide a taxi service using their own cars. Unlike Uber, Waze isn’t trying to make money for itself or the drivers offering to share a ride. Instead, Waze sets a variable fee of up to 54 cents per mile to reimburse the drivers for gasoline and maintenance on their vehicles. The riders pay that fee. Waze also limits trips to a rider’s work or home, with a maximum of two trips per day. Although riders can request a ride at any time, Waze is focusing the service on providing trips during peak commute times in the mornings and evenings. Only one rider is allowed per vehicle. In contrast, Uber touts its around-the-clock service as a way for its drivers to make a decent living or supplement their incomes. Uber also hopes to eventually turn a profit itself to justify its financial backers’ belief that the privately held company is worth more than $60 billion. Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., was among Uber’s early investors. It invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. But the two companies now appear headed down a road more likely to make them foes than friends. Things already have become tense enough to prompt David Drummond, Alphabet’s senior vice president of corporate development, to resign from Uber’s board because of potential conflicts with Google’s ambitions in transportation. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick confirmed Drummond’s departure from the board Monday in a statement that described him as a sage adviser and great personal friend. Kalanick also said he looked forward to “continued cooperation and partnership” with Alphabet. Uber declined to comment Tuesday on the planned expansion of Waze’s carpooling service in one of its biggest markets. Besides testing the Waze carpooling service, Google has been building self-driving cars for the past seven years. Uber is now designing its own robot-powered vehicles and is using some of the autonomous cars to provide rides in Pittsburgh. Google has previously gone to battle with its former allies. In the most prominent instance, then-CEO Eric Schmidt served on Apple’s board for three years, but stepped down in 2009 as Google’s Android operating system for smartphones began undercut sales of Apple’s iPhone. Before he died in 2011, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told his biographer that he believed Google had stolen ideas conceived for the iPhone’s software to create Android.

Estimated read time 1m 26s How did Listeria get into recalled veggies? By Rachel Rettner / Livescience.com 4:50 PM August 30, 2016 About 30,000 cases of precut vegetables are being recalled in many Southeastern states because they could be contaminated with Listeria. But how, exactly, do these bacteria get into veggies? This week, the food manufacturer Country Fresh announced a recall of several of its vegetable products — including precut onions, mushrooms and peppers — after one of its products being sold in a Georgia grocery store tested positive for Listeria bacteria. The recall affects products sold at a number of grocery stores — including Walmart, Harris Teeter and Winn-Dixie — in nine Southern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia). Listeria is found naturally in soil and water, and animals can carry the bacteria without appearing sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Raw vegetables can become contaminated with Listeria either through contact with soil or with animal manure that is used as fertilizer, according to the Mayo Clinic.  From there, Listeria may get into a food processing factory, where it might live for years on equipment, according to the CDC. Unlike many other types of bacteria, Listeria can grow in the colder temperatures of refrigerators and freezers. “It’s a pathogen that’s particularly problematic in food-processing plants because it really likes cold, moist, dark environments,” Benjamin Chapman, a food safety expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, told Live Science in a 2015 interview.

But ALDOT says 'not so fast'. As of now, they have no plans to add an additional light. “The new Walmart opened, there's a traffic light there. The new Kroger. They have a traffic light," said Mary Lynne Wright, President of Madison Hospital. It's been an ongoing battle for the hospital to try to get a traffic light. Wright says their traffic flow has more than doubled in 4 years. She says the light, at one point was approved. But the city asked to take it-- to give to Target.    She claims they were promised they would still be getting one. "We just feel strongly about a hospital that's grown as fast as we have really needs a traffic light," said Wright. And those feelings just keep growing now that Hwy 72 is growing from 4 lanes to 6." They're actually going to make three lanes going east and west, and instead of us getting a traffic light, now if you want to go west you would have to turn right out of our campus, cross three lanes of traffic, do a U-turn to turn west," Wright says. In other words: No light. Not only is it inconvenient to make the switch, Wright says she believes it's dangerous. "You know our real concern for that is when you come to a hospital, you have a lot on your mind. You're not always necessarily thinking about your driving skills," said Wright. Now there is another entrance, but "The back entrance of this hospital was never intended for public through-put. The back entrance is for employees, delivery trucks and ambulances. We would have designed the hospital differently if we were going to do that," said Wright. The back entrance can be accessed via Balch road, with does have a red light, and is only about 1,000 feet from the main entrance. ALDOT says having two red lights that close together on an already congested road way could potentially increase accidents, and congestion: two things they're trying to improve with this project. ALDOT says the plans remain in design and are undergoing revisions. They will continue to look at this entrance to see if there are other ways to improve it.

India has been converting GDP to jobs at only two-thirds the average of other Asian countries, and at half Vietnam’s rate. Moreover, the low employment elasticity of the Indian economy has declined even further in the last decade. With over 60 million new entrants being added to India’s working age population, creation of jobs must be the principal concern for India’s policy-makers. As Albert Einstein said, one cannot solve tough problems by using the same approach that may have caused them. To create more jobs, India’s policy-makers must change their mindsets. Reframe the approach to education and skills Uncertainty about the effects of technology is clouding prospects for employment in manufacturing, services, and even knowledge industries worldwide. Industries are being radically transformed. Moreover, shapes of enterprises and jobs are changing. Bank branches are being made redundant by smart phones. Big box retailers like Walmart are struggling with online retailers like Amazon. Changing shapes of industries, enterprises, and jobs make it very difficult to predict what skills will be required in future. The education and skills system can no longer be designed like an assembly line with pre-set content. It must be reframed to enable young people to discover opportunities and jobs as they arise, and to be quickly able to learn the skills that will be required. The thrust of teaching in universities, technical institutions and schools must be to develop better lifelong learners. Pedagogy must change. As industry landscapes change, competition will arise for enterprises from outside the present borders of their industries. Large size and incumbency will not be sufficient in new competition. Only those enterprises will survive that are able to learn and change themselves faster than others. The only resource any enterprise has with the ability to learn and improve its own abilities is human beings. Human beings are the only ‘appreciating assets’ of an enterprise whose value can increase over time as they learn. The value of all other resources of the enterprise—its machinery, materials, even technology—will depreciate with time. Therefore, in a fast changing world, employers would do well to ‘humanise’ their enterprises, and not only ‘digitise’ them. Reframe the idea of productive enterprises The policy discourse about India’s jobs problem never fails to point out that over 90 per cent of jobs in India are in the ‘informal’ and ‘unorganised’ sector, and in small enterprises. In fact, most of whatever jobs growth has taken place in India has been in this sector of the economy. ‘Informal’, ‘unorganised’, and small, sound bad compared to ‘formal’, ‘organised’, and big. Therefore, the mindset is to convert informal and unorganised to formal and organised, and to prefer big to small. What effect will this have on the job-creation potential of the Indian economy must be examined. How will the conversion of micro, informal, and unorganised enterprises into organised forms of enterprises (in the ways in which formality and organisation are presently understood) improve the job creation potential of the Indian economy, when formal, organised, large enterprises are not creating jobs in India? Rapid developments in technologies are enabling enterprises to be viable on much smaller scales than before. 3D printers are a ‘one-person factory’ with the scope of capabilities that previously required large factories with many special machines. Desktop publishing has made large printing presses unnecessary. Organisational technologies, such as cooperatives and clusters, have enabled small enterprises to acquire scale in marketing, procurement, and capability development, even before the advent of new technology powered platforms. Now, technology powered platforms are increasing the efficiency and reach of networks, further increasing the potential of small enterprises. Human beings are not the scarcest resource in the Indian economy. The measure of an enterprise’s contribution to an ecosystem must be in how efficiently it uses the scarcest resource in the system. Large, formal, organised enterprises use more capital, and more energy, and less people. The thrust of policy must not be to mindlessly bring micro enterprises into prevalent forms of formality and organisation. It must be to reframe the concept of productive enterprises—even in the large sector. Reframe the concept of industrial policy The idea of ‘industrial policy’, which was rubbished with the Washington Consensus, is returning, even in the US and UK, with pressures to create more domestic jobs. However, the concept of industrial policy must change. ‘Picking winners’ can no longer be a sound industrial policy. Because governments cannot predict too far what the shapes of industries will be. Industrial policy for a country must be a process of learning. It is a process of “crossing the stream by feeling the stones underneath,” as Deng Xiao Peng said. Economies grow when enterprises learn to do what they were not capable of doing before. Human beings within them acquire skills they did not have. Thus countries become competitive and their economies grow. Good industrial policy is not a document. In a dynamically changing world, industrial policy has to be a process for coordinated learning amongst government, regulators and stakeholders. Improve the process and outcomes will improve: faster growth and more jobs.

Source: AAP 31 Aug 2016 - 10:10 AM  UPDATED 31 Aug 2016 - 10:10 AM Tweet Google is preparing to expand a San Francisco carpooling program in a move that could set up a showdown with its one-time ally, the popular ride-hailing service Uber. The plans for the US city will build upon a test service that Google's navigation app Waze launched three months ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. The program allows anyone using the Waze app to offer a ride to a limited pool of people trying to get to work or home. Now, only people working at six companies, including Google, Wal-Mart Stores and Adobe Systems, can request rides. The tests have worked well enough to encourage Waze to move into the next phase and allow anyone in the Bay Area with its app to request a ride by the end of this year, spokeswoman Julie Mossler said.

(WIAT) — Anniston police are searching for the person who shot at a passing car. The driver is OK, but he has a warning for drivers to be aware of their surroundings. Bailey Fendley says he was heading to Walmart down Highway 78 in between Anniston and Oxford. It was still daylight when a car heading the oppose way fired one shot as their cars were passing. He says he immediately pulled over to make sure he was OK. His windshield was riddled with what looks like bird shot from a shot gun. Nothing made it through the windshield, but Bailey says he’s really lucky because his window was open. Bailey said, “You never think it is going to happen to you. You hear about random acts of violence every day, but you never think it’s going to happen to you.” His mother says she posted a picture of the damage to Facebook to try and raise awareness and get the word out. The post has been shared more than 550 times. She says multiple people have reached out to her, “I’ve had a couple people message me and say they know people in Anniston, that the same things happened to them. So hopefully, it raises awareness.” Police are investigating. If you have any information, contact local authorities.

MUST CREDIT: Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg. Google's carpooling service, which is being offered via Google's... Going head to head with Uber and Lyft, Google plans a fall introduction of a low-cost ride-hailing service in the Bay Area, according to the Wall Street Journal. Based on Google’s social-navigation app Waze, the service sounds closer to carpooling than on-demand taxi rides. It would connect Waze drivers with riders who are going in the same direction, with low fares so the drivers would not use it as a primary source of income, the Journal said. In a pilot Waze carpooling program taking place around Google’s Mountain View headquarters since May, rides averaged around 54 cents per mile. That’s the Internal Revenue Service mileage reimbursement rate to cover fuel, maintenance and other costs, and it is used by several carpooling apps as the payment from riders to drivers. By contrast, the UberX service is considerably more than 54 cents per mile. (UberPool, which matches unrelated riders going the same way, has cheaper rates, but they’re still much higher than 54 cents a mile.) Google’s pilot program involved 25,000 workers at large employers such as UCSF, Adobe and Walmart Global eCommerce, as well as Google itself. Waze announced today a new carpool service in San Francisco The new service is by invitation only "to a select group of employers and their employees in the Bay Area," Waze says But if it grows popular, it could put Google in direct competition with ride-hailing giants like Uber and Lyft the Waze Rider app simply matches users with a driver heading their same direction like a virtual version of a casual carpool Media: Wibbitz Any of Waze’s 700,000 Bay Area users could participate in Google’s program as either a driver or rider. Unlike Lyft and Uber, Google will not vet drivers with background checks, instead relying on passenger reviews, according to the Journal, which said the Bay Area program could expand to other regions as well. ALSO The Dow, Yahoo Finance, and Trump all miss their targets Boston turns into hotbed for shoe companies State Farm still overcharging some customers, state says One-time allies Google and Uber have been increasingly competing lately, to the point where David Drummond, a senior executive at Google’s parent company, Alphabet, resigned from the Uber board a few weeks ago “given the overlap between the two companies,” he wrote in an email to the Journal. GV, Google’s venture capital division, invested $258 million in Uber in 2013. Google has been muscling into the transportation arena with its work on self-driving cars, a technology that Uber is also fiercely pursuing. Uber plans public tests of robot taxis in Pittsburgh in the next few weeks, beating Google to commercial testing. Ride-hailing is a natural application for driverless cars, and Google reportedly would like to test its own vehicles in a ride service. Waze, which Google bought in 2013 for $1.1 billion, has been testing a carpooling application in its native Israel since last year. The turn-by-turn navigation system, which relies on community input to generate the best ways to avoid traffic, learns its drivers’ routes to work to match them with riders going the same way.

Diced peppers and onions. Some precut, packaged vegetables from Country Fresh are being recalled over possible Listeria contamination. Getty Images/iStockphoto Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email About 30,000 cases of precut vegetables are being recalled in many Southeastern states because they could be contaminated with Listeria. But how, exactly, do these bacteria get into veggies? This week, the food manufacturer Country Fresh announced a recall of several of its vegetable products — including precut onions, mushrooms and peppers — after one of its products being sold in a Georgia grocery store tested positive for Listeria bacteria. The recall affects products sold at a number of grocery stores — including Walmart, Harris Teeter and Winn-Dixie — in nine Southern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia). Listeria is found naturally in soil and water, and animals can carry the bacteria without appearing sick, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Raw vegetables can become contaminated with Listeria either through contact with soil or with animal manure that is used as fertilizer, according to the Mayo Clinic.  [Top 7 Germs in Food That Make You Sick] 11 Photos Foodborne illness: The most guilty foods list Here are the foods most likely to make you sick from nasty bacteria like salmonella, e. coli and more From there, Listeria may get into a food processing factory, where it might live for years on equipment, according to the CDC. Unlike many other types of bacteria, Listeria can grow in the colder temperatures of refrigerators and freezers. “It’s a pathogen that’s particularly problematic in food-processing plants because it really likes cold, moist, dark environments,” Benjamin Chapman, a food safety expert at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, told Live Science in a 2015 interview. Other foods that have been historically linked with Listeria outbreaks include raw milk, unpasteurized soft cheeses and deli meats, Chapman said. So far, there have been no reported cases of anyone becoming sick with Listeria from Country Fresh’s recalled vegetables, Country Fresh said in a statement. But Listeria infections can be serious, and even deadly, particularly for certain groups of people, including young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems. The infection can cause fever, muscle aches and diarrhea, and in pregnant women, it may cause miscarriage or stillbirth, the CDC says. The CDC offered the following general recommendations to reduce the risk of Listeria infection: Rinse raw produce, including fruits and vegetables, before eating, cutting or cooking. Use a produce brush to scrub firm vegetables, such as melons and cucumbers. Dry produce with a clean cloth or paper towel. When preparing food, separate uncooked meats from vegetables and cooked foods. When you handle uncooked foods, be sure to wash your hands afterward, as well as the knives and cutting boards you used for the foods. Do not drink unpasteurized milk. Heat ready-to-eat foods and leftovers until they are steaming hot. People at higher risk of infection, such as pregnant women, should not eat hot dogs, luncheon meats, cold cuts or other deli meats unless they are heated to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). They should also avoid eating soft cheeses, unless the label says it’s made with pasteurized milk.

Jan 03, 2017 Products and Trends>Food and Beverage Q&A: Why the 'humane economy' is the new norm Humane Society CEO Wayne Pacelle on merging our values and actions, cage-free eggs and why companies that rely on animals must evolve or perish. Jenna Blumenfeld - Blogger | Aug 30, 2016 Treatment of animals has markedly improved over the last century. Myriad groups across the country are focused on finding “forever homes” for stray cats and dogs (and horses and parrots and lizards). Per Bob Barker’s persistence, animals are routinely spayed and neutered. And importantly, every single state has laws that criminalize mistreatment of animals—often resulting in a felony. But responsible strides still lag for animals being raised for food. Millions of hens are confined to battery cages—enclosures that allow for only 67 square inches of space, too small for hens to even stretch their wings. Sows are restrained in 2-foot-wide cages throughout their pregnancies, also called gestation crates. Related: 3 plant-based food categories with momentum in the natural channel All this is horrifying for obvious reasons. But in his new book The Humane Economy: How Innovators and Enlightened Consumers are Transforming the Lives of Animals (William Morrow, 2016), Wayne Pacelle, CEO of the Humane Society of The United States, says that meaningful improvements in animal welfare are not just good for animals and our moral compass. Humane business practices are now essential for modern capitalism to flourish—increasingly mindful consumers won’t stand for it otherwise. Here, Pacelle discusses how the new economy—the humane economy—is good for you, good for animals and vital for the bottom line. What’s the elevator pitch for the “Humane Economy”? Wayne Pacelle: It’s about marrying our values with our commerce and business practices—separating them not only produces bad outcomes for society, it also undermines the success of business and government. Any business or government that has animal cruelty baked into its operations is facing unprecedented risks in society and in industry. For example, SeaWorld recently ended the breeding of orcas because children in classrooms were boycotting them, and customers were complaining. SeaWorld saw their stock declining, and they realized that in order to succeed in business, they had to move into animal protection. How has the Humane Society shifted into the food industry—how did that transition occur from an activist standpoint and what’s the vision going forward? WP: The largest number of at-risk animals are caught up in the food production system: 77 billion animals worldwide, and that number excludes fish. One of the biggest concerns we’ve had is the intent of confinement on factory farms, so we’ve been focused on laying hens, veal cows and sow pigs. We have pressured trade associations and food retailers to change the way they do business and to end this era of confining laying hens in small battery cages where the animals are immobilized. In my book, I recount how we are changing the most basic operations in the veal, pork and egg industry. In the last year we’ve gotten 200 major food retailers, including Kroger, Safeway and Wal-Mart, to phase out their purchases that confine animals in cages. I think it’s easy for lots of folks to get on board with the “humane economy.” Consumers understand it. It feels good. But how exactly does the Humane Society convince big brands that rely on animals for profit to make this shift? WP: Executives at these big brands want to do the right thing. When we make the scientifically sound case and say [animal cruelty] is awful, it softens them up because they are people too. Plus, this is where the mass of customers are moving. It’s disqualifying for companies. When animals are mistreated, you often see other bad outcomes in society, too. [Overcrowded factory farms] produce so much waste in the environment, and overuse of antibiotics might eventually render them useless for humans. I think the convergence of so many social concerns is driving these changes in the food industry. But it’s truly a major revolution. We’ve had this intensive confinement of animals during my whole lifetime—we’re now unwinding this. Several large food chains have recently made commitments to improve their sourcing practices for animal products, for example McDonalds said they would transition to cage-free eggs by 2025. This is good. But what needs to be done from a supply standpoint to accelerate such commitments? WP: Some of these companies are phasing in cage-free eggs immediately. The year 2025 doesn’t mean when they start… it’s when they finish. Essentially what we have now is 300 million laying hens in the United States. A year ago, 270 million of 300 million hens are in confinement. Over the next twenty years, we’ll see 10 to 20 million hens per year getting out of these cages. No new traditional cages for hens are being built. Is cage-free good enough? Should these commitments placate us? WP: What we have is a minimum standard when we have cage-free. At the very least, animals with legs and wings should move. And it’s up to consumers to lift the standards higher. Some people are going to demand that these animals live their whole lives in a way that reflects conscious concern for their well-being. There’s going to be a lot of variety in the marketplace. But now, cage-free is the new normal. Conscious consumers are going to reach for higher standards. Some people won’t eat eggs or meat at all. In your book you mention the growth of companies that offer animal product-free alternatives, including Hampton Creek, which makes vegan mayo. Should humane consumers be totally vegan? WP: I think it’s an outstanding option for people who want to steer clear of animal exploitation. What we have is a host of entrepreneurs who are giving us options we never had. If you can mimic the taste and texture of meat, eggs or milk, and get all the protein but none of the fat and cholesterol and none of the animal cruelty, what’s the problem with that? People will have the same sort of palate experience without any of these social costs. Moral intention combined with human ingenuity is going to give us a pathway to a more humane society. We’ve already won the moral argument—there are very few people who say that animals don’t matter. Still, when we are so physically removed from these problems, [animal welfare] doesn’t seem urgent. Animals aren’t slaughtered in front of us; the hen is out of the picture. When you educate people, and give them a product that competes on price, taste and health but is so superior on the moral dimensions, it liberates us. It gives us new options. Do you follow a specific diet? WP: I’ve been a vegan for a long time. I became vegan when I was a college student at Yale—I saw images of factory farming and it turned me off. I just decided I was going to get out of the entire enterprise. But at the Humane Society, our metric is progress not perfection. We want people taking steps to make a difference, and celebrating these steps. Like Meatless Monday? WP: Yes! I was recently on Oprah’s show, SuperSoul Sunday, and she asked me what people can do to help stem animal cruelty. I said Meatless Mondays are a great way to start, and she later urged her Twitter followers to do the same. Do you have any pets? WP: I do. I have a dog named Lily, and she’s a rescue. She was about to be euthanized when we adopted her and she’s the love of my life. Her sister is Zoe the cat. I saw this beautiful stray kitty one day when I was walking Lily, and I scooped her up. How can we move the dial on animal cruelty specifically as it relates to raising animals for food in other countries, too? WP: We need a global movement for animal protection. [The Humane Society] has an international arm and we’re active in 50 countries now, just as we’re doing so in the United States. We have to confront these challenges all over the world.
