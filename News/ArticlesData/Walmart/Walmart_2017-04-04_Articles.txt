Destany Parrish, now 19, described one instance where Tad Cummins, who is accused of aggravated kidnapping and sexual contact with minor Elizabeth Thomas, 15, sang her a 'love song' in the Culleoka Unit School music room. Cummins, 50, and Thomas both disappeared on March 13 and were last seen together on surveillance video from a Walmart in Oklahoma City on March 15. 'I definitely think, on his end, it was a bit more than a friendship — its hard not to think that now,' Parrish told People magazine.  Scroll down for videos  Destany Parrish, 19, has come forward saying she now thinks a teacher accused of abducting one of his teenage female students exhibited 'grooming' behavior with her when she was 15 years old 'We’d sit [in his classroom] and talk about everything and anything,' Parrish said, describing her relationship with Cummins in 2011 and 2012, when he first began teaching the the Culleoka, Tennessee school. 'I never saw anything wrong with our friendship. He made me feel safe and he tried to do that with all of his students, so I never saw it as too weird.' Her opinion changed, though, when she found out about Cummins' accused abduction and alleged sexual contact with minor Elizabeth Thomas. Parrish said the coverage of the disappearance of Cummins and Thomas reminded her of a song he performed for her back she was only 15.  'I started recording because it surprised me how well he [played],' she said. 'I definitely didn’t focus on the lyrics at the time. I kind of thought about it [later] but I didn’t think about anything bad, I didn’t process them because it was Tad, the person I trusted.' Parrish recalled one line from the song to be, 'I could swim for a thousand miles in the oceans inside your eyes and never reach the side.' 'He was the one that everybody trusted,' Parrish said, adding that she shocked initially upon hearing the allegations lodges against Cummins. '[Up until recently] I was in a lot of denial.'   Elizabeth Thomas (left) and Tad Cummins (right) have been missing from Tennessee since March 13 Thomas's father, Anthony Thomas, said he believed Cummins used his time in school to 'groom' his daughter.  'He built up a system where she was dependent on him,' he said, of what he described as Cummins’ alleged efforts to woo the high school freshman. Parrish described Cummins as presenting himself as a confidant for students.   This revelation from Parrish comes after Tad Cummins' wife of 31 years, Jill Cummins, filed for divorce earlier this week.  She cited 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' on her husband's part as reasons for the termination of their marriage, according to court papers obtained by WKRN. Jill Cummins has previously spoken out,  pleading with her husband to 'do the right thing' and bring Thomas back to her family.  Meanwhile, Cummins' wife Jill Cummins filed for divorce on Friday citing 'irreconcilable differences' and 'inappropriate marital conduct' by her husband of 31 years; she is seen here at a press conference aired on Fox AMBER Alerts have been issued over the disappearance of Elizabeth Thomas on March 13 'This is not who you are. We can help you get through this,' she said. 'No matter how far you’ve gone or what’s happening right now, God’s grace is sufficient for you, and He wants you to come home.' It is not known at this time whether Thomas went willingly with Cummins, her former high school teacher. Two weeks before Thomas and Tad Cummins disappeared, a student claimed to have caught the two kissing on January 23 and administrators pulled Thomas from the teacher's classes. Tad Cummins was later, though not immediately, suspended. He was fired from his teaching job after the two disappeared on March 13. Since then the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) has received thousands of tips, but has confirmed only the March 15 Walmart sighting of the two together.  In the surveillance photo, Thomas appeared to have dyed her hair from blonde to red and wore a men's plaid flannel shirt while Cummins had dyed his beard from gray to black. Additional video of the visit later showed the two in discussion as they entered the store, with the teenager looking upset with the man wanted for her kidnapping.

Share this article Share On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before they left the store.  Prior to the Oklahoma City sighting, Cummins was last seen on March 12 buying hair dye at a Walmart, while wearing the plaid shirt that Thomas was seen in on the March 15 video.  The last time the pair was seen was on surveillance video taken at a Walmart in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma on March 15 On their March 15 trip to Walmart the two purchased a few food supplies which Cummins paid for in cash before hitting the road Thomas, who is one of ten children, made frequent posts on social media about romance and love in the weeks before she disappeared. She also started calling herself 'wife' on Instagram and made several references to a 'mission' that was 'almost complete.' On March 13, she told family she was going to spend the day with a friend. Thomas was seen on surveillance footage that same day carrying a bundle of clothes. One of her siblings has since revealed that the teenager told them to call police if she did not return home that night. Authorities say they believe Cummins has been grooming Thomas her for sex for some time. Thomas' estranged mother, Kimberly Ann Thomas, spoke to DailyMail.com earlier this month in an exclusive interview. She shared her fears about her daughter's alleged abduction. Cummins was seen at a Walmart on March 12, one day before the disappearance, purchasing hair dye She labeled her daughter's captor as 'disturbed' and said she worried Thomas would either end up pregnant or dead. Elizabeth Thomas' sister, Sarah Thomas, also spoke about the situation on Good Morning America last week.  The young girl fought back tears as she revealed that Cummins had begun showing up unannounced at her sister's work shortly before the pair disappeared together, and that his last visit had come just two days before the alleged abduction. 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' said Sarah Thomas. 'She thought it was the only way. She felt uncomfortable.' Elizabeth Thomas's family is still holding out hope that they will see the girl again, and are begging any person who might have information to reach out and contact authorities. Elizabeth Thomas's sister, Sarah Thomas (pictured) said that Cummins had been showing up at Thomas's work unannounced 'She would go and tell people to tell him she wasn't there and she would go and hide until he left,' said Sarah Thomas, pictured here second from the R with members of the Thomas family 'It feels like she just vanished, and I know that's impossible, someone had to see her,' said the victim's sister. Her father, Anthony Thomas, meanwhile was optimistic about the teenager's eventual return home to be with her family. 'We just live for that day where we are gonna get a phone call that says, "We're alright and waiting for someone to get me,"' he said. Investigators have learned that the two had been sending love letters to one another which were at times sexually charged by writing draft emails on a shared classroom computer at Culleoka School. They poured over email drafts that the two would send one another while in school for any clues into where the pair may be.

Share this article Share Those letters were all sent after the student claimed to have witnessed Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas kissing in his classroom in January. 'They would write the message and let it save as a draft. The other person would log in, read the message and then delete it and then write another message that was saved as a draft,' said Maury County District Attorney Brent Cooper. 'If you read them you would immediately recognize you are reading messages between two people who have a romantic interest in each other.' One of the emails uncovered by authorities was written by Tad Cummins and began: 'I saw you standing next to your backpack this morning.' The teacher then told the student how nice one of her body parts looked to him in the note.   The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is leading the hunt for the pair. Elizabeth Thomas;s last known whereabouts is believed to be Alabama. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. She has blonde hair and hazel eyes, and is 5 feet 5 inches inches tall and weighs 120 lbs. Cummins, who is described as being 'armed and dangerous,' was seen driving a Silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee license plate 976ZPT, according to the TBI. He is 6 feet tall and weighs 200 lbs, with brown hair and eyes. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Tad Cummins and Elizabeth Thomas is being asked to call 1-800-TBI-FIND.     Read more: New details on relationship between former teacher and missing student | Watch the video - Yahoo Good Morning America Tad Cummins¿ wife files for divorce amid ongoing AMBER Alert | WKRN News 2 Tad Cummins: Student Describes Friendship with Teacher Share or comment on this article e-mail Most watched News videos What happened when we sent a female reporter to catcall men?

Tonight Mainly clear. Low near 40F. Winds SW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: April 4, 2017 @ 10:55 pm Full Forecast Toggle navigation Contact Us Personnel Advertise e-Edition Subscribe News Sports Obituaries Lifestyle Opinion Multimedia Classifieds Weather Letter to the editor: The impending Walmart invasion is of great concern By NORM HAUGHNESS Apr 4, 2017 Updated 5 hrs ago A few Tehachapi residents have written to the Tehachapi News expressing a welcoming attitude toward the imminent threat of Walmart invading our tranquil mountain fastness. Most people, however, are neutral about it. Until, that is, they discover what Walmart does to towns even larger and more resistant to the degradation this retailing monster inevitably wreaks on American communities. Walmart sells cheap because it buys cheap, typically from 37-cents-an-hour Asian slave labor instead of decently paid Americans. This is the dirty secret of Walmart's boast, "Low prices. Always!" In the history of the world, there has never been so rich and powerful a corporation with so little regard for its 2.1 million employees or its impacts on the communities it burdens. Typically, what are Walmart's effects on a town it takes over? Take Kirksville, Miss., a town just a little bigger than Tehachapi. After Walmart's Supercenter barged in, supermarkets and other stores failed left and right, losing 15 solid jobs for every 10 minimum-wage jobs Walmart created. And this is the regular pattern, not an exception. The lowest possible wages, poor or no benefits, poor job security — all these convert a community of former independent business people with their valued employees into a herd of Walmart "associates," barely making it, paycheck to measly paycheck. By these means, Walmart always debases the average income of towns it invades. Always. A member of the Greater Tehachapi Economic Development Council has said in support of Walmart, "It is vital that we keep consumer spending local." A curious statement. Local merchants whose wares and services we buy spend their money here. The money we spend at Walmart is immediately shipped off as profits to Bentonville, Ark., to make the world's richest family, the Waltons, richer than ever. For a factual look at this omnivorous corporation's real impact on the small towns it assaults and on the U.S. economy generally, check out walmartwatch.com or any of the following books: "The Case Against Walmart," by Al Norman; "The Wal-Mart Effect," by Charles Fishman; "How Walmart Is Destroying America," by Bill Quinn; or the feature-length DVD, “Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price,” directed by Academy Award winner Robert Greenwald. Once you know, you care. Once you care, you no longer welcome Walmart's invasion. A community vote on this issue might well help keep Walmart from being foisted upon us. Many of us would really like to see a show of hands — informed hands — in a referendum. For those interested, the Tehachapi school district’s boundaries define the affected area well.

By Renwei Chung Mar 31, 2017 at 4:28 PM Shares459 Natasha Bowman “Turn your face towards the sun / Let the shadows fall behind you / Don’t look back, just carry on / And the shadows will never find you.” — Rihanna Earlier this month, Natasha Bowman delivered a presentation, at the Employment Law and Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., titled Equal Opportunity Bullying: How Even Lawful Behavior Can Put Your Organization at Legal Risk. Bowman has developed a reputation as an expert consultant and thought leader for organizations like The Heritage Foundation, Knowledge International, and Wiley Publishing, among others. Her expertise spans human resources management, talent management, employment law, organizational development, sourcing and recruiting, collective bargaining, and ethics and compliance. Because of her ability to diagnose workplace issues and provide proven solutions to organizations, she is often referred to as “The Workplace Doctor.” Bowman founded Performance ReNEW last year with the mission of developing the next generation of organizational leaders. Here is a (lightly edited and condensed) write-up of my conversation with Natasha Bowman: Renwei Chung (RC): What motivated you to attend law school, and how did you choose University of Arkansas School of Law? Natasha Brown (NB): When presented with my options for enrollment and scholarship opportunities, I chose the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville due to its close proximity to the home office of Walmart Stores Inc. Because I was still determining whether or not I would use my JD to practice labor and employment law or as a tool to continue my career in HR, I thought if I could land an opportunity with Walmart while in law school, I could be exposed to both sides. RC: Performance ReNEW focuses on developing leaders. How can lawyers become better leaders? NB: Just like with leadership any organization, leaders in the legal field should not just focus on becoming a subject matter expert, but also on developing their soft skills such as emotional intelligence. Due to the nature of law, many lawyers already possess many of the skills necessary for leadership: effective communication, persuasion, the ability to negotiate. But they should also leverage those same skills that they use to practice law to engage the workforce within their law offices. RC: Earlier this month, you gave a presentation on bullying in the workplace. How does bullying affect workplace culture? NB: Bullying can have a major impact on workplace culture. Not only can it affect morale, reduce employee engagement, and increase turnover, it can also lead to extreme stress amongst employees. What many fail to realize is that it can also result in legal implications. Many organizations have the mistaken belief that workplace bullying is legal as long as it the person doing the bullying isn’t discriminatory in their actions. The reality is that employees do in fact have other legal avenues that they can pursue other than Title VII claims, such as through state workplace tort laws. RC: You mentioned that “you are responsible for your own career development,” and you wish you knew this fact earlier in your career. Can you expound on this? NB: I, like many others, often depended on my employer for my career growth and development. Additionally, I thought if I was doing everything right at work by exceeding expectations, going above and beyond, and reaching organizational goals, then I’d be on a guaranteed path to promotion opportunities. However, I found that that was just simply not the case. I am solely responsible for reaching my professional goals and dreams. While many organizations have given me opportunities for development and growth that I will always be grateful for, I am living by a saying that I read a while back: “If you’re not making your own dreams come true, you’re making someone else’s.” RC: Can you tell us more about your career path and the importance of building a personal brand? NB: My career path has been very unique. After graduating from law school, I had the opportunity to work for a Fortune 500 company, one of New York’s largest employers, and to teach at some of the most prestigious schools in the country, such as Georgetown University and Fordham University; however, most if not all of those opportunities came to me rather than me going after them. I have worked very hard over the past 10 years or so building my personal brand. I have over 20,000 connections on Linkedin that are about 99% in my professional field. Additionally, I constantly keep in touch with my past employers and colleagues. I spend a good amount networking at events as well. All of these actions have played a role in my career path. RC: Your book, You Can’t Do That at Work: 100 Common Legal Mistakes that Managers Make in the Workplace, comes out on May 6. Can you give us a brief overview? NB: Through my work as a legal academic, human resources practitioner, and consultant, I kept seeing many managers and organizational leaders making the same mistakes that were resulting in legal claims being filed against them. What I came to realize is that most organizations are well aware of basic federal labor and employment laws, but often struggle with the interpretation and application of them. They are often shocked to hear that these are not as black and white as they appear. Who would have thought having a policy of being respectful at work could potentially violate the National Labor Relations Act? This book explores those gray areas of labor and employment laws and gives real-life scenarios of what those laws really mean and how they really impact workplaces. RC: It was great chatting with you. Is there anything else you would like to share with our audience? NB: It was great chatting with you as well. I wish everyone reading this article the very best in their careers and challenge them to make the most of every opportunity that is presented to them. If no opportunities are presented then, they should go out and seek them. Much success to you all. On behalf of everyone here at Above the Law, I would like to thank Natasha Bowman for sharing her story with our audience. We wish her continued success in her career.

Sanders-Weaver told police when he placed the knife under Kirby’s jaw he told him, “Don’t be a bitch, be a man, and quit talking shit behind my back.” Sanders-Weaver was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and battery-threatens with weapon. Sanders-Weaver is being held in the Laramie County Jail on $5,000 cash bond. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for April 7.

First, Wal-Mart is an awful corporation. Second, many of us end up at Wal-Mart regardless of that first fact due to any number of reasons — geography, selection, hours, sadness, boredom, etc.. Third, writing anything on the internet is perceived by racist commenters as an invitation to blindly spew hate, even if it's about something as innocuous as umbrellas, but the cowardly and ignorant most definitely brush their Confederate flags aside and earnestly get to action on the keyboard when you talk about the intersection of economics and social classes at America's bargain basement hellhole. (Which is ironic because until this summer, it was one of the few places you could reliably find the racist flag for sale.) Yelp reviews bare out all those truths and more in stark 1-star reviews filled with bile and worse. Which is all by way of saying if you comment here or on Facebook, keep your racist comments to yourself. Now that all that's out of the way... It should be said and it should be said publicly and it should be said forcefully: The Steelyard Wal-Mart Supercenter is the worst Wal-Mart in America.  If you do a quick Google search, that title, at least when it comes to search engine optimization and previous righteous tirades, is currently held by the Wal-Mart in Martinsburg, West Virginia. We not so humbly beg to differ. There's really no comparison. We'd regale you with the blow-by-blow that got us to this breaking point, but you've likely been there yourself. The lines that stretch across an acre or two as two cashiers do the best they can as a manager looks on with complete indifference. The pervasive lack of concern for anything resembling customer service so widespread and institutionalized that it couldn't be casual or coincidence, that the only possible explanation is a mandatory seminar all employees take to learn how to be so completely inept at even the most basic aspects of their job. The shelves that never seemed stocked, and when they are, stocked in such a manner as to create a portrait of a forsaken wasteland long shuttered from public view, the consumer version of ruin porn shots of defunct amusement parks or condemned warehouses. The waits. The waits for literally anything. To be rung up. To get photos. To have paint mixed. To, god forbid, check the inventory of an item not on the shelf. The parking lot, a cemetery of mish-moshed metal left over, we imagine, from a failed and abandoned experiment to build a Transformer entirely out of shopping carts. The store itself a miracle, an unobserved island of the Walton empire that they have long since forgotten about and probably assume had already closed. That is all. It's the worst. Please don't shop there. Don't make the same mistakes we've made.  Tags: Rants, Steelyard, Wal-Mart, Image Jump to comments (137) Tweet Email Print Favorite Saving… Share Speaking of...

Police said Shane Ultimo, 21, of Hackettstown, at 1:43 p.m. Friday concealed $89 worth of items at the Wal-Mart store by placing them into a bag. He then allegedly placed the bag onto a shelf for Lauren Capalbo, 27, of Hackettstown, to retrieve, police said. Capalbo then entered the store, picked up the bag and went to customer service to try to return the stolen goods for a gift card, police said. A store loss prevention officer however, was onto the scheme and detained the pair until Mansfield officers arrived. Additional store video surveillance footage showed Capalbo making two other fraudulent returns on March 13 for $88 and $80, respectively. Drunken man tries to steal Nazareth police car, cops say Capalbo was charged in that incident with two counts of theft while Ultimo was charged with theft and driving with a suspended license. Both were released pending a court appearance. But Capalbo didn't follow instructions by police to stay away from Wal-Mart, police said. She returned the day after the incident -- Saturday -- and was cited with defiant trespass. Pamela Sroka-Holzmann may be reached at pholzmann@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow her on Twitter @pamholzmann.

About several hundred Black+Decker table saws sold exclusively at Walmart stores are being recalled, due to a risk that the included stand may collapse, which could pose a major injury risk if it occurs while the table saw is in use.  The portable table saw recall was announced by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) on March 31, impacting approximately 400 Black+Decker 10-inch table saws with model number JT2504BD. While there are no reported injuries due to problems with the Walmart Black+Decker table saws, the CPSC warns that the risk of the stand collapsing unexpectedly could cause both laceration and injury hazards for operators. The recalled table saws sit on a black metal foldable table stand, and have Black+Decker and JT2504BD printed on the front right side. The table saws were sold exclusively at Walmart stores nationwide, and on Walmart.com for about $190, from February 2016 through August 2016. They were manufactured in China by Rexon Industrial Corp. Ltd. of Taiwan, and distributed by Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas. While the CPSC is not labeling it a recall expansion, a similar table saw recall was issued in early March, impacting about 45,000 table saws carrying the Craftsman label. Those were sold at Sears, and had either a similar or identical Rexon table saw stand. That recall came after 11 reports that the portable stand had collapsed, with nine reports of injuries, including broken bones, hand and finger injuries, lacerations, a shoulder strain, and one injury resulting in a partial finger amputation. The CPSC recommends that consumers immediately stop using the recalled table saws and contact Rexon for a free replacement stand by calling 866-934-6360 or by visiting the company’s website at www.rexon.net and clicking “Safety Information.” Related Stories Craftsman Table Saw Recall Issued After Injuries Reported From Collapsing Stands (3/8/2017) Makita Circular Saw Recall Issued Due to Laceration Hazard (10/27/2016) Grizzly Table Saw Recall Issued Due to Risk of Blade Teeth Breaking Off (8/20/2015) DeWalt Table Saw Lawsuit Filed Over Lack of SawStop Technology (5/14/2015) Black & Decker Lawn Mower Problems Result in $1.575M Civil Penalty from U.S. CPSC (4/30/2015) Tags: Black & Decker, Laceration, Table Saw, Walmart Tweet Share Your Comments First Name* Last Name Email* Shared Comments* I authorize the above comments be posted on this page* Yes No Have Your Comments Reviewed by a Lawyer Provide additional contact information if you want an attorney to review your comments and contact you about a potential case.

Comments (2) aAFont Size Search mug shots, government salaries, crime maps and more at our Right2Know page. An assailant is sought in robberies of two elderly women outside two different Wal-Mart parking lots in Arkansas, police said. The robberies were reported within 15 hours of each other — the first about 5 p.m. Saturday in Forrest City and another around 7 a.m. Sunday in Blytheville, according to a news release. In Forrest City, an elderly woman, whose age was not released, reported being robbed by someone wielding a butcher’s knife as she loaded groceries into her vehicle outside the Wal-Mart on Deaderick Road. Hours later, an 87-year-old woman told authorities that she was robbed of her purse outside the Wal-Mart on Arkansas 18 in Blytheville. That victim was injured and transported to a local hospital for treatment on her hip, police said. Detectives were later able to link that robber to the initial report in Forrest City, which is nearly 100 miles southwest of Blytheville. A witness to the Blytheville robbery observed a white male entering a vehicle with a Texas license plate and fleeing the area before officers arrived. That same vehicle — a light-colored, four-door car with a rusted out rear fender and dents on the front fender — is believed to have been used in the Forrest City armed robbery, according to authorities. Police say the robber is believed to have since traveled north on Interstate 55. Anyone with information is asked to call the Blytheville Police Department at (870) 763-4411.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. Our picks and opinions are independent from any business incentives. If you're shopping for headphones for your kids, the safest option is a pair that limits the maximum volume. Out of nearly 20 models we tested, the best ones are the Puro BT2200 volume-limiting wireless on-ears. They're a bit pricier than most, but they're well-built, sound great, and have effective wired and wireless volume limits—when used properly. Why should you buy volume-limiting headphones? Because even cheap earbuds can dangerously exceed the levels recommended by health experts. Noise-induced hearing loss can start showing up in even young children, and it can have long-term impacts on their academic performance. Worst of all? Many volume-limiting headphones are capable of exceeding their advertised limits with nothing more powerful than an iPhone. To sort out the good from the bad, we put 19 models through the ringer in our state-of-the-art audio lab. If you want to dig into the nitty gritty of how we tested, why, and what a $25,000 dummy wearing kids' headphones looks like, I highly recommend you read our full report. If you just want to know what to buy, here's what you need to know: Experts recommend a max volume of 85dB for no more than 60min/day. For adults, noise exposure is considered hazardous after 8 hours at 85dB(a). An iPhone's earbuds can easily average 105dB at full volume, which can be hazardous after just a few minutes. Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is permanent. NIHL is cumulative, may not become apparent until years later, and it may affect up to 1.1 billion people. Caution is key—we don't know exactly where the "safe" threshold is. Volume-limiting headphones are not a guarantee of safety. We used an iPhone 7 Plus for our tests, but anything more powerful—like an amp—could drive even the best wired models we tested above recommended levels. Your best bet is to go wireless if possible, or just turn the volume to about 60% of the max. The Puro BT2200 headphones look good, sound great, are durable, are well-designed, and have effective volume limits.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / TJ Donegan) Puro Sound Labs BT2200 Kids Headphones Best Overall   If you're looking for a high-quality pair of volume-limited headphones, the Puro BT2200 is the way to go. Though they're the priciest of the pairs we looked at, that's because they have the best combination of comfort, build quality, and sound quality. They are a bit too big for a toddler, but they should fit school-age children and up quite well. In our tests, the BT2200s played at about 82-84.6dB(a) when used wirelessly at full volume, with about 12 hours of battery life. And because they run off their own internal power when in Bluetooth mode, there's no risk of them being overpowered. When used wired with our standard source (an iPhone 7 Plus with the Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter), they topped out right at the 85dB(a) threshold—as long as you plug the volume-limiting cable in the right way. Our one issue is that the cable can easily be plugged in the wrong way (I did, the first time). This pushed the max volume to 96-100dB(a) in our tests, which could cause damage. The cable does have "Headphones→" written on it so you know which end is which, but these should really be designed so the cable only plugs in the correct way. Where to Buy: $99.99 at Amazon JLab Audio JBuddies Studio Over-Ears The JLab JBuddies Studio Over-ear headphones are the new kid on the block when it comes to kids' headphones, but they were among our favorites with an attractive, folding design. They are designed for kids six and up and feature soft padded earcups that pull down far enough to accommodate even adult-sized heads. The braided, tangle-free cable is non-removable, but that also means there's no way to circumvent the volume limits. Speaking of which, the JLab Studio Over-ears were super effective in our testing. With industry-standard pink noise these averaged just 80.9dB(a), which was well below the recommended levels. The real-world samples we used registered a bit louder, but they only got up to about 82.3-86dB(a) with our iPhone, which isn't bad at all. If you're looking for a great pair of headphones that an older child can grow with, these are a good pick. Where to Buy: $29.99 at Amazon Sakar Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Headphones Best Value   If you need headphones for a younger child, or you just don't want to spend $99 on something your kid will break anyway, then these affordable on-ear headphones are the ticket. Manufactured by Sakar, these Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle-branded headphones feature soft padded earcups and a non-removable, volume-limiting cable. In our tests with an iPhone 7 Plus, these topped out at around 80dB(a) on average and at worst got to 85.3dB(a) during the guitar solo at the end of Sweet Child O' Mine. We weren't in love with the sound quality and these won't stand up to a ton of abuse, but they're affordable, keep to recommended levels when used with most everyday sources, and they come in a ton of different variations featuring popular characters like Batman, the Ninja Turtles, and Hello Kitty. Where to Buy: $2.29 at Amazon $11.99 at Best Buy $23.19 at Walmart $19.99 at Kohl's Sakar Hello Kitty Best Value   These are also made by Sakar and are identical to the TMNT ones above, except with Hello Kitty branding. Why get two identical pairs in for testing? Because it's a common tactic among headphone companies to stuff multiple models onto one Amazon page so all the user reviews are in one big pool. Normally this is just annoying, but for kids headphones it could potentially mean safer models are pooled in with ones with less-effective volume limits. Though we can't guarantee all 14 variations of this model are identical, these two sure are. This Hello Kitty version was within 0.1dB(a) of the Ninja Turtles model and both were below the 85dB(a) threshold when used properly. These are cheap and will probably break at some point, but the same could be said of almost every pair in this roundup. Where to Buy: $9.95 at Walmart $19.99 at Kohl's LeapFrog Headphones Though these are marketed as working primarily with LeapFrog's line of tablets and other devices, these are just standard over-ear headphones like all the rest on this list. That means they'll work with any source that has a headphone jack. They're well-built, comfy, and a bit bigger than the other models on this list, so they'll be a bit loose on a toddler but will fit an older child or a pre-teen well. These are marketed as having a maximum volume of 85dB, but in our tests they output around 88dB(a), with certain songs pushing them up to 90 or 91dB(a) for short stretches. That's a bit louder than is suggested, so you'll want to set volume limits on whatever device you're using so they fall safely within the recommended levels. Still, for a good pair of all-around headphones for a slightly older child these aren't a bad bet—if you take other precautions. Where to Buy: $18.00 at Amazon $22.89 at Walmart Onanoff BuddyPhones The Onanoff Buddyphones come in four flavors on Amazon: Standard, Explore, Explore Foldable, and Inflight. We only tested the standard model, but they were quite good for the sub-$20 price. They are still made of plastic, but they don't feel quite as cheap as the worst models in this batch and the padded earcups are comfy. The cable isn't removable (which means if it breaks you have to replace the whole pair), but it is flat, tangle-free, and has a sharing port built right in so two people can listen to a single device. We should note that we can't make any claims about the safety of the three higher-end models in this lineup, but the standard Buddyphones topped out between 77-82dB(a). That's well below the 85dB(a) threshold the WHO recommends, so these should be fine for normal listening sessions of an hour when used with most everyday audio sources like a smartphone. Where to Buy: $19.99 at Amazon Cozyphones Kids Headphones And now for something completely different: the Cozyphones. These are designed unlike any other headphones we've tested before. Unlike most headphones, these have thin drivers that are inserted into a stretchy, fabric headband. The design is fun and unique, but the fabric felt very warm after just a few minutes and older kids may just not want to wear them. In our lab testing these also proved to be just too loud for our liking. They hit between 93-95dB(a) in our tests, which is above the 85dB(a) threshold we're aiming for. That may be fine for short bursts, but it's too close for our comfort and we think there are better options in this list. Where to Buy: $2.29 at Amazon $18.97 at Walmart LilGadgets Untangled Pro Premium These super-popular wireless headphones are a bit cheaper than the Puro BT2200 Bluetooth models that were our favorites overall, and they're not a bad alternative. Even though we have some reservations about the wired version (the LilGadgets Connect+ Premium), these were much better. They're still more flimsy than the Puro BT2200s, but they seem comfy and well-built. In our tests, these did a great job of keeping noise to the recommended level—when used wirelessly. With Bluetooth these tested from 83-87dB(a), which is close enough to the mark. The issue is that the included wire doesn't do enough (if anything) to limit volume, and in wired mode these got up to 92.4-96dB(a). That's a bit too loud according to the experts, so if the battery runs out or you need to use the wire, you'll want to set hard volume limits. Where to Buy: $49.95 at Amazon $49.00 at Walmart Kidz Gear Wired Headphones for Kids Kidz Gear makes two of the most popular kid-friendly headphones on the market, and this wired pair is affordable and available in a number of fun, bright colors. They're also quite flimsy and mostly made of plastic, but the biggest issue is that they don't have a built-in volume-limiting cable, relying on an adapter instead. The problem? This adapter is small and easy to lose. It's even easier to remove intentionally. And while these were under the recommended level in our tests with the adapter (hovering between 82-85dB(a)), they were way too loud without it, topping out at around 108dB(a). Unless you plan to watch your kids like a hawk all of the time, these aren't the best option. Where to Buy: $2.29 at Amazon $19.99 at Walmart MEE Audio KidJamz KJ25 Like many of the headphones in this roundup, the MEE Audio Kid Jamz are mostly made of plastic and feel a bit cheap. But with a price under $20, you get what you pay for as far as design quality goes. These do feature a neat design touch, though: a plastic switch to turn the volume limit on or off. The switch is hidden under a piece of plastic that actually makes it quite tricky to get at. (I had to use a pair of tweezers, as even a ballpoint pen couldn't reach it). Making the switch difficult to access is important, because these were safely within the recommended level with the limit on (between 75-80dB(a)) and very loud with the limit off (between 103-107dB(a)). That makes these a bit of a high-risk, high-reward proposition. They're perhaps the quietest headphones we tested with the limit on, but if your child is old enough to easily turn the limit off, they're way too loud. Where to Buy: $14.99 at Amazon $14.99 at Best Buy $14.99 at Walmart $24.99 at eBags.com The kids headphone market is a mess, with multiple companies selling re-branded versions of the same headphones.  (Photo: Reviewed.com / TJ Donegan) LilGadgets Connect+ Premium The LilGadgets Connect+ Premium headphones were probably the most intriguing pair of headphones we tested in this group. These are affordable, well-reviewed on Amazon, and they feel like they're well-built, with a removable cable and two ports so you can hook up a second pair of headphones. In our tests they were too loud to be used at full volume (94-96dB(a)), but generally these seem like a decent pick if you can lock in lower volume limits. Where these get real fishy is when we compare these to the Snug Play+ and Nenos Children's Best headphones; they are identical, despite being from ostensibly different companies. Is this a case of multiple companies re-branding the same headphones or one company selling the same headphones under multiple brands? We just don't know. These are definitely the best of the three, but it makes us wary. Where to Buy: $10.56 at Amazon $21.50 at Walmart Nenos Kids Headphones Avoid   The Nenos Children's Best headphones are identical in almost every way to the LilGadgets Connect+ Premium and the Snug Play+ headphones. No, really: they're the same headphones. Though they have different branding and the companies appear entirely unrelated, all three headphones look the same, sound the same, tested the same in our lab, and even come in boxes that are shaped the same way. Our guess? These are all from the same Chinese white label company and all three companies just bought them up and re-branded them because this is a popular category online. The main difference seems to be the companies selling them, and both the Nenos and the Snug Plays have issues there, with spotty user reviews that make us question if these are a wise investment beyond the fact that they're too loud. Where to Buy: Buy now at Amazon Snug Play+ Kids Headphones Avoid   As we talked about in the blurbs above, these are identical to the Nenos Children's Best and the LilGadgets Connect+ Premium headphones. They're all the same pair of headphones outside of a few minor adjustments to the branding. As with those two, these are louder than the experts recommend. If you like what these have to offer, we'd recommend the LilGadgets model first; they seem to be the most responsive on Amazon and have the longest track record. The Snug Play+ should be avoided, though; the seller on Amazon apparently has a habit of making unsolicited phone calls to buyers asking for user reviews. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Where to Buy: $17.95 at Amazon AmazonBasics Volume Limited On-Ear Headphones for Kids Avoid   While we love Amazon's house brand AmazonBasics for many things, these are not the best choice if you want headphones for your kids. They're flimsy, they have mediocre sound quality, and they don't limit volume nearly enough in our tests—even with something as simple as an iPhone. In our tests they produced between 95 and 100dB(a), which is well above the recommended levels. They weren't as loud as even stock Apple or Samsung earbuds, but they could easily be unsafe if used improperly for long stretches of time. Where to Buy: $14.99 at Amazon Editor's Note: The original version of this article featured the JLab JBuddies (Non-Folding), which we purchased from a marketplace seller on Amazon for testing. That model has been discontinued and it appears the unit we tested may be defective, so we have removed it from the roundup. We are working with JLab to test their current volume-limiting headphones and will update once that testing is complete.

Tuesday the retail giant opened a branch of the academy in Bangor–the first of its kind in Maine. Against the backdrop of a graduation ceremony for the Walmart Training Academy’s newest graduates, company officials announced the opening of the academy’s newest location at their Bangor store. “So today we’re opening several academies throughout the United States, and the Wal Mart academy is a training. We take our associates through a very rigorous training process for several weeks,” said Walmart vice president and regional general manager Paul Busby. The Bangor training facility is one of 200 opening across the country by the end of this year. “What will happen is we will cycle out throughout Maine associates as well as assistant managers and they will graduate. We’ll have classes ongoing throughout the year,” said Busby. Students will come from across the state–and range from new hires to 20-year veterans. “It is exciting. I mean we have an opportunity, we’re going to meet people from different stores, different areas. Going through the academy myself I have learned a lot from it,” said Mia Herr, a graduate of the academy and a general merchandise support manager at the Bangor Walmart. Training includes classroom instruction as well as time on the floor. “We always start the day going out on the floor. We tour the store, we walk the departments, we talk to the people that work in those departments. And it is very hands on,” said Herr. After two weeks, trainees receive diplomas–a momentous occasion for graduates and their families.

According to the criminal complaint filed by Patton Township police, an officer was dispatched at about 10:30 p.m. Feb. 22 to the Wal-Mart on North Atherton Street. An individual who was possibly intoxicated was reportedly removing his clothing while inside the store. Upon arrival, an employee told the officer that the male had left the store and was now lying on the ground in the parking lot between parked vehicles, police said. The officer reportedly observed a male, identified as Brett J. Buchanan, 25, lying face down between two vehicles. When the officer asked Buchanan if he was OK, he reportedly stood up and faced the officer. He was allegedly “very unsteady on his feet” and extremely sweaty, repeatedly stretching out his sweatpants, pulling them down and up and exposing himself to the officer, police said. The officer took Buchanan to sit in a police car for his own safety and called for an ambulance, police said. The officer noted Buchanan’s eyes were “unusually constricted” and a frisk when the ambulance arrived revealed an empty syringe and syringe caps. Buchanan was taken to Mount Nittany Medical Center for examination and treatment, police said. Wal-Mart employees reported they had observed Buchanan staggering around the area of the front cash registers and pulling his sweatpants down, police said. He reportedly appeared drunk and a customer had reported that a male had exposed himself to him while in the men’s bathroom. Video surveillance from inside the store reportedly confirmed the employee reports of Buchanan stumbling near the registers and pulling on his pants, police said. A toxicology report made available March 29 indicated the presence of multiple controlled substances at the time of his examination in February. Buchanan was arraigned via summons Tuesday by District Judge Ronald Horner, according to court documents, and charged with one misdemeanor count of indecent exposure and one summary charge of public drunkenness. A preliminary hearing is set for May 3.

clock menu more-arrow Amazon Wants to Dress You The e-commerce giant knows how to sell you underwear, but can it fill the rest of your closet? by Chavie Lieber Apr 4, 2017, 10:00am EDT A model on set at Amazon Fashion’s Brooklyn photo studio. Photo: Brian Ach/Getty Images tweet share pin In 2012, on the first Monday in May, Jeff Bezos stepped onto the red carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City for the annual Costume Institute gala — the fashion world’s biggest, best, most exclusive event — wearing a black Tom Ford tuxedo with a white pocket square and patent leather shoes. The Amazon founder was dressed to impress. His company had sponsored the blockbuster evening, along with that year’s accompanying exhibit, “Schiaparelli and Prada: Impossible Conversations.” As honorary chairman of the gala, Bezos was stationed at the top of the museum’s stairs, greeting industry celebrities and actual celebrities alike alongside Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, designer Miuccia Prada, and actress Carey Mulligan. Bezos was dogged about allying his e-commerce juggernaut with the fashion community, and his efforts didn’t just pertain to philanthropy. Leading up to the Met Gala, the tight-lipped CEO told the New York Times that Amazon was making a “significant” investment in fashion. Though Amazon had previously acquired a few fashion e-commerce companies, Bezos was now keen on building a dedicated fashion hub on its own flagship site. The hub, to be known as Amazon Fashion, would have a special landing page to direct shoppers to clothing and accessories and promote Amazon partnerships with fashion brands; it would also have its own merchandising and editorial teams. Jeff Bezos with his wife MacKenzie at the 2012 Met Gala. Photo: Randy Brooke/WireImage In anticipation, Bezos hired Cathy Beaudoin, a Gap executive who started the now-defunct shoe site Piperlime, to head up the project known as Amazon Fashion; Julie Gilhart, a former fashion director at Barneys, was brought on as a consultant. Amazon convinced designers like Michael Kors, Vivienne Westwood, and Tracy Reese to sell their products on Amazon Fashion, and the company was in the process of building a 40,000-square-foot photo studio in Brooklyn where it could shoot original photography for the site. But even with all these efforts — and the Tom Ford tux — Bezos was decidedly out of his element at the Met. While he told model Elettra Wiedemann, who hosted the event’s very first (and last) livestream, that Amazon “really wanted to participate in this gala as a way of showing our commitment to this industry,” he had also admitted to Bloomberg earlier that morning that “before we got involved, this event wasn’t on my radar at all.” A photo of Bezos looking bored, with his bowtie slightly askew, surfaced on Vogue and eventually hit tech blogs, where he was teased for not being able to fake his interest in fashion for very long, even if he was dining next to Scarlett Johansson and Mick Jagger. Five years later, Bezos and Amazon have not backed off their aggressive pursuit of fashion. Since 2015, the company has sponsored New York Fashion Week: Men’s. Last year, it premiered a 30-minute HSN-style shopping show called Style Code Live that airs live every weeknight on Amazon.com and picked up The Fashion Fund, the documentary-style show about the process behind the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund competition that previously ran on Ovation TV, and Hulu before that. These days it’s also sponsoring international fashion weeks, notably in India and Japan. Plenty of brands have entered into official partnerships with Amazon since the Met Gala, too. There are now dozens of premium fashion labels selling their wares directly on the site, including Stuart Weitzman, Kate Spade, Rebecca Taylor, Milly, Frye, Marc Jacobs, Gucci, and Ferragamo. (Hundreds more brands are sold by third-party sellers via Amazon’s massive free-for-all marketplace.) Even Gap CEO Art Peck told investors he was open to wholesaling to Amazon — an unusual move for the once-dominant company. With its newly robust list of brands, Amazon seems to be making good on what Beaudoin told the Seattle Times back in 2013: “We want to be a great department store, like Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom, and Saks." It’s worth noting that while Amazon is on the upswing, those great department stores are in serious trouble. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, department store sales shrunk from $67.56 billion in 2011 to $60.65 billion in 2015; meanwhile, Amazon’s clothing and accessories sales nearly quadrupled from $4.3 billion to $16.4 billion during that same period. Macy’s is currently the largest fashion retailer in the country, but according to finance firm Cowen & Co., Amazon will soon replace it, with a projected $28 billion in apparel sales this year. So yes, when it comes to Amazon’s fashion ambitions, this is just the beginning. In 1994, at the age of 30, Jeff Bezos left his executive position at an investment firm on Wall Street and moved to Texas. It was the start of the dot-com era, a time when internet usage was growing at an annual rate of 2,300 percent. According to the story Bezos repeats in the rare interviews he grants, he made a list of 20 items he guessed could sell easily online, which first and foremost included books. Bezos and his wife MacKenzie eventually relocated to the Seattle area, where big tech companies like Microsoft were based. He launched Amazon out of his suburban garage with his first four employees in July 2005. The company’s initial $300,000 investment came from his parents, according to Josepha Sherman’s 2001 biography Jeff Bezos: King of Amazon. Within its first month of operation, Amazon was seeing $20,000 of sales each week selling books to users in all 50 states and more than 45 countries. Customers flocked to the user-friendly site that became known for speedy shipping, personalized recommendations, and a community of avid reviewers. It also got a little help from a new search engine company called Yahoo that sent users to Amazon via its “What’s Cool” list. The manifest destiny of Amazon is to be the biggest retailer in the world. By 1996, Amazon employed 151 employees and was bringing in $15.7 million in net sales. The company filed for IPO in 1997, and in 1999, Bezos was named Person of the Year by Time for single-handedly invigorating online shopping. Within a decade of going public, dethroning Walmart, the world’s largest company by sales, became the goal. This is where clothes come in. “The manifest destiny of Amazon is to be the biggest retailer in the world,” says Brad Stone, author of The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon. “They run this blueprint again and again each time they enter a category. Bezos understands that if Amazon will ever come close to the sales of Walmart, he’ll have to add groceries and apparel.” In 2006, according to the Wall Street Journal, Bezos traveled to New York to meet with designers “but apparel executives were reluctant to entrust their brands to a retailer known for cut-throat prices and a utilitarian approach to displaying products.” Left to his own devices, Bezos began the clothing crusade on his own. He first bought Shopbop, which was estimated to bring in some $30 million in annual sales at the time thanks to loyal return shoppers who appreciated the site’s well-merchandized selection of cool, contemporary brands. The next year Amazon launched the shoes and accessories e-commerce site Endless.com, which was meant to face off with Zappos. But ultimately Amazon couldn’t contend with the site, a customer favorite for its then-unusual free shipping and returns policy, and it ended up buying the company instead in 2009 (Amazon shuttered Endless.com in 2012).

In 2011, Amazon debuted the membership-based flash-sale site MyHabit, a move to directly compete with Gilt Groupe, which was thriving at the time and boasted a valuation of approximately $1 billion (Amazon shuttered MyHabit last year). Amazon introduced the contemporary menswear website East Dane under the Shopbop umbrella in the fall of 2013. That same year, that giant photo studio in Brooklyn opened, and in 2015, Amazon opened another such studio in London. The Amazon Fashion project was in full swing — because despite all of his high-profile launches and acquisitions, Bezos realized that building out a dedicated fashion space on Amazon was the only way to truly maximize profits. This is largely due to Amazon Prime, the website’s two-day-shipping subscription, which Stone says “turns people into Amazon addicts.” “Amazon Prime is the engine that drives Amazon,” he explains. “It capitalizes on irrational human behavior, where people are maximizing their membership. The whole point of getting people to sign up is for them to always be on the Amazon site, buying more.” Plus, clothes are lucrative. As Bezos told the New York Times back in 2012, “gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item.” American shoppers spent $273.67 billion on new clothing last year, according to Euromonitor, of which Amazon currently has a 6.6 percent market share. The bulk of Amazon’s clothing sales, however, are currently in the functional basics category, meaning socks and undergarments.

Photo: Stephen Lovekin/WireImage Retail consultant Sucharita Mulpuru thinks Amazon would fit perfectly as a retailer “that competes with Old Navy and Macy’s,” but John Blackledge, a senior research analyst at Cowen, says Amazon is clearly after the mid-to-upper market with its fashion venture “simply because of the ticket on luxury.” “Apparel has some of the highest margins, and in luxury fashion, Amazon knows people who want something unique won’t mind spending a bit more for it,” says Blackledge. It certainly helps that a whopping 70 percent of upper-income households in the U.S. (those earning more than $112,000 annually) are Amazon Prime members. One former Amazon employee, who worked on the fashion team and agreed to speak to Racked on the condition of anonymity, says the company’s aggressive foray into the space is about them wanting to be at the “center of every conversation.” “As they enter and take over literally every single industry, this is just another way of Amazon being relevant,” the former employee says. “They know that a lot of shoppers don’t see them as a credible source for fashion, but they are taking this very seriously and trying to get designers on board so they can have another piece of the pie.” On the brand end, it’s not surprising that so many fashion companies are choosing to wholesale with Amazon. Amazon has logistics down, from top-of-line fulfillment centers to sophisticated backend tech, and these are companies that need to expand their own e-comm footprints, given the slowdown of in-store shopping. Better to get aboard the Amazon train than have to shutter hundreds of stores or declare bankruptcy like their peers. These days, there are two ways to describe retail: a shit show, and Amazon. “These days, there are two ways to describe retail: a shit show, and Amazon,” says Scott Galloway, an adjunct professor of marketing at NYU’s Stern School of Business. As Blackledge explains, “Amazon is the only one that’s not stuck in the vicious cycle of declining foot traffic that’s leading to declining sales that’s forcing stores to close. They are in a constant virtuous cycle.” “In many cases, fashion companies are turning to Amazon because it’s a life support at this point,” adds Mulpuru. “They see the dying retail environment, and then they raise their eyebrows when they see Amazon’s growth and eventually cave out of desperation.” For smaller brands, there’s also the benefit of exposure. Scott Studenberg, one of the partners behind the contemporary line Baja East, which was a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist and sells on Amazon, puts it simply: “It’s a brand that has one of the biggest reaches in the world.” “I was at a party in LA with Kate Hudson, who was wearing this amazing gray, strappy jersey dress,” he continues. “I said, ‘I love your dress!’ and she said, ‘Oh, I got it on Amazon.’ Kate Hudson! It just shows all the different types of people that are shopping on Amazon, whether it’s for groceries or a dress.” Chris Gelinas, the designer behind the brand CG, who was also a CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund finalist, admits he was initially hesitant about selling on Amazon because “it represented a different type of shopping, and I was already concerned about online because my clothes are so tactile.” After Amazon worked with Gelinas to create a landing page for his brand, he was sold. “It shifted when I saw how much effort they put into storytelling,” he says. “They put a lot of work into shooting the clothing so they could capture the core message and hone in on the idea of clothing being crafted and authentic. There were definitely certain stigmas it carried for me, but that didn’t last beyond seeing the attention and space Amazon was giving to a brand as new as mine.” A look from Baja East’s spring 2017 collection. Photo: Estrop/Getty Images A look from CG’s spring 2017 collection. Photo: Victor Virgile/Getty Images Gelinas adds that while CG is simultaneously keen on growing its direct-to-consumer business, “I now have a customer base I couldn’t ever even have thought of accessing without Amazon.” That exposure doesn’t just come from Amazon’s own enormous platform or its digital advertising efforts, which increased 224 percent last year — during the 2016 holiday season, it spent more on TV ads than Walmart and Target, according to WWD. “They put my clothes in a television commercial!” says Gelinas. “At the end of the day, getting my product into the hands of the people who want it is all I’m after, and there are now women all over the world who can access CG because it's sold on Amazon.” Even brands that don’t necessarily need the exposure say an Amazon partnership is valuable. Shoshanna Gruss, the designer behind womenswear label Shoshanna, sells her clothing at stores like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. She also sells her three largest categories (swim, ready-to-wear, and evening) on Amazon. “Brands were nervous to try selling on QVC or do an exclusive line for Target. Now they’re lining up to do either,” says Gruss. “It’s important for these brands to adapt with the digital world. Amazon Fashion was the next step for us, as customers look to Amazon for everything and it has such a large reach. Everyone trusts Amazon, so getting our product in front of loyal Amazon customers really opens more doors for us.” No one looks at Amazon and thinks that it’s a great partner. It’s considered the evil empire. For every CG or Shoshanna that openly (and glowingly) talks about its partnership with Amazon, though, there are many, many more that refuse to discuss their relationship with the e-commerce giant. Out of the 50 brands that were contacted for this story, nearly every single one declined to participate; Kate Spade, Rebecca Minkoff, Marc Jacobs, See by Chloé, Stuart Weitzman, Mara Hoffman, Rachel Comey, Lacoste, and New Balance are just some of the brands that comprise this list. Other companies agreed to participate but backed out at the last minute out of concern for Amazon’s reaction. (Amazon also ignored multiple interview requests from Racked.) “No one wants to talk about Amazon because it’s a dirty little secret that they are slowly migrating to the platform,” says Harriet Greenberg, a partner at Friedman LLP. Galloway, the NYU professor, suggests that “no one looks at Amazon and thinks that it’s a great partner. It’s considered the evil empire.” And while there are high-end brands selling products on Amazon, the selection is often limited to entry-level items like handbags, sunglasses, and perfume. Fashion companies, ultimately, are saving the good stuff, like clothing and footwear, for higher-end retailers. “Everyone in fashion looks down on Amazon, and as a brand, you don’t want to be shouting that you are selling there,” says Nivindya Sharma, a senior editor at trend forecasting agency WGSN. “There’s a balance between wanting sales and wanting exclusivity, which is why you’re seeing many brands offering a limited selection and selling premium products elsewhere. It’s all about perception.” For all of Amazon’s investment in Amazon Fashion, there are technical challenges that impede its growth, in terms of both potential partners and shoppers. For one, the Amazon Fashion landing page remains largely difficult to navigate. There is a master list of designers, but it’s buried deep within the site and does not differentiate between brands that sell via Amazon directly and brands that sell through a third party. Finding products from current seasons is also impossible. “Amazon’s algorithm is complicated,” says Galloway, “but it generally favors what sells the most. So if you search booties, it’ll likely show you what’s three years old, and not the new shoes sold on Macy’s or Net-a-Porter. That’s not great for fashion labels constantly putting out new collections.” Both the women’s and men’s sleek landing pages have links to curated product lists and editorials, but when you click to actually buy an item, you’re faced with Amazon’s inscrutable UX. Amazon Fashion’s women’s landing page. “They have this front page with some content and it looks nice, but then you start clicking and it’s like, ‘Oh god!’” says Sharma, the WGSN editor. “There’s no editing, the filtering is dodgy, and I’m just put off completely. Maybe I’ll buy something if I can find it, but I don’t know if this is a recipe for a loyal customer base.” Blackledge confirms that according to consumer reviews of shopping for clothing on Amazon last summer for Cowen, everyone’s main complaint is the site’s functionality — “a challenging user experience” is how one shopper put it. Amazon might have grown to prominence in the early aughts because it was user-friendly, but the site hasn’t progressed much; in fact, it’s only gotten harder to use as it’s become inundated with a never-ending flood of merchandise. “What we heard from shoppers is that while they go to Amazon to replenish goods or search well-known brands or items, the site really falls short in curation and the browsing experience,” says Blackledge. “It’s just like, come on, how can you not have a beautiful digital presentation? You’re Amazon!” The former Amazon employee says that even though the company had a strong roster of buyers, merchandisers, and software engineers on the fashion team during her time at the company, there were often clashes over making Amazon Fashion “prettier,” or at least making it look less like Amazon. If it really cared about promoting and boosting fashion, it wouldn’t offer knockoff stuff. “Because the culture at Amazon is so different from fashion,” the former employee says, “it was really slow to adapt to change and listen to, say, people from Bloomingdale’s who wanted to study new brands and who’s buying what in the market.” One womenswear designer, who spoke to Racked on the condition of anonymity, shared that she’s frustrated with how Amazon surfaces cheaper versions of designer items. For example, on the Amazon page for Stella McCartney’s $908 platform Oxford shoes, a similar $32.99 pair is displayed in the “Customers who viewed this item also bought” unit right below the product description. “It feels like they are taking our products because they are a never-ending pit,” the designer says, “but at the end of the day, they just care about the sale, and not about the integrity of the brands or products that are even on the site. If it really cared about promoting and boosting fashion, it wouldn’t offer knockoff stuff.” Like other e-commerce marketplaces, Amazon is also home to plenty of counterfeit products that boast fake designer labels; its unwillingness to remove these products has stirred controversy. Over the summer, CNBC reported Birkenstock was ceasing distribution on Amazon due to the myriad other sellers listing counterfeit Birkenstocks on Amazon. This is particularly distressing to brands because Amazon fulfillment centers have been known to mix inventory from partners with those from third-party sellers, meaning that counterfeits can make their way to customers who bought authentic brand merchandise. "The Amazon marketplace, which operates as an 'open market,' creates an environment where we experience unacceptable business practices which we believe jeopardize our brand," David Kahan, the U.S. CEO of Birkenstock, wrote in a memo. “Policing this activity internally and in partnership with Amazon.com has proven impossible.” Do people even want to be seen in Amazon clothes? This is harder for them than it looks. Reflecting on Birkenstock’s decision, Galloway agrees that Amazon’s counterfeit problem has hurt the site’s reputation in the eyes of potential partners. Why would Louis Vuitton or Tory Burch ever confidently enter into a relationship with Amazon when there are countless counterfeit products imitating their brands on the site? “A website like Net-a-Porter would never sell counterfeit goods,” says Galloway. “It just wouldn’t happen.” Just two weeks ago, Amazon Marketplace vice president Peter Faricy told Reuters the company would be rolling out a counterfeits removal program that will allow companies to register their logos and intellectual property and then flag sellers listing illegitimate products. The fact that Amazon took so long to take action, says Galloway, “shows you a difference of culture.” “You would think Amazon, which has the most sophisticated technology, could easily weed out these fakes and unverified sellers simply by creating some sort of algorithm,” he says. “But Amazon has an ethos where it wants to instead shrug its shoulders and turn a blind eye as long as it’s making money.” One of Amazon’s recent maneuvers in its multi-pronged approach to winning the fashion game involves rolling out as many as eight in-house labels, including at least five womenswear lines: Society New York, Ella Moon, Lark & Ro, James & Erin, and North Eleven. It also offers men’s suiting and children’s clothes, with athleisure, bras, and quite possibly plus-size on the way. These launches were informed by data the company collected about what customers are buying on Amazon; it decides which categories to launch private labels in based on existing consumer behavior. A dress from Amazon’s Ella Moon label. The in-house labels have been met with little fanfare. They are hard to find on the site, and there have been plenty of complaints regarding quality and sizing. The marketing around the brands has been confusing too, with no clear indication as to what differentiates one from another. Lark & Ro merely offers that it’s for “women constantly on the move, who want to look stylishly pulled together from day to night,” and the clothing for Ella Moon is apparently “globally inspired, everyday beautiful.” The other women’s lines don’t have any brand descriptions at all. “While we’ve learned to never bet against Amazon, building a successful private fashion label is a challenge they have never faced,” says Greg Portell, a partner at A.T. Kearney. “It takes years to build a brand and to figure out the precise marketing for it too. Do people even want to be seen in Amazon clothes? This is harder for them than it looks.” The former Amazon employee says rolling out private-label brands based solely on data instead of design or merchandising expertise is a perfect example of how Amazon doesn’t understand the industry. “There are people at Amazon who actually love and breathe fashion and care about cool new things,” the employee says. “But at the end of the day, Amazon is numbers-driven.” In the fall, LVMH CFO Jean-Jacques Guiony said on an earnings call that his company’s brands, which include Céline, Fendi, Givenchy, Dior, and Louis Vuitton, would not be working with Amazon. (LVMH also owns a majority stake in Marc Jacobs, which does in fact have a partnership with Amazon.) “We believe the business of Amazon does not fit with LVMH full stop and it does not fit with our brands," said Guiony. “There is no way we can do business with them for the time being." LVMH is planning to launch an e-commerce business of its own, where all of its brands can live. Amazon is well aware of its downmarket reputation and flawed user experience, and it appears to be actively working to fix it. The company recently put up a job posting for a senior manager of product management, a role whose end goal will be implementing solutions to help “customers navigate through our selection of hundreds of millions of items,” which “remains one of the biggest customer experience challenges for Amazon Fashion.” This candidate will define “the product vision, goals” and influence “senior leaders within Amazon Fashion and across Amazon to communicate the team’s vision, strategy, goals, status, and customer impact.” Nadia Shouraboura, a former Amazon executive who now runs retail tech brand Hointer, says it’s not a matter of if luxury brands will cave to Amazon, but when. “I know that customers will be able to shop for Chanel and Dior on Amazon soon — just like fashion houses are obsessed with creating timeless looks, Amazon is obsessed with creating the perfect online shopping experience, effortless and unmatched, so it's going to happen,” Shouraboura says. “In several years, customers will be able to stream the latest runway show on [an] Amazon video service and tell Alexa to ship favorite outfits to their homes for one-hour delivery in time for an evening event.” Of course Amazon will have brick-and-mortar clothing stores — customers told us they want to be able to touch and feel clothing before buying. Stone, the Amazon author, likens the situation to what happened when Amazon began selling tech products: Companies like Sony and Samsung pledged to never sell on the site, only to cave when they couldn’t hold out any longer. Stone believes that “just because these luxury brands aren’t selling on Amazon today doesn’t mean that one day they won’t have to.” “It’s a brave new world, and anyone who thinks Amazon isn’t going to be number one in fashion is not being honest,” says Greenberg of Friedman LLP. “Just look at the numbers. The products will go where the customers are, and they are on Amazon.” There’s also a belief that Amazon could take over in-person shopping, too; after all, 85 percent of shoppers prefer to shop in stores. Plenty of e-commerce companies have since expanded into physical locations: Warby Parker, Birchbox, Everlane, and ModCloth, to name a few. Amazon has already debuted its own bookstores, and grocery stores are next. “Of course Amazon will have brick-and-mortar clothing stores — customers told us they want to be able to touch and feel clothing before buying, and Amazon has always listened to customers,” says Shouraboura. So what does this mean for the rest of retail? Will Amazon eventually clobber clothing stores, like they did bookstores? Is everyone destined for doom? According to Blackledge of Cowen, “This isn’t winner takes all. It’s a win and take most.” Because retail is fragmented — a segment that’s always had countless players — analysts don’t think Amazon will fully take over the shopping sector the way it did with books. Plus, “fashion is an emotional purchase that makes shoppers feel a certain way, and Amazon takes away that feeling,” says Laura Sossong, a senior consultant with Boston Retail Partners. “Getting something in an Amazon box just waters down that experience,” echoes WGSN’s Sharma. “I really think there will be those who will spend the extra $50 to shop at a nice store, or buy something on a beautifully curated website that will ship items to you in a nicely wrapped box.” Ultimately, Amazon is not and will never be a fashion company. “Technology does not always mean creativity, and that’s why there’s continued opportunity for merchants facing off against Amazon,” says Richard Kestenbaum, a partner at Triangle Capital LLC. “Amazon might be a big fat pipeline into consumer’s homes, but that’s not the same as creating inspiration. Selling Fruit of the Loom is not the same as selling Oscar de la Renta.” Chavie Lieber is a senior reporter at Racked.

Walmart's U.K. unit was the worst hit, with sales falling 1.8% to £4.07 million ($5.05 million) over the 12 weeks ending March 26, according to data published Tuesday by Kantar Worldpanel. The FTSE 350 Food & Drug Retailers Index was down slightly in Tuesday morning trading. It has lost 3.73% over the past year.  A late Easter weekend also factored into a drop in sales.

This article really caught my attention and I think the gist of it applies to customers in retail as well. At my Target recently, I asked a young man where I could find something and it was obvious that he was mentally impaired and could not help me, but he tried so hard and I was so appreciative to him and thanked him with gusto for his help. I was so delighted that Target was hiring such persons who need jobs and can function well as stockers, etc. And, at my neighborhood Wal-Mart, my checker was an elderly man in a wheelchair. He was slow but so pleasant and trying so hard to maneuver my items. I thanked him profusely. Again, I was delighted that Wal-Mart hires persons in specific jobs to fit their capabilities. But I think it is up to the public, the consumers, to recognize these individuals and appreciate them for the jobs they do and be patient and kind. Barbara Wiskow, Dallas Blind to immigrants' plight Re: "Mayors try to pin down Trump policy -- Homeland Security chief hears frustrations over defining 'sanctuary city,'" Thursday news story. For more than 20 years our country has let immigrants come across our borders and work our hard-labor jobs and build a life for themselves and their children. Now we are telling them if they do not abandon their lives that they have worked so hard to build, we are going to throw them out. Since their children were born here, we are going to throw out the parents and foster their children in foster care. Millions of foster children will be ours to raise. We all know foster children often end up being troubled. Labeling the people we have allowed to build lives in this country as illegal immigrants is wrong in every way. People who can't see this are blind, cruel and un-Christian. Susan Simmons, Waxahachie Moving on to wealth care So, now that repealing the Affordable Care Act failed in the House, it's time to move to ... tax reform? It seems they have decided that it is appropriate for a shift from health care to wealth care. Funny, wouldn't you have some kind of actual budget in place before you go monkeying with your cash flow? I know it works that way in our household. George Dailey, Dallas A tea party remnant? Re: "Trump slaps at the right -- Freedom Caucus draws his wrath; some push back, say he needs them," Friday news story. In the famous words spoken by Butch Cassidy to the Sundance Kid when they were being pursued and threatened by a group of lawmen, "Who are those guys?" The Freedom Caucus guys seem to be a remnant of the tea party movement of 2009-10. It won the admiration of many conservatives but failed to sustain itself in the years that followed. It seemed they were too radical and overly opposed to the leadership. This caucus group missed a great chance to boost the conservative cause by giving the party a victory in the health care vote. It would have helped the future plans of the party's tax reform, infrastructure updating and the budget approval. One congressman said: "It is easy to say 'no' but very hard to govern." There will always be opposition to change. Folks don't like their perks taken away. Could a compromise have been worked out? Ronald Reagan compromised and got a lot of good legislation passed. His approach: Take what you can now and try for more, or the rest, later. They could have gotten rid of the unpopular mandate and other similar parts of the Affordable Care Act. How severe a blow this was to the Republicans will be determined later this year. Robert Watkins, Plano Why demonize entitlements? Re: "See behind the ritual of presidential budget -- Jonah Goldberg: It is greeted as a document of significance, but its unveiling is almost always symbolic," Wednesday Viewpoints. Goldberg's use of the budgetary process to argue for his economic ideology is unpardonable. Here, he is the crazy street corner preacher screaming the end of world is at hand, repent. What's needed is not recognition of the ritual, but what every economist knows, that: 1. A nation like ours, with its debt entirely in its own currency, cannot go broke. 2. Most of our debt is owed to ourselves, and you aren't broke because you have more of your money in one of your pockets than another. Why demonize entitlements and debt, when these actually put money into the private sector, whereas government surpluses and balanced budgets don't? Follow the money. When governments hoard, the public must buy from private parties who profit. When governments spend directly into the public, private parties have less to offer -- and thus make less. So the real problem with entitlements for people like Goldberg is that there's no profit in them for private-sector businesses, and the real problem with debt is that it's funding public initiatives that the private sector doesn't profit from. Brian Baldwin, Dallas/Oak Lawn Don't hamstring civil servants It's a challenging time to be a federal employee, but as president of Chapter 254 of the National Treasury Employees Union I can attest to the dedication of our nation's civil servants, even in the face of threats to cut their pay, their benefits and their jobs. Federal workers in small towns and large cities all across America are committed to serving the American public. Whether they protect the border, process tax filings, catch financial scammers, keep the air and water clean and safe, or inspect new food and medical products, these employees deserve a fair wage and the necessary resources to carry out their missions. Indiscriminate budget cuts and across-the-board hiring freezes only hamper their ability to deliver vital public services. We urge our fellow Americans to stand with us to protect the integrity of the civil service and make sure government functions efficiently and effectively for everyone. David Arvelo, Dallas Border wall an insane project Re: "Will wall go on Mexico's side of the Rio Grande?" Thursday news story. The estimated cost by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for building the wall along the Mexican border is $21.6 billion over three years. I used to own 200 acres on the Rio Grande south of Eagle Pass, where there are more rattlesnakes than people. Believe me, the river moves, there are mountains and all sorts of physical and legal obstacles with this project that makes it insane, and maybe, just maybe, that should describe those who propose it.

If the store carried Mexican brands, they would hang out and gossip with people who came to purchase them. Eventually they were connected with other immigrants in the region. Before Stewart’s study, the best estimates of the rural immigrant and farm-worker population in Ohio ranged from 15,000 to 18,000. Stewart’s group found there were actually 63,500 to 70,300 rural immigrants and farm workers. “There was a clear disparity between what people thought they knew, and what was actually going on in the state,” Stewart said. That led to the creation of the Immigrant Worker Project in 1998. Stewart, coordinator of the IWP, was at Youngstown State University on Monday to talk about how the Canton-based nonprofit helps meet the needs of immigrant communities in Ohio, especially when it comes to workplace rights. Stewart said the majority of immigrants in Ohio are coming from Mexico and Guatemala, and they’re coming to work on farms. Between 1997 and 2004, production on poultry and dairy farms more than doubled. Farms producing eggs and nurseries cultivating plants for landscaping also have seen an increase in output tied to immigrant workers, Stewart said. These workers often are vulnerable. Stewart told a story about a man who cut himself in a poultry factory. He was taken to a vet to get stitches and then returned to work. On another farm, chicken catchers saw their wages reduced when a worker injured himself. The employer said it was to cover the workers’ compensation payments. The Immigrant Worker Project helps these groups advocate for themselves and obtain better treatment in the workplace. They also provide education and help communities develop their own leadership. “We’re building from the base and empowering the base, so they can lead themselves,” he said. When asked about whether he should tell people to return to their countries of citizenship, Stewart said that would have little effect. Businesses want the low-wage workers, and immigrants are often fleeing terrible conditions including the civil war in Guatemala. “Think about a 30-year civil war in Ohio and 500,000 die – civilians, not combatants. That’s what they’re coming from,” Stewart said. Stewart said beginning in 2009, they started seeing unaccompanied minors coming in who were fleeing violence in their home countries. Georgia Kasamias, a YSU student who interns at the IWP, organized the event. She said most people in the Youngstown area don’t know the organization exists, and it’s a nonprofit that lacks funding. “I wanted to help market what they do and spread information,” she said. Stewart said the closest community the group works in is Salem. He acknowledged unauthorized immigration is a difficult issue, but he also said the current immigration system is broken. Also, America has some of the cheapest food prices in the world, in part because it relies on immigrant workers. Stewart asked if Americans aren’t willing to have immigrants come do this work, are they willing to see farming outsourced to Mexico or are they willing to pay more for food? It’s a decision most people don’t want to make, he said.

God intended. What follows are musings that might have occurred between busting caps for Christ. Or maybe this is all from the Russians. I feel unmasked. When’s that medical marijuana become available? • During this 91st General Assembly of Arkansas legislators, we have again been reminded of the forces that continue to be powerful in this state. They are the SEC, NRA, and GOD. And not always in that order. Forces not so powerful continue to be the FOIA and YOU. Regnat Populus, my ass. • Tyson Foods CEO Tom Hayes recently said the future of food could be meatless. Yep, meatless. We’ll all be eating cricketburgers. How many crickets can one grow in a converted chicken house? 500,000? That number of crickets cricketing would be loud. Am assuming Hayes didn’t mean we’ll go meatless any time this century. A meatless Tyson is hard to fathom. That would be like a white trash free Wal-Mart, or a consistently nationally competitive Razorback football program, or a cleavage-free Hooters. Societies do evolve, however. Hayes may be ahead of his time. But probably not, because, well, bacon. • Of the many reasons why Sam Walton was a retail genius, putting clear “Enter” and “Exit” signs on his stores must be one of them. Nowadays such signage must be considered a suggestion, if not a dare. “In Through the Out Door” was a Zeppelin album title, not a recommendation for retail rebellion. Also, if you bring a child to Wal-Mart, please don’t let your germ wagon touch all the door handles in the frozen food section. And the middle of the aisle is not a place for a 15-minute high school or family reunion. Get your bacon, Ruffles and Great Value bean dip and keep moving. • About the effort by the Arkansas Legislature to pass a bill allowing guns on university campuses, there appears to be no truth to the rumor that the bill was amended to prevent the Razorback football team from using the shotgun or pistol formations. Not that either have proven consistent at hitting a target. • It seems every legislative session there is a push to make something the official state whatever-it-is. Milk is our official state beverage. We have official dirt. Dirt. It’s “Stuttgart” dirt, which is mostly good for growing crops and large areas of poverty. This year we have an official state dinosaur. And no, smartass, it’s not the Democratic Party of Arkansas. It’s something-something-saurus, I think. Our august gaggle of 100 men and women elected to the Arkansas House also this year approved a resolution – a resolution is not official, wink-wink – to make the Holy Bible the official state book. Again, the resolution is non-binding – like the state and U.S. Constitution in the minds of some Arkansas lawmakers when it comes to social legislation. If we can make dirt official, nothing is off limits. Here are some other “official” ideas. Official state pastime: Posting prayer requests on Facebook. “Cousin Donnie got a daughter getting married. He’s hoping to win enough money in the chamber’s bass tournament to get her a dress. The one she wore for that no-account second husband don’t fit no more, and she needs something different to cover up them tattoos she got with her third husband. Needing prayers that Donnie gets out of jail in time to make the fishing tournament.” Official state truck: The Ford owned by Sam Walton. Official state car: One of the vehicles driven by Mark Martin. The one that made only left  turns. At high speeds. Not anything driven by the constitutional officer of the same name who sometimes lives in Little Rock. Official state meat: Bacon. Real bacon. Official state bird: The Mockingbird is soooooo yesterday. Let’s go with the Cash bird. The Dirtius Dyess Digitidae. A rare sighting can be found at this link. Official state obsession. List of choices include: Guns; tax cuts; curbing civil liberties and making government less transparent in a hoped-for trade-off for more societal security; more guns in case that societal security thing doesn’t work out; bathrooms without urinals and who should or shouldn’t be traipsing through bathrooms without urinals. And designating stuff and people and animals with official stateification.

Police said Shane Ultimo, 21, of Hackettstown, at 1:43 p.m. Friday concealed $89 worth of items at the Wal-Mart store by placing them into a bag. He then allegedly placed the bag onto a shelf for Lauren Capalbo, 27, of Hackettstown, to retrieve, police said. Capalbo then entered the store, picked up the bag and went to customer service to try to return the stolen goods for a gift card, police said. A store loss prevention officer however, was onto the scheme and detained the pair until Mansfield officers arrived. Additional store video surveillance footage showed Capalbo making two other fraudulent returns on March 13 for $88 and $80, respectively. Drunken man tries to steal Nazareth police car, cops say Capalbo was charged in that incident with two counts of theft while Ultimo was charged with theft and driving with a suspended license. Both were released pending a court appearance. But Capalbo didn't follow instructions by police to stay away from Wal-Mart, police said. She returned the day after the incident -- Saturday -- and was cited with defiant trespass. Pamela Sroka-Holzmann may be reached at pholzmann@lehighvalleylive.com. Follow her on Twitter @pamholzmann.

Elderly St. Augustine woman scammed by Nigerian she met on dating website by: Jenna Bourne, Action News Jax Updated: Apr 4, 2017 - 10:25 PM Twtter The St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office is investigating how a 79-year-old St. Augustine woman was scammed out of her money by someone she met on a dating website. The woman told deputies she’d been sending money to Nigeria for years. Related Headlines Amazon shoppers targeted by scammers who take over victims' computers JEA warns customers of latest scam Wedding planner accused of scamming numerous brides A stranger stepped in to help the woman after seeing her crying at the St. Augustine Walmart. “I was in line at Walmart and I noticed this elderly woman on her cellphone," Lance Hayes said. "She was crying and asking somebody for some cab fare."  Hayes said he offered to help her and she told him she needed the money because she’d been wiring money to Nigeria. That’s when he called St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office deputies, who found that the woman had wired $700 to a Nigerian account on Friday. “She’s behind on her rent, you know, and this has been going on for years, so it’s just unbelievable that people would do this to somebody so vulnerable,” said Hayes. Investigators said someone in Nigeria who calls himself James Coleman told the woman he needed the money for sick relatives. The woman said he also told her, if she sent money, he would buy her whatever she wanted, like a house or car. A deputy who looked at her phone saw she’d gotten 121 calls from the same number since 1:28 that morning. Action News Jax left a voicemail on that number. No one has returned our call. “She obviously is very vulnerable," Hayes said. "I mean, she has the beginning stages of dementia. She’s lonely. The only person calling her is this person who’s looking to take her money."  Hayes worries the woman is going to relapse into sending this person money. He said he’s going to stay in her life. “We got together yesterday and did a little shopping.

Love visual aspect of news?: Enjoy this exclusive slideshows treat! MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA: Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realised computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing with videos from extremist groups and other offensive matter. That ads bought by well known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as much has been written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which You-Tube shares a portion of ad sales with creators of the content those ads appear against. This glitch in the company’s giant, automated process turned into a public-relations nightmare. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Consumers watch more than a billion hours on YouTube every day, making it an obvious beneficiary as advertising money moves online from television. But the recent problems opened Google to criticism that it was not doing enough to look out for advertisers. It is a significant problem for a multibillion-dollar company that still gets most of its revenue through advertising. "We take this as seriously as we’ve ever taken a problem," Philipp Schindler, Google chief business officer, said . "We’ve been in emergency mode." Over the last two weeks, Google has changed what types of videos can carry advertising, barring ads from appearing with hate speech or discriminatory content. In addition, Google is simplifying how advertisers can exclude specific sites, channels and videos across YouTube and Google’s display network. It is allowing brands to fine-tune the types of content they want to avoid, such as "sexually suggestive" or "sensational/bizarre" videos. It is also putting in more stringent safety standards by default, so an advertiser must choose to place ads next to more provocative content. Google created an expedite way to alert it when ads appear next to offensive content. Google’s efforts are being noticed. Johnson & Johnson, for example, said it had resumed YouTube advertising in a number of countries. Google said other companies were starting to return. For the most part, Google failed to address the issue adequately before because it did not have to; the instances in which ads appeared next to objectionable content happened infrequently and out of view from the broader public. Google said for many of its top advertisers, the objectionable videos accounted for fewer than one one-thousandth of a percent of their total ad impressions. To train the computers, Google is applying machine-learning techniques — the underlying technology for many of its biggest breakthroughs, like the self-driving car.

Slideshow: SLIDESHOW: Man accused of robbing elderly women at 2 AR Walmart stores The suspect in Blytheville (L) and Forrest City (R) (Source: Blytheville Police) BLYTHEVILLE, AR (WMC) - Police are looking for a man accused of robbing two older women at different Arkansas Walmart stores. The first reported robbery happened in Forrest City on Saturday around 5 p.m. The victim said she was loading groceries into her vehicle when the man approached her with a butcher’s knife and robbed her. Police said the man got into a vehicle and drove off. Blytheville Police Department said a man then entered Walmart on Sunday at 7 a.m. when he approached an 87-year-old woman, knocked her to the ground, and took her purse. The woman was taken to the hospital with an injury to her hip. A witness said the man drove off before officers arrived. The man is driving a vehicle with Texas tags. Police believe the two robberies were carried out by the same man driving the same vehicle. Detectives said the man continued north on I-55 after the second robbery.

" - Ian Whitehead, Project Manager Westinghouse Rail Systems That is what real revolutions are like. The old stuff gets broken faster than the new stuff is put in its place. The importance of any given experiment isn 8767 t apparent at the moment it appears big changes stall, small changes spread. Even the revolutionaries can 8767 t predict what will happen. Agreements on all sides that core institutions must be protected are rendered meaningless by the very people doing the agreeing. (Luther and the Church both insisted, for years, that whatever else happened, no one was talking about a schism.) Ancient social bargains, once disrupted, can neither be mended nor quickly replaced, since any such bargain takes decades to solidify. When we shift our attention from 8766 save newspapers 8767 to 8766 save society 8767 , the imperative changes from 8766 preserve the current institutions 8767 to 8766 do whatever works. 8767 And what works today isn 8767 t the same as what used to work. Chaotic, as it turns out. The Bible was translated into local languages was this an educational boon or the work of the devil? Erotic novels appeared, prompting the same set of questions. Copies of Aristotle and Galen circulated widely, but direct encounter with the relevant texts revealed that the two sources clashed, tarnishing faith in the Ancients. As novelty spread, old institutions seemed exhausted while new ones seemed untrustworthy as a result, people almost literally didn 8767 t know what to think. If you can 8767 t trust Aristotle, who can you trust? Print media does much of society 8767 s heavy journalistic lifting, from flooding the zone covering every angle of a huge story to the daily grind of attending the City Council meeting, just in case. This coverage creates benefits even for people who aren 8767 t newspaper readers, because the work of print journalists is used by everyone from politicians to district attorneys to talk radio hosts to bloggers. The newspaper people often note that newspapers benefit society as a whole. This is true, but irrelevant to the problem at hand 8775 You 8767 re gonna miss us when we 8767 re gone! 8776 has never been much of a business model. So who covers all that news if some significant fraction of the currently employed newspaper people lose their jobs? «Walmart essay thesis on forgiveness» in pictures.

Here’s how to find one… Posted 9:51 am, April 4, 2017, by Michelle Stark Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest LinkedIn Email × Looking for the sold out Nintendo Switch? Here’s how to find one… The Nintendo Switch gaming console remains sold out nearly everywhere. It is possible to find one though, with a little determination and some digital tools. Since the system’s launch last month, demand for Switch has surged, in large part because of very strong reviews for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Gamers and parents of gamers searching for a Switch in the Tennessee Valley (or anywhere nationwide) face an up-hill battle. Toys R’ Us, Walmart, GameStop and Best Buy have all seen restocks of the console; only to have the systems gone from shelves within minutes or hours. If you’re determined to find one, here are some suggestions for improving your odds. Restocking Websites These websites offer inventory tracking services with varying degrees of accuracy. Some offer “alert” functions to minimize the time you need to spend actively searching. Two to consider trying are istocknow.com (which includes an interactive map) or nowinstock.net. Retailer apps Some retailers like Target and Walmart offer stock tracking within their mobile apps or online. Walmart’s app, for example, let’s you select a “home store” and compare inventory there to online inventory. The apps are updated regularly but if you’re really eager to get your Switch, it’s best to cross-check websites and apps before driving to the nearest store. You’re more likely to spot an inconsistency that way. Even so, you may find inaccurate information. Phone calls Retail workers everywhere will hate the suggestion, but it never hurts to pick up the phone and call your nearest Switch seller. Ask for a manager, who might be more knowledgeable about re-stocking times/shipments and try to be as polite as possible. A little kindness goes a long way.

Elias O'Neal April 4, 2017 0 The 31,000-square-foot Shops at Stonehenge houses national and regional tenants such as Q Barbecue, Cato Fashion and Windows Depot. (J. Elias O’Neal) A last-minute cash infusion wasn’t enough to save a Chesterfield County retail property from the auction block. The Shops at Stonehenge, at 2013-2077 Walmart Way in Midlothian, is set to be auctioned Friday in a foreclosure sale. The auction is scheduled for 2 p.m. on the steps of the Chesterfield County courthouse at 9500 Courthouse Road. At 31,000 square feet, the Shops at Stonehenge houses national and regional tenants such as Q Barbecue, Cato Fashion and Windows Depot. It is wedged between a Sam’s Club and a Walmart Supercenter, neither of which are part of the foreclosure. The auction does not include the neighboring Argent Credit Union property. The property, about 4 acres, originally was scheduled for foreclosure on Feb. 24, according to a report from Trepp, a commercial real estate tracking firm. It was delayed after the owner – Fort Worth, Texas-based Melhi Richmond Properties – allocated $800,000 to pay down part of its debt in an attempt to refinance the loan and delay foreclosure. However the deadline for loan payoff came and went, leading to this latest attempt at foreclosure. The strip center was built during the height of the real estate boom in 2006, and reported a 94.2 percent occupancy rate during the first quarter of 2016, according to Trepp. Its rent revenue and total operating expenses for 2015 were $350,000 and $132,000, respectively. That’s down from its peak rent revenue and total operating expenses of $614,000 and $172,000 in 2008. The property most recently was assessed at $6.5 million by the county. Melhi Richmond could not be reached for comment Monday afternoon. Shops at Stonehenge substitute trustee Andrew S. Hirsch with Tyson’s Corner-based law firm Venable LLP would not comment about the pending auction. The outstanding balance on the retail center is $3.03 million, according to Trepp. The loan was originated by Wachovia and later sold off into a commercial mortgaged-backed security.

However, surveillance video later showed the man himself bringing the venomous snake into the store, a Walmart spokesperson told the station. No one else was injured, but the snake sighting caused pandemonium, according to customer Linda Moore Mathews, who snapped a photo of the reptile as it lay coiled in the middle of a produce aisle and posted it on Facebook. “Everyone was freaking out,” Mathews said. Another woman recorded video of a man finally catching the copperhead and placing it in a Walmart bag. The snake was de-fanged, which is usually done to snakes kept as pets, according to Jacksonville Animal Control, but the venomous glands weren’t removed. The man was taken to an area medical center for treatment according to KTHV; his condition is not yet known.

READ MORE: 91st General Assembly A revived bid to pass a bill on the collection of online sales taxes failed in the House on Monday, the last full day of the Arkansas General Assembly's regular session for a while. The session recessed until May 1, when it will adjourn for good, legislative leaders said. The delay in adjournment gives lawmakers time to consider fixing errors in bills or override any vetoes. Part of Monday was celebratory. While legislative leaders bemoaned a lack of solutions for increasing long-term highway funding, they and Gov. Asa Hutchinson also touted successes like cutting taxes. In the House, one display of bipartisanship included a "bromance" citation for Rep. John Walker, D-Little Rock, a civil-rights lawyer, and Rep. Kim Hendren, R-Gravette, a chicken farmer. But representatives also revived a familiar debate on the 85th day of the 91st General Assembly over whether to enact legislation aimed at getting Internet retailers to charge sales tax and remit the money to the state. The tax is already owed under current Arkansas law, but it's the responsibility of taxpayers to pay it. Few do. Rep. Dan Douglas, R-Bentonville, told the House that Senate Bill 140 was a matter of simple fairness. Every year, he said, he buys five pairs of Wrangler bluejeans. This year, he bought one pair at Academy Sports, a second pair at Tractor Supply Co. and the remaining three online, he said. The online retailer did not collect any sales tax, he said. "They're the same brand of bluejeans. They're the same style, the same size, used on the same fat body for the same purpose, and they didn't collect sales tax," he said of the online seller. "Now, is that fair? And part of our jobs is to be fair and equitable." [EMAIL UPDATES: Get free breaking news alerts, daily newsletters with top headlines delivered to your inbox] But opponents of SB140 -- which was sponsored by Sen. Jake Files, R-Fort Smith -- said it was unconstitutional. A 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that a state cannot require the collection and remittance of sales taxes by companies that do not have a physical presence in that state. "This is interstate commerce. This is one of the powers that is granted solely to the Congress," said Rep. Stephen Meeks, R-Greenbrier. "This is a federal issue only. The states do not have this authority." Files has said the bill is similar to a law in South Dakota that's under review by that state's Supreme Court. He also said the decision by online retailer Amazon to collect sales taxes and pay the money to each state that charges sales tax addresses the constitutional question. Opponents of the bill said, if enacted, it would be felt as a new tax. "We have to take a burden off if we're going to put a burden on," said Rep. Bob Ballinger, R-Hindsville. "That's the only way I can ever support a new tax and I get it -- there is a use tax out there -- our citizens aren't feeling it. But they will feel this." The vote was 43-50. It required 51 votes for passage in the 100-member House. If the bill had passed, members of the Senate planned to suspend the rules to concur with a House amendment on the bill. From there, it would have gone to the governor for his signature. Files has estimated that SB140 could increase state tax revenue by up to roughly $100 million a year, while state officials have said they don't know how much the bill would raise in additional tax revenue. It would require out-of-state companies to collect taxes on sales to Arkansans if the seller's gross revenue from those sales exceeds $100,000 or it had at least 200 transactions for delivery into Arkansas in the previous or current calendar year. If these companies don't collect and remit these taxes, SB140 would require them to report each year to the state Department of Finance and Administration the name and address of each Arkansas purchaser and the total amount paid, and provide notice to each Arkansas purchaser that the information has been provided to the state. Monday's debate came weeks after Amazon voluntarily decided to start collecting sales taxes in Arkansas on March 1. SB140 was supported by brick-and-mortar stores from Wal-Mart to Ozark Outdoor Supply in Little Rock. "To me, it's a really black-and-white issue. There's no gray area on it. I don't understand how somebody can look at it in any way other than it's not fair," said Jim Frank, owner of Ozark Outdoor Supply, in an interview Monday. "I mean Wal-Mart's behind this thing, too. You've got little old me sitting up here on Kavanaugh beating them over the head, they've got Waltons up there swinging a big old bat, it's just beyond me." While Amazon is the leading online seller in the United States, it accounted for less than half of all online sales in 2016, according to Slice Intelligence, which tracks email receipts of online orders. Frank said their voluntary collection won't affect him much because much of what he stocks isn't available on Amazon. While sales taxes aren't the sole problem affecting local retailers, Frank said it's certainly a factor. The bill was opposed by Conduit for Action, a conservative group. "This vote saves the taxpayers from facing a heavy burden of possibly over $100 million a year in an increased collection of taxes," the group said in a statement. "It appears the House of Representatives realized this was unconstitutional and would negatively impact their constituents and voted this down." Files said he's disappointed with the fate of his SB140. "We still got several people that didn't even get to vote," he said. "That's part of the process, but I am very frustrated." Hutchinson said to count him as a supporter of SB140, calling it a matter of fairness. "This will be resolved. It is just a matter of time," he said. "I had a number of legislators that came up to me and said they want to continue to work on that, so we'll see when that can be addressed in a future legislative session." SB140 was one of a number of Internet sales tax bills. House Bill 2085 by Rep. Johnny Rye, R-Trumann, did not aim to collect more Internet sales taxes but would earmark online sales tax revenues above $15 million for roads. It was referred to a Senate committee, but no action was taken on it. Meanwhile, House Bill 1388 by Douglas would require out-of-state retailers to tell Arkansas customers and the Department of Finance and Administration each year the total amount of each customer's purchases. The bill was approved by the House, but was not voted on in the Senate. After the House adjourned, pictures were taken and hands shaken, House Speaker Jeremy Gillam, R-Judsonia, told reporters that among victories this legislative session -- such as increasing foster care funding by $26.7 million in the state's general revenue budget -- he believes there's work to be done with taxes and highway funding. Some of that work will be done by the Arkansas Tax Reform and Relief Legislative Task Force. Files said he expects his bill to be considered by the 16-member panel. Gillam said he's met with some members interested in serving on the task force, but has not made appointments yet. For now, Gillam plans to go back to to his berry farm -- which he said raises peaches, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries as well as debt -- and help his brother with the family business. Looking back on the session, Senate Democratic leader Keith Ingram of West Memphis said the "most disappointing thing was there was no action on highways. "We are digging deeper in the hole," he said. "It seems to me the concerns that many of us had about the budget continues to look less than favorable. "All in all, it was a contentious legislative session in many ways. But we discussed a lot of good things for the people of the state of the Arkansas. Hopefully, the things that are good will outweigh the bad," Ingram said. Over the duration of the session, more than 2,069 bills were introduced. As of Monday evening, nearly 750 new laws and appropriation bills were approved by the 91st General Assembly. Hutchinson, during a news conference Monday, said, "In my judgment, this is one of the most pro-growth, pro-jobs General Assemblies that have met in recent memory." The governor said the plan is for the Legislature to finally adjourn May 1 and "the three days following we have set aside for a potential special session" to clear the way for his administration to apply for a waiver to the Trump administration for the state's Medicaid expansion called Arkansas Works. Among measures approved in this year's regular session, Hutchinson cited laws that will cut individual income taxes for Arkansans with taxable income of less than $21,000, exempt military retirees from state income taxes and reduce the sales tax on replacement parts for manufacturing in exchange for eliminating the InvestArk economic development incentive. "Of very great significance, we avoided a North Carolina-type bathroom bill in this legislative session," Hutchinson said, referring to legislation that dictated which restrooms were to be used by transgender people. He said he made it clear that "this is not a problem in Arkansas. It does not cry for a solution. It would be harmful for this state and I am delighted the General Assembly did not pass any legislation in that regard." Hutchinson said the fact that legislation wasn't passed to help fund the state's highways demonstrates the importance of last year's special session in which the Legislature enacted his plan to provide about $47.5 million a year in state funds to match $200 million a year in federal highway funds. A bill that didn't make it through the Legislature would have referred to 2018 voters a highway bond issue and fuel tax increase. "As to the long-term solutions, it emphasizes that it is difficult to get a referral of this General Assembly out to the voters, and that I hope the leadership of our state and the business community and others will look at an initiated act that might go on the ballot for a highway program," he said. "Otherwise, we'll continue to debate the long-term solution in future sessions."

April 4, 2017 at 10:52 a.m. The state's revenue grows as the economy grows. When the government at any level passes a tax increase, they are saying that government should be a bigger part of your life. That's NOT a good thing. ( permalink | suggest removal ) RBear says... April 4, 2017 at 11:22 a.m. Whippersnapper, I don't know how simple we must be to spell it out. This is NOT a new tax. If anyone of those businesses had a nexus in Arkansas they would be required to pay the tax. You don't have a "new tax" when you establish a nexus. Are you just that thick skulled to not understand? Typical Trump demographic. ( permalink | suggest removal ) NoUserName says... April 4, 2017 at 11:45 a.m. First off, Bear, businesses don't pay s**t. The consumer pays the tax. The business collects and remits because the state forces them to. Second, the fact that people are against this is because they are tired of getting fleeced. What? The state needs money to support infrastructure? Sure. On the other hand, how about the millions we paid Jake Files to stiff Ft. Smith? Or the $2 million pay increase we just gave the legislators. Or the millions that a DHS employee just swindled instead of feeding hungry kids. It's time to SHRINK government, not give them MORE money to waste. As for the tax itself, it was pushed by Walmart for the sole purpose of forcing Amazon to collect. Now that is done, there is no reason to pass this law. As such, the p*ssy legislators can claim to the constituency they didn't pass it. ( permalink | suggest removal ) HarleyOwner says... April 4, 2017 at 11:59 a.m. Even if they had of passed the internet tax bill, I would still shop on the internet so, that still would not help the Arkansas businesses. It would just give the Arkansas Legislators more money to waste. ( permalink | suggest removal ) drs01 says... April 4, 2017 at 1:37 p.m. You see what happens when government get addicted to a revenue stream. The city of Little Rock "leadership" was the only vocal group complaining about this missing sales tax. Why? Maybe because they have relied on it too much, just like the LRSD had relied on the de-seg $$$. Now they both are in trouble. Why? because they are still trying to feed the monster that is growing government. Periodically this newspaper will publish numbers showing the growth of state government employees and payroll. The line continues upward from Clinton through Beebe. Sooner or later there will be a price to pay. Little Rock and the LRSD are there now....the state will soon follow. ( permalink | suggest removal ) RBear says... April 4, 2017 at 1:57 p.m. NoNameUser et al, the same old lame argument about "wasting money." The bottom line is that none of you can really point to true waste other than situational instances. All the while, Arkansas continues to lag on education and care for the elderly. I know, you're getting fleeced ... not. The reality is you're the ones fleecing others by your anti-tax attitude.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon TORONTO — Packaged food companies and retailers changed the recipes of more than twice the amount of products in 2016 compared with the year before in order to meet a growing consumer demand for healthier food, according to a new report. Companies including Walmart, Dole, Smuckers and PepsiCo altered 179,600 products to reduce the level of ingredients such as salt, sugar and saturated fat in 2016, up from 84,000 reformulations in 2015, according to the Consumer Goods Forum, a non-profit global trade association. The numbers also track a swift upward trajectory from 2014, when 22,500 products had their recipes rejigged. The most-removed product ingredient cited by manufacturers and retailers in 2016 was sodium, cited by 67 per cent, followed by sugar at 61 per cent and saturated fat at 50 per cent, the report said. Related McDonald’s to serve up fresh beef on one of its burgers — but it’s not the Big Mac Amazon wants Cheerios, Oreos and other brands to make their products to be shipped, not sold at Wal-Mart Conversely, whole grains and vitamins were the most likely new ingredients added to boost the nutritional profile of food, at 25 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively. “Salt and sugar — the two are the new tobaccos” in terms of consumer perception, said Sylvain Charlebois, agriculture expert and Dean of management at Dalhousie University in Halifax. “The centre of the store is changing. Health and well-being are aspects that consumers are looking for (in products) and those will occupy the centre store more in the future and that also plays into the grocers’ own strategies around private labels,” he said. “And because the line between food service and food retail is blurring, grocers are trying to take advantage of that trend of offering consumers ready-to-eat, healthy products.” That has played out at Loblaw Cos., which has converted dozens of its Shoppers Drug Mart stores across the country to incorporate fresh convenience food. While Shoppers has long been a convenience destination for packaged snacks, there has been significant fresh food growth at the drug and cosmetics retailer. “We have strong growth pretty much across the board in the front store at Shoppers Drug Mart,” Loblaw chief executive Galen Weston told investors on the company’s third-quarter conference call last November. “We think part of what is driving that is the enhanced (fresh) food proposition that may actually be driving more traffic, more visits,” and that volume seemed to lead to higher sales in other categories, he said. “Where we see really, really significant success in adding fresh food is in the urban market.” Beyond catering to consumers’ desire to eat healthier, the trend highlights the response from grocery retailers and food manufacturers to the so-called “centre-store erosion” in grocery stores, a phenomenon which has seen consumers eschew packaged goods in favour of fresh food and the ready-to eat foods on the periphery of the stores. Sales of packaged foods has been tepid in Canada for years, growing at a combined annual rate of 2.4 per cent per annum between 2011 and 2016, according to market research firm Euromonitor. Retailers and manufacturers are increasingly teaming up in order to influence communities “across a broad and more holistic set of health indicators,” the Consumer Goods Forum report noted. “We aim to oversee the design and execution of several collaborative pilots to test the hypothesis that retailers and manufacturers can jointly create healthier practices and help people live healthier lives.” Unilever, maker of products such as Knorr soups, Lipton teas, Hellman’s mayonnaise, and Dove skin products has posted its commitment to making healthier food on its website. “More than 1.9 billion adults, 39 per cent of the global population — are overweight and 13 per cent are obese,” the site says. Unilever says by 2020, it will double the proportion of its food portfolio that meets the highest global nutrition standards. “This will help hundreds of millions of people to achieve a healthier diet,” Unilever says. “The business case is compelling. We have seen that by promoting hygiene and nutritious food, sales increase.” Cereal in particular has been a hard-hit packaged food category as more consumers eat on the run in the morning and look for more portable and protein-rich breakfast options. In response, packaged goods makers have been adding protein to breakfast and snack bars. “As we come into the beginning of this year, we’ve renovated even more of our food,” Paul Norman, president of Kellogg North America, told analysts during the cereal maker’s fourth quarter conference call in February. “Where we have renovated so far, we’ve seen better performance.” The Consumer Goods Forum is comprised of about 400 members including retailers, manufacturers and consumer service businesses.

The long list includes household names such as Starbucks, Pepsi, Walmart, Tesco, the BBC and the UK government. Some have even suggested that they may have inadvertently sponsored extremist and hateful groups to the tune of more than £250,000. To understand how, it’s helpful to recall how Google services such as YouTube work. When we watch a video clip we may see ads and we often skip them. But for Google the ad is the important thing – something like 90% of its revenue comes from selling ads. When an ad is placed around a YouTube video, Google charges the advertiser and shares some of the revenue with the user who posted the video. Vloggers such as Zoella make a pretty penny from this. Google’s targeting technologies can allow advertisers to place their ads around specific types of videos or present them to specific groups of viewers. So what’s the problem? Surely it is acceptable for brands to choose which content they sponsor? Isn’t this what happens on traditional media? Given that brands can target their ads already perhaps something else is going on. Over the firewall Brands certainly have the right to demand which content their ads appear alongside. On traditional media, a brand might not want its ads placed alongside a report about a terror campaign, for example. But it is not considered acceptable for them to say that the newspaper shouldn’t report such events at all. To get around this, traditional media companies separate news and information operations from advertising operations. The problem with services like Google and other social media platforms is that such organisational firewalls don’t exist. As a result, there are potential hidden biases that can come about when advertisers insist that content matches their “company values”. Ironically enough, this problem is spelled out pretty well in a 1998 paper by Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. They wrote that the “goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users”. The example they cited from a prototype version of Google saw a search for mobile phones pull up a study which went into detail about the risks of speaking on a phone while driving. They concluded that a search engine company which was taking money for mobile phone ads would struggle to justify that kind of search result to paying advertisers. Brin and Page concluded that: Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers. That belief underpins why Google search separates out advertising sponsored links from organic search results. On YouTube, however, responsibility for the content of videos and the placement of ads is delegated onto viewers, users and brands through its terms of service and advertising policies. Indeed, from my analysis of 45 published cases by the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority that involved YouTube, there were 44 in which YouTube responded that users, viewers and brands were responsible for the ads people saw on the service – not them. In just a single case, did YouTube accept that an ad should be taken down following a complaint to the ASA. So, one way of looking at the current boycott is that’s it’s a case of brands pushing responsibility for content and placement back onto Google/YouTube who, up to now, have been very successful in passing this responsibility onto brands and user. Weeding There is another way of looking at it, and that is as an indirect way for brands to claim more power over the type of content that people can share online. If Google has to “weed out extremist views” (as politicians such as Yvette Cooper have requested), it has to define what is extremist. The problem here is that Google’s approach to consulting with other institutions about how it operates is often spiky – as their engagement with the ASA illustrates. If they only listen to what brands want, it leaves them very susceptible to the types of insidious biases that Brin and Page spoke about in their 1998 paper: see its definition of “advertiser-friendly content”. Might they start to direct viewers towards advertising-friendly content? They could, for example, push other content down their search results and recommended video lists. So what does Google do next in the stand off with the big brands? Chief Business Officer Philip Schindler told Bloomberg that the firm has improved its ability to flag offending videos and immediately disable ads. He also revealed that giant health products firm, Johnson & Johnson, has rolled back its boycott in some major markets. More broadly though, the solution is for Google to be far more transparent and engaged in the societies in which it operates. It needs to respond to brands and consumers but other social institutions as well. We all have to decide what is acceptable, not an algorithm, brands, politicians or individual YouTube viewers.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print The three best-performing teams last week in The Blade’s School Stock Contest had one major thing in common: All held shares of Tesla Inc. The California-based electric car maker had a big week, with shares gaining almost 6 percent. Enlarge Between that and solid returns from Best Buy, J.C. Penney, and Wal-Mart, the JDMR team from Springfield High School moved up an impressive 34 spots to begin the final quarter of the contest just outside the top 10 after nine weeks of the 12-week contest. Bonita Adams, who teaches business classes at Springfield and is advising a number of teams this year, including JMDR, said she’s tried to tell her students one big week could put them back in play. “Some of them that were kind of on the bottom would get a little discouraged, and I would tell them you can’t get discouraged,” she said. “Anything can happen and change. Even this team at one point, they were like second or third and they dropped way down. You just never know.” JMDR was actually in the red after week eight. But the 7.2 percent gain in week nine now has them up 7.1 percent and in 11th place. The annual stock contest gives participating teams a hypothetical $40,000 to be split evenly among four U.S. stocks. After 12 weeks, the team whose portfolio has grown the most will take home the top prize. This year, the first place team and school will get $1,500, second place gets $250, and third place $100. The contest is sponsored by University of Toledo’s College of Business and Innovation, which is tabulating the results, Fifth Third Bank, The Blade’s Newspaper in Education program, and the Taylor Automotive Family. This year’s contest is happening in what has shaped up to be a strong year for securities. “Overall market performance has been good,” said Ron Belle, senior vice president and the top regional investment adviser for Fifth Third, Year to date, all the major averages have had positive growth. The Nasdaq has had the largest increase — more than 10 percent — followed by S&P’s 500 index at 6 percent and the Dow over 5 percent.” With three weeks left, 56 of the 85 participating teams’ portfolios have returned positive gains. For the second straight week, the GBumpus team of St. John’s Jesuit Academy held the top spot. The team, whose holdings are Owens Corning, Cedar Fair, Advanced Micro Devices Inc., and Sony Corp., had turned its $40,000 into $45,339.81 through nine weeks, a gain of more than 13 percent. Second place was held by Alpha from Rossford Junior High School, while third place was held by by Klang, from Chase STEM Academy. Each of those teams are up about 9.6 percent. With several economic reports still to come in April and first quarter earnings reports not too far away, there’s still plenty of chance for a shake up. Contest teams holding Tesla already have seen big movement. Shares soared more than 7 percent on Monday as investors reacted to news over the weekend that Tesla had delivered a record 25,000 vehicles in the year’s first quarter. That’s 69 percent higher than the first quarter of 2016. Here are the Week 9 standings, with team name, school, city, and portfolio amount. 1.

Cops are investigating. Hancock sheriff’s officials and Waveland police investigate a report of a child abduction Monday night in the woods west of the Waveland Wal-Mart. Wesley Muller wmuller@sunherald.com File Authorities from several law enforcement agencies in Hancock County investigate a report of a child abduction Monday night in the woods near Wal-Mart in Waveland. Wesley Muller wmuller@sunherald.com File 1 of 3 i By Wesley Muller wmuller@sunherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story WAVELAND After responding to a report of a possible child abduction near the Waveland Wal-Mart, authorities believe a witness may have seen a man grabbing a child and walking through the woods to a nearby apartment complex.   Hancock County sheriff’s Chief Deputy Don Bass said officials received a third-party report of a girl being abducted from the store about 7:30 p.m. Waveland Police Chief David Allen said a woman flagged down a sheriff’s deputy and told him she saw a man take a girl by her hair into the woods from the parking lot. The witness told authorities the girl appeared to be about 7 years old. No one has come forward to report their child missing, Allen said. As authorities searched the woods Monday night, Bass said a Waveland officer saw a man and approached him. The man, who did not have a child with him, saw the police officer and ran. The officer chased him, but the man got away, Bass said. By 10 p.m., the man was still at large. Authorities said the alleged kidnapping occurred on the woods line to the west of Wal-Mart and not in the actual parking lot. Surveillance footage from the store did not record anything regarding it. However, the description of the man given by the witness matches surveillance footage of a man pulling on car doors in the parking lot about the same time the alleged abduction was reported. Police formed a perimeter around the Wal-Mart property and the woods with the help of a canine search team. At 10 p.m., authorities still had not found a child or received a report of a missing child. There are several paths through the woods that lead to the nearby apartment complex. Residents of that complex often walk through the wooded area to get to and fom the store.

Workers who feel they aren’t represented may look for another outlet to express their views. Protests in France demonstrate how violent these outlets can become. Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Business groups in Australia have been engaged in a long-term effort to increase the legal regulation of unions to constrain union activities. But this crackdown on the traditional union movement has created a void starting to be filled by “alt-unionism” - a more amorphous, less predictable vehicle for workers to voice their dissatisfaction. Arguably the restriction of union activity has had some success. For example, the legal right to strike is heavily circumscribed, as highlighted by new secretary of the ACTU Sally McManus. In addition to this the Australian Building and Construction Commission has been re-established meaning tighter restriction on the activities of building unions. Over the past 30 years the percentage of unionists in liberal market economies has been falling. In the wake of this decline steps alt-unionism (also known as “alt-labor” and “improvisational unionism”). It operates outside the established processes of collective bargaining to improve the wages and conditions of workers by other means. Alt-unionism is a catch-all term that can refer to spontaneous actions by workers that don’t conform to the traditional pattern of strike behaviour or other industrial action. An example of this is the numerous protests by Uber drivers in Australia and around the world. It’s also characterised by the fluid campaigns (often digital) launched outside of regular channels of representation. Take for example the online petition signed by Starbucks workers and individual supporters last year that resulted in an increase of up to 15% for Starbucks US employees. Alt-unionism can also refer to relatively stable associations of workers that aren’t registered organisations in the way traditional unions are and consequently are not constrained by the institutional history and rules of formal unions. These organisations are also not subject to the specific provisions of labour law aimed at regulating union activity. These organisations in Australia include those representing rideshare drivers, such as the Rideshare drivers association and Rideshare Drivers United and others like the Retail and Fast Food Workers Union, an unregistered body. In the US, the Freelancers Union and the Independent Drivers Guild each have thousands of members but are not allowed to represent these members in the same way as other unions, because their members are notionally independent contractors. Why businesses should take notice of alt-unionism The rise of alt-unionism may not seem like an immediate threat to businesses. Many of its manifestations are ad hoc and small scale and consequently easy to ignore. However, alt-unionism is not uniformly institutionalised and its constituency is broader than a workplace or even an industry. Its development is erratic and much more difficult to contain through existing systems of industrial regulation such as tribunals. Also, it’s often focused on inflicting reputational damage on a business in order to leverage an outcome by meshing workers’ grievances and concerns of ethical consumer groups. For example, the OUR Walmart campaign in the US leveraged the anti-sweatshop movements and the Walmart bribery scandal in Mexico to support their actions for better working conditions at Walmart and in the retail industry. Walmart was also confronted with unprecedented alt-unionism in China, where a spontaneous movement lead to strikes across the country. In our ongoing research into the experience of rideshare drivers in Australia and the US, the main frustration expressed by drivers is the lack of a way to channel their voices. One New York member of the Independent Drivers Guild noted that: Before the guild the drivers had no voice – no one was listening, no-one was caring. Workers whose concerns are not heard through established mechanisms may look for other modes of association and voice. This may expose business to potentially robust and unpredictable reaction from workers. The most recent example is from France. Uber faced a coalition of the old transport union and the new independent association of drivers to contest changes to the pricing policy that resulted in reductions in commissions received by drivers. Protests and sporadic violence led to the appointment of a public mediator. Negotiations to date have been unsuccessful and a continuing impasse might lead to a state-regulated minimum price which is counter to Uber’s business model. Though unprecedented in recent decades, business could acknowledge some of the problems with the industrial relations system from the union side. It could seek to improve the system to allow unions a legitimate place, with the capacity to adequately represent workers. After all, Australia is at historic lows of industrial action and most employers never have to deal with it. But if the system continues to reduce the capacity of unions to undertake their representative role - we may see worker dissatisfaction expressed through action. This might not be the known type of garden variety industrial action - namely strikes during bargaining - but an increase in a spontaneous phenomenon, not bounded by the Fair Work Act or whatever supersedes it. This could pose a challenge for business and make current industrial relations settings and traditional unions seem - if not attractive - then perhaps at least palatable.

Alex Reynolds/NPR hide caption toggle caption Alex Reynolds/NPR Bone broth has become so popular these days that the bones used to make it are getting harder — and more expensive — for broth retailers to source. Alex Reynolds/NPR Dear dogs of America — sorry about bone broth. Since this well-marketed take on an ancient beverage started sweeping hip enclaves like New York, Austin and Los Angeles a few years ago, it's getting harder to find cheap bones. Unlike many food fads, bone broth seems to be here for the long simmer. As more people switch to sipping, there are fewer bones to go around. Bone broth is commonly confused with broth (the quick-cooked mix of meat, bones and aromatics used to make chicken soup) and stock (a similar but more bone-heavy mixture that's often cooked for 4 to 6 hours to extract collagen from the bones), though it's closer to the latter. Many bone broth recipes say to simmer the mixture for anywhere from 14 to 48 hours, depending both on the type of bones and the patience of the cook. Meat broths have been touted for their restorative properties for centuries. In the 1800s, chemist Justus von Liebig began working on a meat-based food to feed Europe's poor — a reduction of meat and bones that he claimed could address "all cases of weakness and digestive disorder." By the 1860s, a London hospital was using 12,000 pots of beef "tea" every year to feed their patients. The Salt Taking Stock Of Bone Broth: Sorry, No Cure-All Here At more than $12 per quart at many stores, bone broth is no longer a food for the poor. Its healthful properties (and familiarity) have made it the elixir du jour. And it's a relatively easy sell in a time when even Wal-Mart carries organic products and foods filled with the antioxidant of the month. Yet until recently, bone broth — even made from grass-fed meats — was relatively inexpensive to produce due to the low price of bones. That's not the case any longer. Tressa Yellig, who started Portland, Ore., broth company Salt, Fire & Time in 2009 (and now runs Broth Bar with her sister Katie Yellig), has noticed a spike in prices over the past few years. The company only sources from local farms that meet specific environmental and humane standards, which leaves a short list of farms to partner with. "Trying to get enough bones is really hard," Yellig says. "You have to remember, [bones] were waste products that were going to dog food. Farmers were ecstatic if they could get anything for them." Today, a butcher in Seattle might be selling beef bones for $4 a pound retail when the Yelligs used to pay a farmer about $30 per case of bones – between 30 and 50 pounds. Just three years ago, it wasn't worth it for Katherine Johnson of Virginia's Dragonfly Farms to get her bones back from the butcher. "They didn't sell," she explained. "They take up a lot of space and we have to pay to have them packaged." Then the calls started coming in. People and restaurants wanted bones. Now she's charging $2 per pound. Jenni Harris of White Oak Pastures in Georgia is a fifth-generation rancher whose family has been raising cattle since 1866. Today, White Oak tries to make use of every part of its animals by selling tallow soaps, leather bags and even candles. They used to grind up unused bones to use on the farm as fertilizer. So even Harris was surprised by the sudden demand for bones one winter a few years ago. "Our knuckle, marrow and soup bones stayed sold out," she said. Eventually she learned that her customers were making broths at home using the beef bones she sold. Since then, growth has been explosive, she says. "We hardly have any bones left over at the end of the week." Despite the sourcing difficulties, the Yelligs have used the high price of beef and chicken bones (still the most popular meats to make broth from) to try to expand their customers' broth horizons. All of Salt, Fire & Time's broths are priced the same, but the margins for chicken and beef keep getting smaller. "No one wants to pay for broth the way they pay for steak," Yellig said. Salt, Fire & Time also sells broths made from lamb, bison, pork, turkey and alpaca bones. But Tressa Yellig says many customers think the only way to make broth is with chicken. They often expect lamb or bison broth to taste gamey. "When we do conferences or events we don't take chicken for just that reason," Yellig said. How will anyone know if they like alpaca broth if they never try it? Tove K.

The decision by the full 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago comes just three weeks after a three-judge panel in Atlanta ruled the opposite, saying employers aren’t prohibited from discriminating against employees based on sexual orientation. It also comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has begun setting its own policies on LGBT rights. The case stems from a lawsuit by Indiana teacher Kimberly Hively alleging that the Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend didn’t hire her full time because she is a lesbian. Google’s ad placement MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Google engineers, product managers and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Companies like AT&T and Johnson & Johnson said they would pull their ads from YouTube, as well as Google’s display advertising business, until they could get assurances that such placement would not happen again. Fox News bias lawsuit NEW YORK — A third Fox News Channel employee has joined two colleagues in their lawsuit that says they were subjected to racial discrimination by a since-fired executive. Monica Douglas said former controller Judith Slater, who was fired Feb. 28, frequently expressed an unwillingness to be near black people. Ms. Douglas is black, as are colleagues Tichaona Brown and Tabrese Wright, who filed suit against Fox last week. Ms. Douglas, who is Panamanian, said in the lawsuit that Ms. Slater told her she wouldn’t let her dogs eat food Panamanians eat. She said Ms. Slater frequently referred to her status as a breast cancer survivor, calling her the “one-boobed girl” and the like. Ms. Douglas said she complained about Ms. Slater’s comments in 2014 and nothing was done. Also in the nation ...

A sale to an investment firm could help Staples escape the glare of the public market, where its shares have more than halved in three years. The move comes less than a year after its proposed merger with rival retailer Office Depot Inc (ODP.O) was torpedoed on antitrust grounds. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is confidential. Staples spokesman Mark Cautela declined to comment on Tuesday. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples had a market value of $5.65 billion as of Monday. Staples shares rose as much as 15.5 percent on Tuesday, and were still up 10.1 percent at $9.54 in afternoon trading. Staples, which made its name selling papers and pens, has for years been hurt by the digitization of the workplace and increased competition from online retailers including Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and big-box stores such as Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT). In 2015, it tried to address these challenges by merging with rival Office Depot, but the deal was called off a year later due to antitrust concerns. Since then, Staples has announced cost-cutting plans and operational restructuring. Last year, it sold its UK business to restructuring specialist Hilco Capital for a “nominal” amount and a majority stake of its European business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. In the United States, it has focused on selling to small businesses in light of changing consumer habits and has embarked on an office sharing program, opening up some of its stores as communal working space. Staples, which has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada, last month announced plans to sell roughly 60 stores in North America. Staples has made executive changes as well, appointing Shira Goodman as CEO in September. Goodman, who had held a number of positions as Staples, also worked for years as a consultant at consulting firm Bain and Co. Private equity firm Bain Capital LLC helped support the founding of Staples in the 1980s and took it public in 1989. Staples has the largest market share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent and that share has been increasing since 2011, according to Euromonitor. TROUBLED SECTOR Private-equity acquisitions of retailers have become increasingly rare, as the investment firms worry about increasing headwinds facing the industry and their portfolio companies struggle with the debt burden left behind from leveraged buyouts. Retail deals comprised the smallest share of mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, backed by buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners, filed for bankruptcy last year. The owners of high-end U.S. department store chain Neiman Marcus, Ares Management LP (ARES.N) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CPPIB have begun to consult restructuring advisers. The level of debt issued by U.S. retailers trading at distressed levels remains elevated, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said last month. In early March, Standard & Poor’s had taken 20 negative actions against retailers, including downgrades of iconic department stores including Macy’s Inc (M.N). Moody’s said in an outlook note last year that the office supply sector will continue to struggle, with operating profit expected to be nearly flat in 2017. Still, Staples’ bonds maturing in 2018 are trading at face value, indicating investor confidence in the company. In its most recent quarter, Staples recorded a net loss of $615 million and a sales decline of 3 percent compared with the prior year. It expects to have at least $500 million in free cash flow this year, according to its quarterly earnings. The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier on Tuesday that Staples was exploring a sale.

Move aside, indoor sports. It is time to celebrate America’s pastime for the next seven months. It doesn’t feel like it was that long ago that I was staying up late watching the Cubs win Game seven of the World Series and completely ignoring an exam I had the next morning. I don’t remember what class the exam was for, but I remember the game. That’s usually how those kinds of things work out. As great as baseball continues to be, I used to think – and still do, to a degree – that we lost sight of what baseball really is: a game. It’s a kid’s game, really. But maybe that’s also why it feels like so much more than just a game to its fans later in life. It becomes a souvenir of sorts from their childhood. Baseball is not changing your underwear because you’re on a seven-game hitting streak. It’s yelling indecipherable chants of encouragement from the dugout when your teammate is at bat. Sometimes it’s being able to call yourself an athlete and still be fat enough to not get questioned when zooming around Wal-Mart in one of those motorized carts. It’s going broke and building a full-size diamond in your cornfield just to play catch with the ghost of your father. And it’s definitely NOT about crying, no matter how much “Field of Dreams” may tempt you. Above all other interpretations of the game, the Fourth of July scene from “The Sandlot” perfectly depicts what baseball, at its core, is meant to be. It’s that part in the movie when the kids play their only night game of the season under the light of the fireworks. It sounds super cheesy, but they played because they loved baseball. They didn’t play for college scholarships. They didn’t have an adult screaming in their faces because the rookie-division-house-league title was on the line. All the “Sandlot” kids cared about was having enough players to field a team and a ball to play with that day. That movie took place in the ‘50s. Things are a little different today. From a young age, thousands of kids around the country are brought up specializing in one sport – in this case, baseball – going to private lessons and clinics year-round. But when you’re 12 years old, there are only so many mid-January practices in a gymnasium and ultra-competitive, whack-job coaches you can stand before falling out of love with baseball. In a way, the competitiveness in youth baseball is robbing kids of what is supposed to be their pastime. A pastime when many years down the road, the smell of a leather glove brings them back to the time their grandfather took them to their first ballgame, or the time their dad first taught them how to play catch. Not a pastime when what mattered was the numbers on the scoreboard or the radar gun. To me, baseball will always be about the times I shared with my dad. The times he’d practically throw his arm out tossing batting practice to me after work because I wanted to finally hit a home run, or the conversations we had in the car traveling to and from games. Kids should still be able to take away memories like these. Memories of something much bigger than just a game. Memories they can look back fondly upon long after their playing days are over that root themselves in a lifelong relationship with baseball.

Done Editing Tags 86 Comments Share this article 93 93 93 The New Brandeis movement wants to demolish a source of that concentration—monopolies. David Dayen at The Nation writes—This Budding Movement Wants to Smash Monopolies: In a conference room overlooking the Chicago River last week, 35 years of thinking about the economy came under direct challenge. It won’t get as much attention as a Sean Spicer press conference or a Bernie Sanders town hall, but decades from now it may prove much more important to how our economy is organized. The University of Chicago Stigler Center’s three-day conference asked, “Does America Have a Concentration Problem?” A sufficient response to this could be “go outside.” Virtually every major sector in our economy has been whittled down to a few major players. Two companies produce nearly all of America’s toothpaste. One, Luxottica, produces nearly all the sunglasses. There are four cable and Internet providers, who have divvied up the country and rarely compete. There are four major airlines. There are four major commercial banks. There are four major Internet platforms — Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Google — controlling your information flow, your data, and your virtual life. These markets are shrinking further, thanks to a continuing wave of mergers. Bayer is buying Monsanto to control a significant section of the agricultural seed market. AT&T and Time Warner’s combination would tie a content distributor to a content provider. The Walgreens-Rite Aid deal would narrow major chain pharmacies down to two (three if you’re generous and include Walmart). Platform monopolies like Google are buying a firm a week; it’s become a large part of their research and development strategy to acquire ideas and market share simultaneously. This market consolidation has wide-reaching effects beyond the higher prices monopolies can charge due to lack of competition. Quality suffers when consumers have nowhere else to turn. Supply chains become fragile – an outage from Amazon Web Services, the leader in cloud computing, took out half the Internet in February. Economic power begets political power and democratic institutions suffer. Personal liberty to use talents and skills gets stymied when there’s only one game in town. Barriers to entry have led to a decline in business startups and a retrenching of economic dynamism. Inequality grows when a few at the top gather all the rewards in a market. Our growing monopolization didn’t happen by accident. Starting in the 1970s, a group of academics led by failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork changed the view of antitrust law, which was originally intended to break up concentrated power. Without altering a word in the Sherman Antitrust Act, Bork and his colleagues – known as the “Chicago school” because of their devotion to University of Chicago neoclassical economic theories – rewrote history, determining that antitrust merely concerned “consumer welfare,” an economic study of prices, rather than effects on competition. Starting in the Reagan administration, the Chicago school’s capture of antitrust theory has brought us to a period of market concentration unrivaled since the Gilded Age. A new group of scholars and activists has rebelled against Chicago school dictates. You can call them the “New Brandeis movement.” Louis Brandeis, before reaching the Supreme Court, advised President Woodrow Wilson in the election of 1912, condemning “the curse of bigness” and favoring breakups of those trusts that the Sherman Act had yet to dismantle. Under Wilson, Congress closed Sherman Act loopholes with the Clayton Antitrust Act, and created the Federal Trade Commission to combat monopoly power. As Brandeis wrote, “We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can’t have both.” [...] An Activists’ Calendar of Resistance Events TOP COMMENTS • HIGH IMPACT STORIES QUOTATION "To sit home, read one's favorite paper, and scoff at the misdeeds of the men who do things is easy, but it is markedly ineffective.

Kruse (@KevinMKruse) April 4, 2017 BLAST FROM THE PAST At Daily Kos on this date in 2005—Cornyn: Violence against judges understandable: Remarks by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) on the Senate floor today: I don't know if there is a cause-and-effect connection but we have seen some recent episodes of courthouse violence in this country. Certainly nothing new, but we seem to have run through a spate of courthouse violence recently that's been on the news and I wonder whether there may be some connection between the perception in some quarters on some occasions where judges are making political decisions yet are unaccountable to the public, that it builds up and builds up and builds up to the point where some people engage in—engage in violence. Violence against judges is nothing short of domestic terrorism. And Cornyn (along with DeLay and their ilk) are nothing more than apologists for such violence. ​​​ 86 Comments Share this article 93 93 93 86 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Changes could help Honeysuckle traffic problem Lance Griffin Lance Griffin 4 hrs ago (…) Lance Griffin Dothan District 4 Commissioner John Ferguson addresses residents during a public meeting Tuesday at the Family Life Center of Selma Baptist Church. Changes could be coming to alleviate congestion and traffic hazards at one of Dothan’s most confusing intersections. The awkward conflagration of Honeysuckle and Hatton Road on one side of South Park Avenue, with Moore Road coming in from the other side at Selma Baptist Church, has caused accidents, near-accidents and congestion for several years. The opening of James Oates Park this weekend, along with expected further development in the general area, will only add to the congestion. One of the most affected areas is Moore Road. Motorists looking to avoid Ross Clark Circle are piling on to Honeysuckle Road and traveling south to South Park Avenue, then jetting across South Park to squeeze on to Moore Road and use it as a cut-through to Taylor Road to access the southside Wal-Mart and, most likely, James Oates Park. According to recent traffic counts, about 2,500 cars travel on Moore Road in any given 24-hour period, about four times more than normal for the dwellings along the road. Assistant Public Works Director Charles Metzger said Tuesday evening during a community meeting held by District 4 Commissioner John Ferguson that the city is looking to construct two cul de sacs on Moore Road that would keep the residences accessible, but preclude cut-through traffic. Metzger also said the cul de sacs would assist in alleviating drainage issues that often lead to flooding. The cul de sacs are relatively inexpensive. The solution appeared to be well received by homeowners along Moore Road. The project could be the first of a handful of projects in the future to alleviate congestion in the area and solve the awkward configuration at the intersection. A comprehensive Honeysuckle Road corridor study is currently being performed. The study begins at Honeysuckle Road and Highway 84 West and is expected to offer suggestions for improvements all the way to Highway 231 South. Potential suggestions include the widening of Honeysuckle Road from Highway 84 West to Fortner Street, a slight movement of Honeysuckle Road north near South Park Avenue to avoid the awkward intersection, and a potential extension of Honeysuckle Road. “We are trying to look at what we can do, and of course that has to do with what we can afford,” Ferguson said Tuesday during the community meeting held at Selma Baptist Church. I travel this area often and I know things right now are sort of edgy at best.” Metzger said solving the traffic issues in the area can be tricky because one solution in one area can cause a greater problem in another. Metzger said he believes the potential widening of Honeysuckle Road to Fortner Street is essential. “At the end of the day, you have to do something about that bottleneck at the front,” Metzger said. Ferguson said the matter is a priority for him because residential development is expected to increase traffic in the future. “This is not just about the ball park traffic,” Ferguson said. Metzger expects public meetings to be held on the Honeysuckle corridor study in June and/or July. About 100 residents attended the public meeting, which also included updates about city finances, sewer projects and long-term debt.

Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ U.S. pricing, availability, and offers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/03/29 10:34am PDTMar 29, 2017 11 Plus 1 on G+ 36 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 AT&T Cricket Wireless Galaxy S8 MetroPCS News Samsung Sprint T-Mobile US Cellular Verizon Wireless Videos Article Contents 1 Carriers 1.1 AT&T 1.2 Sprint 1.3 T-Mobile 1.4 U.S. Cellular 1.5 Verizon 2 Retail 2.1 Best Buy The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ are finally official, after months of leaks, speculation, and rumors. The phone seems like more than just another iterative step for good ol' Sammy, what with the shift to softkeys for navigation (finally), the new screen aspect ratio, and so on. But as exciting as all of this is, I am certain that those of you who are interested in either phone will want to know where, when, and for how much you can pick one up. Luckily, we've compiled a nice list for you. Before we get started, here's the official blurb from Samsung: "In the U.S., the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver. Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173. AT&T, Cricket Wireless, Sprint, Straight Talk Wireless, T-Mobile, U.S. Cellular, and Verizon Wireless will carry the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ in stores beginning April 21. In addition, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will be available at all Best Buy stores as well as BestBuy.com, ShopSamsung app, Target and Walmart." Carriers Most of the carriers have chimed in at this point, although we are still missing information from Cricket and Straight Talk. We'll keep you updated as we learn more. AT&T The blue carrier has announced its pricing and availability for the S8. Pre-orders open tomorrow, March 30, and there are a few pricing options. AT&T Next customers can get the smaller phone for $25 per month, or the larger for $28.34 per month — both for 30-month terms.That, taking into account the 0% APR, brings the final retail price to $750 and $852 respectively, excluding taxes (which are due at the time of sale). In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle A Gear S3 for $49 with a two-year contract A Galaxy Tab E or Gear S2 for $0.99 with a two-year contract AT&T also mentions that Samsung's newest devices will be the first ones to take advantage of the carrier's "5G Evolution Markets" program. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are expected to be available on April 21. Sprint Sprint's pre-orders begin tomorrow, March 30th, including the same three colors as the other US carriers, along with the Gear VR bundle. You can also choose to upgrade to the Gear VR "Experience" bundle that includes a set of premium on-ear headphones and a 256GB memory card along with the Gear VR pack. Sprint will offer the S8 for $31.25 per month for 18 months on lease, and the S8+ will be $35.42 for the same 18 months. Sprint adds that Boost and Virgin will stock the standard S8 starting on April 21st. Sprint's standard retail price for the S8 and S8+ will be $750 and $850, respectively. T-Mobile Team Magenta, on the other hand, released plenty of details for the S8, pricing, and network capabilities (what's a Tmo press release without the company talking about its network?). Customers can pre-order Samsung's latest at 9:01pm PT tonight, March 29. Both phones can be had for $30/month on the Equipment Installment Plan for 24 months. The catch is that the S8 requires $30 (plus taxes) down initially, whereas the S8+ requires $130 down. That makes the phones $750 and $850 respectively when all is said and done. Pre-orderers will also score the new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free. T-Mobile is also hyping up its new network technology, where the S8 will be the first to take advantage of a trifecta of stuff. I don't want to spoil your experience reading up on it, so be sure to check out the source links at the end of the post. MetroPCS customers can also take advantage of the pre-order freebies. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ are supposed to launch on April 21. U.S. Cellular The underdog of the bunch, U.S. Cellular is also getting in on the new Galaxy goodness. Where this carrier is hoping to stand out is that customers can get the S8/S8+ for nothing down (with qualifying trade-in) — if you don't have such a device and want a new Galaxy S8, the company will give a you a $100 promo card. As for pricing, U.S. Cellular's press release doesn't actually specify what customers will pay. Though, if my calculator skills prove correct, I'd bet around $31/mo for the S8 and $35/mo for the S8+, assuming 0% APR and no down payment. Like its competitors, U.S. Cellular is giving its customers a Gear VR controller bundle for free if they pre-order between tomorrow, March 30, and April 20. I think it's pretty safe to assume that the phones will be available on April 21. U.S. Cellular reached out to us to offer a correction to the original press release. Only the Galaxy S8 will be "free," but the S8+ will cost $3.64 per month on a 30-month "retail installment contract." You can find the updated press release here or at the updated U.S. Cellular source link at the bottom of the post. Verizon We round out our carrier list with Verizon. Big Red is offering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ to Unlimited customers for $15/month for 24 months, 0% APR, with an eligible device trade-in. In short, that's a very good deal. Pre-orderers can choose between two additional options: 1) The new Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free, or 2) the Experience Box, which includes the aforementioned free bundle plus a pair of Harman Kardon headphones and a 256GB microSD card, for $99. If you don't have a qualifying device for trade-in, then you'll need to pay $30 per month for the S8 ($720 final) or $35 per month for the S8+ ($840 final). Overall, Verizon has some of the better pricing for Samsung's new flagships. Both phones will be available on April 21. Retail There will be a few retail stores (besides the obvious carrier ones) where you can purchase a Galaxy S8 or S8+. Right now, we only have information from Best Buy, but you can also expect some news from Target and Walmart in the near future. Best Buy There isn't much to say with the electronics retailer, other than it is taking pre-orders for the S8/S8+ starting tomorrow. Like with Verizon, pre-orderers can get the Gear VR controller and Oculus content bundle for free or the Experience Box for $99. Best Buy is also offering Geek Squad Complete Protection (i.e. insurance) in case your phone breaks or something. Also be checking the stores and the website for cases, accessories, and whatnot.

Just buy the thing outright and save yourself a ton of dough in the long run. Cellphone Chris How is it any cheaper to do that? The carriers will allow you to buy outright as well - it's not like they charge interest on the installment plans. ddevito Right - then why use the carrier at all then? Suicide_Note The carrier versions have actually been getting updated quicker than the unlocked US models. Plus, the carriers offer easy installment plans. ddevito Okay, that's a good reason I guess. That's insane to me but I'm not disagreeing with you. Suicide_Note I agree. One would think the unlocked models would be updated faster, but unfortunately that hasn't been the case lately. Adil Tajgeer this. and with the phone launching on 7.0 instead of 7.1 i don't see samsung actually updating this round of unlocked phones in the US any faster. (the unlocked US model STILL doesn't have Nougat when all US carrier models do.) Jay Quir I dont beleive the unlocked model best buy will be selling will be the u.s. version. It will probably be a international one instead. Can't remember which international version the black s7 was though Adil Tajgeer I didn't think best buy sold international models, the s7 was a us unlocked model. But it would be better if they sold the intl ones since they seem to get better support. Jay Quir Yea they sold two versions of the gs7 one was the silver u.s. unlocked and the black international. I ended up taking back the black one due to not having samsung pay at the time ( I got way too used to Samsung Pay) now that samsung pay seems to be available in all countries ( I beleive) that shouldnt be a problem with the s8/s8 +. Although the international version s7 could not receive best buy geek squad protection. Jay Quir Yup still waiting for it, bet anything they wont update it until a month or so or the day of the s8 launch. Jay Quir Best buy up charges the unlocked models yet give you so many months to pay for it. All depends on how bad you dont want that carrier logo 😂 Suicide_Note Best Buy has the unlocked S8+ for $825, which is $25 cheaper than the carriers. Jay Quir Nice! Before they used to up charge the price. Still have to wait a month later but not that bad of a wait blueman24 Why would anyone who cares about updates buy a samsung phone in the first place? Doby Gillis Choice. Look up the definition if it confuses you. ddevito But won't you have more choices if bought outright? Adil Tajgeer i'm not sure i'm following your argument. what extra choices would you have in buying the unlocked model? as for cost, BYOD nets you the same discount as using an EIP on the major carriers, so you don't save anything on your bill. i can see if you want to use an MVNO and their service/price is a better option, but if one is happy with what they are getting service wise from a major carrier, there is no real benefit to buying a phone outright. if there is, please enlighten me, because i truly can't see the benefit. ddevito yes, more choice as in carriers. MVNOs use the same networks and are way cheaper. So I don't see YOUR point Adil Tajgeer MVNOs don't always offer the right service packages for everyone. if an MVNO works for you, then it's great as you can potentially save $20-30 a month, but if it doesn't and you're using a major carrier anyways, then there is really no reason to buy the phone outright. ddevito Okay, but you kind of said the same thing I did. Adil Tajgeer the issue is that MVNOs aren't a good deal for everyone. sometimes the plan offered by the major carrier works better for the user, and in that case, the EIP makes far more sense than buying the phone outright. everyone should shop around to see what works for them, being on a major carriers plan JUST to be able to get the phone in installments is a bad idea for sure. Michael2011 Just pay the damn thing off and free up your monthly income. You're essentially financing a phone and getting into debt. Debt is risk. Adil Tajgeer You're not spending any more or less money total either way. A fixed loan at 0% interest is not the same thing as a credit card, nor is it as dangerous. Michael2011 Lol. My friends who think like you are basically broke and better hope they stay in good health. Their monthly income is tied up in 0% fixed loans. One catastrophic event and they're bankrupt. Adil Tajgeer Sorry your friends have no idea how to manage their finances. Michael2011 Yup. As well as most Americans who believe debt (a fixed rate of 0% is still debt) is normal and acceptable. The problem is it ties up their income and introduces stress and risk because life happens (unexpected financial burdens). It's always best to save up and pay for toys in full. Michael2011 As well as many in countries where financing every little thing is normal. Have fun with your debt/liability. Adil Tajgeer I will, because the $30 a month is not going to break my budget. I know how to manage my money. Thanks! Michael2011 Sure you do. Keep living the debt life. Adil Tajgeer Keep living that judge life. You don't know me man, so kindly piss off with your judgement. Michael2011 You mad bro? Adil Tajgeer Nah, it really doesn't matter to me. ddevito Exactly. It's astonishing how dumb people are with money. Cellphone Chris I agree that updates are more timely. Also, why invest the capital up front when you don't need to? It's the same benefit of leasing a car - Controlled expense and the ability to upgrade more frequently - By the time your manufacturer's warranty is set to expire, you've most likely moved on to a newer device. ddevito Right, and I see your point of view with the warranty. But owning it outright gives you more choice and more flexibility with the device itself and the carrier it operates on. Yes, controlled expenses work when the total assets total much more than we have in our bank accounts (why mortgages exist, and car payments) but a < $1000 piece of equipment shouldn't have this much control of your expenses. It's ludicrous Cellphone Chris I agree with your assessment if the ability to switch carriers adds value for you. I've been very satisfied with mine, so I tend to lean the other way. Dllemm Except Sprint doesn't work with Verizon doesn't work with AT&T. And sim card locks. Justin W On top of that, with the value of money decreasing over time (inflation), paying $30/mo is better in the long-run with 0% interest than paying all of it down now, though of course this depends on whether or not you could/will invest the remaining amount in an investment that will be a net positive when considering inflation rate. MJ I don't know where you live but inflation is "low" in the US so that is not really a factor on "small" purchases like this. Saying that, I wouldn't ever buy a carrier phone nor want to be committed to service for the long term. This is ignoring the fact, that personally ,I could pay the balance immediately). niuguy Time value of money....$1 now is more valuable than $1 in a year. Inflation is only one component in that equation. MJ What? Time is a factor but NOT over two years for the amount in question. Again, inflation has been irrelevant for years now and the American dollar stable for even longer. The argument makes sense if purchasing a car or house but NOT a phone. Justin W I'd agree it's not a significant factor, but the value of money over time decreases in this economy. That may change, but typically it doesn't, but if we're looking at efficiency, that is probably the best way to do if you don't mind having a slightly higher monthly payment. As @niuguy:disqus said, the money is more valuable now than it will be in a month, a year, two years, etc. and that applies to pretty much everything. Defenestratus Believe it or not, many American's cannot find an emergency $500 if it came down to it. The smartest thing they did is release this around tax refund season since that is likely the only way a lot of people will be able to afford this handset at full retail. ddevito I agree with you, but it's so sad Maha Rashtrian Tax season point covered. Michael2011 Those people have no business buying a $750+ phone then. Adil Tajgeer if you're happy with your carrier, i don't see the issue with the EIP, it's a 0% interest loan and you need a carrier to use the phone anyways. if you are unhappy with service you can pay it off and move on, they will unlock the phone if its paid off, and with the verizon models they're unlocked anyways. i'd rather keep my money liquid than dump it all in a phone for no actual benefit. ddevito I don't mean to sound like an elitist, but having a "liquid" $800 isn't going to make or break you, and if you do your homework you will realize you will save money in the long run, thus being more "liquid" in the long run. I can understand expensive home appliances such as a furnace or roof, or a car payment, but not a smartphone. Adil Tajgeer that only works if you find an MVNO that is acceptable to you in terms of service for the price. metroPCS is $60 to get even close to the plan i have with tmo for $70, and they will still cap you at a far lower amount than tmo straighttalk is the same and will also cap you at a low amount same with mint so you have more options and can potentially save some money, but you also are getting less for that savings. i'll take my 30gb soft cap before throttling, unlimited international roaming, more tethering allowance, and other random perks for the $10-15 more a month. i get that $800-1000 isn't a ton of money, but i have yet to find an MVNO that really offers me much more for my money, and if one is on a major provider already then there is no benefit to sinking any amount of cash for no gain. ddevito I pay $55/month for Straight Talk on AT&T's network for 10GB. It's a great deal and I'm not capped until I reach the 10GB. Not sure what low amount you're referring to. Adil Tajgeer i pay $70 for unlimited on tmobile and i'm not capped until 30. being that i regularly use 15-20gb a month on average, the 10gb caps don't work for me, especially for the $15 in savings. plus their international roaming is a livesaver and has saved me a considerable amount of money traveling. most MVNOs at the 50+ price range will give you 10GB of data. if someone's usage is below 10GB (even more so if they use less than 6GB) MVNOs offer a good value, but if you use a lot of data (especially if you use more than 10GB) there is little benefit gained by using an MVNO. that is the crux of my argument, if you are happy with what you are getting from a major carrier, and MVNOs don't offer you what you need from a provider, then there is no benefit from buying the phone outright versus an EIP. if a new MVNO pops up, or offers a new plan that works better, simply paying off the phone you have will let you jump ship to them and you will be out the same money you would have been if you had bought it outright in the first place. niuguy The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. rockstarr27 The price isn't the issue, t-mobile is $750 with only $30 monthly payments, no interest, so you're actually saving money since it's still $750 in the future even when inflation has devalued your money. The real carrier scam is carrier lock-in. ddevito Okay, sure, but that's just T-Mobile. Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable. MadMartigan "Unless you live in a metro area their coverage is miserable." So the LTE in my hometown is imaginary? Cool... ddevito TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US, I'm happy you have coverage, good for you. MadMartigan "TMO coverage is awful in the majority of the US" Right, right. Obviously. /s ddevito If their coverage was decent they'd have a ton more customers. Surely you can't really believe it's that good can you? Trust me I hope I'm wrong but I know I'm not. I would love to be able to use them, but it's never going to happen. MadMartigan Wireless customers: Verizon Wireless: 145.7 million (Q4 2016) AT&T Mobility: 135 million (Q4 2016) T-Mobile US: 71.5 million (Q4 2016) Out of curiosity, exactly how many customers do they need to be considered to have "decent coverage"? ddevito Misleading stat - they're a metro based carrier. MadMartigan Ah. Well then. I guess that's that. DKBNYC How is having to pay off the phone a termination fee? You agreed to buy the phone at a set price. They were kind enough to let you do that over a set number of months. You decided 10 months in that you no longer want to use the service. Well you agreed to pay for a phone. Shouldn't you have to pay what you owe on your phone? " It isn't hard math to do once you realize how much dough you actually save with a sim-only/MVNO, etc." Didn't you have to buy a phone to use this? Whats the difference? tim242 It's the same price either way. ddevito For the phone, yes. But for service included, not even close. tim242 That has nothing to do with the price of the phone througj the carrier. ddevito I never said it did. But read your bill, you're paying for that phone whether you realize it or not. You simply want to troll and argue, but you're not doing a sufficient job keeping your argument going. I also added the cost of the service to my original point. In the long run you're paying more, it's a simple fact. You like paying more? Good for you, capitalism loves people like you. tim242 I don't know where you reside, but US carriers removed subsidies years ago. ddevito Yes. But you're still paying for it. But you're a troll, I get it. I'm moving on. MadMartigan "it's the same price either way" now equals trolling? I must have missed that memo - or the part where he made any kind of claim as to not "still paying for it"... tim242 I'm a troll for proving you wrong. Ok. ddevito Since you always need to get the last word in, I'm replying again. tim242 Blocked. yardie good luck buying a phone with no service what a tool ddevito Lots of people do, it's buying it unlocked. Are you new? TechGuy22 no, you end up paying more in long run tim242 What are you talking about? The S8 is $720 full retail on Verizon, or $30 per month for 24 months. That is $720 either way. yardie stop smoking crack bruh youre so stupid. please learn basic Math ddevito Read your carrier bill, do the math. It's quite simple, you pay more in the long run. Benedict Weren't carrier phones also optimized for their specific network? ddevito Perhaps, but I don't believe that's the case with recent phones, but I can be wrong. Paco Inurreta I pay the same montly fee with my carrier with a phone or without it. Buying the phone from my carrier gives me 50% off the total phone price in a 24 month contract which I already use with or without a contract. So no, is not a scam if you know what the heck is up! Brendan Sprint seems to be offering a Gear VR with controller, content bundle, and an exclusive "Platinum Experience with Samsung Rewards". Cakefish UK pricing: S8: £689 S8+: £779 S7 series launch day pricing for comparison: S7: £569 (S8 is 21% more expensive) S7 edge: £639 (S8+ is 22% more expensive) Conclusion: thanks Brexit :( Moeen Ahmed Any VR headset available with pre orders? Checked Samsung and Carphone and neither seemed to offer VR headset. Christopher Bailey (Xcom923) you need to look at https://samsungpromotions.com/ X-47B You can't compare directly like that. You have to take into account inflation and base storage as well. Check prices against 64GB S7. Cakefish Yep, UK inflation is the highest it's been for years. I wonder why? Because Brexit. Samsung didn't sell 64GB S7 in UK by the way, only 32GB, so that comparison is moot. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan S8 is more expensive in general too. Us TRUE €UROPEANS are gonna get fked too.

These days only, I generated close to $36k so far with nothing but my computer and some free time, however i have a full-time nine to 5 job. Even everyone new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income may go much very high over time... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Xk StopBeingOffendedDERP ridiculous blaming it on Brexit. Please, continue being a slave to a non-UK nation controlling who can enter your country and take jobs, vs. UK leaders. Cakefish Ridiculous eh? What caused the pound to drop considerably in value vs the US dollar in the last 12 months? Thereby making imported goods considerably more expensive. The Brexit referendum result. Francisco Peña Brexit happened 9 months ago. Maybe the pound dropped because the markets knew that Obama would finally leave and praise the banks that he did. StopBeingOffendedDERP The vote happened - the actual exit will take planning. Francisco Peña Should have been clearer.. yes, the actual thing won't happen until 2 yrs from now, I meant the referendum, was 9 months ago, but that basically set the wheels moving. My point wasn't to blame Brexit (referendum or otherwise) entirely as it was more the US markets increasing due to Obama leaving... Cakefish Brexit didn't happen 9 months ago, the referendum did. Article 50 was only just triggered today. So there's still roughly 2 years before the UK is officially out of the EU. And what does the former US president's term coming to an end have to do with the currency of the UK? Francisco Peña That's what I meant.. the vote... which led to 9 months later May invoking Article 50. Brexit officially won't happen for 2 yrs, but for all intents and purposes, the referendum started it. StopBeingOffendedDERP As noted, Brexit would cause economic impact when first implemented. That would be 'short term'. If I were told 'merge with Mexico and Canada, let them dictate social, economic and trade policies, be powerless regarding who has essentially free reign to enter and hold jobs', I would gladly pay more money for luxury items. I guess that is my ultimate point. Overall, Brexit WILL be good for the UK and bad for the EU. Paying less to lose sovereignty is totally independence, IMHO. Cakefish They say 'short term' but this period of extreme economic uncertainty will last a minimum of another two years (until UK officially leaves the EU) and possibly many more as trade deals between nations often take many years to finalise and Scotland will try and break away again as soon as they can hold another independence referendum. Defenestratus So wait, if you do the pre-order promo do you get the VR headset with the controller? Or just the Controller? I'm so confused. Suicide_Note You get both. Defenestratus Score! Benedict Germany: Preorders are live, 799€, 899€, shipping 18th April 2017 rockstarr27 And unlocked is where? Synacks When Verizon means trade-in up top, do they mean existing customer trade-in as in Edge-Up? Or do they mean new customers trading in a device from another carrier? Corey W. Trading in any device, but it must be paid off entirely. tim242 They have the yearly upgrade now. They pay off the last half with your trade-in. But you have to have one of the devices from the last year or two that qualifies. Adil Tajgeer Tmobile is also offering that $99 SD card and headphone bundle, and i think samsung is giving the "platinum experience" thing on their end, so all carriers will be offering it Daniel Tiberius Which sd card and headphones are they? Adil Tajgeer Looks like a 256gb card and some on ear akg bt headphones Scott Looks like AT&T's BOGO deal requires a TV package :( TechGuy22 sounds good really expensive but if i can sell my s7 edge for around 300 then i'd be good Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ In addition, Next customers are also eligible for the following promotions: Up to $750 in bill credits toward another S8/S8+ WITH an additional line mind you. looks like a great device....but has battery improvements been made?? seems this will have the same lackluster battery the S7's had. Not that they were horrible, in my eyes, they couldve/shouldve been better. TechGuy22 also bootloader better not locked PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan It is, if you want that don't bother with Samsung TechGuy22 the exynos will be unlocked. the s7 edge is unlocked running remix rom Corey W. Man that $50 Gear S3 is a killer deal even with the $5/m for 24months, that's only a $170bucks headpiece747 Too bad Verizon is not offering that I would get the S8 and S3 in a heartbeat if they did. Corey W. Same lol. On Verizon too. KennyB123 Too bad it's $10/month on AT&T. Corey W. That's tablets or hotspots, connected wearables are $5 KennyB123 Watches are 10 dollars a month on AT&T. I've looked it up twice now to make sure. They are 5 dollars on T-Mobile, and possibly other carriers, but not the death star. Averix Please include the stupid upgrade fees in this pricing. Verizon's cost isn't so attractive when you tack on a useless $30 fee to each phone that has no clear value. MadMartigan T-Mobile is doing this now as well, but I don't remember the exact total of the "upgrade fee".... Lame. dabug91 $30 is what it was years ago. Isn't it $40 now? Averix Pretty sure it's still $30. A few years ago, the fee only applied to contract upgrades. If you were off contract, there was no fee. Then they made the fee mandatory for all. A $30 fee for me to swap a SIM chip ON MY OWN. If they want to charge an in-store setup fee of $30 for people that can't figure out what they're doing, fine. But making me pay a nebulous fee with 0 tangible benefit to me just makes me irritated. Aaron Did you call them first before SIM swapping? I mean if you are buying a new phone through them I can see where they have you but I have never noticed a charge when SIM swapping between phones myself. Of course Verizon tells you that you can't, but I've never noticed any issues afterward. dabug91 Well it was $40 even two years ago. It started at $30 in 2012, went to $35, and then $40, and now it's back down to $30. https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/verizon-raises-upgrade-fee-to-cover-increased-cost-but-its-costs-declined/ Ryan Cottrell Just do it on Verizonwireless.com and they usually waive the fee Averix No, they don't anymore. They used to online for full price buys, but it's locked in as part of the sale now. You may be able to get it waived if you call, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Ryan Cottrell It must just be a sales promotion thing now. When I got on 4 days ago it said it would be waived but not today. Probably because they know they'll make a killing off the pre-orders. Maybe it'll be back sometime before shipment day AbbyZFresh Samsung fans will be able to satisfy their burning desire for a new Galaxy product. It's gonna blow up the smartphone market. Marty The back looks like my Note 5. Nothing different. kapilmachi S8 is all about the front side. Marty ...except for the fingerprint scanner. Analyst_NYC So if i am already an AT&T customer, I can get buy 1 get 1 free (bill credits)? ArrTooDeeToo Meh Margaritas Ante Porcos Still no word on TouchWiz? Did they make it lighter or does it still suck as always? TouchWiz is the only big thank in Samsung phone that makes me look the other way. Kevin I have the S7Edge on Nougat and they've done wonders for TouchWiz (and I think they're calling it something else now). It's still not as lightweight as stock Android but it's considerably better than it's ever been and no longer makes me want to punch the nearest baby. jonzey231 Unlocked availability? Good_Ole_Pinocchio #Unlocked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f4745c019aae7e3c05746af0e61186e5fb91f093c06fdbaea6e834c1cf1ea30a.png Barron Roth Any downside to getting this version? Good_Ole_Pinocchio I mean it's fully unlocked and has the bands for all carriers...... But the unlocked S7 still doesn't have nougat....So theres that. Leonardo Baez You will get updates faster on an unlocked device than a carrier one Good_Ole_Pinocchio No. The US Unlocked models still don't have nougat. All the carrier variants do. Leonardo Baez I bet you that will be an upgrade OTA on the first week after unboxing it Good_Ole_Pinocchio Bro I'm taking about the unlocked S7 from last year lol. Daniel Tiberius Yeah that used to be the case but not anymore. :-( Mike O Probably the best... but those are looking at a May release. Eddy Nelson Lopez Look at the model number, if it ends with the letter U do not buy it if you care about software updates, if the variant ends with the F then do buy it, that's the best variant to receive Software updates and rhe Fastest thanks to the exynos processor. Eddy Nelson Lopez Is this the unlocked version finishing with a letter X like they did with the poor S7 that does not even have 7.0 yet or That's the the one finishing with the letter F AKA the best variant to buy and exynos variant? Good_Ole_Pinocchio The "U" model is the US Model that doesn't have Nougat. Don't think there's an X model. Best Buy used to sell the F International model but I don't think they do anymore since the U model became a thing last year. Eddy Nelson Lopez You're right, the U is the bad variant, the X is the variant they use for Demo purposes at the stores. Leonardo Baez Quick and dirty preview from Casey Neistat. (He works closely with samsung and got a preview sample unit) https://youtu.be/n0makpckS8c Maybe is the unfinished firmware or something else.... but the image quality of video and pictures looks better in the iPhone. Maybe something that can be corrected with an update? Jay Quir Not going to lie I have recently thought about going from cricket to att because of their direct tv cell phone plan bundle. Yet still trying to see if it will save me money in the long run. Anyone have that plan and dont mind saying how much they pay a month for it? Ailín Ó’S Irish pricing (probably same in the rest of the EU.) S8: €799.99 S8+ €899.99 Interestingly there's a network here (3) which will sell the phone 8 days before general release if someone preorders. Must be preordered by 12/4 however which means the phone will be available on 20/4 instead of 28/April. Richard Markert 95xU news? Mr. Robot "Pre-orders for both Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will begin at 12:01 EDT on March 30, 20173" I strongly doubt there's much interest in the S8 by 20173 ;-) brgulker Is it just me, or is that fingerprint sensor in just about the worst possible spot imaginable? Who likes fingerprints all over their camera lenses!?!?! Bonedatt It's just you 😉 Wildcard Funny, if this were a HTC phone, you guys would have been killing them over the pricing Bonedatt Yea but htc screwed themselves. Always one step forward two steps backwards. They just started listening again to their customers. A little too late if you ask me, but I wish them well. I'm a fan of their designs. dblock Really on the fence about getting one of these. They appear to be quite nice, but I don't know if I want to lock myself into Verizon or not. Plus, the new rumors of the OnePlus 5 having an edge variant has me curious. Seeing as OPO phones are kind of the new Nexus phones these days. Vivek Rameses When does opo release their devices? dblock Just doing a quick search on the release dates for the OPO 2 and 3, looks like the summer months is when they typically release new devices. So, hopefully we can expect to seem some details soon on a device from them, with a release in June or July. Dllemm S8 plus? I had to double check, but it looks like they're ripping off Apple's naming scheme now? Cakefish What suffix or prefix would you give the larger model? Daniel Tiberius Ultra!! Cakefish That has been 'claimed' by HTC though ;) Mike O Venti? Dllemm XL or Pro or Edge or something their #1 direct competitor didn't just started using. Suresh Aryal There was Galaxy S2 plus years before iPhone plus. AQ Samsung previously used + on the S6 for the larger screen version (S6, S6 Edge & S6 Edge+) because you could get a 5.1 inch S6 with the Edge screen back then. Dllemm It would help their credibility if (A) they were upfront about pricing and (B) acknowledge that most people use phone cases in their marketing and build the back of their phones more rigid. Daniel Tiberius Anyone know if I can still use Jump On Demand on T-Mobile for this? Flo R. S8 € 799.- S8+ € 899.- In Austria http://www.saturn.at/de/shop/samsung-s8.html?utm_medium=affilate&utm_campaign=SE%5F%5Fsparhamster%2Dpost&utm_source=sparhamster&etcc_var=textlink&etcc_grp=sparhamster&dclid=CNaO16DU_NICFYyPGwodyNEOnA Fiorta I gotta get rid of this Nexus 6. It's terrible... G6 or S8?! Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Ju kidding me mon? S8 or S8 Plus. G6 is nice, but not worth $750. iluvthesoftsoft One Plus 3T, and save $300-$400. Bonedatt OP3T... That's the equivalent (processor wise) to the G6. Fiorta Can't finance through TMobile tho right? Eddy Nelson Lopez I can't believe people still buy phones from US carriers, that's the stupidest idea you can have, just buy the european variant at full price and forget about US carriers controlling your software updates and Just use a pre-paid company like Simple Mobile. lomsha You do that and let others make purchases as they wish. It's a free world. krazy $1199 and $1349 in Australia...

News sign-up Mistrust of US politicians also hits brands News, 05 April 2017 Topics Political audiences Brand equity & strength LOS ANGELES: It may come as little surprise that 70% of Americans believe politicians are less truthful today than 20 years ago, but a new survey has revealed as many as 42% also say the same of brands. That finding has significant implications for marketers, who are having to navigate a cultural landscape that is becoming increasingly divided between left and right, liberal and conservative. And although there is evidence of shared values and common ground among the American public, The Truth About America survey identified a number of "gaps", based on political outlook, in attitudes towards brands, institutions or even foreign countries. Produced by McCann Truth Central, the global agency's intelligence unit, the report's findings were unveiled at the American Association of Advertising Agencies' (4A's) Transformation conference in Los Angeles. Specifically focused on exploring US trends that are currently influencing advertising, the survey involved 1,000 nationally representative US adults and revealed a sharp divide between conservatives and liberals across many categories. For example, conservative Americans emerged as being more trusting of Walmart when asked "If a brand was going to be in charge of the US, which would get the vote?" Liberals, on the other hand, favoured Google, while the overall consensus settled on Amazon. When asked "What's most American?", the common ground answer was burgers, fries and soda, although conservatives named bald eagles and liberals opted for jazz and blues music. NASA emerged as the most trusted institution in the US, although conservatives favoured the US Army while liberals cited the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. And when asked "Which country besides America has the best political system?", the UK got the seal of approval from conservatives while liberals chose Sweden. "America's increasingly pervasive polarisation is creating a new kind of challenge for brand marketers. They have to decide how much to align with values favoured or opposed by one constituency or another," said Steve Zaroff, Chief Strategy Officer of McCann North America. "But what we found in our Truth Central study is that there are also areas of common ground with regard to positively viewed values and institutions," he added. Nancy Hill, President and CEO of the 4A's, agreed with Zaroff, adding: "To be effective, advertising needs to be in tune culturally with the mood and trends of the country. This research shows how critical it is for advertisers to get out and speak to consumers; data is not enough on its own. "While there is a divide – which we are all aware of – there are also shared viewpoints that can be uncovered and leveraged to reach target audiences."

Police say a man set himself and the car on fire. (Paul Aiken / Staff Photographer) Related Stories Mar 27: Man who lit himself on fire outside Lafayette Walmart dies Mar 26: Man lights himself, car on fire in Lafayette Walmart parking lot Recent suicides in Lafayette have shed light on a mental health crisis that has quietly enveloped Boulder County, according to police, who along with city leaders will roll out an outreach campaign dubbed "Because We Care" over the next few weeks. Two violent and public deaths that occurred within Lafayette — the first, when a man shot himself in front of police outside Flatirons Community Church earlier this month, and another on Sunday as dozens of horrified shoppers looked on while a man set fire to himself and his car in a Walmart parking lot — have left residents in the quiet east Boulder County city at a loss for answers.

Bashor, who has served on Lafayette's police force for 34 years, says the recent suicides may be a side effect of a growing mental health crisis in recent years across the community. "When I first started in law enforcement, we would do a 72-hour mental health hold twice a month or so," Bashor said Monday. "Now, oftentimes we see people in need of this once or twice a day. We seem to handle more suicides than we ever did in the past." A 72-hour hold allows for a person with a mental illness to be involuntarily detained for a 72-hour psychiatric hospitalization if the patient is deemed a threat to themselves or others, according to the Welfare and Institutions Code. Last year, Bashor presented his concerns with the increase of mental health calls to the City Council. He suggested exploring a task force aimed at tackling mental health akin to one created by the Colorado Department of Human Services last year and believes the issue poses a stark threat to communities throughout Colorado. The trend is not unique to Lafayette, he said, as Boulder County and state mental health numbers have painted a similar picture in recent years. A total of 52 suicides were reported throughout Boulder County in 2010, according to data provided by the Boulder County Coroner's Office — an increase from 39 reported suicides in 2001. In 2015, the most recent available numbers, 67 suicides were reported in Boulder County, the majority of which were middle-aged males. A report released last year from the Colorado Health Foundation found that the state's suicide rate — one of the highest in the country — had continued upward with 19.4 suicides per 100,000 residents in 2014. That marked an increase from 16.5 suicides per 100,000 residents in 2007. The 2016 study found that 470,000 Coloradans are struggling with mental health issues. "We have certainly noticed an increased need for mental health support," Suzanne Crawford, chief executive for Lafayette's Sister Carmen Community Center, said Monday. "People are very stressed out and people are living in fear in our community for a lot of different reasons." On Monday, Lafayette officials sent out an email blast to its residents titled "Colorado Crisis Services" with links and contact information for local mental health resources. "Personally, I think that people are under a lot more stress these days," Bashor said. "Financial stress, pressures from life in general, and everything brought on with this information age, we are just on overload. Our senses are being bombarded and the filter has gone off on social media. "I think that a lot of times mental health crises are a private issue for some," he added. "So I think these being out in the public view have really brought the spotlight on the threat they pose. The more we keep an eye out for each other in this small town, the better off we'll be."

Photo Credit: NCPD advertisement | advertise on newsday Police patrols of shopping center parking lots have been increased after two elderly women were targeted in robberies in separate incidents less than 24 hours apart outside stores in Westbury and East Rockaway, Nassau County police said. Police aren’t certain if one man is responsible for both crimes. They have released a sketch of the suspect in the first case — a knife-point carjacking outside a Walmart in Westbury that ended with a robbery in Elmont.

When the woman tried to get out, the man grabbed her arm, but she pulled away, got out of the car and began yelling for help, police said. Bystanders came to her aid and called 911. She was not hurt, police said. The man, who did not display a weapon, ran toward Atlantic Avenue, police said. Police said he is in his 30s, about 5-foot-7 to 5-foot-10, with facial hair, and wearing dark clothing and a dark baseball cap. About 1:30 p.m. Sunday, a man armed with a large knife approached an 85-year-old woman who was getting into her vehicle in the Walmart parking lot on Old Country Road in Westbury, police said. He demanded money, forced the woman into the passenger seat, took her keys and drove her to a Chase Bank in Elmont, police said. He forced the woman to give up her ATM card and PIN, and then he withdrew an undisclosed amount of money, police said. The suspect drove about three blocks to Dutch Broadway and Audrey Avenue, where he got out of the vehicle and ran west, police said. The woman, who was left with bruises to her torso, drove to the nearby Fifth Precinct in Elmont to report the crime, police said. The Westbury suspect is 6-foot-1, in his 20s, with a thin build and wearing a dark baseball cap. Detectives request anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at 800-244-TIPS.

The Fool's options expert answers a listener question about how much work you should do yourself with options, and what's appropriate to leave for your broker. Motley Fool Staff Apr 4, 2017 at 5:20PM In this clip from the Industry Focus podcast, Motley Fool Options analyst JP Bennett explains how investors should handle options that are close to expiration. Listen in to find out when it's appropriate to contact your broker, when it's appropriate to just let your broker do all the work it would do anyway, and how to tell the difference between the two. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 24, 2017. Dylan Lewis: "I'm near the expiration of the option. Do I think about it differently if it's in the money versus out of the money?" This is something we touched on a little bit in the first half of the show. JP Bennett: Yeah. When you get close to expiration, depending on the strategy and what your plans are going for, you do have to think about it a little bit differently. When we set up strategies like I referred to earlier, we just let them mature and see what happens in the market. But then, when you get close to expiration, if it's out of the money or in the money and what you need to do will, again, depend on the strategy and what's likely to happen over that couple of days. So, let's say you wrote puts and they end up out of the money, and you get close to expiration. You don't have to do anything. They're going to end without any value, so your best bet there, or, your appropriate course of action to minimize transaction cost and things like that is to do nothing, because after expiration Friday, your broker is going to come in and wipe those obligations from your account, and you're free to write more puts in the following day. If they're in the money and you want to take shares, don't do anything, your broker will automatically put those shares into your account and take out the cash needed to buy those shares. On the flip side, if you have covered calls, if they're out of the money, don't do anything, they're going to expire worthless. If you're in the money and you want to sell shares, don't do anything, your broker is going to do it for you automatically. The differences come into play when you don't want that outcome. Even though, with puts, let's say you want to buy the shares at that given strike price, there could be instances where you want to do what is referred to as rolling the contracts. So, you'll buy back the contracts that you sold in the past, and you'll sell new ones. Maybe you sold April contracts. You can buy those back as you get close to expiration, and write ones for July or something along those lines. Same thing with calls. Basically, the nuts and bolts of it -- and I did a lot of rambling there -- is that it depends. More often than not, when you're asking a basic question with options, that's the appropriate answer. It's a lot easier when you have specific strategies and things like that to go through what you need to think about and do. Lewis: But if you're working with some of the simple options strategies, then more often than not, the broker is going to automatically handle things in the background for you. Bennett: There are certain instances where you're doing something that, just because of technicalities, the broker won't recognize, so you have to either call them up or take action ahead of time. But as long as the option is $0.01 in the money, the broker is going to automatically exercise it for you. Unless, if you have call contracts and they're worth one penny, you can call them up and say, "Dude, don't do it for me, it's not worth it." Otherwise, they're just going to do it. Whether or not you want that to happen is an entirely different matter. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

David Ryder/Getty Images Amazon is going after customers with no debit or credit cards. By MariaLaMagna Reporter No credit or debit card? No problem. As of this week, you can shop on Amazon.com AMZN, +1.72%  without it. The retailer on Monday announced “Amazon Cash,” a new program that allows customers to add money to their online Amazon accounts by purchasing what is essentially an Amazon gift card — even though there’s no actual physical card. With this new service, Amazon will send you a bar code by text message, or will give an option for you print your bar code on paper. Here’s how it works: You load cash onto your Amazon account’s balance by visiting partner stores, which include Speedway, CVS Pharmacy CVS, -0.23% Sheetz and VG’s Grocery, among others. In exchange for cash, the store attendant can scan your bar code and add the balance. Once a shopper has a bar code, whether on their phone or on a piece of paper, they can use it repeatedly to shop on Amazon. This Amazon’s latest way of giving customers as many ways to buy their merchandise as possible. Amazon previously allowed customers to buy gift cards and use them online, but they had to be refilled with a checking account, credit, debit or prepaid card. “Amazon Cash,” on the other hand, can be refilled again (and again) without those options. How self-driving cars will take over more than just the driving(2:32) Daimler CEO and Head of Mercedes-Benz says this is the future of autonomous cars. Paying with Amazon Cash will likely appeal to people who don’t have a debit or credit card. About 7% of households in the U.S. are “unbanked,” meaning they don’t have any type of banking account at an insured institution, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And an additional 20% of households are “underbanked,” meaning they have a bank account, but look outside the banking system to meet other financial needs, including lines of credit. In the past, those customers turned to prepaid debit cards, which often charge high fees, or were unable to shop online, said Michelle Evans, the head of digital consumer research at market-research firm Euromonitor International. “This is just more of a streamlined process for them,” she said. Another critical difference: Unlike many prepaid card services, Amazon Cash does not charge any fees. Don’t miss: Yielding to critics, American Express boosts its sign-up bonus for the Platinum Card Amazon is also advertising that from now until May 31, customers who add $50 to their Amazon Cash accounts will receive a $10 digital credit. Amazon did not immediately respond to an email asking whether there will be any additional loyalty points or benefits in the future. Other companies including Wal-Mart WMT, +0.25%  and PayPal PYPL, +0.21%  have also recently targeted unbanked and underbanked shoppers, with services including Wal-Mart’s reloadable prepaid “MoneyCards” and PayPal’s “Easy Payments” which let customers pay for products in installments instead of putting those purchases on a credit card. Younger shoppers might also benefit from using the new service, said Michael Landau, the payments lead for the financial technology practice at professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Millennials have fewer credit cards on average than their older peers, in part because the Credit CARD Act of 2009 made it more difficult for those under 21 to sign up for cards. Many Americans use credit cards to build a credit history and, therefore, help reduce the cost of future loans. For customers who do have credit and debit cards, however, Amazon Cash will likely be too onerous, said Brendan Miller, a principal analyst at the research firm Forrester. Customers who have credit cards that offer rewards including cash-back will likely want to use those instead, he said. (Amazon even has its own credit card that offers 5% cash back on Amazon purchases, a high percentage compared to even the most lucrative cash-back cards.)

Officials said Frank Savarese III, 33, was charged with aggravated robbery, two counts of petty theft and one count of drug possession. It all started late Sunday night when the store's loss prevention officer saw a man apparently leaving with several hidden items. "The loss prevention officer stopped him, immediately started struggling with him to get him back. A patron assisted the loss prevention officer. They got him in the office. From there, and from the statements, he continued on struggling," said Sheriff Dave Lucas. According to the sheriff, while the man struggled, he appeared to be reaching for something, and a large hunting knife fell from his clothing. When the deputy arrived, they said Savarese went into custody peacefully. He's being held under $24,500.

David Ryder/Getty Images Amazon is going after customers with no debit or credit cards. By MariaLaMagna Reporter No credit or debit card? No problem. As of this week, you can shop on Amazon.com AMZN, +1.72%  without it. The retailer on Monday announced “Amazon Cash,” a new program that allows customers to add money to their online Amazon accounts by purchasing what is essentially an Amazon gift card — even though there’s no actual physical card. With this new service, Amazon will send you a bar code by text message, or will give an option for you print your bar code on paper. Here’s how it works: You load cash onto your Amazon account’s balance by visiting partner stores, which include Speedway, CVS Pharmacy CVS, -0.23% Sheetz and VG’s Grocery, among others. In exchange for cash, the store attendant can scan your bar code and add the balance. Once a shopper has a bar code, whether on their phone or on a piece of paper, they can use it repeatedly to shop on Amazon. This Amazon’s latest way of giving customers as many ways to buy their merchandise as possible. Amazon previously allowed customers to buy gift cards and use them online, but they had to be refilled with a checking account, credit, debit or prepaid card. “Amazon Cash,” on the other hand, can be refilled again (and again) without those options. How self-driving cars will take over more than just the driving(2:32) Daimler CEO and Head of Mercedes-Benz says this is the future of autonomous cars. Paying with Amazon Cash will likely appeal to people who don’t have a debit or credit card. About 7% of households in the U.S. are “unbanked,” meaning they don’t have any type of banking account at an insured institution, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And an additional 20% of households are “underbanked,” meaning they have a bank account, but look outside the banking system to meet other financial needs, including lines of credit. In the past, those customers turned to prepaid debit cards, which often charge high fees, or were unable to shop online, said Michelle Evans, the head of digital consumer research at market-research firm Euromonitor International. “This is just more of a streamlined process for them,” she said.

David Ryder/Getty Images Amazon is going after customers with no debit or credit cards. By MariaLaMagna Reporter No credit or debit card? No problem. As of this week, you can shop on Amazon.com AMZN, +1.72%  without it. The retailer on Monday announced “Amazon Cash,” a new program that allows customers to add money to their online Amazon accounts by purchasing what is essentially an Amazon gift card — even though there’s no actual physical card. With this new service, Amazon will send you a bar code by text message, or will give an option for you print your bar code on paper. Here’s how it works: You load cash onto your Amazon account’s balance by visiting partner stores, which include Speedway, CVS Pharmacy CVS, -0.23% Sheetz and VG’s Grocery, among others. In exchange for cash, the store attendant can scan your bar code and add the balance. Once a shopper has a bar code, whether on their phone or on a piece of paper, they can use it repeatedly to shop on Amazon. This Amazon’s latest way of giving customers as many ways to buy their merchandise as possible. Amazon previously allowed customers to buy gift cards and use them online, but they had to be refilled with a checking account, credit, debit or prepaid card. “Amazon Cash,” on the other hand, can be refilled again (and again) without those options. How self-driving cars will take over more than just the driving(2:32) Daimler CEO and Head of Mercedes-Benz says this is the future of autonomous cars. Paying with Amazon Cash will likely appeal to people who don’t have a debit or credit card. About 7% of households in the U.S. are “unbanked,” meaning they don’t have any type of banking account at an insured institution, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And an additional 20% of households are “underbanked,” meaning they have a bank account, but look outside the banking system to meet other financial needs, including lines of credit. In the past, those customers turned to prepaid debit cards, which often charge high fees, or were unable to shop online, said Michelle Evans, the head of digital consumer research at market-research firm Euromonitor International. “This is just more of a streamlined process for them,” she said. Another critical difference: Unlike many prepaid card services, Amazon Cash does not charge any fees. Don’t miss: Yielding to critics, American Express boosts its sign-up bonus for the Platinum Card Amazon is also advertising that from now until May 31, customers who add $50 to their Amazon Cash accounts will receive a $10 digital credit. Amazon did not immediately respond to an email asking whether there will be any additional loyalty points or benefits in the future. Other companies including Wal-Mart WMT, +0.25%  and PayPal PYPL, +0.21%  have also recently targeted unbanked and underbanked shoppers, with services including Wal-Mart’s reloadable prepaid “MoneyCards” and PayPal’s “Easy Payments” which let customers pay for products in installments instead of putting those purchases on a credit card. Younger shoppers might also benefit from using the new service, said Michael Landau, the payments lead for the financial technology practice at professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. Millennials have fewer credit cards on average than their older peers, in part because the Credit CARD Act of 2009 made it more difficult for those under 21 to sign up for cards. Many Americans use credit cards to build a credit history and, therefore, help reduce the cost of future loans. For customers who do have credit and debit cards, however, Amazon Cash will likely be too onerous, said Brendan Miller, a principal analyst at the research firm Forrester. Customers who have credit cards that offer rewards including cash-back will likely want to use those instead, he said. (Amazon even has its own credit card that offers 5% cash back on Amazon purchases, a high percentage compared to even the most lucrative cash-back cards.)

Alex Reynolds/NPR hide caption toggle caption Alex Reynolds/NPR Bone broth has become so popular these days that the bones used to make it are getting harder — and more expensive — for broth retailers to source. Alex Reynolds/NPR Dear dogs of America — sorry about bone broth. Since this well-marketed take on an ancient beverage started sweeping hip enclaves like New York, Austin and Los Angeles a few years ago, it's getting harder to find cheap bones. Unlike many food fads, bone broth seems to be here for the long simmer. As more people switch to sipping, there are fewer bones to go around. Bone broth is commonly confused with broth (the quick-cooked mix of meat, bones and aromatics used to make chicken soup) and stock (a similar but more bone-heavy mixture that's often cooked for 4 to 6 hours to extract collagen from the bones), though it's closer to the latter. Many bone broth recipes say to simmer the mixture for anywhere from 14 to 48 hours, depending both on the type of bones and the patience of the cook. Meat broths have been touted for their restorative properties for centuries. In the 1800s, chemist Justus von Liebig began working on a meat-based food to feed Europe's poor — a reduction of meat and bones that he claimed could address "all cases of weakness and digestive disorder." By the 1860s, a London hospital was using 12,000 pots of beef "tea" every year to feed their patients. The Salt Taking Stock Of Bone Broth: Sorry, No Cure-All Here At more than $12 per quart at many stores, bone broth is no longer a food for the poor. Its healthful properties (and familiarity) have made it the elixir du jour. And it's a relatively easy sell in a time when even Wal-Mart carries organic products and foods filled with the antioxidant of the month. Yet until recently, bone broth — even made from grass-fed meats — was relatively inexpensive to produce due to the low price of bones. That's not the case any longer. Tressa Yellig, who started Portland, Ore., broth company Salt, Fire & Time in 2009 (and now runs Broth Bar with her sister Katie Yellig), has noticed a spike in prices over the past few years. The company only sources from local farms that meet specific environmental and humane standards, which leaves a short list of farms to partner with. "Trying to get enough bones is really hard," Yellig says. "You have to remember, [bones] were waste products that were going to dog food. Farmers were ecstatic if they could get anything for them." Today, a butcher in Seattle might be selling beef bones for $4 a pound retail when the Yelligs used to pay a farmer about $30 per case of bones – between 30 and 50 pounds. Just three years ago, it wasn't worth it for Katherine Johnson of Virginia's Dragonfly Farms to get her bones back from the butcher. "They didn't sell," she explained. "They take up a lot of space and we have to pay to have them packaged." Then the calls started coming in. People and restaurants wanted bones. Now she's charging $2 per pound. Jenni Harris of White Oak Pastures in Georgia is a fifth-generation rancher whose family has been raising cattle since 1866. Today, White Oak tries to make use of every part of its animals by selling tallow soaps, leather bags and even candles. They used to grind up unused bones to use on the farm as fertilizer. So even Harris was surprised by the sudden demand for bones one winter a few years ago. "Our knuckle, marrow and soup bones stayed sold out," she said. Eventually she learned that her customers were making broths at home using the beef bones she sold. Since then, growth has been explosive, she says. "We hardly have any bones left over at the end of the week." Despite the sourcing difficulties, the Yelligs have used the high price of beef and chicken bones (still the most popular meats to make broth from) to try to expand their customers' broth horizons. All of Salt, Fire & Time's broths are priced the same, but the margins for chicken and beef keep getting smaller. "No one wants to pay for broth the way they pay for steak," Yellig said. Salt, Fire & Time also sells broths made from lamb, bison, pork, turkey and alpaca bones. But Tressa Yellig says many customers think the only way to make broth is with chicken. They often expect lamb or bison broth to taste gamey. "When we do conferences or events we don't take chicken for just that reason," Yellig said. How will anyone know if they like alpaca broth if they never try it? Tove K.

By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Hey, Alexa, can anything stop Amazon? Shares of the e-commerce king, which is also now a cloud computing giant, connected-home leader, drone company, freight airline, Hollywood studio and even a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer, rose above $900 for the first time Tuesday. It's another all-time high. Amazon stock is on a seven-day winning streak. The shares have gained 7% during that stretch and more than 20% this year. As a result, Amazon is worth more than $430 billion. That's nearly twice the market value of its rival Walmart, which has a market cap of a mere $220 billion. Only Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Microsoft are worth more than Amazon. The Jeff Bezos-led company is now more valuable than Facebook and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. And with that $900 stock price, Amazon is approaching some rarefied air. The only company in the S&P 500 with a stock price in the quadruple digits is Priceline, which is trading at about $1,770 a share. The latest surge in Amazon stock comes after news last week that it is buying Middle Eastern e-commerce Souq.com. Amazon's success is causing significant pain for other retailers, especially mass merchandisers like Macy's, Kohl's, Sears, JCPenney and Target. Several analysts have also lavished praise on Amazon for its Sponsored Products business, which lets sellers place ads on Amazon search listings for specific products and keywords. Some tech and advertising experts are starting to think that Amazon could even challenge Google and Facebook for digital ad supremacy. Investors are also excited about the success of Amazon's Echo home speaker, which features its Alexa voice assistant. Amazon has the lead over Google Home so far. So will Amazon continue to climb? The stock is extremely expensive, trading at more than 125 times its estimated earnings this year and nearly 75 times its forecast profit next year. But amazingly enough, most Wall Street analysts still think it's a buy. According to FactSet, two dozen analysts have a stock price target above the current price. Seven put it above $1,000. Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets raised his price target on Monday to $1,200. And that's still not the highest on Wall Street. Shyam Patil of Susquehanna Financial Group has a price target of $1,250. That's nearly 40% higher than the current price. And that level, Amazon would have a market value of about $600 billion. Not bad for a company that started out selling books and CDs (remember them?) online. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Jackson Hewitt(R) Offers Tips for Last Minute Tax Filers /EINPresswire.com/ — JERSEY CITY, NJ–(Marketwired – Apr 4, 2017) –  With just two weeks until the tax deadline of April 18th, millions of Americans still have not filed their tax return. In fact, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service® expects an unusually large surge of last minute filings this season. To support late filers, Jackson Hewitt announced that locations across the country, including thousands in Walmart stores, will be open later into the evening. This will help hardworking Americans get the tax preparation help they need when and where it’s convenient for them. To further help those late filers, Jackson Hewitt offers these tips: Gather all necessary tax documents – Make sure you have all your tax documents. A few to look for: W-2s, 1099s, expense records, tuition documents, mortgage interest statements, real estate and property tax receipts, charitable contributions and medical expense receipts. Using a copy of last year’s return may also help when gathering this year’s records. Jackson Hewitt provides an online checklist of items needed for filing a tax return. File electronically – E-file your tax return when you file this year. E-filing is faster, more accurate and provides a confirmation of receipt, so taxpayers know their returns have been received before the deadline. Jackson Hewitt offers free e-filing with paid tax preparation. Don’t overlook any deductions and credits – Tax law changes and life changes may drive new tax benefits. If you got married, changed jobs or had a child in 2016, make sure the name with the Social Security Administration matches the name on identification and income information. Ask about extensions – With an extension, you can postpone your return until October 16, 2017. However, an extension does not give additional time to pay any taxes owed. A professional tax preparer can help assess whether there are taxes due and determine whether filing an extension is needed. „As the tax deadline approaches, a tax professional can help you claim your maximum refund and avoid leaving money-saving credits or deductions on the table,” said David Prokupek, Co-CEO of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. „This year the tax deadline is April 18th, but that day will be here soon. The professionals at Jackson Hewitt are available late to help clients file their taxes or file an extension before the due date.” For procrastinators, Jackson Hewitt cautions that there are two penalties taxpayers may face if they miss the tax deadline: failure-to-file and failure-to-pay. Failure to file – The penalty for not filing a return or an extension is 5 percent of unpaid taxes each month, not to exceed 25 percent. Filing for an extension with form 4868 grants a filing extension, but does not defer payment of taxes that are due. Failure to pay – The IRS can also assess a failure-to-pay penalty if at least 90 percent of the expected taxes due are not paid. This penalty is much less costly; starting at 0.5 percent of unpaid taxes each month, not to exceed 25 percent. Jackson Hewitt tax professionals can help taxpayers avoid these penalties. They are also trained to inform clients about IRS payment relief options, such as monthly installments or an offer in compromise based on the client’s income.

Shares of the e-commerce king, which is also now a cloud computing giant, connected-home leader, drone company, freight airline, Hollywood studio and even a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer, rose above $900 for the first time Tuesday. It’s another all-time high. Amazon stock is on a seven-day winning streak. The shares have gained 7% during that stretch and more than 20% this year. As a result, Amazon is worth more than $430 billion. That’s nearly twice the market value of its rival Walmart, which has a market cap of a mere $220 billion. Only Apple, Google owner Alphabet and Microsoft are worth more than Amazon. The Jeff Bezos-led company is now more valuable than Facebook and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. And with that $900 stock price, Amazon is approaching some rarefied air. The only company in the S&P 500 with a stock price in the quadruple digits is Priceline, which is trading at about $1,770 a share. The latest surge in Amazon stock comes after news last week that it is buying Middle Eastern e-commerce Souq.com. Amazon’s success is causing significant pain for other retailers, especially mass merchandisers like Macy’s, Kohl’s, Sears, JCPenney and Target. Several analysts have also lavished praise on Amazon for its Sponsored Products business, which lets sellers place ads on Amazon search listings for specific products and keywords. Some tech and advertising experts are starting to think that Amazon could even challenge Google and Facebook for digital ad supremacy. Investors are also excited about the success of Amazon’s Echo home speaker, which features its Alexa voice assistant. Amazon has the lead over Google Home so far. So will Amazon continue to climb? The stock is extremely expensive, trading at more than 125 times its estimated earnings this year and nearly 75 times its forecast profit next year. But amazingly enough, most Wall Street analysts still think it’s a buy. According to FactSet, two dozen analysts have a stock price target above the current price. Seven put it above $1,000. Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets raised his price target on Monday to $1,200. And that’s still not the highest on Wall Street. Shyam Patil of Susquehanna Financial Group has a price target of $1,250. That’s nearly 40% higher than the current price. And that level, Amazon would have a market value of about $600 billion. Not bad for a company that started out selling books and CDs (remember them?) online. 11 companies pull ads from 'The O'Reilly Factor' in growing movement Tony Romo to take analyst job at CBS Sports Related Posts Wall Street banker gives summer interns ’10 Commadments’ Out of shape: Square tanks on bigger loss House tax chief: I won’t ask for Trump’s tax returns Elizabeth Warren calls out KPMG for Wells Fargo disaster Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

Ocala-based State Attorney Brad King will remain the prosecutor for the Markeith Loyd case. (Red Huber / Orlando Sentinel) Rene StutzmanContact ReporterOrlando Sentinel Privacy Policy Special Prosecutor Brad King has formally filed notice that he intends to seek the death penalty against accused cop killer Markeith Loyd. That paperwork was made public Tuesday. Loyd, 41, is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Orlando police Lt. Debra Clayton, who was shot four times in a Wal-Mart parking lot Jan. 9 as she tried to arrest him. He’s also charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Sade Dixon, Loyd’s pregnant ex-girlfriend, who was shot to death in December. King filed notice of his intent to seek the death penalty in that case, too. King was appointed by Gov. Rick Scott to handle both cases after Orange-Osceola State Attorney Aramis Ayala announced that she would not seek the death penalty against anyone during her term. On Monday, Scott signed another series of executive orders, taking 21 other murder cases away from Ayala and reassigning them to King. Ayala has criticized Scott for making those re-assignments, calling them unprecedented and a violation of her authority. In each death penalty notice filed against Loyd, King gave a list of reasons why, under Florida’s statutes, Loyd should be given a death sentence Each homicide was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, he wrote; they were carried out in a cold and calculating manner and Loyd has a history of violence. rstutzman@orlandosentinel.com or 407-650-6394 Caption Body cam footage reveals altercation ahead of Sanford shooting Sanford police on Friday released body cam footage of officers’ interactions with Allen Cashe and Latina Herring at a Wawa.

(REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson) Staples Inc is in talks with private equity firms about a potential sale, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as the largest U.S. office-supplies seller tests buyer appetite for an industry rattled by online competition and hefty debt burdens. A sale to an investment firm could help Staples escape the glare of the public market, where its shares have more than halved in three years. The move comes less than a year after its proposed merger with rival retailer Office Depot Inc was torpedoed on antitrust grounds. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is confidential. Staples spokesman Mark Cautela declined to comment on Tuesday. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples had a market value of $5.65 billion as of Monday. Staples shares rose as much as 15.5 percent on Tuesday, and were still up 10.1 percent at $9.54 in afternoon trading. Staples, which made its name selling papers and pens, has for years been hurt by the digitization of the workplace and increased competition from online retailers including Amazon.com Inc and big-box stores such as Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In 2015, it tried to address these challenges by merging with rival Office Depot, but the deal was called off a year later due to antitrust concerns. Since then, Staples has announced cost-cutting plans and operational restructuring. Last year, it sold its UK business to restructuring specialist Hilco Capital for a “nominal” amount and a majority stake of its European business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. In the United States, it has focused on selling to small businesses in light of changing consumer habits and has embarked on an office sharing program, opening up some of its stores as communal working space. Staples, which has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada, last month announced plans to sell roughly 60 stores in North America. Staples has made executive changes as well, appointing Shira Goodman as CEO in September. Goodman, who had held a number of positions as Staples, also worked for years as a consultant at consulting firm Bain and Co. Private equity firm Bain Capital LLC helped support the founding of Staples in the 1980s and took it public in 1989. Staples has the largest market share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent and that share has been increasing since 2011, according to Euromonitor. Trouble Sector Private-equity acquisitions of retailers have become increasingly rare, as the investment firms worry about increasing headwinds facing the industry and their portfolio companies struggle with the debt burden left behind from leveraged buyouts. Retail deals comprised the smallest share of mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, backed by buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners, filed for bankruptcy last year. The owners of high-end U.S. department store chain Neiman Marcus, Ares Management LP and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board <CPPIB> have begun to consult restructuring advisers. The level of debt issued by U.S. retailers trading at distressed levels remains elevated, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s said last month. In early March, Standard & Poor’s had taken 20 negative actions against retailers, including downgrades of iconic department stores including Macy’s Inc <M.N>. Moody’s said in an outlook note last year that the office supply sector will continue to struggle, with operating profit expected to be nearly flat in 2017. Still, Staples’ bonds maturing in 2018 are trading at face value, indicating investor confidence in the company. In its most recent quarter, Staples recorded a net loss of $615 million and a sales decline of 3 percent compared with the prior year. It expects to have at least $500 million in free cash flow this year, according to its quarterly earnings. The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier on Tuesday that Staples was exploring a sale.

Melaina Juntti | Apr 04, 2017 Peter Lassen was practically predestined to become a natural products retailer. His parents ran a shop in their native Denmark before immigrating to the U.S. Then in 1971, his mother, a nutrition enthusiast who’d toss eggshells into her seven kids’ breakfast drinks for extra protein and calcium, opened a small vitamin store in Camarillo, California. Lassen would help out at the shop while munching on fig bars and sipping kefir. After majoring in accounting in college, he returned home to run his mom’s newly opened second store. When she felt ready to retire, she sold her son the business for $39. Today, he oversees 12 Lassens Natural Foods & Vitamins locations spanning from Fresno to Los Angeles. NFM chatted with Lassen about his 40 years in the natural products biz. What’s your primary role in the company and what does your day-to-day look like? Peter Lassen: I’m the big-picture guy. I try to keep the company going in the right direction, making sure we keep true to our goals and mission statements. I do quite a bit of traveling, as our stores are so spread out. I really love going out and talking to our employees and seeing what’s happening at every location. Our staff are the ears of what customers are asking for, so I’m always making sure we are well connected and getting in the products they are requesting. I also work on expansion, which we plan to do more of, although there’s nothing concrete in the works at the moment. What’s the most enjoyable or rewarding part of your work? PL: I love to eat! And I love to see people enjoy what they’re eating. Eating is such a wonderful thing we get to do in life, and to be able to offer clean, fresh, wholesome food is so fulfilling. Eating can be a necessity or it can be very romantic, so I’m happy to help people embrace good food. I also take pride in the fact that we can help small, local manufacturers sell their products, as long as they meet our criteria. We are easier to get into than Whole Foods Market or Sprouts Farmers Market, so we like partnering with small producers and giving them a chance to innovate, develop, grow and offer exciting new products to the public. Along with prioritizing local, are you big on organic, too? PL: We are huge supporters of organic. Our produce department is 100 percent organic, and for any packaged item, we’ll choose organic over conventional any day. Storewide, 98 percent of the products we sell are organic certified or non-GMO. There are some things such as spices that are hard to get in either, but we are very committed to the non-GMO cause. Are you feeling the competition tighten with natural and organic foods now so widely available? PL: Well, my belief is only we stand in the way of our own success. I think our ability to be successful depends on our own attitudes and making sure we’re providing a great service to our customers. Yes, sure, now natural and organic foods are sold in more places. But I still believe we have the complete power to succeed by ensuring we’re doing as much as we possibly can to offer the best service. Besides, I’ve been in this business long enough to know that it always ebbs and flows. Conventional grocery stores want to dabble in organic, but they don’t have the capacity to really support it. So those products get convoluted with all their other stuff and they end up taking the organic items back off their shelves. The Walmart and Target shopper is not necessarily the natural foods customer. If people can rely on us and know we are committed to these foods, that goes a long way. Besides providing quality products, how else do you cater to customers? PL: We do plenty of educational events, seminars, cooking classes and so on. Educating our customers is important, but we also put in a lot of time and effort with our staff to make sure they get proper, ongoing training and are always equipped with knowledge. It’s also important that our employees taste and know all about the products we sell. That really makes us different from Walmart or most regular grocery stores. They just throw products on shelves and expect them to sell. We want to make sure that when customers come in with questions, we can provide answers and allow them to taste products. What are the biggest changes you’ve observed in this industry in your 40 years? PL: Well, that’s actually one of the best things about this industry: the way we’ve been able to change, evolve, grow and innovate. Lassens has been selling organic foods for decades, but now to see them in regular supermarkets, that’s great. To have a consumer base that’s much more conscientious about what they eat, that’s a wonderful thing. When we started in the ’70s, what we could sell was very limited. The cookies tasted bad, the whole-wheat pasta was really heavy, the supplements were very limited—pretty much just the basic letter vitamins and a few minerals. But now so much research and innovation has gone into natural foods and supplements that this has been a great train ride to be on. It remains exciting and refreshing and it’s why I’ve enjoyed being in this business for 40 years. I hope that never ends. The moment we stop having stuff change in this industry is when it will die. Any concerns about the current state of the industry or the future of independents? PL: Not really. There’s a lot of potential in the food business. There is room for everybody, and I want everyone to succeed. I guess it’s a little discouraging when I see independents not being run as efficiently or kept as clean as they could be—it’s discouraging because we have so much to offer the public. But overall, there are so many opportunities out there to succeed that I don’t really worry. Sometimes these small manufacturers get gobbled up by big boys like General Mills, but all that does is open doors for someone else, so I say let them go do that. We still live in exciting and fascinating times. Being so invested in and passionate about your work, do you get much free time? PL: All work and no fun is just not good, so yes! I really enjoy hiking and backpacking. I just turned 60 and have had it on my bucket list to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, so my wife, my kids, a buddy and I just did a six-day trek up to the top, which was 19,000 feet. I’ve also climbed 12,000-foot Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Whitney in California. I am also a tennis enthusiast, love skiing in the winter and enjoy a good movie or book. I would go back to the Galapagos in a heartbeat. I found it so amazing to swim with sharks and penguins, go snorkeling and have birds dive into the water right next to you.

Hedge funds are slashing their long bets and throwing their chips in on a renewed decline below $50 a barrel. Motley Fool Staff Apr 4, 2017 at 2:19PM Oil has been recovering for a few months now, but in the past few weeks, hedge funds have been betting on that trend coming to an end. In this clip from Industry Focus: Energy, Motley Fool analysts Taylor Muckerman and Sean O'Reilly explain what's behind these hedge fund decisions, and how much investors should take these trends into account when they consider buying into oil today. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on March 30, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Hedge funds betting on a renewed decline below $50 a barrel. What's up? Muckerman: That's what the Financial Times headlines said a week ago. This was after all the headlines are saying hedge funds have never bet this much on rising oil prices, in the history of oil trading. And now they have a historical decline in their long bets. I think it was 153 million barrels reduction in net long position across WTI -- O'Reilly: Just, for the layman, these are futures contracts. Muckerman: Yeah, so, they're betting on the future price of oil. O'Reilly: Right, and these are contracts to theoretically buy 153 million -- that was the decrease? Or was that the total? Muckerman: That was the combined decrease across WTI and Brent -- O'Reilly: So the net longs are way more than that? Muckerman: Yeah, they are. It was the third straight week of selling after they hit a net long peak of 951 million barrels at the end of February. O'Reilly: That's the number I needed, OK. Muckerman: So that's your relative number. It was a peak of 951 million. And last week, they sold off a combined 153 -- O'Reilly: And it dropped off to 800. Muckerman: Well, that was the third week of declines, but that was the biggest decline in history. Because, I mean, you're starting from the biggest -- O'Reilly: Percentage-wise, you're starting from 16%-17%. So, for the layman, these guys and their ties on the New York Mercantile Exchange, they have all these futures contracts to essentially take delivery of crude oil at a future date, at a set price, for 953 million barrels, which is actually a lot of oil. Muckerman: That's a considerable amount. O'Reilly: Then it decreased to 800. And just so everybody knows, most of these never actually -- nobody ever actually takes delivery of the oil; it's just a financial asset. But theoretically, you could take delivery if you wanted to. But most people don't. Isn't there $1-$2 per barrel that you pay in addition if you actually take delivery? Muckerman: I'm not 100% sure how these future contracts work. I know how they can impact prices, but I've never personally bought a futures contract. O'Reilly: We should pool our money and buy one future. Muckerman: One barrel of oil? Yeah. O'Reilly: "We want to buy a future for three months from now." Muckerman: We'll look into it. We'll advertise it. If listeners want to chip in, we'll start our own hedge fund. O'Reilly: We both live in Arlington. Which of our places could we keep this barrel when we take delivery?  Muckerman: I have a garage. O'Reilly: How would your wife feel about that? Oh, you have a garage! We'll put the barrel of the oil in your garage! Muckerman: It's a communal garage. People might siphon it. O'Reilly: They couldn't refine that. Muckerman: It's like the episode of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia several years back, when they were filling their Land Rover on barrels of gasoline because gasoline prices were rising through the roof. O'Reilly: Oh, man. You know Dylan from the Tech show loves Always Sunny, right? Muckerman: I hope more than just Dylan loves it. O'Reilly: No, so do I, and I'm so glad you brought that up. Anyway. It seems to me like they're not necessarily betting on oil being below $50. They're just being a little less bullish. Muckerman: Being a little less bullish, but also, because they still have such high long bets if oil starts to fall a little bit more and they get a little nervous and they sell, that could just be added pressure to the downside for oil prices. O'Reilly: You could get a cascade. Muckerman: A cascade, yeah, that's a good word. O'Reilly: Well, you know, I'm a bit of a poet. Do you care about any of this? For our listeners who are, obviously, long-term Foolish investors? Muckerman: It's just funny to see how whimsical these hedge funds really are, to go from record longs one day to, the very next week, record selling. O'Reilly: I think it's algorithms. Muckerman: It very well could be. O'Reilly: There was one hedge fund that was an algorithmic trading firm; the name escapes me. Muckerman: There's more than one. O'Reilly: Bottom line, 90% of the trades on the New York Stock Exchange, it's just algorithms going nuts. Muckerman: I would imagine it's very high, I don't want to call out a number, but it's very high. It's higher than 50%. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Picture taken March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Staples Inc is in talks with private equity firms about a potential sale, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as the largest U.S. office-supplies seller tests buyer appetite for an industry rattled by online competition and hefty debt burdens. A sale to an investment firm could help Staples escape the glare of the public market, where its shares have more than halved in three years. The move comes less than a year after its proposed merger with rival retailer Office Depot Inc was torpedoed on antitrust grounds. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is confidential. Staples spokesman Mark Cautela declined to comment on Tuesday. Framingham, Massachusetts-based Staples had a market value of $5.65 billion as of Monday. Staples shares rose as much as 15.5 percent on Tuesday, and were still up 10.1 percent at $9.54 in afternoon trading. Staples, which made its name selling papers and pens, has for years been hurt by the digitization of the workplace and increased competition from online retailers including Amazon.com Inc and big-box stores such as Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In 2015, it tried to address these challenges by merging with rival Office Depot, but the deal was called off a year later due to antitrust concerns. Since then, Staples has announced cost-cutting plans and operational restructuring. Last year, it sold its UK business to restructuring specialist Hilco Capital for a "nominal" amount and a majority stake of its European business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. In the United States, it has focused on selling to small businesses in light of changing consumer habits and has embarked on an office sharing program, opening up some of its stores as communal working space. Staples, which has 1,255 stores in the United States and 304 in Canada, last month announced plans to sell roughly 60 stores in North America. Staples has made executive changes as well, appointing Shira Goodman as CEO in September. Goodman, who had held a number of positions as Staples, also worked for years as a consultant at consulting firm Bain and Co. Private equity firm Bain Capital LLC helped support the founding of Staples in the 1980s and took it public in 1989. Staples has the largest market share of office supply stores in the United States at 48 percent and that share has been increasing since 2011, according to Euromonitor. TROUBLED SECTOR Private-equity acquisitions of retailers have become increasingly rare, as the investment firms worry about increasing headwinds facing the industry and their portfolio companies struggle with the debt burden left behind from leveraged buyouts. Retail deals comprised the smallest share of mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, backed by buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners, filed for bankruptcy last year. The owners of high-end U.S. department store chain Neiman Marcus, Ares Management LP and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board have begun to consult restructuring advisers. The level of debt issued by U.S. retailers trading at distressed levels remains elevated, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said last month. In early March, Standard & Poor’s had taken 20 negative actions against retailers, including downgrades of iconic department stores including Macy's Inc. Moody's said in an outlook note last year that the office supply sector will continue to struggle, with operating profit expected to be nearly flat in 2017. Still, Staples' bonds maturing in 2018 are trading at face value, indicating investor confidence in the company. In its most recent quarter, Staples recorded a net loss of $615 million and a sales decline of 3 percent compared with the prior year. It expects to have at least $500 million in free cash flow this year, according to its quarterly earnings. The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier on Tuesday that Staples was exploring a sale.

Kevin Brady, who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, says he’s listening “very closely” to the import industry’s concerns about the proposed border adjustment tax and foresees “significant modifications” to the plan, such as a transition period. Brady did not elaborate but said Tuesday that the tax-writing panel is looking at how to structure and phase in a border adjustment plan, so it’s “pro-growth” for importers as well. “We think imports and exports are equally important to our economy, so I foresee significant modifications in that border equal tax going forward in a really positive way,” Brady told a roundtable of reporters at the U.S. Capitol. The proposal would lift the tax on exports and impose a 20 percent tax on imported goods and domestic sales. Some independent analyses estimate it would raise more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over a decade. A coalition of retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target Corp. have lobbied against the border-adjusted tax, arguing the change would lead to higher consumer prices. Companies that mostly export goods have been more supportive. The White House has not indicated where it stands. A Democratic aide said Brady’s comments signal the proposal is in trouble, and that the only way tax reform will succeed is if it’s a bipartisan process. Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, tout the idea as necessary to help American-made products compete better in overseas markets. Since companies have moved headquarters overseas to avoid having their profits be taxed, the GOP lawmakers argue the proposal would eliminate the reasons that corporations move plants, headquarters and jobs off shore. “One-hundred-and-sixty of our competitors do this. We are one of the few that don’t,” Brady said. “What we propose is that all products be taxed equally in the U.S. at a low, 20 percent rate. So it doesn’t matter where that product is made. It doesn’t matter who makes it. That is a major change from the way we tax today. It’s critical for us to be competitive to do that.” Asked about the opposition from retailers and others, Brady said it was to be expected. “In tax reform, you expect groups – special interests – to protect what is a $1 trillion tax break for foreign products over made-in-America products,” he said. The House Republicans’ tax plan assumes that a stronger dollar will offset hikes to consumer and business costs caused by the border adjustment tax. Retailers and auto dealers say the change would cause prices to increase for consumer products including vehicles sold in the United States because various parts within a vehicle are manufactured or assembled elsewhere and brought into the country. mburke@detroitnews.com 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2ozdJ5p TOP VIDEOS GM cars hoisted up to the Comerica Park fountain 0:50 Sen.

High Flows Over Shoshone Falls Record Flooding Drive Means Drive Colley’s Commentary Weather Jerome Police Warn of Dangerous Scam Targeting Area Residents By Andrew Weeks April 4, 2017 11:51 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter JEROME, Idaho (KLIX) – The Jerome Police Department is warning citizens of a potentially dangerous scam that recently targeted at least one resident. According to the police department, a woman on Tuesday received a phone call in which the caller said she had won a new car. The male caller said all she had to do was to meet him in the Walmart parking lot and present him with a check for $3,400 to cover the necessary taxes and fees. The woman had planned to meet the caller before being stopped by a family member. This incident is undoubtedly a scam intended to steal money from the victim. What is very concerning in this case is the would-be thief asked to meet the victim in person, which is very unusual. It is quite possible the orchestrator of the crime was setting the victim up for a more serious crime such as robbery. We encourage people to be very wary of such scams. If an offer seems too good to be true, it is probably a scam. If you have any information about this or other suspicious calls, contact the Jerome Police Department at 324-4328 or, if out of the area, your local law enforcement.

Cohen April 4, 2017, 1:28 pm Tweet Email Print Share William Llop is optimistic about his chances in his third run for Congress Writers David R. Cohen David R. Cohen is the Associate Editor of the Atlanta Jewish Times. He is originally from Marietta, GA and studied … [More] Journalism at the University of Tennessee. [Less] Follow or contact: Facebook Twitter Email RSS Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics Ga Politics News William Llop Running on a platform of lower taxes and fair wages, Republican William Llop brings 30 years of experience as a certified public accountant to the 18-candidate race for the 6th Congressional District. The Sandy Springs native ran for Congress from the 11th District in 2012 and 2016 but decided to run in the 6th — he lives just across the district line — when Tom Price vacated the seat to become U.S. health and human services secretary in February. “I know what the problems are in America as it relates to taxes and regulations, and I know how to fix it,” Llop said. He is in favor of reducing government spending and taxes by raising the minimum wage. He said large companies such as McDonald’s, Sears and Walmart take advantage of government welfare programs that give subsidies to employees who make minimum wage. When Llop graduated high school in 1979, the minimum wage was $2.90. Adjusted for inflation, that number today would be $9.70 per hour, he said. If elected, he would work to raise the minimum wage to that number. “Really what big business is doing is getting their labor subsidized off of corporate welfare,” he said. “The employers are the ones taking advantage of minimum wage.” He said $22 an hour is the living wage in America, “but $9.70 is a step in the right direction. We can reduce the size of government by getting people off of the system. People don’t want a government handout; they want respect.” Llop also favors tax breaks for the middle class and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 39 percent to 25 percent to spur growth in the economy and produce more jobs. Immigration reform is another priority for Llop. His father came to the United States from Italy in 1936 and served in the U.S. military during World War II. He supports granting legal status to longtime illegal immigrants. “These people are part of our culture now,” he said. “We need to give them legal status. They came here illegally, but they’ve been here now for 10 and 20 years. We’ve educated their children and given them jobs. We’ve made an investment in these immigrants, and we need to start getting our return in the form of them paying taxes like the rest of us.” Llop, who favors restrictions on abortion, would work to repeal the Affordable Care Act and said he would have voted for the health care legislation House Republicans failed to pass last month. The fourth of 11 siblings, Llop grew up in Atlanta and attended Riverwood High School in Sandy Springs. He now lives in Sandy Springs with his wife and 12-year-old twins in a neighborhood split between the 6th and 11th districts. “When I walk my dog in the morning, three quarters of the walk is in the 6th District,” he said. “But our home is actually in the 11th.” A member of Holy Spirit Catholic Church, Llop said that Israel should be a place open to all religions and that the United States needs to continue to support Israel. In response to the apparent increase in anti-Semitic activity in the United States, Llop said the key to fighting all forms of discrimination against minorities is better education. “Our country is based on freedom of expression, and we need to keep those freedoms in place,” he said. “It’s like we’re going backward when we need to go forward. We need to rejoice in individual faiths.” In the 2016 Republican primary in the 11th District, won by incumbent Barry Loudermilk, Llop received only 9.8 percent, but he said he is optimistic about his chances to be one of the top two vote-getters in the April 18 special election and reach the June 20 runoff. “Having this many candidates favors a person like me,” he said. “I think I have a strong presence in Atlanta, and I already have a decent following. That will help me get over the hump. I only need two out of 10 votes.”   Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  Ga Politics,  News,  William Llop,  Republican,  Sandy Springs,  6th District Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Current top stories For Now, OVS Stays Off Egalitarian Path By Sarah Moosazadeh   Priest Exposes Parallels in Jewish, Yazidi Genocides By Benjamin Kweskin   Grawert Brings Front-Line Experience to Election By David R.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Nation/World Analysis: Bill O’Reilly’s problems just got real Tue., April 4, 2017, 9:55 a.m. In this combination photo, former Fox News contributor Wendy Walsh, left, appears at a news conference in the Woodland Hills section of Los Angeles on Monday, April 3, 2017, and Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly appears on the set of his show, “The O’Reilly Factor” on Oct. 1, 2015 in New York. (File / Associated Press) By Callum Borchers Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Fox News stood by Bill O’Reilly when he settled a high-profile sexual harassment lawsuit in 2004 and when a 2015 Mother Jones article chronicled the host’s misleading claims about having covered a “war zone” during the Falklands War. More important, advertisers stood by O’Reilly. In fact, the King of Cable News enjoyed a ratings boost at the height of the Falklands scrutiny, which only made his nightly show a more appealing forum on which to air commercials. The New York Times, citing data from Kantar Media, reported on Tuesday that O’Reilly’s program hauled in $446 million in ad revenue from 2014 to 2016. The Times also reported this: —- Mercedes-Benz and Hyundai said they were withdrawing their ads from Mr. O’Reilly’s prime-time show, “The O’Reilly Factor,” after the New York Times published an investigation this weekend that found five women who made allegations of sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior against him. Those five women received settlements totaling about $13 million, the Times reported. —- O’Reilly’s problems just got real. Losing advertisers, let’s remember, contributed to Glenn Beck’s downfall at Fox News in 2011. Walmart, Geico, CVS and Procter and Gamble were among the major companies that pulled ads off Beck’s show, which had quickly become one of the most popular in cable news after its 2009 debut. Despite his large following, Beck’s polarizing commentary frightened off mainstream brands. Most memorably, Beck declared on the air that President Barack Obama was “a racist” who “has a deep-seated hatred for white people.” Sponsors didn’t desert Beck all at once, but eventually hundreds of companies refused to buy airtime during his show. O’Reilly is a long, long way from becoming a business liability on par with Beck. But when advertisers start walking, TV executives start paying attention. The bottom-line reality is that lost revenue registers in a way that liberal outrage over something like, say, a “James Brown wig” does not. Even questions about journalistic integrity can be shrugged off or spun to O’Reilly’s advantage. The Falklands episode two years ago centered on previous claims O’Reilly had made about his career as a reporter, such as this one in his 2001 book: “I’ve reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands.” In fact, O’Reilly – like almost all journalists who covered the Falklands War in 1982 – never set foot on the Falkland Islands. After Mother Jones published its report, O’Reilly said he never meant to suggest he was on the islands and was referring to his on-the-ground coverage of postwar protests on the Argentine mainland, in Buenos Aires. He said that distinguishing between combat on the islands and faraway demonstrations in which soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters amounted to “splitting hairs.” Slate’s Justin Peters explained at the time why reporting by Mother Jones and subsequent coverage by the likes of Media Matters would not dent O’Reilly: —- Being accused of fabulism by liberal news outlets like Mother Jones and Media Matters doesn’t harm O’Reilly’s credibility because O’Reilly’s credibility is dependent on exploiting a sense of victimization among his audience. Much of the Fox News demographic is composed of people who feel that they’re under attack by unscrupulous liberals. So when it appears that a host comes under attack by unscrupulous liberals, that serves to reinforce their existing worldview. The first thought isn’t Bill O’Reilly is a liar. It’s The world is out to get Bill O’Reilly. —- O’Reilly’s viewers might be similarly galvanized now. But the success of his show depends on advertisers’ willingness to pay for access to those viewers, and two just said they are no longer willing.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News New iGR study analyzes where and how U.S. mobile consumers purchase their mobile phones /EINPresswire.com/ — AUSTIN, TX–(Marketwired – April 04, 2017) – U.S. mobile consumers have a wide range of options when deciding where to purchase a mobile phone or smartphone. They can purchase it directly from their mobile service provider or the phone manufacturer, but many other options are also available, including electronics stores, such as Best Buy or Radio Shack, discount stores, such as Target, Walmart or even Costco, and online-only retailers, such as Amazon, eBay, or Newegg. And within each of these types of retailers, consumers usually have the choice to either purchase online or go to a physical store. In addition to the many options in purchase location, consumers also have a choice in how they purchase their mobile phone: buy the phone at full price and pay for it up front, or purchase with an installment plan that allows for frequent upgrades. However, buying a subsidized phone with a two-year contract is no longer an option at the major U.S. mobile operators. iGR, a market research consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile industry, has released a new market study that analyzes which of these options U.S. mobile consumers have chosen for their latest mobile device and which they plan to use for their next mobile phone purchase. iGR’s latest market study also analyzes mobile consumers’ awareness of, use of, and interest in mobile phone installment and upgrade plans, which are now provided by all of the major U.S. mobile operators. In addition, the study discusses Apple’s installment plans and how mobile consumers perceive the program, especially when compared to the installment and upgrade plans provided by their mobile service providers. „Mobile device installment plans provided by mobile operators have risen in popularity, and in this study we discuss how many consumers have used the plans and how many are interested in purchasing their next mobile phone with this method,” said Iain Gillott, president and founder of iGR. „We have also analyzed how purchasing through an Apple installment plan might compare.” iGR’s new market study, U.S. Mobile Device Distribution Channels: The Move to Installment Plans discusses where and how U.S. mobile consumers purchase their mobile phones. The study also looks at the rising popularity of device installment plans from both mobile operators and device manufacturers (specifically, Apple) and consumers’ awareness of and interest in the plans. When appropriate, results are compared to those from iGR’s market study of January 2016. The data in the study is based on two web-based surveys of more than 1,000 U.S. mobile consumers that iGR fielded in November 2015 and March 2017. The following key questions are addressed in the new research study: How often do U.S. mobile consumers visit their mobile service providers’ retail stores and why? From what type of retailer did U.S. mobile consumers purchase their latest mobile phone? Did U.S. mobile consumers purchase their latest phone online or in a physical store? Where do U.S. mobile consumers plan to purchase their next mobile phone and why? What type of purchase method did U.S. mobile consumers use when they purchased their last phone – a subsidized phone plan with a contract, an installment plan, or some other method? What type of purchase method do U.S. mobile consumers plan to use when they purchase their next phone and why? What are U.S. mobile consumers’ awareness of and interest in their mobile service providers’ installment plans? How has this awareness and interest changed over the last two years? What percentage of U.S. mobile consumers have purchased their devices with mobile service provider installment plans? How does this number compare to one or two years ago? What are U.S. mobile consumers’ awareness of and interest in Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program? What percentage of U.S. mobile consumers have purchased their devices with Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program? Would more U.S. mobile consumers prefer to purchase their next iPhone with Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program or with their provider’s installment plan? How do the location and method of U.S. mobile consumers’ mobile device purchases vary according to their mobile service provider? How do the location and method of U.S. mobile consumers’ mobile device purchases vary according to demographic variables? The information in this market study will be valuable for: Mobile network operators Mobile service retailers and distributors Mobile device OEMs Financial analysts and investors.

For Google, the largest internet advertising provider, this has been a serious problem. Now, they're trying to address it in order to put advertisers at ease. Over the years, Google trained computer systems to keep copyrighted content and pornography off its YouTube service. But after seeing ads from Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart appear next to racist, anti-Semitic or terrorist videos, its engineers realized their computer models had a blind spot: They did not understand context. Now teaching computers to understand what humans can readily grasp may be the key to calming fears among big-spending advertisers that their ads have been appearing alongside videos from extremist groups and other offensive messages. Google engineers, product managers and policy wonks are trying to train computers to grasp the nuances of what makes certain videos objectionable. Advertisers may tolerate use of a racial epithet in a hip-hop video, for example, but may be horrified to see it used in a video from a racist skinhead group. That ads bought by well-known companies can occasionally appear next to offensive videos has long been considered a nuisance to YouTube’s business. But the issue has gained urgency in recent weeks, as The Times of London and other outlets have written about brands that inadvertently fund extremists through automated advertising — a byproduct of a system in which YouTube shares a portion of ad sales with the creators of the content those ads appear against. It's a justified concern for those brands. Unfortunately, it raises concerns in a different direction. The "engineers, product managers, and policy wonks" described are people, and that introduces a potential problem. What are these people's biases and will they use that to influence the training the advertising bots will get? Google Pledges $11.5 Million to Make Sure Black Lives Matter For example, a large portion of the criticism of President Obama was labeled as racist. How will that come into play? Will these computers be able to tell the difference between a video of a commentator who takes issue with affirmative action and a video of a Klan member railing against interracial marriage? https://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2017/04/03/google-is-teaching-their-ad-bots-to-recognize-objectionable-content/ load more facebook Share Google Is Teaching Their Ad Bots to Recognize 'Objectionable' Content twitter Tweet email Email Related: technology Related Products The Western Story Lecture #6: The Genres of Western Learning: Novels, Plays, Poems, Essays and Treatises amazon.com History In The News Lecture #2: The 21st American Century or What Amazon or Facebook Says About America amazon.com Klavan and Whittle: Manly Men and Womanly Women amazon.com Editor's Choice Looking for Must-See Films? comments Here's a True Ranking of the Beatles' Albums from Worst to First comments Dear 30-Year-Old Man-Child Who Got His Girlfriend Pregnant comments Who knew your inbox could be this informative?

(AMZN) Stock Has Reached Absurd Levels: Fade the Rally Position for a pullback in Amazon with this AMZN stock play By Tim Biggam, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Apr 4, 2017, 10:03 am EDT Get AMZN alerts: Submit     Popular Posts: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Has Reached Absurd Levels: Fade the Rally Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Has Reached Absurd Levels: Fade the Rally Recent Posts: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Stock Has Reached Absurd Levels: Fade the Rally Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Has Lost Its Shine Tesla Inc (TSLA) Finding Big-Time Resistance at $266 View All Posts Don’t get me wrong. I think Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a great company. It is the Vampire Squid of the internet commerce space, devouring everything in it way. I just don’t like the stock price at these levels. Given the near-parabolic ascent of the recent rally, I expect AMZN stock to pull back from these extremes. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr It is important to remember that the last earnings report showed a pretty big miss on revenues, with $43.74 billion in sales versus expectations of $44.68 billion. Guidance was also lowered to a range of $33.25 billion to $35.75 billion compared to a previous guidance of $35.95 billion. While sales have grown 27% over the past year, the stock price has risen nearly 50% in that same time frame. This means the price-to-sales ratio has nearly doubled over the past year, driving the price-to-sales ratio to 3.2. This is the highest level since 2005 and well above the five-year average of 2.2. Amazon is now the fourth-largest company in the U.S with a market cap of $425 billion. As a comparison, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) sports a market cap of $220 billion, meaning AMZN stock is being valued at almost twice the level of WMT. Yet Walmart had $482 billion in revenue in 2016 versus only $136 billion for Amazon. So AMZN stock is twice the price with only 28% of the sales … tough for such a huge company to grow into such an extreme multiple. Law of large numbers is definitely beginning to apply to Amazon. I realize that investors in AMZN ignore fundamentals, even as crazy as they have gotten. After all, Daniel Salmon of BMO Capital Markets recently raised his target price for Amazon to $1,200 — more than a third higher than current levels. A look at the technicals paints a similar overextended picture, though. AMZN stock is now the most overbought on a nine-day RSI basis that it has been over the past year with a reading well over 80. Previous times when Amazon approached the 80 level proved to be important short term tops in the stock price of Amazon. Click to Enlarge Amazon has also been up six days in a row, rising nearly 60 points off the March 27 low of $833.50. While normally fairly correlated to the Nasdaq 100, AMZN has diverged sharply over the past week, outpacing the broader market by 5%. I look for this spread to converge somewhat and for AMZN stock to be a relative underperformer. So with AMZN stock extended on practically every metric, a short-term bearish trade makes probabilistic sense. With implied volatility (IV) at the 44 percentile, selling an out-of-the-money call spread is the optimal way to position bearishly. AMZN Stock Trade Idea Buy AMZN Apr $920 calls and sell AMZN Apr $915 calls for a $1.20 net credit. Maximum gain on the trade is $120 per spread with maximum risk of $380 per spread. Return on risk is 31.6%. As of this writing, Tim Biggam did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Callum Borchers By Callum Borchers April 4 at 5:50 PM Follow @callumborchers Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. (Frank Micelotta/Invision/AP) Fox News stood by Bill O'Reilly when he settled a high-profile sexual harassment lawsuit in 2004 and when a 2015 Mother Jones article chronicled the host's misleading claims about having covered a “war zone” during the Falklands War. More important, advertisers stood by O'Reilly. Now, however, 10 big-name sponsors have pulled their spots from “The O'Reilly Factor” after a New York Times investigation which found that a total of five women have collectively received $13 million in settlements after accusing the host of sexual harassment or inappropriate conduct. The companies are Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, BMW of North America, Untuckit, Constant Contact, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, GSK pharmaceuticals, Allstate, Sanofi and T. Rowe Price. O'Reilly's problems just got real. "We value our partners and are working with them to address their current concerns about 'The O'Reilly Factor,' " Paul Rittenberg, Fox News's executive vice president of advertising sales, said in a statement. "At this time, the ad buys of those clients have been re-expressed into other [Fox News] programs." Losing advertisers, let's remember, contributed to Glenn Beck's downfall at Fox News in 2011. Walmart, Geico, CVS and Procter and Gamble were among the major companies that pulled ads off Beck's show, which had quickly become one of the most popular in cable news after its 2009 debut. Despite his large following, Beck's polarizing commentary frightened off mainstream brands. Most memorably, Beck declared on the air that President Barack Obama was “a racist” who “has a deep-seated hatred for white people.” Sponsors didn't desert Beck all at once, but eventually hundreds of companies refused to buy airtime during his show. O'Reilly is a long, long way from becoming a business liability on par with Beck. But when advertisers start walking, TV executives start paying attention. The bottom-line reality is that lost revenue registers in a way that liberal outrage over something like, say, a “James Brown wig” does not. [Maxine Waters swings back at Bill O’Reilly: ‘I’m a strong black woman and I cannot be intimidated’] Even questions about journalistic integrity can be shrugged off or spun to O'Reilly's advantage. The Falklands episode two years ago centered on previous claims O'Reilly had made about his career as a reporter, such as this one in his 2001 book: “I've reported on the ground in active war zones from El Salvador to the Falklands.” In fact, O'Reilly — like almost all journalists who covered the Falklands War in 1982 — never set foot on the Falkland Islands. After Mother Jones published its report, O'Reilly said he never meant to suggest he was on the islands and was referring to his on-the-ground coverage of postwar protests on the Argentine mainland, in Buenos Aires. He said that distinguishing between combat on the islands and faraway demonstrations in which soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters amounted to “splitting hairs.” Slate's Justin Peters explained at the time why reporting by Mother Jones and subsequent coverage by the likes of Media Matters would not dent O'Reilly: Being accused of fabulism by liberal news outlets like Mother Jones and Media Matters doesn’t harm O’Reilly’s credibility because O’Reilly’s credibility is dependent on exploiting a sense of victimization among his audience. Much of the Fox News demographic is composed of people who feel that they’re under attack by unscrupulous liberals. So when it appears that a host comes under attack by unscrupulous liberals, that serves to reinforce their existing worldview. The first thought isn’t Bill O’Reilly is a liar. It’s The world is out to get Bill O’Reilly. O'Reilly's viewers might be similarly galvanized now. The King of Cable News enjoyed a ratings boost at the height of the Falklands scrutiny, which only made his nightly show a more appealing forum on which to air commercials. The Times, citing data from Kantar Media, reported on Tuesday's frong page that O'Reilly's program hauled in $446 million in ad revenue from 2014 to 2016. The continued success of “The Factor” depends on advertisers' willingness to keep paying for access to O'Reilly's viewers, and 10 just said they are no longer willing.

Who's behind these, and what happens if you click? Watch for the word 'Congratulations' It typically happens when you are on Facebook on your phone, and suddenly something pops up telling you "Congratulations, today is your lucky day!"  Uh no, it's not. It may claim you have just won a chance at a Best Buy or Walmart gift card, an iPhone 7, or something similar. It may even have a countdown clock, saying you have just two minutes to click, or you will lose the deal. Darci Pearl got hit by one last year. "They said  you won a thousand dollars," the skeptical woman said. But she didn't know what she should do next. What happens if you click Sometimes a click takes you to posts from people claiming  they got their freebie. Other times it takes you to a survey page. But resist the urge to click. MacWorld.com says these are all either marketing tricks or outright scams, and you may be giving the scammers access to your Facebook page. The most benign versions are "like harvesting" schemes, where they get you to give out personal info by liking a page, then taking a survey, where they can then target you with more junk. The most dangerous are phishing scams, where clicking through can give the scammers access your Facebook friends list, and they could soon receive bogus messages purporting to be from you. If that happens to you, you'll say "doesn't that stink?" What to do, and not do If you get a popup claiming you have won something: 1. Close it out. 3. Don't "like" it, don't open it, and don't share. 3. If these are hitting your phone more and more, Apple suggests starting by clearing your phone's history, where these pages sometimes reside, then pop back up. 4. Check Apple support forums. Apple has more detailed advice on how to block these popup ads in its support pages. 5.  Add a Satari popup blocker, according to a report in MacWorld. 6. A report in Malware Tips offers even more good advice. 7. If it is happening on a laptop or desktop PC, download Malwarebytes, which will remove any malware causing it. Remember: Facebook is not giving away money, and no, you didn't win a free iPhone 7 at random.  Sorry, it is not your lucky day. So resist the urge to click, so you don't waste your money. _____________________ “Don't Waste Your Money” is a registered trademark of Scripps Media, Inc. (“Scripps”).

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next NORTH RANDALL, Ohio - Big stores, like Sears and JCPenney, are closing left and right. On Friday, GameStop announced it would close 150 of its stores. Earlier this month, Sears executives said the department store may not last through the year. Looking around now, you wouldn't be able to tell that the abandoned building and parking lot in North Randall used to be Randall Park Mall. And that back in the late 70s, it was the largest shopping center in the world. Sadly what's left is a vacant building and debris from construction. Retail experts say this will not be the last we'll see in what they're calling a Retail Renaissance. “Retailers have to recognize that nothing is perfect and nothing is permanent," said Richard Klein, Sales Expert & Professor at Cleveland State University. He said it’s what is fast becoming one of the biggest waves of retail closures in decades. PHOTOS: Snow overtakes abandoned Rolling Acres Mall “Baby boomers, the X generation, the centennials are all looking for bargains and they're looking for an informal atmosphere," Klein said. Part of the shift is the obvious reason — online sales. But he says other reasons are a bit more practical. “Discount department stores, cannot dispel them, the Walmarts, the Targets, play a big part. Kohls has played a tremendous part," he said.  Randall Park Mall closed after sales went out and crime came in. The same thing happened with Rolling Acres Mall in Akron. And the impact was felt far beyond empty parking lots. RELATED: What happens next with Rolling Acres Mall in Akron? "The second somebody leaves a community and goes to another community, their dollars go with them," Klein said. That's a scenario, Richmond Town Square Mall is trying to prevent. Sears in that Richmond Heights complex is closing now, and JCPenney will be soon. Business owners in the area are getting nervous. “We thought for sure this would be a great spot, 3 1/2 years later Macy's is gone, Sears is leaving, JCPenney's is leaving," said Elisabeth Sapell, Store Owner at the sweet shop All City Candy sitting right across the street from the Richmond Town Square Mall. She said the whole reason she moved in was because of hopeful mall traffic, now she's already seeing a decline. “We will definitely stagnate at some point with all the traffic being gone," she said. But Lisa Russell, who oversees the mall's operations and marketing, says neighbors have nothing to worry about. "That's one thing, you know, I really want to put to rest is that Richmond Town Square is not closing." PHOTOS: Parmatown Mall demolished That's not the case for what's happening nationally once these big stores like JCPenney and Sears duck out. “If one store, two stores, three stores, start to close and nothing replaces them, the retail sector, like any smart business community, looks around and says, 'what's going on here?'" said Klein. And the impact left on the community is great. Klein advises that mall owners get ahead of the trend, figuring out what other businesses or services can occupy the space before a big store like Macy's or Sears announces it will leave, so taxpayer dollars stay within that community.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next MACEDONIA, Ohio - Macedonia Police are currently investigating a simple purse snatching case. However, they said federal privacy laws are hindering their investigation. According to Macedonia Police, a clause in the federal law prevents them from moving forward with identifying the thief. A clause they say seems to defy common sense. The incident happened almost two weeks ago on a late Sunday night. "About 11:30, we had a 77-year-old woman shopping at Walmart 24 hours. It's not uncommon,” said Detective Richard Lea. The woman left the purse with her husband. After about 15 minutes, a group of three women passed by. One of them then stole the purse. Macedonia Police said they were able to obtain the government assistance card number she used. However, the state cannot give out her identity because of the federal privacy laws, tied specifically to the government-issued EBT cards. "We are frustrated. We've tried legal process as a way of getting information we needed and that was denied,” said Detective Lea. Police said if the thief had used a debit or credit card, this would not have been an issue. However, for EBT cards, the law states, "if the member is fleeing to avoid prosecution or custody for a crime, or an attempt to commit a crime, that would be classified as a felony." Macedonia Police said the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services told them that while the woman on this surveillance video did commit a crime, she did not attempt to flee, since police were not at the scene of the crime at the time. Therefore, she is still protected from the privacy law. "State told us basically even if we were investigating a homicide, they cannot release the information to us,” said Detective Lea. Cleveland state law professor, Jonathan Witnmer-Rich called it an unusual circumstance. "In most circumstances, they can get information they want even private information,” said Witnmer-Rich. Meanwhile, Macedonia police say they are working with the prosecutor and have issued a subpoena and have also reached out to lawmakers to see if there is anything they can do to modify the current federal law in place for future investigations. The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services issued a statement on the issue to News 5:  "As a policy, ODJFS does not comment on pending legal matters. However, generally speaking, both state and federal law prevents the release of information relative to food assistance recipients unless it’s directly related to the administration or enforcement of the food assistance program.” Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc.

With new logos, Perimeter cities join the branding boom Many of metro Atlanta’s corporate giants, from Coca-Cola to UPS, attract customers with instantly recognizable brand logos. In turn, cities marketing themselves as hometowns for such businesses are trying to stand out with their own brands, with new city logos popping up everywhere from Perimeter Center to Peachtree City. Dunwoody and Sandy Springs are among the local cities that have recently created new city logos at considerable cost in time and money that they figure will pay off with economic development. The new Sandy Springs city logo. “A city is a business,” said Sharon Kraun, communications director at the city of Sandy Springs, which recently spent more than $175,000 on a package of six logos and related illustrations for its government and its City Springs downtown redevelopment. “We are a business. We are attracting other businesses to come.” The city of Atlanta is the old-school holdout, its post-Civil War emblem of a phoenix reborn from ashes remaining essentially unchanged from its adoption in 1887. That logo appears everywhere, including on the city’s economic development handbook that tries to sweet-talk businesses into moving to Atlanta and staying. But the city also built a distinct economic development authority, Invest Atlanta, that has a modern logo of a stylized “A” in the blue-and-green color scheme that is popular in recent city logos. The Atlanta phoenix logo. Atlanta also had a “New Coke” moment of a branding change gone wrong, according to former Mayor Sam Massell, who now heads the Buckhead Coalition. During his administration in the early 1970s, he said, the city introduced a redesigned phoenix intended to look modern and cosmopolitan, as Hartsfield-Jackson airport began running its first non-stop international flights. The logo didn’t fly, he said. “We weren’t really international,” Massell said. “We were talking bigger than we deserved.” Getting a city’s brand spot-on is “just a hard, hard job,” Kraun said. Indeed, the new Dunwoody and Sandy Springs brands are in part replacements for previous logos that didn’t work so well. The new Dunwoody city logo. In Dunwoody in 2010, the city and the Convention and Visitors Bureau paid a branding company $105,000 for a logo that was immediately derided as a confusing copycat. It featured a star that looked like an asterisk and became known as the “Walmart logo” for its similarity to the discount retailer’s symbol. As much as the City Council wanted to change the logo, it was even more eager to avoid spending more money on another one. This year, three Dunwoody residents who head marketing and branding firms — Jay Kapp of Kapp Koncepts, Mike Martin of Jackson Spalding, and Heyward Wescott of Custom Signs Today — did pro bono work to produce a new logo. Their final design is the city’s name in blue with a curving green brushstroke beneath it. “We went with a very safe design,” Wescott said, while Kapp added, “We didn’t want to see the city go through another round of a logo that people didn’t like.” A big difference city logos have from corporate counterparts is that they must try to represent an entire diverse community and their costs must be justified politically to city residents. Dunwoody was able to say its new logo was free, but the design team said their volunteer effort had a market value of around $30,000. The City Springs district logo. Sandy Springs took some heat for spending nearly $100,000 on its new city logo, the primary version of which is three blue-and-green brushstrokes. That was on top of $77,000 spent on branding its new “City Springs” downtown area anchored by a $220-million public-private development — a name that private developers are already imitating. Kraun said it’s true that various websites will design a custom logo for $500. But, she said, cities get what they pay for, including market research, vetting of designs and creation of alternatives and spin-off logos to use in other formats. Sandy Springs got six separate designs and a branding guide to using them. “If it was just to draw that one icon, yes, a hundred thousand dollars would be a lot,” Kraun said. “The cost for us was not just that icon. … It’s not just something you put on a T-shirt.” Sandy Springs presented its branding companies with complex challenges. Its previous city logo, depicting a river and trees in shaded colors, was popular, but it was a nightmare to use in different sizes, colors and applications. The replacement had to be not only more flexible, but also had to match well with the new City Springs brand — an abstract, fountain-like image — that, in turn, has a more specialized goal of drawing residents and customers to downtown. The $100,000 included several designs integrating the new city logo with other images for such special uses as the parks department and the city’s new performing arts center, which is set to open next year. One of the new illustrations is specifically for economic development marketing materials. It shows the city logo wrapped around the Concourse Center’s King and Queen skyscrapers, the icons of the city’s Perimeter Center big-business hub. That is not an official logo, but an image that may be used in marketing materials as well as serving as an inspiration for other versions later. An illustration created for Sandy Springs economic development marketing, showing the city’s new logo combined with the King and Queen skyscrapers. The cost included “how we were able to take something so iconic and wrap it with the brand,” Kraun said. “From an economic development perspective, we’re tying all the pieces together.” Businesses ultimately base their location decisions on measurable factors such as demographics, community amenities and tax incentives. Does a city logo really matter? Are cities creating them mostly because everyone else is? Kraun likened the value of a city brand to a basic rule in the public relations business: “‘No comment’ is a comment. No logo is also a logo. … It’s a calling card.” Kapp said the logo serves as a foundation for a city to build its brand value upon. “A logo is what you make of it, how you use it,” he said. “Of course you don’t want a logo with [the cartoon typeface] Comic Sans. But what’s in a brand? The reason Coca-Cola is as well-known as it is, is not because of a logo.” About John Ruch Mail | More Posts (1037) 4 Responses to With new logos, Perimeter cities join the branding boom Pete Reply April 3, 2017 at 8:17 am Students at SCADncouod have done all of this and saved the city $100,000. Concern Sandy Springs Citizen Reply April 3, 2017 at 3:01 pm Ok. They spent $175k for design and consultation for guidelines on how to use it. Now, how much is it going to cost to replace the old logo on the street signs, the park signs, city uniforms, city vehicles, etcs??? TO MUCH MONEY!!! An investigation should be held to see who influenced this decision. A logo is a logo. So, why replace one if you already have one that works…The new Sandy Springs logo is a MAJOR step back from the previous design. The new logo tells the direction of the city. Sandy Springs officials care less about “depicting rivers and trees..” and more about making things cookie-cutter. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Sandy Springs needs a CITY SEAL like the one the City of Atlanta has had for over a Century! It has served them well enough to land major business so the idea that Sandy Springs needed new branding within 10yrs of being a City is asinine. Paul Reply April 4, 2017 at 7:29 am For the reasons you stated and many, many others the entire city council and the mayor need to be voted out of office in November. Hopefully, there will be good alternative candidates. Ralph Reply April 4, 2017 at 4:51 pm City leaders have lost sight of how to lead our city. They throw dollars around as if it is limitless and always available. They continually approve developments to increase the tax base with no regard to infrastructure. The City of Sandy Springs needs a moratorium on developments for 5 years. But, our leaders won’t do that because of their developer friends that have hijacked the system and the constant pressure of being sued. Maybe our leaders should spend some of our taxes to defend a moratorium. Better spent on that than logos. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Protect Plus Creates Municipal Water Division To Meet Lead Crisis Head On HICKORY, N.C., April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Protect Plus, a nationwide supplier of water and air filtration products, today announced the creation of a new Municipal Water Division to better service the needs of water municipalities facing the growing lead crisis. In the wake of the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis, increased attention has focused on aging infrastructures in cities across the country. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates as many as 2,000 towns are facing similar problems. As a result, water district leaders are scrambling for a short-term fix while they make plans and adjust budgets to update millions of miles of old pipes. The DuPont Traditional Pitcher is certified to reduce lead, cadmium, mercury, more than 50 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), aesthetic chlorine, taste & odor, Particulate Class III. Each cartridge has a 40 Gallon filter life. „We’ve been getting a lot of calls for our lead-reducing water filters,” says John Genter, Vice President of Protect Plus’s new Municipal Water Division. „Traditionally, we’ve sold our lead-reducing water pitchers and faucet mount filters through retail stores, such as Walmart. Recently though, we’ve been shipping our products to municipalities that provide lead filtration at the tap while they fix the bigger issues. It just made sense to create a division to better serve the municipal buyers. They’ve got a lot on their plate and we want to make it as easy as possible for them.” Protect Plus is already working with water districts across the United States, including Cincinnati, Detroit, Milwaukee, Washington, and Providence, R.I. to provide a variety of lead-reduction products certified to NSF Standard 53, including easy-to-use pitchers and easy-to-install faucet mount filters. It is one of very few companies to achieve such respected certifications in these product categories. Protect Plus water filtration products are certified by the Water Quality Association (WQA) and/or NSF, depending on the category. There are two types of lead found in drinking water: soluble and particulate. In simple terms, soluble lead gets into drinking water from the soil, in ground water, or due to industrial pollution. Particulate lead gets into drinking water by flaking off lead pipes or paint. As the U.S. infrastructure ages, old lead pipes are leaching particulate lead. Even if water leaves a filtration plant with no lead, the pipes between the municipality and the homes can foul the water. Surprisingly, it is much harder to filter out particulate lead than soluble lead. Protect Plus is one of only a few companies to do so, in products such as: DuPont® Traditional Water Filter Pitcher DuPont® Faucet-Mount System DuPont® Quick-Twist 2-Stage Under Sink System DuPont® Quick-Twist 3-Stage Under Sink System, which also removes bacteria, viruses and cysts DuPont® Reverse Osmosis Under Sink System Protect Plus, headquartered in Hickory, North Carolina, manufactures and distributes air and water filtration products all over the United States. In addition to the above products, the company offers other DuPont® products under license as well as other in-house and licensed brands, such as Arm & Hammer®.

Corner Bench Memos Bench Magazine Subscribe Login Donate The Morning Jolt By Jim Geraghty To Quote the Joker, ‘It’s Simple… We Kill the BAT’ Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Jim Geraghty April 4, 2017 10:48 AM To Quote the Joker, ‘It’s Simple… We Kill the BAT.’ Remember that talk that compared to repeal-and-replace, tax reform was going to be easy? Yeah, not if you include the “border-adjustment tax.” Under the proposal, U.S. companies that import goods from foreign suppliers would no longer be allowed to deduct those purchases, so a new tax would be effectively implemented on all imported goods, including crude oil. A group of businesses opposed to the tax, Americans for Affordable Products, gathers comments from just about every big-name conservative economic thinker criticizing the BAT proposal: Americans For Prosperity’s Tim Phillips: We are against this approach because in the end, it is making life more expensive for all Americans, especially low and fixed-income families. Instead of picking winners and losers, Congress should pursue a simple, pro-growth approach that lowers rates, eliminates loopholes, simplifies the tax code, and above all, protects consumers from new tax increases. (“AFP Issues Letter Opposing Border Adjustability Tax,” Americans For Prosperity, 1/27/17) Koch Industries’ Mark Holden: “[The Border Adjustment Tax is] just a tax that’s going to be passed on to people who shouldn’t be taxed,” said Mark Holden, who is now co-chairman of the Koch Seminar Network. He indicated the issue could be a key one for evaluating how strongly to support lawmakers in future elections. “It will be one of the things we look at,” Holden said. “Sure, there aren’t elections for a few years, but we’re hopeful that we can get with leadership and get them to think of better ways to do this, and not pass on a huge new burden to consumers.” (Jim Geraghty, “Koch Network Ready For A Fight On The Border Adjustment Tax,” National Review, 1/28/17. I hear that piece was really good. CATO’s Daniel Mitchell: I don’t like [the Border Adjustment Tax] because I worry it sets the stage for a value-added tax. I don’t like it because it is designed to undermine tax competition. I don’t like it because it has a protectionist stench and presumably violates America’s trade commitments. I don’t like it because that part of the plan only exists because politicians aren’t willing to engage in more spending restraint. And I don’t like it because politicians should not try to reinvent the wheel when we already know the right way to do tax reform … My advice is that Republicans abandon the border-adjustable provision and focus on lowering tax rates, reducing double taxation, and cutting back on loopholes. Such ideas are economically sounder and politically safer. (Daniel J. Mitchell, “Don’t Ruin A Chance For Tax Reform With ‘Border Adjustments,’”Foundation For Economic Education, 2/22/17) CNBC’s Larry Kudlow: At this moment I am completely unconvinced about a Border Adjustability Tax. I don’t want a planned economy where we’re going to tax imports, which is going to blow the middle class, you know, Walmart shoppers and so forth, and subsidize exports. I want a market economy. We’ve lived this way for so many years. I don’t want to emulate Europe. I don’t want to emulate Asia, for example. I do agree with my friend Andy Busch that basically if we have the kind of business tax reform for large and small companies as Steve Moore and I wrote in the Journal today, that’s going to fix a lot of these issues. We will become the most hospitable investment environment in the world for our own companies and for international companies. So, that’s the way to fix it. (CNBC, 1/27/17) Club For Growth President David McIntosh: On the other side is the Club for Growth, a free markets advocacy group, which said the losers under a border tax will be average Americans. Former Rep. David McIntosh, the club’s president, said the House GOP was wrong to chase after the goal of revenue-neutral tax policy. “Instead of trading one tax for another, the GOP needs to focus on cutting rates, and cutting spending and the size of government to match,” he said. (Stephen Dinan, “GOP’s Border Adjustment Tax Divides Conservatives, Pits House Against Trump,” The Washington Times, 1/24/17) Forbes Media’s Steve Forbes: In fact, an outbreak of Beltway-itis seems to be the only reasonable explanation for the Border Adjustment Tax fanatically being pushed by establishment Republicans in the House of Representatives. Make no mistake, the BAT will inflict American working families – the very people critical for Donald Trump’s election – a whole lot of hurt … The BAT is absolutely unnecessary to attract businesses and capital to our shores. Cutting the profits tax to 15 percent and minimally taxing – or not taxing at all – overseas earnings would lead to a flood of money pouring into the U.S. Countless foreign companies would be eager to set up shop here … But on the BAT, Republicans have to cure themselves of this ailment if they want to rev up the economy – and avoid having to pursue other opportunities after next year’s elections. (Steve Forbes, “Will Washington Republicans Succumb To Beltway-Itis?,” FOX News, 2/22/17) Former Reagan Economic Advisor Arthur Laffer: I think the border tax adjustment is a major mistake to put into legislation. It’s a huge bureaucratic mess to be honest with you. If it’s done ideally, Maria, which would be a tax on imports matched by a subsidy on exports of the equal size, it would have the same effect as devaluing the currency which would lead to domestic inflation. But if you look at it, there will be all sorts of nuances, all sorts of political grab bags going in the process and I just think they should just do tax rate reductions, get rid of this pay-for notion and don’t touch a border tax adjustment. It just makes no sense. (FOX Business, 2/9/16) Any big-name conservative economic thinkers left? The Overlooked Menace of ‘Gangster Islam’ The one-year anniversary of a fairly significant terror attack came and went without much acknowledgement here in the United States. On March 22 of last year, three suicide bombers allegedly loyal to ISIS struck in in Belgium: two at Brussels Airport in Zaventem, and one at Maalbeek metro station in central Brussels. It was the deadliest terrorist attack in Belgium’s history, killing 32 and injuring more than 300 people. The perpetrators were part of a cell that had perpetrated the November 2015 Paris attacks. In British GQ, Robert Chalmers offers some fantastic investigative journalism about the intertwined and criminal jihadist undergrounds in that neighborhood of Molenbeek. (This article isn’t online in an easily readable form, but you can see scans of the pages at the above link.) The sections I found most eye-opening were how the jihadist movement is flourishing not among the particularly religious but among the angry young men who are looking for a justification for their preexisting violent and aggressive impulses. Belgium has produced more jihadist fighters, per capita, than any other Western European nation and is estimated to have dispatched around 520 recruits to the Islamic State cause in Syria. Historically, Belgian jihadists have been more interested in [ISIS] than in religion. (Les Beguines, the café owned by the Abdeslam brothers, was closed on account of drug dealing.) [Former Brussels Mayor Philippe} Moureaux told me, “we never had any evidence that the trouble eminates from the mosques.” Geraldine, mother of Anis, said that her son never attended mosques but was radicalized by people “on the street.” Her opinion was echoed by almost everybody I met in Molenbeek. “The people that do this,” one source told me, “are more familiar with a bar stool than a prayer mat.” It is ten years since the journalist Hind Fraihi wrote her outstanding book Undercover in Little Morocco. Fraihi was one of the first to describe what she terms Molenbeek’s ‘synergy between crime and jihad” and has come to be called “Gangster Islam,” practiced by small, secretive gangs who drew inspiration from marginal figures, such has Khalid Zerkani. Zerkani, a major organizer of radicalization in Brussels, was imprisoned for 12 years in July 2015. The case for the defense wasn’t helped by the fact that Zerkani’s laptop contained tracts with titles including: “Thirty-Eight Ways to Engage in Jihad” and “Sixteen Must-Have Items If You’re Heading for Syria.” At Zerkani’s trial, witnesses testified that he had taught small street gangs that “stealing from infidels is permitted by Allah.” Anecdotal accounts concerning such groups aren’t hard to obtain, although, as ever in Molenbeek, people are understandably reluctant to speak on the record. One source told me that he knew of bounties of as little as 300 Euro being paid for the enlistment of naïve recruits like Olivier’s son Sean. The networks responsible, he said, are dominated by a Tunisian mafia. (Zerkani has close links with activists in that country.) The funds, my source insisted, originate from what he would only describe as “a very wealthy gulf state.” Such organized gangs, Philippe Moureaux acknowledges, do exist. Could he have done more to prosecute them? “When I was mayor,” he says, “we recognized the beginnings of fundamentalism. What we didn’t have were these organized networks.” Last month, a confidential Belgian government report declared that out of “more than 1,600 organizations and NGOs registered in the neighborhood, 102 were suspected of having links with crime, and another 51 were linked to terrorism.” I Can Remember When Chemical-Weapons Attacks Were a Big Deal Speaking of Syria, yet another report of a serious chemical-weapons attack: Dozens of people, including at least ten children, have been killed and more than 200 injured in a suspected chemical attack in northern Syria, multiple activist groups claim. Airstrikes hit the city of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday, giving off a “poisonous gas,” according to Anas al-Diab, an activist with the Aleppo Media Center. The casualties reportedly came as a result of asphyxiation caused by exposure to an unknown gas or chemical agent. Longtime readers of this newsletter know that I find the world’s nonchalance about the use of chemical weapons to be one of the darkest and most disturbing developments of the age. It is not exaggerating to say that within our lifetime, the position of the U.S. government was that any use of chemical weapons against our forces would be met with a nuclear response: After the Persian Gulf war, General Avihu Ben-Nun, commander of the Israeli Air Force, concluded that “the fact that [Saddam Hussein] didn’t launch chemical weapons against us was only because he feared our retaliatory response.” The threat of Israeli retaliation was not the only deterrent to Saddam’s use of chemical-armed rockets. On 14 August 1991, Defense Secretary Cheney stated that “[i]t should be clear to Saddam Hussein that we have a wide range of military capabilities that will let us respond with overwhelming force and extract a very high price should he be foolish enough to use chemical weapons on United States forces.” The American government reportedly used third-party channels to privately warn Iraq that “in the event of a first use of a weapon of mass destruction by Iraq, the United States reserved the right to use any form of retaliation (presumably up to and including nuclear weapons).” If you hit us non-conventionally, we’ll hit you non-conventionally, and our non-conventional weapons will leave your neighborhood a pile of radioactive rubble. This was the philosophy of deterrence; this was, before the phrase became a bitter punch line, a “red line.” The Syrian Civil War just entered its sixth year. Roughly 465,000 people are dead; the war has generated 5 million refugees.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Protect Plus Creates Municipal Water Division To Meet Lead Crisis Head On HICKORY, N.C., April 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Protect Plus, a nationwide supplier of water and air filtration products, today announced the creation of a new Municipal Water Division to better service the needs of water municipalities facing the growing lead crisis. In the wake of the Flint, Michigan drinking water crisis, increased attention has focused on aging infrastructures in cities across the country. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates as many as 2,000 towns are facing similar problems. As a result, water district leaders are scrambling for a short-term fix while they make plans and adjust budgets to update millions of miles of old pipes. "We've been getting a lot of calls for our lead-reducing water filters," says John Genter, Vice President of Protect Plus's new Municipal Water Division. "Traditionally, we've sold our lead-reducing water pitchers and faucet mount filters through retail stores, such as Walmart. Recently though, we've been shipping our products to municipalities that provide lead filtration at the tap while they fix the bigger issues. It just made sense to create a division to better serve the municipal buyers. They've got a lot on their plate and we want to make it as easy as possible for them." Protect Plus is already working with water districts across the United States, including Cincinnati, Detroit, Milwaukee, Washington, and Providence, R.I. to provide a variety of lead-reduction products certified to NSF Standard 53, including easy-to-use pitchers and easy-to-install faucet mount filters. It is one of very few companies to achieve such respected certifications in these product categories. Protect Plus water filtration products are certified by the Water Quality Association (WQA) and/or NSF, depending on the category. There are two types of lead found in drinking water: soluble and particulate. In simple terms, soluble lead gets into drinking water from the soil, in ground water, or due to industrial pollution. Particulate lead gets into drinking water by flaking off lead pipes or paint. As the U.S. infrastructure ages, old lead pipes are leaching particulate lead. Even if water leaves a filtration plant with no lead, the pipes between the municipality and the homes can foul the water. Surprisingly, it is much harder to filter out particulate lead than soluble lead. Protect Plus is one of only a few companies to do so, in products such as: DuPont® Traditional Water Filter Pitcher DuPont® Faucet-Mount System DuPont® Quick-Twist 2-Stage Under Sink System DuPont® Quick-Twist 3-Stage Under Sink System, which also removes bacteria, viruses and cysts DuPont® Reverse Osmosis Under Sink System Protect Plus, headquartered in Hickory, North Carolina, manufactures and distributes air and water filtration products all over the United States. In addition to the above products, the company offers other DuPont® products under license as well as other in-house and licensed brands, such as Arm & Hammer®. For more information about the company, go to www.protectplus.com. DuPont® is a trademark or registered trademark of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and is used under license by Protect Plus, LLC.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Jackson Hewitt(R) Offers Tips for Last Minute Tax Filers JERSEY CITY, NJ–(Marketwired – Apr 4, 2017) –  With just two weeks until the tax deadline of April 18th, millions of Americans still have not filed their tax return. In fact, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service® expects an unusually large surge of last minute filings this season. To support late filers, Jackson Hewitt announced that locations across the country, including thousands in Walmart stores, will be open later into the evening. This will help hardworking Americans get the tax preparation help they need when and where it’s convenient for them. To further help those late filers, Jackson Hewitt offers these tips: Gather all necessary tax documents – Make sure you have all your tax documents. A few to look for: W-2s, 1099s, expense records, tuition documents, mortgage interest statements, real estate and property tax receipts, charitable contributions and medical expense receipts. Using a copy of last year’s return may also help when gathering this year’s records. Jackson Hewitt provides an online checklist of items needed for filing a tax return. File electronically – E-file your tax return when you file this year. E-filing is faster, more accurate and provides a confirmation of receipt, so taxpayers know their returns have been received before the deadline. Jackson Hewitt offers free e-filing with paid tax preparation. Don’t overlook any deductions and credits – Tax law changes and life changes may drive new tax benefits. If you got married, changed jobs or had a child in 2016, make sure the name with the Social Security Administration matches the name on identification and income information. Ask about extensions – With an extension, you can postpone your return until October 16, 2017. However, an extension does not give additional time to pay any taxes owed. A professional tax preparer can help assess whether there are taxes due and determine whether filing an extension is needed. „As the tax deadline approaches, a tax professional can help you claim your maximum refund and avoid leaving money-saving credits or deductions on the table,” said David Prokupek, Co-CEO of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. „This year the tax deadline is April 18th, but that day will be here soon. The professionals at Jackson Hewitt are available late to help clients file their taxes or file an extension before the due date.” For procrastinators, Jackson Hewitt cautions that there are two penalties taxpayers may face if they miss the tax deadline: failure-to-file and failure-to-pay. Failure to file – The penalty for not filing a return or an extension is 5 percent of unpaid taxes each month, not to exceed 25 percent. Filing for an extension with form 4868 grants a filing extension, but does not defer payment of taxes that are due. Failure to pay – The IRS can also assess a failure-to-pay penalty if at least 90 percent of the expected taxes due are not paid. This penalty is much less costly; starting at 0.5 percent of unpaid taxes each month, not to exceed 25 percent. Jackson Hewitt tax professionals can help taxpayers avoid these penalties. They are also trained to inform clients about IRS payment relief options, such as monthly installments or an offer in compromise based on the client’s income.

Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won’t Escape This Storm Anytime Soon Recent Posts: 7 Tech Stocks That Will Crush the Market for Years GoPro Inc (GPRO) Stock Management’s Cure Is Worse Than the Disease Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Stock Won’t Escape This Storm Anytime Soon View All Posts Since the early days of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), there has been plenty of controversy. Often it has been about content, such as with copyright infringements. Yet GOOGL stock has usually found ways to deal with the issues. Source: Shutterstock But recently, Alphabet has found itself in another scrape, and this one may prove fairly damaging. It all started in early February, when the Times of London reported that YouTube ads from major brands were associated with videos that involved hate speech, terrorism and violence. What Kind of Trouble Is Alphabet In? The backlash was quick — and GOOGL stock has already taken a hit. Over 250 brands have suspended their ad campaigns on YouTube, including some of the world’s largest like Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX). While Alphabet has responded with tough talk about taking swift actions, the fact is that the problems continue. On Mar. 24, The Wall Street Journal reported that YouTube was still running ads with major brands that had offensive content. Yet all this is not a one-off. It seems quite likely that GOOGL has been running these kinds of ads for some time. What’s more, the company has recently been involved in other mishaps, such as: GOOGL made certain LGBTQ content “restricted,” which has caused an uproar in the community. The company terminated one of its most popular YouTube shows, called PewDiePie, because of alleged anti-Semitic jokes. Google pulled an advertising agreement with a YouTube channel called “Real Women, Real Stories,” which had interviews with women who talked about sexual harassment and abuse. Now it’s certainly understandable that advertisers should be very concerned. They understand that their brands are quite delicate and can easily be tarnished. Also, by paying for the ads, the companies are essentially subsidizing this content! So what does all this mean for GOOGL stock? Well, some analysts have been crunching the numbers. For example, analysts at Nomura Instinet estimate that YouTube will suffer about $750 million in lost revenues. It’s true that this is a relatively small amount when compared to Alphabet’s annual revenues of $90 billion. Yet the analysis may ultimately be too narrow. Let’s face it, brands may get concerned about other ad programs from GOOGL. Besides, rivals like Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) will certainly act quickly to capitalize on the situation. In fact, even traditional cable networks, such as the Hallmark Channel, can tout their brand-safe content as more attractive alternatives. Keep in mind that the “upfront” season has already started, which is when advertisers make decisions for their budgets.

In fact, Jackson Hewitt Tax Service® expects an unusually large surge of last minute filings this season. To support late filers, Jackson Hewitt announced that locations across the country, including thousands in Walmart stores, will be open later into the evening. This will help hardworking Americans get the tax preparation help they need when and where it's convenient for them. To further help those late filers, Jackson Hewitt offers these tips: Gather all necessary tax documents - Make sure you have all your tax documents. A few to look for: W-2s, 1099s, expense records, tuition documents, mortgage interest statements, real estate and property tax receipts, charitable contributions and medical expense receipts. Using a copy of last year's return may also help when gathering this year's records. Jackson Hewitt provides an online checklist of items needed for filing a tax return. File electronically - E-file your tax return when you file this year. E-filing is faster, more accurate and provides a confirmation of receipt, so taxpayers know their returns have been received before the deadline. Jackson Hewitt offers free e-filing with paid tax preparation. Don't overlook any deductions and credits - Tax law changes and life changes may drive new tax benefits. If you got married, changed jobs or had a child in 2016, make sure the name with the Social Security Administration matches the name on identification and income information. Ask about extensions - With an extension, you can postpone your return until October 16, 2017. However, an extension does not give additional time to pay any taxes owed. A professional tax preparer can help assess whether there are taxes due and determine whether filing an extension is needed. "As the tax deadline approaches, a tax professional can help you claim your maximum refund and avoid leaving money-saving credits or deductions on the table," said David Prokupek, Co-CEO of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. "This year the tax deadline is April 18th, but that day will be here soon. The professionals at Jackson Hewitt are available late to help clients file their taxes or file an extension before the due date." For procrastinators, Jackson Hewitt cautions that there are two penalties taxpayers may face if they miss the tax deadline: failure-to-file and failure-to-pay. Failure to file - The penalty for not filing a return or an extension is 5 percent of unpaid taxes each month, not to exceed 25 percent. Filing for an extension with form 4868 grants a filing extension, but does not defer payment of taxes that are due. Failure to pay - The IRS can also assess a failure-to-pay penalty if at least 90 percent of the expected taxes due are not paid. This penalty is much less costly; starting at 0.5 percent of unpaid taxes each month, not to exceed 25 percent. Jackson Hewitt tax professionals can help taxpayers avoid these penalties. They are also trained to inform clients about IRS payment relief options, such as monthly installments or an offer in compromise based on the client's income.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News Loss of a pet is a very difficult time for most people A beautiful Testimonial all the way from Texas USA. We recently dealt with the lovely Donna from Texas USA.  She was over from USA on holidays to enjoy the sites of Australia.  We caught up with us at the Queen Victoria Market and having never seen Photo Engraving previously was quite taken by it. She explained her daughter had a beloved dog called Rusty who was getting a little old, so she decided to purchase a keepsake gift for her.  We received news today that Rusty had passed on the 30th March at the age of over 15 years.  The family had Rusty for all his life and was particularly close to her daughter as she had grown up with Rusty.  I even saw photos at the local Walmart with them shopping with Rusty in the trolley.  Rusty was clearly very much loved and adored by everyone.  The keepsake Donna purchased was originally was going to be given as a Christmas gift.  I suggested to give it to her on her return, as it was such a beautiful piece and it would be something special from Australia.  On our advice she did that and her daughter described our gift as the best present she had ever received.  It even was better than her beloved diamonds!  What a huge compliment.  Fortunately she gave the gift to her daughter on her return in February. Now  she is suffering badly with the loss of a pet, she holds our piece even closer to her heart.  It is providing her with great comfort and will be a forever keepsake that will be treasured forever. Memories are Forever and that is what Memory Keepsakes is all  about.

And not only do they spend more time at Amazon’s site, but they spend more time browsing other retail sites as well. The data were reported by market research firm GfK, based on a tracking study the firm conducted between August and December of last year on 300 Amazon Prime members and 419 non-members, all of whom owned a smartphone. Amazon Prime members spent an average of 12.8 hours on online shopping-related activity, some 80% more than the 7.2 hours spent by non-Prime members. Prime members’ most-used site was Amazon (78%), but more than 60% said they also visit and shop at other retailers, such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and online-only merchants. Why do Prime members shop more? For one thing, they have higher incomes than non-Prime members. Nearly 30% of Prime members reported household income of more than $100,000, nearly double the 16% of non-Prime members with a similar income level. About 40% of Prime members reported household income between $50,000 and $99,999, compared with 33% of non-Prime members. GfK Senior Research Director Christina Pate told eMarketer: [Prime members] are a big portion of the online shopping population. There’s a lot of time spent shopping outside of Amazon. You can’t cut them out. Even though they are spending a lot of time on Amazon, there are a lot of opportunities to reach them. Amazon does not report the number of Prime subscribers, but one estimate puts that number at around 50 million in the United States. That leaves more than 60 million U.S. households that remain to be signed up — a solid growth opportunity for Amazon, and good news even for its competitors.

Teens Apparently Love Collecting ‘Big Mouth Billy Bass’ and Other Animatronics Those grating toys from Spencer's Gifts might be worth more than you think thanks to teens. Around 2003, my brother and I went to the discount section of Spencer's Gifts and found an animatronic Henry VIII doll for about $5. It sang a version of Herman's Hermits "I'm Henry VIII, I Am" at the push of a button on its plaque. My brother and I found it weird, bought it, and drove our father crazy with it. We would often drive around town, windows open, with a megaphone to the singing animatronic. We also ripped its latex skin off, revealing its creepy animatronic exoskeleton. I recently discovered that the animatronic Henry VIII doll and other animatronic animals you see at Walmart, like Big Mouth Billy Bass, are now desired collectables thanks to an emerging subculture of young people who are obsessed with them. 15-year-old collector CJ Webber told me over Facebook chat Henry VIII was a very rare Gemmy animatronic that is now worth around $70. Some items, according to collectors, can be worth as much as $1,800. That's a lot more than the German porcelain figurines my mom left me when she passed away, and that were expected to become valuable over time. Webber collects early 2000s items from Gemmy Industries, a Texas company that creates toy animatronics. Webber specifically loves Grave Ravers, a series of Halloween characters that ran from 2005 to 2015. They stand on a base with two lights that flash or glow while the character dances to a song. 21-year old Chandler Anderson lives in Tennessee and has over 300 Gemmy products he collected over 12 years. He bought most of his items at Goodwill, which he frequents four times a week. He loves the Big Mouth Billy Bass collection, one of the most sought-after Gemmy items. Here is a photograph of his singing fish wall. Image: Chandler Anderson Big Mouth Billy Bass began selling in 1999 and became popular in the early 2000s. It's a mounted game fish that sings, turns its head, wiggles its tail, and sings "Don't Worry, Be Happy" by Bobby McFerrin and "Take Me To The River" by Al Green. The singing Zombie Fish of this collection sings "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor. "There's just something about [animatronic singing fish] that really stand out to me" Anderson said. "They are what got Gemmy where they are today as the leading novelty and animation company out there. Every single one of them is different. No two fish are alike." Bailey Kitchings, one of the collectors who runs the Gemmy Master Animatronics YouTube channel, said there are hundreds of people who collect these animatronics. They collect primarily Gemmys but not exclusively. Most are young, teenagers or in their early twenties. Some have the Gemmy Industries logo as their Facebook profile, and some of their favorite animatronics as their cover photo. Westley Geairn, who is in junior high, told me he has spent thousands of dollars on animatronics. He has two rooms in his house devoted solely to Gemmy animatronics. One is full of life-sized animatronics. The other has smaller pieces, including a wall of 22 singing fish. Over video chat, Geairn showed me his boxes full of gears, wires, button, and eye and skin pieces to repair his singing fish. He fixes the gears when they break. He even customized certain fish. He told me that the Gemmy "Pop Culture" series is popular among collectors. These were singing animatronics of popular entertainers like Louis Armstrong, James Brown, and Dean Martin created between 2001 and 2004, and sold by Spencer Gifts. Included in this collection is a Shrek doll that sings Ricky Martin's "Livin' La Vida Loca." Jordan Heyd, a 20-year-old from North Dakota, has been accumulating Gemmy items since he was three, when he was given a dancing gorilla that sang "The Macarena." "In 2014, I think I started getting out of Gemmy animatronics a bit mainly because I had a lot of dancing Santas in my room and it's a problem because I didn't wanted to bring friends over. I didn't want them to see [all the Santas] because I didn't know what they'd think," he said. In 2015, he met Kitchings online. "He inspired me to start collecting again. his collection was small at the time but as soon as we met our collections were growing so fast and he taught me how to fix them too." Once he met Kitchings and the other collectors on the internet, he felt a sense of relief that there was a community for collectors. He said he always felt like it was "a thing" and he had a feeling that there were kids around his age that had the same hobby, but they didn't live nearby. Heyd said he and the others who run the YouTube channel aim to show people how much cooler Gemmy's older stuff was. "It just blows my mind, the amazing and random ideas [Gemmy] came up with back then," he said. "And now it's like their ideas are really random but without the creativity, and it's like they either try too hard, or they aren't trying at all and they just don't care."

 Teens think Google is really cool ... according to a study by Google Rob Price Apr. 4, 2017, 7:29 AM 1,185 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO and ultimate cool dude Sundar Pichai.Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Teens think Google and YouTube are some of the coolest brands around ... according to a study commissioned by Google. The Californian technology giant is being ridiculed online over the self-promotional report (entitled "It's Lit") that says it intends to "provide a glimpse into the world of teens in the US through the lens of what they find cool." Many of Google's own products sit very highly on the cool scale, according to the survey of more than 1,100 teens aged between 13 and 17. The most-cool brand was YouTube, Google's video streaming site. Then came Netflix, followed by Google itself in third place. After that was Xbox, Oreos, GoPro, PlayStation, Doritos, and Nike, with one more Google brand — Chrome, a web browser — rounding out the top 10. Meanwhile, Facebook is less cool than Walmart, Nestle, or Ebay, while Apple is on a par with Nike but behind Chrome or Doritos. Snapchat is supposedly less cool than Gatorade. And wildly popular messaging app WhatsApp is allegedly one of the least cool brands out there. Only The Wall Street Journal and Vice are less cool. "Google is really cool because it is an innovator," an extremely positive anonymous 17-year-old girl is quoted as saying. "A trend setter. Google is not only a powerful search engine, but great at everything it does, from email to documents. Google products are easy to use and work well. As a company, Google also stands for education and creativity, shown by the science fairs and doodles contests they host." The full cool matrix among "Gen Z" — the buzzword Google uses for the current generation of teens — is below. (Click to enlarge.) Google Another suspect stat in the report is the claim that around 42% of US teens use Google+, Google's moribund social network. Google automatically gives people who up for Google accounts an account on Google+, but it's considered a ghost town compared to the likes of Twitter or Facebook. An analysis in January 2015 estimated that just 4-6 million people actively engaged, posted, and interacted on the social network, despite its 2.2 billion registered profiles. The report has been mocked by many online. Some have suggested that it is a veiled attempt by Google to appear hip and down with the kids.

Something becomes 'cool' when it brings joy or happiness or is unique enough to stand out from everything," Google says. And that definition, Google suggests, might just conveniently include Google.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Donald Trump's surprising election and his promise to overhaul the tax code set off celebrations across corporate America -- but some industries had barely applauded before they began gearing up for a fight. Trump's win gave Republicans control of the U.S. government for the first time in a decade and quickly drew attention to a tax plan that House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled last summer with little fanfare. Ryan's radical tax-code rewrite would replace the corporate income tax with a 20 percent tax on businesses' domestic sales and imports; their exports would be exempt. Cue the alarm bells for import-heavy companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Nike Inc. Retailers, apparel-makers, shoemakers, automakers and others unleashed one of their most robust lobbying and public-relations pushes in recent memory against the so-called "border-adjusted" tax. Buttressed by more than 10,000 phone calls to congressional offices, by a parody-style TV ad that aired during "Saturday Night Live" and by a succession of Republicans who've expressed concern about the plan, the opponents' efforts appear to be winning. So far. But the action has now shifted to the White House, which will be "driving the train" on tax legislation, Press Secretary Sean Spicer says. There, the picture gets cloudier; lobbyists on both sides of the border-adjustment tax issue say they're not sure who'll determine the final contents of the administration's plan. "Clearly, the retailers getting out so fast and so aggressively early was" an advantage in lining up congressional opposition to Ryan's plan, said Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy for the American Action Forum, a right-of-center think tank in Washington. But it's still early, he said, and "unless we know where the White House is going to come down on it, it's hard to say who is winning." Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, have championed the border-adjustment plan as a way to raise revenue that would help finance tax-rate cuts. Independent estimates have said it would raise more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years. They also say it would help American-made products compete more effectively in overseas markets, while stimulating more domestic manufacturing. Those who oppose the border-adjusted tax say it would lead to higher prices on a range of consumer goods -- though supporters say a strengthening dollar would ultimately even such effects out. Opponents have gained valuable allies in Trump's administration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is said to oppose the border-adjustment concept, as is Gary Cohn, Trump's top economic adviser. Meanwhile, Stephen Bannon, the president's chief strategist who favors an "economic nationalist" approach, is said to favor the proposal. The retailers were aided early when, less than a month into Trump's presidency, they scheduled the chief executive officers of several retail companies to meet with Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council. Cohn elevated the event to a meeting with the president on Feb. 15, at which the border-adjustment plan was discussed, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump himself hasn't weighed in yet -- and that lack of clarity has left Ryan's plan without much political cover, leaving it open to attack, said Gray of the AAF. The main opposition group, Americans for Affordable Products, debuted on Feb. 1, and now has more than 400 member companies. A flood of CEOs including J.C. Penney haven't been shy about lambasting the border-adjustment proposal. Wall Street analysts have chimed in; the concept "would be a really big hit to some companies," said Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Retail stocks have declined this year while the overall market hit new heights. "No other issue galvanized the industry like this one," said Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, one of the groups leading the opposition. "Until the sponsors declare it dead, we will continue to fight against it." Opposition to border adjustments also came from Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. AFP says it has placed more than 10,000 telephone calls to members of Congress and made more than 100 visits to district offices in the past six weeks. The border-adjustment plan has supporters too. One day after the opposition group made its debut, the American Made Coalition was announced. It has fewer than 30 major companies as members -- almost all of them net exporters -- but they include household names like General Electric Co., Caterpillar Inc., and Merck & Co. The supporters say border adjustments would boost domestic manufacturing and reduce incentives for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. They're planning to launch new ads this month as Congress takes a two-week spring recess. "There's a lot of tax reform debate to be had," said John Gentzel, a spokesman for the supporters' group. He said the border-adjustment measure would create 1.7 million new jobs and boost wages by almost 8 percent. "Meanwhile, the opposition has spent all this time and energy trying to maintain status-quo tax policies that promote foreign-made products over U.S. jobs." Amid the corporate division on the issue, Washington's usual business lobbying has been thrown into disarray. Powerhouses like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and National Association of Manufacturers have been neutral because their memberships are split on the issue. Same for the Business Roundtable. "Regardless of how that issue comes out, you will see the Business Roundtable coming in strongly to help pull reform across the finish line," JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, who chairs the group, told Bloomberg last month. Wall Street has also mostly stayed quiet on border adjustments because it's not clear how businesses such as trading and lending would be treated under the House GOP plan. Financial industry lobbyists see the proposal as a non-starter in the Senate because of the opposition generated there by the retailers and their allies. "It has proved to be a very controversial issue, particularly on the Senate side where it doesn't look like there is going to be enough support for it," said Mike Sommers, the president of American Investment Council, which represents private equity firms. But all bets are off if the House plan for a border-adjusted tax, or BAT, is defeated and Congress begins looking for other ways to help finance tax cuts -- which might draw any number of other companies into the fray. "If you think the fight over BAT is ugly, just wait -- because what comes next is going to be a much bigger food fight," said Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners, a policy-research group in Washington. "We haven't even begun." © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 4 April 2017 by Military News New iGR study analyzes where and how U.S. mobile consumers purchase their mobile phones Study looks at recent trends, including the increasing use of installment plans to purchase phones AUSTIN, TX–(Marketwired – April 04, 2017) – U.S. mobile consumers have a wide range of options when deciding where to purchase a mobile phone or smartphone. They can purchase it directly from their mobile service provider or the phone manufacturer, but many other options are also available, including electronics stores, such as Best Buy or Radio Shack, discount stores, such as Target, Walmart or even Costco, and online-only retailers, such as Amazon, eBay, or Newegg. And within each of these types of retailers, consumers usually have the choice to either purchase online or go to a physical store. In addition to the many options in purchase location, consumers also have a choice in how they purchase their mobile phone: buy the phone at full price and pay for it up front, or purchase with an installment plan that allows for frequent upgrades. However, buying a subsidized phone with a two-year contract is no longer an option at the major U.S. mobile operators. iGR, a market research consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile industry, has released a new market study that analyzes which of these options U.S. mobile consumers have chosen for their latest mobile device and which they plan to use for their next mobile phone purchase. iGR’s latest market study also analyzes mobile consumers’ awareness of, use of, and interest in mobile phone installment and upgrade plans, which are now provided by all of the major U.S. mobile operators. In addition, the study discusses Apple’s installment plans and how mobile consumers perceive the program, especially when compared to the installment and upgrade plans provided by their mobile service providers. „Mobile device installment plans provided by mobile operators have risen in popularity, and in this study we discuss how many consumers have used the plans and how many are interested in purchasing their next mobile phone with this method,” said Iain Gillott, president and founder of iGR. „We have also analyzed how purchasing through an Apple installment plan might compare.” iGR’s new market study, U.S. Mobile Device Distribution Channels: The Move to Installment Plans discusses where and how U.S. mobile consumers purchase their mobile phones. The study also looks at the rising popularity of device installment plans from both mobile operators and device manufacturers (specifically, Apple) and consumers’ awareness of and interest in the plans. When appropriate, results are compared to those from iGR’s market study of January 2016. The data in the study is based on two web-based surveys of more than 1,000 U.S. mobile consumers that iGR fielded in November 2015 and March 2017. The following key questions are addressed in the new research study: How often do U.S. mobile consumers visit their mobile service providers’ retail stores and why? From what type of retailer did U.S. mobile consumers purchase their latest mobile phone? Did U.S. mobile consumers purchase their latest phone online or in a physical store? Where do U.S. mobile consumers plan to purchase their next mobile phone and why? What type of purchase method did U.S. mobile consumers use when they purchased their last phone – a subsidized phone plan with a contract, an installment plan, or some other method? What type of purchase method do U.S. mobile consumers plan to use when they purchase their next phone and why? What are U.S. mobile consumers’ awareness of and interest in their mobile service providers’ installment plans? How has this awareness and interest changed over the last two years? What percentage of U.S. mobile consumers have purchased their devices with mobile service provider installment plans? How does this number compare to one or two years ago? What are U.S. mobile consumers’ awareness of and interest in Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program? What percentage of U.S. mobile consumers have purchased their devices with Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program? Would more U.S. mobile consumers prefer to purchase their next iPhone with Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program or with their provider’s installment plan? How do the location and method of U.S. mobile consumers’ mobile device purchases vary according to their mobile service provider? How do the location and method of U.S. mobile consumers’ mobile device purchases vary according to demographic variables? The information in this market study will be valuable for: Mobile network operators Mobile service retailers and distributors Mobile device OEMs Financial analysts and investors.

By Leslie Kaufman, InsideClimate News Apr 4, 2017 Solar generating station at Nellis Air Force Base in Las Vegas, Nevada. The doomsday coverage of the attack on renewable energy by the Trump administration is "fake drama," according to one solar entrepreneur. "We've already won the battle." Credit: Ethan Miller/Getty Images For proponents of clean energy, the Donald Trump administration already seems like a nightmare. In the worst moment so far, Trump surrounded himself with coal miners and signed an executive order last week that aims to rescind former President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan. That regulation would have continued to move the power industry away from coal-burning plants and toward wind and solar farms. So is Washington trying to kill the renewable energy revolution? Jeff Tannenbaum and Jigar Shah don't believe that's possible. They were both involved with a company called sPower, which has built and operates 150 utility-scale solar and wind power projects across the U.S. and the U.K. It was sold in February to giant utility AES Corporation for $1.6 billion—one of the biggest deals ever in the green energy industry. Tannenbaum and Shah say that deal is just one of many that prove the shift away from fossil fuels is inevitable, whatever the political climate and no matter who is in the White House.   Jeff Tannenbaum, founder of Fir Tree Partners. Photo courtesy of Jeff Tannenbaum Tannenbaum is the founder of Fir Tree Partners, a private investment firm with $10 billion under management. His clients are endowments, pension funds and foundations, and he did not make his bet on sPower because he is an environmental activist. He said his primary goal is to make good long-term investments. Fir Tree acquired sPower three years ago for the most traditional of reasons—because Tannenbaum saw a potentially booming market for clean power companies. In contrast, Shah, owner of a firm called Generate Capital, has been a renewables advocate for decades. His company provides financing for commercial-scale renewable energy generation projects, heating equipment retrofits, energy storage, urban farms and wastewater treatment technologies. He was a founder of solar energy pioneer SunEdison, is the author of the book "Creating Climate Wealth," and had been on the board of directors of sPower since 2014. Shah is frustrated with what he sees as the media's doomsday coverage of the attack on clean energy by the Trump administration. "This is fake drama," he said, referring to Trump's executive order. "We've already won the battle. You should be covering renewables like you did with the dawn of fracking—as if this changes everything." Jigar Shah, cofounder and president of Generate Capital. Photo courtesy of Jigar Shah The case for optimism is grounded in swelling private markets and technological advances that Tannenbaum and Shah believe are immune to U.S. government interference. They point out that more than 60 percent of new energy generation in 2016 was from wind and solar. And that was in a year when the United States put 26 new gigawatts online—the largest addition since 2012—according to the United States Energy Information Administration. Shah said that, subtracting the energy being produced by fossil fuel plants retired last year, net new electricity generation was clean. The appetite for that power comes not just from utilities being forced by state laws to meet carbon reduction targets, Tannenbaum and Shah said, but also from private markets and corporate demand. Fortune 500 companies like Google, Walmart, Facebook, Mars and Nestle have all set goals to use 100 percent clean power. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the number of companies signing long-term green-power contracts in 2016 dropped from 2015, but more are still coming. Tannenbaum said Fortune 500 green-power commitments will add up to 50 gigawatts in the next five to seven years. State requirements—if they remain unchanged—will add another 80 gigawatts in the next decade. Tannenbaum argues this trend will only accelerate, even if subsidies for renewables are phased out. Producing electricity with solar and wind farms is already cheaper than energy from new coal plants. Although generating electricity with natural gas is still cheaper, he acknowledged, that should change over the next few years as costs continue to decline. "In just three years at sPower, our cost curve on the build-out went from two dollars per megawatt hour to one dollar and it is heading to $.85 in the near future," he said. And that is without the big game-changer. China announced in January it would spend $360 billion to develop renewables in the next three years, which it forecasts will create 13 million new jobs. "I've never heard of a number bigger than $350 billion in three years in any industry," Tannenbaum said. "Not in cars. Not in cable. It would be a tremendous economic tragedy for the new administration to miss the opportunity China sees and not go after this tremendous—and much needed—job creation." Shah says that even without China-scale investment, renewables are building a solid employment base in the U.S., while coal continues a long decline. Despite coal production increasing from 883 million tons in 1985 to 1,150 million tons in 2005, automation caused jobs in the industry to drop from 173,000 to fewer than 80,000. As coal production has fallen since then, industry jobs have declined to fewer than 70,000. Meanwhile, the solar industry said it employed more than 260,000 as of 2016 and that roughly 1 in 50 new jobs nationwide last year were in that industry. Renewables also enjoy the cool factor, Shah said. "I saw an executive from Shell Oil on TV complaining that people don't want to work for him," Shah said. In contrast, renewable energy "is the hottest job market in 25 years and I have 500 resumes sitting on my desk." Not everyone in the green power community is sanguine about the impact of the Trump administration's policy reversals. Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national non-partisan group of environmental entrepreneurs, is particularly concerned that state governments will feel empowered to push back against new state environmental requirements. In Illinois, opponents of the so-called Future Energy Jobs Law—a 2016 law mandating that certain amounts of energy be generated from solar and wind—filed lawsuits in February to stop it from going into effect. In North Dakota, legislators have proposed a two-year ban on new wind energy. In Ohio, Republican Governor John Kasich has already vetoed a bill to freeze alternative energy and energy efficiency standards, and the bill is coming around again. "The people fighting against these smart policies were just emboldened by the president of the United States and that is something to worry about," Keefe said. Even in states that support renewables, this promises to be a rocky year. In California, for example, the independent operator of California's electrical grid has said it will have to curtail solar. The grid simply can't absorb all the hydropower from record snows and solar production. Having too much sustainable power sounds like a victory, but it represents a fundamental weakness in renewables. They don't produce power efficiently at peak use times (morning and evening) and there still aren't enough storage options. Still, Tannenbaum is not discouraged. Yes, he argued, the new political environment will be challenging for renewable companies and lots will go out of business, but that is the nature of an infant industry. "We will look back in 20 years and remember this was the first inning," he said. "It's like the beginning of the Internet revolution; 99 percent of companies went out of business. But there were winners and there will be lessons learned." Shah is even more confident. "The Clean Power Plan was entirely about shutting down coal plants, never about promoting renewables," he said. "Now [coal] may live three to five years longer, but that doesn't hurt renewable energy. "People say, 'What if they could bring back coal'? I say, 'What if a pig could fly'?"

They can purchase it directly from their mobile service provider or the phone manufacturer, but many other options are also available, including electronics stores, such as Best Buy or Radio Shack, discount stores, such as Target, Walmart or even Costco, and online-only retailers, such as Amazon, eBay, or Newegg. And within each of these types of retailers, consumers usually have the choice to either purchase online or go to a physical store. In addition to the many options in purchase location, consumers also have a choice in how they purchase their mobile phone: buy the phone at full price and pay for it up front, or purchase with an installment plan that allows for frequent upgrades. However, buying a subsidized phone with a two-year contract is no longer an option at the major U.S. mobile operators. iGR, a market research consultancy focused on the wireless and mobile industry, has released a new market study that analyzes which of these options U.S. mobile consumers have chosen for their latest mobile device and which they plan to use for their next mobile phone purchase. iGR's latest market study also analyzes mobile consumers' awareness of, use of, and interest in mobile phone installment and upgrade plans, which are now provided by all of the major U.S. mobile operators. In addition, the study discusses Apple's installment plans and how mobile consumers perceive the program, especially when compared to the installment and upgrade plans provided by their mobile service providers. "Mobile device installment plans provided by mobile operators have risen in popularity, and in this study we discuss how many consumers have used the plans and how many are interested in purchasing their next mobile phone with this method," said Iain Gillott, president and founder of iGR. "We have also analyzed how purchasing through an Apple installment plan might compare." iGR's new market study, U.S. Mobile Device Distribution Channels: The Move to Installment Plans discusses where and how U.S. mobile consumers purchase their mobile phones. The study also looks at the rising popularity of device installment plans from both mobile operators and device manufacturers (specifically, Apple) and consumers' awareness of and interest in the plans. When appropriate, results are compared to those from iGR's market study of January 2016. The data in the study is based on two web-based surveys of more than 1,000 U.S. mobile consumers that iGR fielded in November 2015 and March 2017. The following key questions are addressed in the new research study: How often do U.S. mobile consumers visit their mobile service providers' retail stores and why? From what type of retailer did U.S. mobile consumers purchase their latest mobile phone? Did U.S. mobile consumers purchase their latest phone online or in a physical store? Where do U.S. mobile consumers plan to purchase their next mobile phone and why? What type of purchase method did U.S. mobile consumers use when they purchased their last phone - a subsidized phone plan with a contract, an installment plan, or some other method? What type of purchase method do U.S. mobile consumers plan to use when they purchase their next phone and why? What are U.S. mobile consumers' awareness of and interest in their mobile service providers' installment plans? How has this awareness and interest changed over the last two years? What percentage of U.S. mobile consumers have purchased their devices with mobile service provider installment plans? How does this number compare to one or two years ago? What are U.S. mobile consumers' awareness of and interest in Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program? What percentage of U.S. mobile consumers have purchased their devices with Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program? Would more U.S. mobile consumers prefer to purchase their next iPhone with Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program or with their provider's installment plan? How do the location and method of U.S. mobile consumers' mobile device purchases vary according to their mobile service provider? How do the location and method of U.S. mobile consumers' mobile device purchases vary according to demographic variables?

Trump’s win gave Republicans control of the U.S. government for the first time in a decade and quickly drew attention to a tax plan that House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled last summer with little fanfare. Ryan’s radical tax-code rewrite would replace the corporate income tax with a 20 percent tax on businesses’ domestic sales and imports; their exports would be exempt. Cue the alarm bells for import-heavy companies like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Nike Inc. Retailers, apparel-makers, shoemakers, automakers and others unleashed one of their most robust lobbying and public-relations pushes in recent memory against the so-called “border-adjusted” tax. Buttressed by more than 10,000 phone calls to congressional offices, by a parody-style TV ad that aired during “Saturday Night Live” and by a succession of Republicans who’ve expressed concern about the plan, the opponents’ efforts appear to be winning. So far. But the action has now shifted to the White House, which will be “driving the train” on tax legislation, Press Secretary Sean Spicer says. There, the picture gets cloudier; lobbyists on both sides of the border-adjustment tax issue say they’re not sure who’ll determine the final contents of the administration’s plan. Still Early “Clearly, the retailers getting out so fast and so aggressively early was” an advantage in lining up congressional opposition to Ryan’s plan, said Gordon Gray, director of fiscal policy for the American Action Forum, a right-of-center think tank in Washington. But it’s still early, he said, and “unless we know where the White House is going to come down on it, it’s hard to say who is winning.” QuickTake Trump’s ‘Big Border Tax’ Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Ways and Means Committee, have championed the border-adjustment plan as a way to raise revenue that would help finance tax-rate cuts. Independent estimates have said it would raise more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over 10 years. They also say it would help American-made products compete more effectively in overseas markets, while stimulating more domestic manufacturing. Read more: A Q&A explains how the border-adjusted tax would work Those who oppose the border-adjusted tax say it would lead to higher prices on a range of consumer goods -- though supporters say a strengthening dollar would ultimately even such effects out. Opponents have gained valuable allies in Trump’s administration. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is said to oppose the border-adjustment concept, as is Gary Cohn, Trump’s top economic adviser. ‘Economic Nationalist’ Meanwhile, Stephen Bannon, the president’s chief strategist who favors an “economic nationalist” approach, is said to favor the proposal. The retailers were aided early when, less than a month into Trump’s presidency, they scheduled the chief executive officers of several retail companies to meet with Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council. Cohn elevated the event to a meeting with the president on Feb. 15, at which the border-adjustment plan was discussed, according to people familiar with the meeting. Trump himself hasn’t weighed in yet -- and that lack of clarity has left Ryan’s plan without much political cover, leaving it open to attack, said Gray of the AAF.

Sign Up The main opposition group, Americans for Affordable Products, debuted on Feb. 1, and now has more than 400 member companies. A flood of CEOs including J.C. Penney haven’t been shy about lambasting the border-adjustment proposal. Wall Street analysts have chimed in; the concept “would be a really big hit to some companies,” said Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Retail stocks have declined this year while the overall market hit new heights. Import-heavy companies like Wal-Mart unleashed one of their most robust lobbying and public-relations pushes in recent memory against the so-called “border-adjusted” tax. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg Fight Continues “No other issue galvanized the industry like this one,” said Brian Dodge, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, one of the groups leading the opposition. “Until the sponsors declare it dead, we will continue to fight against it.” Opposition to border adjustments also came from Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group founded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. AFP says it has placed more than 10,000 telephone calls to members of Congress and made more than 100 visits to district offices in the past six weeks. The border-adjustment plan has supporters too. One day after the opposition group made its debut, the American Made Coalition was announced. It has fewer than 30 major companies as members -- almost all of them net exporters -- but they include household names like General Electric Co., Caterpillar Inc., and Merck & Co. Ads Planned The supporters say border adjustments would boost domestic manufacturing and reduce incentives for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. They’re planning to launch new ads this month as Congress takes a two-week spring recess. “There’s a lot of tax reform debate to be had,” said John Gentzel, a spokesman for the supporters’ group. He said the border-adjustment measure would create 1.7 million new jobs and boost wages by almost 8 percent. “Meanwhile, the opposition has spent all this time and energy trying to maintain status-quo tax policies that promote foreign-made products over U.S. jobs.” Amid the corporate division on the issue, Washington’s usual business lobbying has been thrown into disarray. Powerhouses like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and National Association of Manufacturers have been neutral because their memberships are split on the issue. Same for the Business Roundtable. ‘Finish Line’ “Regardless of how that issue comes out, you will see the Business Roundtable coming in strongly to help pull reform across the finish line,” JPMorgan Chase & Co. CEO Jamie Dimon, who chairs the group, told Bloomberg last month. Wall Street has also mostly stayed quiet on border adjustments because it’s not clear how businesses such as trading and lending would be treated under the House GOP plan. Financial industry lobbyists see the proposal as a non-starter in the Senate because of the opposition generated there by the retailers and their allies. “It has proved to be a very controversial issue, particularly on the Senate side where it doesn’t look like there is going to be enough support for it,” said Mike Sommers, the president of American Investment Council, which represents private equity firms. But all bets are off if the House plan for a border-adjusted tax, or BAT, is defeated and Congress begins looking for other ways to help finance tax cuts -- which might draw any number of other companies into the fray. “If you think the fight over BAT is ugly, just wait -- because what comes next is going to be a much bigger food fight,” said Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners, a policy-research group in Washington. “We haven’t even begun.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Elissa Nadworny/NPR hide caption toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR If you live in Nogales, Ariz., you're just a short walk from the border with Mexico. Elissa Nadworny/NPR Depending on where you sit, the U.S.-Mexico border is: a) a dangerous frontier that allows drug traffickers and illegal immigrants to cross freely into the U.S. or b) a familiar frontier that is navigated as a regular part of everyday life. For people who live along the border in the twinned cities of Nogales, Ariz., and Nogales, Mexico, it's nearly always the latter. The sister cities are known collectively as Ambos Nogales, or "Both Nogales." Nogales, Ariz., is less than a tenth of the size of its Mexican counterpart: about 20,000 people compared with 250,000 on the Mexican side. Enlarge this image The border wall separating the two cities named Nogales extends for about 10 miles. It's made of rusted steel tubes reinforced with concrete — with steel plates on top.

It's made of rusted steel tubes reinforced with concrete — with steel plates on top. Elissa Nadworny/NPR In both directions, cross-border excursions are a normal thing. If you live on the Arizona side, you just take a short walk to the crossing, follow the small sign with the red arrow that says "TO MEXICO," pass through a turnstile, and there you are in another country. One of the first things you'll see is the border wall stretching between the two countries. In Nogales, it looms 18 to 30 feet tall. It's made of rusted steel tubes reinforced with concrete, with steel plates on top. There are 4-inch gaps between the bars, wide enough for people on opposite sides of the border to hold hands through the openings. Walk just a bit farther into the city, and you'll find pharmacies, salons and dental clinics offering services at a fraction of what they would cost in the U.S. (Top) Nogales, Mexico, is packed with pharmacies, salons and dental clinics, offering services at a fraction of what they would cost in the U.S. (Bottom right) Rubi Celeste gives Delia Garza a manicure at Excellence Beauty Salon in Nogales, Mexico.

Elissa Nadworny/NPR hide caption toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR In fact, many Arizonans we meet in Nogales tell us they cross over into Mexico all the time for haircuts, manicures or a bit of nightlife. (Many also swear the tacos are better on the Mexican side, though our unscientific taste tests could not confirm this.) At a nail salon a couple of blocks away from the border crossing, I meet Delia Garza. She has walked across the border on her day off from her job at Walgreens in Nogales, Ariz., and tells me she comes to Mexico all the time because it's so much cheaper: 100 pesos for a manicure, or about $5. Dental clinics are in profusion on the Mexico side, offering the gamut of services: root canals, braces, implants, cosmetic dentistry. About The 'Our Land' Project Our Land is a project from special correspondent Melissa Block. She's spending the next few months traveling the country, capturing how people's identity is shaped by where they live. Help her decide where to go and who to spend time with by filling out this form. Outside the Smile Dental Care clinic, a sign promises customers they can "SAVE UP TO 70% COMPARE TO THE USA," and lists a dozen U.S. dental insurance companies whose plans the clinic accepts. In the Smile Dental Care waiting room we find Adriana Guerrero, 23, who has driven an hour south from Tucson to get her braces tightened. The price she was quoted for braces back home was $5,000. Here in Mexico? $1,600. Her husband's mother lives on the Mexican side, so Guerrero can bring their baby and combine a braces tune-up with a visit to Grandma. When we walk back across into the U.S. (just a few of the nearly 3.5 million pedestrians who will cross into Nogales, Ariz., each year) we find Trinidad Leon in a shoe store, shopping for her grandchildren. She walks across from Mexico looking for bargains on the U.S. side, often at Wal-Mart — shoes, clothing, certain groceries — "every day," she says, laughing, "if I have the money!"

Elissa Nadworny/NPR And down the street, there's another border crosser: Michelle, a frisky pug dog, who has just been let out of her crate by 12-year-old Alexander Figueroa. He explains that Michelle got in a fight with a bigger dog back home in Tucson and needed stitches to mend her torn lip. The Tucson veterinarian was going to charge the family $675. In Mexico? "It was like 600 pesos, which was around $30," Alexander says, "and we got her stitched up and everything, and it was a great deal." "And a shower!" his mother, Liliana Figueroa, chimes in. "A free shower. She's cute now, very cute and clean, and she's ready to go home." The border wall separating the two cities named Nogales extends for about 10 miles, and in that stretch there's one crossing that doesn't require a passport. That's where we meet Juan Manuel Fleischer. He is a cattle broker based in Arizona, and the day we meet, he is waiting for the latest herd of cattle he bought in Mexico to cross into the U.S. through that border gate. Enlarge this image Cattle careen down the dusty hillside and are funneled into pens on the U.S. side.

Elissa Nadworny/NPR "A thousand, 1,500 head come in here every day, and they leave every day," Fleischer says. High above us, the steel gate creaks open. Cattle start careening down the dusty hillside and are funneled into pens on the U.S. side. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are standing by with clickers, counting off each one as it lumbers through. All of the Mexican cattle are branded with an "M" on their right hip. Fleischer will be shipping his to California and Texas. Enlarge this image All of the Mexican cattle are branded with an "M" on their right hip.

His wife was born in Mexico. "We're all intertwined here on the border," he says. He sees his own identity as an easy blend. "I'm a Mexican-American," he begins. "I'm Latin. I'm white; that's what they make me sign [on] the papers. Yeah, I'm a Mexican-American from the border." Fleischer's family lived here when all this land was part of Mexico.

He can trace his lineage in this part of the world all the way back to the 1500s, to ancestors who came from Spain and Portugal. When he grew up in the 1960s and '70s, he recalls, the border was open. "Oh yeah," he says. "You could cross with nothing before. You didn't need passports. People knew each other. Mexican people could come back and forth. You know, [at] customs, you say, 'Hey, I'm just gonna go get stuff at the grocery store ...' Yeah, it was different times." Over time, the Nogales wall has evolved and grown, from a simple barbed wire fence to this latest version, put up in 2011. "I don't like the wall," Fleischer says. "I think it's ugly. But as far as leaving no wall and no vigilance? It'd be ridiculous. We're just looking for trouble." Still, Fleischer flatly calls it "stupid" to think the wall stops drug traffickers.

"You'll see people just hop over that fence with loads of dope on their backs and risk the cross," he says. "It happens a lot. They get a little ladder and they get up there. These are agile kids." "I couldn't do it!" he adds, laughing. "It'd scare the hell out of me to get up there!" Fleischer pauses to reflect on the relative dangers this border poses. "I guess what I would tell people that aren't from the border is, we aren't in any risk of being invaded by drug dealers or terrorists or illegal aliens. The fact that they can cross through here is just a fact." This land, spanning two countries, is close to his heart. "I love the fact that I can live on both sides of the border and be OK with that," he tells me. "I think it's a fair deal." "And," he concludes, "I think we're fortunate as a country to have a country next to us that is our friend. It could be a lot worse."

(AP) — The four Gospels of the New Testament chronicle the life of Jesus Christ. When Charlie Hunt reads them, he sees a story and he puts it on the walls of Princeton's First Baptist Church. Hunt's first paintings were inspired by cartoons he saw on television when he was five years old. He never made a career of it. Instead, he spent 22 years in the military, then worked as night manager at the Princeton Walmart. But then, FBC Pastor Mark Massaro asked for volunteers to paint Bible stories on the walls of the youth Bible education class space. Some children of the church painted a mural depicting the birth of Jesus. And another group of volunteers painted another scene from the life of Christ. Then Hunt volunteered. "I hadn't painted for 20 years," he said on a Friday morning as he applied acrylic paint brush strokes to depict scourge marks on Christ's body in the scene of the crucifixion. He found, he said, that painting can be just like riding a bicycle. "I've got 39 pictures in mind, from Mary and Joseph and Jesus crossing the desert, to Christ's ascension," he said. "I've got 11 completed." Hunt does his painting in his spare time. He started in 2015, and he estimates he has another two year worth of work ahead of him before the life of Christ is told in mural form within the church. It's a good way to bring the words of the biblical books of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to life in a visual form for children and adults, he agrees. Hunt estimates he spends about 20 hours per week working on the murals. He first sketches a Bible scene on paper, then makes a scale grid. He free-hand sketches the same scene in larger dimension on a grid on the particle-board walls that divide the FBC youth education classrooms. Once the scene is sketched on the wall, he can start to paint. "I come in early and work to midmorning," he said. Those wooden walls eat away the art sketch pencils and absorb a lot of acrylic paint. Hunt estimates he started out with about 300 bottes. It's hard to say how many he will have used before the project is completed. He climbs down from the ladder where he's been painting the crucifixion scene and walks down the corridor of the building where he also volunteers with the children's ministry. He points to the mural the children started with, and across the aisle to a corresponding scene of Jesus in the manger that he painted. Next to it, a scene of Jesus as a child in the temple in Jerusalem, and across the aisle in a corner, the fluorescent light casts an appropriate glow upon the rays of light emanating from the top of a mural that shows a dove depicting the Holy Spirit in the scene of Christ's baptism by John the Baptist. Hunt walks along the corridors, where more scenes are complete, and some sketches are taped to blank spaces where the next scene will be painted. Directly across from the crucifixion scene, which is nearly complete, is a pencil sketch of Christ's ascension. "I enjoy doing it. It's something I found a passion with. When I was in school, I helped teachers in art classes. I got through biology by drawing pictures of dissections of bugs. "This, to me, is just like basketball or baseball is for other people. It's something I can do. This, I can do." ___ Source: The Princeton Daily Clarion, http://bit.ly/2o33tkV ___ Information from: Princeton Daily Clarion, http://www.tristate-media.com/pdclarion This is an AP-Indiana Exchange story offered by The Princeton Daily Clarion.

Women and Men - Essay Women and Education While they cannot be said to be representative, the highest positions are even more elusive for women: only seven of 655 elected heads of state in the world are women, and only 66 of 697 heads of government. The situation is similar at the level of local government: female elected councillors are under-represented in all regions of the world and women mayors even more so. And many of the women in top positions are already lined up for success. The few women in the Forbes rich list mostly come from rich families or business dynasties such as Walmart or Apple. Why Do Women Outnumber Men in College? You are getting better. Still need to work more: 6. Try to write the sentences more smoothly 7. Read other top essays and learn how to develop your arguments Women and Men - Essay When both spouses have the same education level, for example a university degree, this is called educational homogamy. Due to the rapid growth in the proportion of female university graduates, men with a university degree had more opportunities of finding a spouse with a degree in 7556 than in 6986. Thus in 7556, among married men with a university degree, 67% of them had a spouse with the same level of education as they had, whereas that proportion was only 88% in 6986. Women and Education Between the 6855s and 6555s, Europe experienced a period of cultural rebirth known as the Renaissance , marking the transition from medieval times to modern times. Having this movie, 67 Angry Men, being made in the late 6955"s, women were not allowed to serve as jurors in the courtroom. Therefore, another good name for this movie could have easily been 67 Stubborn Men.. Therefore, when a woman reacting to a bloody murder case, I cannot see any of those men reacting the way they did throughout the movie towards the other men.. Knowing that history cannot be changed, it is still ridiculous that women were not allowed the power to serve as a juror to provide a vote.. Women are just as equal especially when making a choice to decide innocent or guil. Improving the status, health and well-being of women psychologists and consumers of psychological services, and addressing issues such as gender disparities, domestic violence, disabilities and depression. Men And Women What influences a person’s identity? Is it their homes, parents, religion, or maybe where they live? When do they get one? Do "Women earned percent of bachelor's degrees in business in 6989-5 and 55 percent by 7556-7, up from only percent in 6975-6." It&apos s been historically a gender role. Since men are naturally stronger than women, harder outside tasks were designated. Leaving easier, inside housework for the women. Women who are in powerful positions often find they face a daily barrage of sexist behaviour from men, which in many countries is outlawed in the workplace. And often, even among the elite, women do not do as well as men. Eighty-eight per cent of women aged 85-89 see their earnings decline when they have children. A study of Harvard graduates in the US found that median earnings in 7555 were $95,555 for women but $667,555 for men. Among full-time, full-year workers, median earnings were $667,555 for women and $687,555 for men. «Women and men essay writer» in pictures. More images «Women and men essay writer».

Murry and Kirbie Walker say it's not a perfect system, but they've made it work for them. Tuesday afternoon, with their two children in tow, the couple was headed to the grocery store, with a stop on a downtown bus bench as they waited for a transfer. It's a common sight on Second Street Southwest, where the city's hub-and-spoke transit system gathers people from throughout Rochester and efficiently delivers them downtown for work, medical appointments or to catch a bus to another destination. But for the Walkers, even a trip from their home in north Rochester to Walmart North requires a downtown stop. Kirbie Walker said it's one of the things she'd like to see change. For Murry Walker the biggest change needed is expanded weekend service, especially for families, who rely on the system for all their transportation needs, "Especially on Sunday," Kirbie Walker said, echoing her husband's comments. "A lot of people go to church, and a lot of people have Sunday off." She said she noted as much when she took a recent survey regarding Rochester's bus service. She's not the only one seeing the need. Tuesday afternoon, Brad Lind was waiting for a bus to get to his job at Forager, but he noted Sunday service should be a priority. According the survey results, other community members also see the lack of adequate weekend service as one of the three largest unmet needs, along with the lack of evening hours and service gaps in parts of the city. Tuesday, during the Rochester City Council's committee of the whole meeting, Stuart Geltman, senior transit planner with Aecom, revealed how the public transit plan his company is preparing for Rochester will address such needs. The five-year plan lays out goals that include starting Sunday service in July, restructuring routes, clarifying route names and eventually establishing a direct route from downtown to Rochester International Airport. Expansion efforts also include the creation of a crosstown route as early as 2018 and adding buses throughout the plan, an effort that received an early boost last week with the award of a nearly $3 million state grant. Geltman noted the uncertainty of state and federal funding is being considered in the plan. While it will suggest a timeline for adding buses and expanding routes, he said implementation could fluctuate. "If funding gets tight, you can delay," he said, while noting other state grants could fast track parts of the plan. The estimated cost of expanded service wasn't as high as some Rochester City Council members expected. Mark Hickey questioned how routes could expand with the city planning to nearly double eventual service hours without doubling operating expenses. While the cost of new buses and facilities will spike expenses in 2018 and 2020, Geltman said operating costs are only expected to climb from $9.3 million to $14.6 million. With that, he said, local funding would actually drop from $2.35 million to $1.96 million. The drop comes with an expected $2 million increase in revenues, as well as expected increases in state funding due to increased ridership. Brian Law of Rochester Public Transit said the city department hopes to have the final plan ready to present in early May for a 30-day review before it heads to the city council.

Tim Ryan of Howland, D-13th, and Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington state Republican, introduced the Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Act on Monday. Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing 10 percent or more of the school year. Students who are chronically absent are 68 percent less likely than other students to graduate high school. The Chronic Absenteeism Reduction Act extends the allowable use of funds of Title IV-A block grants to allow schools the flexibility to invest in getting students to engage in academic programs before having to invest in enriching those programs. The bill allows schools to enact attendance programs that cater to their local needs by authorizing existing funds for schools to develop and implement effective strategies to combat chronic absence in schools.

Allen said a woman reported seeing a man drag a small girl into the woods by the store around 7:30 p.m. Monday. After hours of searching, Allen said investigators found no sign of a suspect or missing child. Officers from Waveland, Bay St. Louis, and the Hancock County Sheriff’s Department joined in the search Monday night. Allen said a man matching the description given to police was seen in the woods, but he ran when officers approached him, and officers were unable to catch him. After that man was seen, the area was contained, and K9 units were called in to join the search. Allen said officers searched Walmart and found no parents had reported missing children. Investigators also reviewed hours of surveillance tape and found no sign of a child in or around the woods near the store. Allen said a shoplifter was reported at the store just before the incident, and that could have been the man who ran from officers. Officers also checked nearby apartment complexes to see if anyone reported a missing child. The search was called off around 10:15 p.m. after all leads were exhausted. Allen said the woods around the store are used by people living in nearby apartment complexes, and it’s possible the witness saw a person walking through the woods with their own child.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Technology From Facebook ventures, YouTube music to Gucci memes, here are top 5 in-the-news ads From Facebook ventures, YouTube music to Gucci memes, here are top 5 in-the-news ads Mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Published: April 4, 2017 7:33 AM Mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Social media leader Facebook has confirmed the integration of header bidding on its platform. Header bidding, which allows mobile web publishers to collect bids and then select the highest offer, and improve upon the original programmatic auctions, has been lauded by publishers. Facebook’s initial partners include Amazon Publisher Services, AppNexus, Index Exchange, Media.net, Sonobi and Sortable. These mobile publishers have been able to tap demand from Facebook Audience Network. The system will allow them to take bids from multiple buyer pools all at once. Due to advance bidding technology, publishers can make more money and earn up to 10-30% more revenues, when compared to programmatic advertising. With this, the cost to buy ads on the mobile web are set to go up as simultaneous bidding grows as all demand sources get the same information at the same time. This, however, experts suggest, will force mobile web prices to go up. Facebook has been testing this platform since August 2016 to counter Google’s ad platforms. Google’s Doubleclick has already adopted header bidding. A BI Intelligence report on header bidding says that nearly 70% of publishers now use header bidding technology. It further states that the technology offers many benefits for publishers and advertisers. “For publishers, header bidding offers a means to optimise yield, cut down on passbacks, increase transparency of inventory value, and eliminate Google’s favouritism for its own ad exchange, AdX. On the buy side, advertisers are given the opportunity to bid on all available inventory and not just remnant inventory like in a waterfall system,” says the report. Facebook says that its tests with publishers such as the Washington Post, Daily Mail and Forbes have shown header bidding through its Audience Network can increase revenue by 10-30%. YouTube faces the music Amidst growing concern over objectionable content on digital platforms, brands are taking all possible steps to guard themselves from appearing next to such content on YouTube and other Google-partnered websites. Havas Group UK recently decided on its clients’ behalf to pull out all of their advertising monies from YouTube and Google. The statement issued by the company said, “Havas Group UK has taken the decision on behalf of its UK clients, which include O2, Royal Mail, BBC, Domino’s and Hyundai Kia, to pause all YouTube and Google Display Network (GDN) investment until further notice.” The objectionable content includes videos promoting extremist content and terrorist organisations such as ISIS on Google-partnered websites near the content from brands. AT&T, Johnson & Johnson and Verizon have also announced that they would refrain from buying both video and text ads. McDonald’s, Walmart, Audi and Toyota are also pulling their ads from Google properties. In a blog post, Philipp Schindler, chief business officer of Google, assured increased brand safety levels and controls for advertisers. He wrote, “We know advertisers don’t want their ads next to content that doesn’t align with their values. So starting today, we are taking a tougher stance on hateful, offensive and derogatory content…We’ll offer advertisers and agencies more transparency and visibility on where their ads are running, and in the coming months we will expand availability of video-level reporting to all advertisers.” 1800 Tequila’s new video wins Hands down Building further on 1800’s strong relationship with the hip-hop community, the new ad from the brand called Hands establishes the tequila as the drink of choice for modern boundary-pushers. The film, which is garnering steam online, features a man who practices in a boxing ring during the day and plays piano in the nights at a jazz establishment.  The high-energy soundtrack Tap Dance from Octave Minds features Chance the Rapper who has given two verses to Hands. The new positioning, which goes with the tagline Just Refined Enough, tries to break through much abused liquor stereotypes and aims “to spark a new conversation about the multi-dimensional nature of modern masculinity”, according to the brand.  Created by CP+BLA, our protagonist in the ad — one-part pianist, one-part boxer — is shown approaching both tasks with  equal enthusiasm. Over the years, through partnerships with Billboard, 1800 has worked with various notable hip-hop artists including Rae Sremmurd, Travis Scott, Wale, Mike WiLL Made-It, etc. The aim of the brand has been to trace an artists’ roots and shed light on urban lifestyles. The latest viral by 1800 Tequila definitely hits the right notes with its protagonist and soundtrack matching up to the brand’s philosophy. You might also want to see this: TV ad spends to drop in the UK According to Zenith, the Publicis Groupe media agency, television ad spends in the UK are set to fall by 2% to £3.93 billion this year. If it does, it will be for the first time since 2012. The Advertising Expenditure Forecast further says that London currently is the fourth biggest city globally, following New York, Tokyo and Los Angeles, for ad spends. It contributed £5.2 billion in 2017. The forecast also says that 2017 will see internet advertising attracting more monies than traditional TV advertising and newspaper advertising will be overshadowed by social media advertising. The report said that TV spends in the UK will shrink in the first quarter of 2017, due to decline in retail spends by 15% and drop in FMCG advertising by 12%. For 2017, the forecast predicts, global internet advertising expenditure will grow 13% to reach $205 billion. Internet advertising will attract 36.9% of all advertising expenditure, up from 34% in 2016, totalling $192 billion. “Internet advertising has contributed all of the growth in global ad spend since the beginning of the decade, and has stimulated much of the innovation we have seen in the market,” said Vittorio Bonori, Zenith’s global brand president. “Innovation is proceeding as fast as ever, and we believe that this is what will continue to drive brand growth for advertisers.” Gucci’s memes for digital world Gucci recently owned the meme landscape in the virtual world with #TFWGucci to launch its new watch collection, Le Marché des Merveilles. The brand commissioned international artists to develop original imagery which were then given to famous viral creators on Twitter and Instagram to turn into new memes for its timepieces. The results, which became a collection of the brand’s captioned art, were met with awe and criticism in equal measure. “Adapted from a popular meme, That Feeling When Gucci is about the moment of putting on one of the watches, when the world suddenly becomes different and time slows down a little bit,” announced the brand on its microsite. One of the most viral memes to garner over 80,000 likes, it was inspired by the Arthur meme. — Compiled by Ananya Saha Please Wait while comments are loading...

Third annual Wood Buffalo Spring Food Drive brings in 52-thousand pounds of food for the region Charity Community Local News by melaniewalsh Posted Apr 3, 2017 5:52 pm MDT Last Updated Apr 3, 2017 at 5:53 pm MDT The Wood Buffalo Food Bank’s third annual Servus Spring Food Drive raised a grand total of $22,968.69 in monetary donations and brought in 52,209 pounds of food. The goal that was set out by the Food Bank for the weekend was originally 35,000 pounds of food. A press release from the Food Bank reads, “Fort McMurray residents came together once again to prove that they are the most giving and supportive community, regardless of recent struggles they have faced this past year.” With the increase in need this year for the region the two day food drive held from Saturday, April 1st to Sunday, April 2nd had volunteers stationed at local grocery stores in Fort McMurray as well as Walmart and the Anzac Grocery store collecting donations. “In a time when our community is still reeling over past events it was so good to be able to have some many of our citizens come out to volunteer and donate to support those most vulnerable in our community. We recognize the great strain the citizens of our region face in so many ways right now and are eternally grateful for the kindness and generosity of all who give of their time, money, and food. The Staff and Board of the Wood Buffalo Food Bank want to thank everyone who supported the Servus Spring Food Drive, and a special thanks to our sponsors without whom this event would never get off the ground,” Said Executive Director of the Woof Buffalo Food Bank, Arianna Johnson. If you didn’t get the chance to help out this past weekend, the Food Bank is always looking for volunteers at their warehouse. They are open Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m.-8:30p.m. You can sign up online. #ymm|foodbank|RMWB Movie Trailers March 31, 2017 to April 6, 2017 Landmark 6, 10015 Manning Ave. PH:791-6610 Landmark Cinemas Landmark Cinemas Fort McMurray Weekend Listings: Beauty and the Beast (PG) 3D 10:00pm 12:00pm / 3:00pm / 3:45pm / 6:15pm / 7:00pm / 9:15pm Kong: Skull Island (PG) 10:30pm Goon: Last of the Enforcers (14A) 3:30pm / 6:45pm / 9:45pm Get Out (14A) 4:00pm / 7:15pm / 10:15pm Logan (18A) 3:15pm / 6:30pm / 9:30pm 660 NEWS CALGARY NATIONAL Immigration arrests at Mexican border continue to plummet Apr 04, 2017, 5:17 PM Brazil soap star Jose Mayer apologizes for sexual harassment Apr 04, 2017, 5:14 PM The top iPhone and iPad apps on App Store Apr 04, 2017, 4:57 PM The top 10 books on Apple’s iBooks-US Apr 04, 2017, 4:56 PM The top 10 audiobooks on Audible.com Apr 04, 2017, 4:54 PM Stephanie Seymour completes alcohol program; charges dropped Apr 04, 2017, 4:39 PM Trudeau expected to visit Juno Beach after Vimy Ridge commemoration Apr 04, 2017, 3:50 PM Police ask public to 'romaine calm' after $45K lettuce heist in Hamilton Apr 04, 2017, 3:26 PM Junos apologize for co-host Russell Peters' 'off-script' remarks about women Apr 04, 2017, 3:07 PM Liberal bill on security oversight committee of parliamentarians passes Apr 04, 2017, 2:37 PM The Tuesday news briefing: An at-a-glance survey of some top stories Apr 04, 2017, 2:34 PM What's the big spy scandal in Washington?

It's Your Birthday WHAT'S ON Watch NBC The Two Virginias' CW MeTV Two Virginias' Dub Request Form Tale of two cities: Grundy 40 years after the Flood of '77 Posted: Wednesday, April 5, 2017 1:35 AM EDT By Rick Douglas, Evening Anchor/ Content Manager BioEmail Connect Biography rdouglas@wvva.com (WVVA) - GRUNDY, VIRGINIA - In Grundy, the waters are restless. And it's been that way as long as anyone can remember. Longtimers will tell you the Levisa Fork River has flooded nine times since 1929, so dealing with such tragedies is in Grundy's DNA. P.L. Williams, a columnist for The Voice newspaper puts it succinctly. "Us old-timers will never forget." On April 4th, 1977, Grundy faced not just any flood, but one so destructive, it changed the town forever. Ron Coleman, a reporter for The Voice, remembers it all too vividly. "Damage," he says, "in every direction." "It was a frightening, terrifying experience. It really was," chimes in Williams. Ron says at the movie theater downtown, the ticket window was a powerful funnel for floodwaters that would cause the theater eventually to close--for good. The misery visited upon Grundy was largely an accident of geography. Old photos show the town right at a bend in the river. And a lot has disappeared over the years, but the destruction in 1977 was of a different caliber. Mary Belcher, who has worked at the Chamber of Commerce for 29 years, is wistful. "You do wish the old was back." The historic and grand Buchanan County Courthouse is still standing. Not a surprise since it was built of local stone and seems impenetrable. The Renaissance-revival style building was completed in 1906. Local historians say it was damaged by a fire in 1915 that gutted downtown Grundy and was rebuilt and expanded by 1917. Today, it is now protected by massive floodgates that bookend what's left of Grundy's original downtown. It looks like a lonely fortress, cut off from what you might call "The New Grundy." According to Ron Coleman, the two-cities aspect has the town of Grundy looking like no other. "If you notice this town looks like it's down in a rock quarry. Because three mountains have been shaved down to create some space." Decades after the massive flood, the Corps of Engineers cleared a 13-acre parcel of land across the river from what had been Main Street and prepared the way for a new town center. Today the anchor of Grundy's Town Center is an enormous, two-story Walmart, complete with escalator and a 500-car parking garage underneath. It stands as a symbol of a town that would like to see another flood, but this time of commerce, Says Mary Belcher, "We're going through a trend right now. Our law school... coming back strong. We've got a strong pharmacy school. We're fighting back. The flood wall and the widened Highway 460 are testimony to some impressive engineering. But it came at an impressive cost. "The Corps of Engineers and VDOT got together and completed a $200 million rebuild of this town," says Coleman. "But it took from 1977." So what advice do the people of Grundy have for West Virginians who saw heart-breaking flooding not quite a year ago? P.L. Williams offers some: "You just have to be, you can say tough. But resilient is the main thing. Just pick up the pieces, clean up and, you know, move on." Call it what you want. Divine guidance. Native wisdom. Magical thinking. Like the fog that dances in the treetops. Like the restless waters. Hope has found a home here. Mary Belcher says it best. "We're a strong community and we do come back. And West Virginia will, too."        NEWSMore>> Tale of two cities: Grundy 40 years after the Flood of '77 Tale of two cities: Grundy 40 years after the Flood of '77 Grundy, Virginia, is marking the 40th anniversary of a massive flood that changed the layout of the town, forever reinventing it as two cities.

The buyout discussions come just under a year after the Framingham chain shelved a $6.3 billion merger with rival Office Depot Inc., when a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the deal to allow a Federal Trade Commission review. Staples stocks closed at $9.51 yesterday, up 9.82 percent, after reaching $10. Staples is in early talks with a small number of potential private-equity bidders, The Wall Street Journal first reported. Staples, which had a market value of about $5.65 billion as of Monday, declined comment. Its shares have more than halved in three years. Going private could ease pressure on Staples as it continues a cost-cutting restructuring that includes a narrowed focus on North America after selling its U.K., Australian and New Zealand businesses, and all but 15 percent of its European operations. Staples has been targeting deliveries to businesses with 10 to 200 employees, and closing stores in the United States and Canada, where it has 1,559 locations. The No. 1 office supplies chain reported its fifth consecutive decline in annual sales, ending 2016 with a $459 million net loss. It’s been contending with a digitalized workforce and increasing competition from online retailers including Amazon Business and big-box chains such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. A private equity buyer would likely further slash Staples’ store base, said Susan Assadi, research director at Gimme Credit. “Although Staples carries little debt, its fixed obligations are considerable, and most of its free cash flow has been returned to shareholders, leaving little opportunity for credit profile improvement,” Assadi said.   More On: Staples Inc.

The combined company will be the market leader in pre-workout and BCAA-based categories with an unparalleled brand portfolio that includes Cellucor C4 and XTEND, among many others. Financial terms were not disclosed. Founded in 2004, Scivation is often-credited with inventing the intra-workout category through its XTEND-branded product line, which delivers high-quality BCAAs and electrolytes in deliciously-flavored powder mixes, helping users recover, rehydrate and build lean muscle. Scivation is highly complementary with Nutrabolt’s pre-workout and functional food offerings and will benefit from Nutrabolt’s well-established supply chain and global distribution channels.

We are confident that the XTEND brand has significant runway and can achieve even greater market penetration and an expanded assortment as part of our platform.” Mike Hockenberry, Scivation’s Chief Executive, said, “We are thrilled to be joining Nutrabolt and leveraging their global platform to strengthen and expand our business. Over the past 18 months, Scivation has been deeply focused on innovation, launching new line extensions such as XTEND GO, XTEND Perform and XTEND Free.

I am very proud of our team and the business we have built and look forward to our next phase of growth.” With a portfolio that now includes sports nutrition brands Cellucor, Royal Sport and Scivation and functional food brand FitJoy, Nutrabolt expects to further demonstrate its ability to execute on its vision of being a strong industry force.

With all 21 precincts reporting, Skillman had 1,083 votes to Ritter's 436 votes, according to unofficial results. Skillman is a lifelong resident of the village and worked at the fire department for nearly 30 years before retiring last year. He thinks the community needs a leader with a fresh perspective. He thanked voters in a Facebook post after his victory. He also thanked Ritter for his service. "It is my absolute honor to be the new president of the village I have called my home for the last 54 years," Skillman said. "Tonight, the new chapter begins in the history of Carpentersville." Ritter said the village has made great strides to improve its reputation, economy and residents' quality of life since he was first elected to the board as a trustee in 2005. Upon congratulating his new successor, he said he hopes Skillman serves as an "independent voice for the village." "I'd like to thank all the citizens for giving me 16 years to serve the village," Ritter said. Skillman said his goals include lowering taxes, improving efficiency in public safety departments and hiring a professional dedicated to human resources duties, such as leading union negotiations and serving as a liaison between staff members, management and elected officials.

(WKRN) – A tip in the AMBER Alert case called in to the Maury County Sheriff’s Office from a West Nashville hotel was deemed not credible. Maury County sheriff Bucky Rowland told News 2 the description of a possible Tad Cummins look-a-like didn’t match up. Sheriff Rowland confirmed the tip came into their dispatch center around 7:30 p.m. Someone called from the Best Western off White Bridge Pike at Interstate 40 saying someone looked like Cummins. (Photo: WKRN) Maury County authorities then called Metro-Nashville police, who responded to the hotel to look into the matter. Hotel employees told News 2 police checked the surveillance footage before deciding it wasn’t the AMBER Alert suspect. Cummins, 50, is accused of kidnapping one of his former students, 15-year-old Elizabeth Thomas, on March 13.

(Courtesy: TBI) Thomas is a 15-year-old white female, with hazel eyes, stands 5 feet tall and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, who stands 6 feet tall, weighs approximately 200 pounds, and has brown hair and eyes. He’s believed to be armed with two handguns. It remains unknown if they were still traveling in Cummins’ silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. Anyone with information on their whereabouts is urged to call 1-800-TBI-FIND.

Instead of a simplistic and punitive tax on carbon, Canada needs a food policy that addresses a broad swath of issues, including health care costs, environmental outcomes and economic prosperity. Bacon, who is chief executive officer of Pulse Canada, said a narrow focus on farm practices and greenhouse gases is the wrong approach. More attention should be paid to consumers. “Ingredient production (at the farm) is looking at only one variable. We also need to look at what people choose to eat and how the food they eat can be formulated and manufactured to reduce the (sector’s) contribution to greenhouse gas emissions,” said Bacon, who spoke March 30 to the standing Senate committee on agriculture and forestry, which is studying the impacts of climate change on agriculture. “We need to look at food solutions that are not only going to improve the health of the planet, but are also going to improve the health of the people.” The committee his holding hearings on farming and climate change because the federal government and provinces are hashing out policies around greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has told provinces to introduce a price for carbon or a cap and trade system by 2018. Otherwise, the feds will impose a price on carbon, starting at $10 a tonne of emissions in 2018 and rising to $50 a tonne by 2022. The government is hoping a carbon tax encourages farmers to innovate and produce food with fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Bacon was one of three industry representatives who addressed the Senate committee. Cereals Canada president Cam Dahl and Phil de Kemp of the Barley Council of Canada also spoke at the meeting. Dahl and de Kemp emphasized familiar talking points within the ag sector: • Other grain export countries and regions, such as Australia, the United States and Black Sea producers, don’t have a carbon tax, so Canadian farmers would be at a competitive disadvantage. • Canadian growers have and are taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through conversation tillage and precision use of crop inputs. ADVERTISMENT • Farmers should be compensated for carbon that they sequester in the soil. • A carbon tax would curb growth in the ag sector, damaging a key driver of Canada’s economy. Bacon mostly avoided those arguments. In his 50 minutes before the committee, he talked mostly about a food policy that is broader than penalizing methane from cows and nitrous oxide from the soil. “Carbon pricing does not address issues like growing health care costs associated with the rising rates of obesity and the related diseases,” he said. Instead, giving consumers tools to choose healthy and sustainable foods might make it possible to improve the health of Canadians, expand the economy and protect the environment. Canada’s Food Guide is one potential information tool. “The Swedish food guide says on page two, ‘what you eat isn’t just important to your own personal well-being, it’s important to the environment as well,’ ” Bacon said. “We can calculate the greenhouse gas reduction that could be achieved through food reformulation and dietary innovation, through sourcing from sustainable cropping systems in Canada and encouraging companies and consumers to make informed choices.” Industry leaders are already moving toward food that is healthy and sustainable. Companies such as Unilever, Walmart and PepsiCo have adopted sustainability protocols, in which they will buy only grain, oilseeds and other ingredients from farmers who use less fertilizer and emit fewer greenhouse gases. Yuen Pau Woo, a senator from B.C., challenged Bacon’s idea of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture through “moral suasion.” ADVERTISMENT Society and the environment would benefit if Canadians ate more peas, lentils and other healthy food that have minimal environmental impacts. However, a carbon tax could push consumers in that direction. “The price mechanism is the best way to get at changing consumer behaviour without making normative judgments about whether your meat diet is harming the planet,” Woo said. “If we can capture all the (costs) of carbon emissions in the supply chain and have it show up in the price, it’s more likely to influence consumers than anything else.” Bacon disagreed. He said taxation is a blunt instrument. If Canadians would make different choices if they knew how a certain food affected the environment. “I think we’re underestimating the ability of consumers to make informed (decisions),” he said. “And we’re underestimating the role of government to provide leadership in a food transformation.” Bacon said such a transformation could produce a new global brand for Canada, where the country is seen as the “healthy people, healthy planet food basket” for the world. The country should act swiftly on a food policy that targets health, environmental and economic outcomes because it is 20 years behind other western nations, he added. robert.arnason@producer.com ADVERTISMENT Popular articles Farmers overcharged nearly $100 million in CGC… Police warn about illegal left turns Survey reveals ‘amazing’ soil loss in Great… Grain bag slashing angers farmer Genesis plans huge fertilizer supercentre west of… About the author Robert Arnason — Winnipeg bureau Also by this author Glyphosate-free label unveiled in U.S. Pulse Canada CEO urges ‘food… Organic wheat dodges mycotoxin bufford54 “The impact of climate change on agriculture”, is nothing but conjecture and speculation. The impact of a Liberal federal government, combined with that of a socialist NDP provincial government, will be far more detrimental to the economy than air pollution. Happy Farmer Agree to your climate change comment. About the article. Of course the CEO of Pulse Canada would promote his industry to the government. It “seems to fit” todays social comments. Well, there used to be more pulses grown and then disease hit them so farmers were forced in other directions. Also, legumes are notorious for producing “gas” when digested. What we need is for the government to stay out of farming and food. The consumer and farmer are perfectly capable of sorting these issues out. But they won’t be worked out in “Social Media” circles. Forums are producing nothing but anger, resentment, unwillingness to see differently or to change. Need proof of the previous comment, I have said several times that when clear and concise evidence shows me a different way than I currently use I will change. I have asked others if they would be so willing, no answers to date. A carbon tax is just another tax, so it hurts each one of us. And while it may seem great for Canada to be seen as a leader in climate change, I just don’t see why we should be taxed for such a little overall world impact. (check out what Canada’s contribution worldwide is to greenhouse gases). And just for arguments sake I do have a solution for reducing Canada’s greenhouse gas emissions that will not cost 1 cent. It just not very popular to reduce maximum speed limits to 90 kmh. Harold Are you looking for evidence or are you waiting for evidence to drop on your lap. It is normal not to specifically target areas that would produce a funding cut or a profit loss so therefore this does prevent honorable clear intent and focus. This is absolutely being normal. This being said, I invite you to look at the documentary: the great global warming swindle. (you tube) If you think that you are capable of being brain-washed or won’t be forgiven for looking, then don’t. These Scientists will have nothing to say to you and you can continue to pay taxes and drive at 90 kmh. Susan Linkletter Pay carbon credits to farmers who sequester carbon in their soils and don’t pay anything to the ones who don’t. That is all you would need to do to encourage better farming practices and more nutritious food in the marketplace. Harold I recall watching the news when I was young and the scientists were then saying that carbon emissions were blocking the sun and if we didn’t reduce those carbon emissions we would go into an ice age. This fact was presented many times on TV. Had they collected carbon taxes back then they would have been proven correct; we would have warmed. Now they want a tax to prevent global warming and the TV and media are regularly presenting the fact and again blaming high emissions of carbon. Why do you believe that we should be paying any tax at all and especially when Canada produces only the smallest fraction of carbon emissions? China or any other country can up their production and totally erase all of what we have for years paid taxes on. One volcano eruption can do the same. Does this not scream to you that this is nothing more than a fraudulent tax grab? Notice that the scientists who are making the claim are unheard of, unnamed and untitled, and that they themselves are not communicating directly to the public. There also has been talk of imprisoning people for being climate change deniers. Banned thought; very scientific. Back some 50 years ago it would have taken about 20 years to expose the fraud and today it will take 20 years to expose this fraud. I can only think that the people back then were not as gullible as we are today because I heard the people around me saying let’s just see what the good lord provides. Apparently the good lord provided warming instead. I think that the scientists of that day were not amused. Documentary: the great global warming swindle. (you tube) Susan Linkletter Black carbon (soot) does cause global cooling. CO2 causes global warming, they are two different things. Black carbon that hangs above low-lying stratocumulus clouds stabilizes the layer of air on top of the clouds, promoting their growth. It just so happens that thick stratocumulus clouds are like shields, blocking incoming sunlight. As a result, black carbon ends up cooling the planet.

Apr 04, 2017 States need $100M more for Food Safety Modernization Act After the release of the preliminary 2018 budget proposal, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture drafted a letter to congressional budget leadership saying state governments need an additional $100 million a year for "sufficient funding" for implementation of the Food Safety Modernization Act. They need $40 million for produce safety programs, $20 million for preventive control programs for animal food and $40 million for preventive control programs for human food, they say in the letter. While the FDA wrote the rules, state agencies are the primary ones responsible for implementation and enforcement activities. Read more at Food Safety News...   Majority of EU countries vote against new GMO crops Only one GMO crop is grown in Europe (although others are approved for import as feed and food).

Opinion Columns How to axe the IRS: Switch to an elegant and fair value-added tax By Columns - April 4, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Ever notice the filing deadline for the U.S. income tax – April 15 – is about as far away from Election Day as possible? If the annual ordeal punctuated on Oct. 15, the frustration and outrage taxpaying citizens feel would translate into a voter revolt and finally compel politicians to deliver a simpler and fairer system. The personal and corporate taxes levy terribly high marginal rates, offer a myriad of special-interest credits and deductions, require expensive recordkeeping and impose complex auditing functions at the Internal Revenue Service that have proven susceptible to political abuse. Americans believe it favors the very wealthy and big businesses, who can afford high-dollar lobbyists and big campaign contributions. It does encourage businesses of all sizes to often make decisions based on tax considerations instead of sound economics. Foreign governments rely more on value-added taxes, which approximate national sales taxes. In compliance with World Trade Organization rules, those are rebated on exports and applied to imports. Income taxes are not, placing U.S. businesses at a cost disadvantage. The most comprehensive tax reform would be to replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a VAT. The Treasury annually collects about $2 trillion through personal and corporate taxes. This could be replaced by an 11 percent national sales tax on all private purchases and payments – be they computer equipment, college tuition or lunch at the corner deli. Businesses and institutions would pay the taxes they collect less the taxes they pay on materials and equipment, rent and the like. This subtraction would avoid the double taxation on goods and services purchased and effectively create a VAT. It would end the headaches associated with valuing inventories, calculating depreciation on buildings and machines and much other work that cost billions in accounting and legal fees. A VAT would favor no activity over another, and mostly end the problem of U.S. firms parking profits abroad to avoid U.S. taxes. Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady proposes to do essentially this for the corporate income tax. His plan would eliminate credits and deductions and lower the maximum corporate rate from 35 percent to 20 percent, which would be refunded on exports and applied to imports. This plan faces a lot of undeserved opposition from retailers who say it would raise prices 20 percent on imported goods and make them less competitive, but that’s nonsense. First, it would be levied on the import value of the goods – that excludes any domestic logistics costs and wholesale and retail markups. Second, as all retailers would be paying the same tax on imports, Wal-Mart and Target would have the same costs as other brick-and-mortar and internet vendors. Moreover, by removing the disincentive to manufacture in the United States created by foreign reliance on VATs, it would create new competition from new U.S. suppliers of toasters and cell phones–who would now be aided by more automated production process then when their manufacturing was relocated to China. The Brady Plan still has two flaws. It would continue the myriad of filing headaches and inequities most ordinary Americans endure paying personal income taxes, and many businesses are limited liability corporations and pay through the personal income tax system. They would face even greater disadvantages by paying rates up to 39.6 percent and not enjoying rebates on exports. The logical option is to generalize Brady’s reforms to include the personal income tax as well. Junk it and impose a VAT of 11 percent on all economic activities. Two problems would remain. A VAT would tax rich and poor consumers at the same rate. The elderly, who more or less live on savings, have already paid income taxes on those savings and would be taxed again. An effective response would be to raise the rate to 14 percent, and award each parent $4,000 for each child under 21 and to seniors 65 and older. Taking things a step further, the Social Security and Medicare taxes could be eliminated by raising the rate to 20 percent. Temptations would abound to exclude or exempt all kinds of activities, but that would do more to appease big corporate contributors and the wealthy than to serve the public interest. That is the kind of thinking that gave us the current mess – and inequities, slow growth and mindless harassment from the IRS. Elegant, egalitarian and efficient, a value-added tax without exemptions would permit the economy to grow faster and create more jobs.

DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Consumer Products are spending April celebrating their popular DC Super Hero Girls property with a month of special online programming aimed at younger readers across multiple platforms titled DC Kids Super Hero Month. The initiative, announced over the weekend via the DC Kids YouTube channel, will feature new content across the official DC Super Hero Girls website, social media channels and app, as well as new episodes of DC Kids and on DCKids.com, and social channels dedicated to both the Justice League Action and Teen Titans Go! animated series. Part of the monthlong program centers around weekly "Super Hero Training Camp" exercises, intended to help kids reach their best potential by using DC's superhero characters as inspirations with lessons centering on the value of friendship, kindness and creativity, amongst other attributes. (Batman, in particular, is very big on friendship and kindness.) Beyond the online component, DC Kids Super Hero Month will also be supported by merchandising partners including Target, Toys'R'Us, Walmart and Amazon, with Mattel, the Lego Group and other manufacturers also participating in the promotion. Additionally, a DC Kids Super Hero Month sweepstakes will run throughout April, offering fans a chance to win DC Super Hero Girls, Justice League Action and Teen Titans Go! merchandise, with runner-up prizes of smaller merchandise collections. DC Super Hero Girls launched as a multimedia property in 2015, with web-based animation and related action figures and merchandise. Subsequent releases have included best-selling graphic novels from DC, a direct-to-home full-length movie release and a series of prose novels from Random House. Mattel's action figure assortment won the Toy Industry Association's Action Figure Toy of the Year honors in February.

(Photo: Evan Vucci, AP) 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE President Trump’s attention has shifted to trade once again. During the presidential race, Trump talked tough on China, suggesting the country pushed down the value of its currency to help exporters and criticized trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as bad for the U.S. Since then, Trump's tone has softened and the president is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday. The two men are expected to spend much of their time discussing trade. Related:  Cracking down on trade: New Trump orders will target trade deficit U.S.-China trade scorecard: advantage China China is currently the largest trading partner with the U.S., with about $600 billion in goods going back and forth between the two countries last year. Much of it is tilted in favor of China, which sells about $462.8 billion of its goods in the U.S. Meanwhile, American goods sold in China amounted to only $115.8 billion. The U.S. currently doesn't have a free trade deal with China. But the countries operate under the terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which regulates trades among more than 160 countries worldwide. And Trump has said that he will seek more direct negotiations with China to open more of its domestic market for American companies and may even consider a tax on imports. "The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits..and job losses. American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives," he tweeted last week. The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits...— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 30, 2017 A look at what trade deals are and why they matter to Americans: Q: What are trade deals? A trade deal is an agreement between countries that determines how goods and services flow across international borders. They may include import taxes, product quotas, environmental standards, work and labor conditions, and guidelines for settling disputes. They are designed to lower barriers, such as high taxes, so the countries involved can export more products to each other at reasonable prices. There are more than 430 active trade treaties worldwide, according to the WTO. Q: Why are trade deals used? The idea is to make it easier for companies to do business across borders. For example, a U.S. motorcycle manufacturer may find that it’s paying a particular tax rate for its products and filling out numerous forms in Country "X," while paying another rate in neighboring Country "Y." If the U.S. and these countries can agree on a tax rate and standardize paperwork, it would encourage the motorcycle maker to sell more aggressively in these countries. Theoretically, the treaty would then encourage motorcycle makers in these countries to be more competitive, work more efficiently and possibly even lower prices. Trade agreements also aim to encourage companies to play fair, pay proper taxes and abide by appropriate labor conditions and local laws. Q: How do trade deals affect my budget and access to goods? Trade deals are often designed to ease access to markets. For consumers, that can mean access to a greater variety of products and lower prices due to increased competition. When goods are imported from China, for instance, American shoppers can benefit. The effect plays out at places like Walmart stores, whose low prices help keep a few more dollars in shoppers' pockets. And those fresh strawberries in the produce section of your local supermarket in the winter, they probably were flown in from or shipped from, overseas as a result of a trade pact. Q: Why are some deals controversial? Rising imports puts pressure on U.S. companies to be more competitive, and they respond in a variety of ways. Some companies cut jobs and business units to be leaner or to make up for lost revenue. Workers also may lose jobs when their employers take advantage of a trade deal that allows them to open new factories abroad with cheaper workers. The U.S. has lost about 5 million manufacturing jobs since 2000, according to government data. Trump has criticized American companies for taking advantage of NAFTA by outsourcing their manufacturing functions to factories in Mexico and buying from suppliers there. While some trade deals have led to Americans losing jobs, other factors, such as automation have also contributed to companies needing fewer workers. And the jobs that are lost are the ones that often don’t require a college degree. Workers without a college degree make up more than two-thirds of the U.S. labor force, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Q. How can trade deals help the U.S. economy?  Most economists agree that trade deals help make the international economy run and open more markets abroad for American companies to sell to new customers. Many countries impose trade restrictions that are more stringent than the U.S., which make it difficult for American companies to set up shops and sell to customers in these foreign markets.But trade deals help U.S. companies chip away at these restrictions, including high taxes and other barriers, says Nikia Clarke, executive director at World Trade Center San Diego. “Firms that would benefit the most from that is small and medium-size companies,” she says. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2nUD7zL

Last week, Chinese news service Caixin reported that the deal was being held up because of two problems: tighter currency restrictions inside China and LeEco’s well-publicized cash crunch. Today, Bloomberg followed up by revealing that LeEco may be looking into potential contingency plans if the original goal — a full $2 billion acquisition of Vizio — fails to materialize. “LeEco is now exploring other options, including taking a minority stake in or partnering with Vizio,” the report said. When contacted by The Verge for an update last week, Vizio spokesperson Katie Kotarek did not respond. Last summer, both companies were hopeful that the deal would successfully close by the fourth quarter. In December, LeEco told Recode that US regulators had signed off on everything, but the same wasn’t true of Chinese authorities. “We are awaiting regulatory approval in China,” a spokesperson said at the time. Buying Vizio was seen as a way for LeEco to fast-track its way into US living rooms; LeEco sells unlocked smartphones in the United States as well as its own televisions, but Vizio’s sets are very successful and big sellers at Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and other retailers. Related What is LeEco, and why is it buying Vizio? In February, just after the FTC announced a $2.2 million settlement with Vizio over the company’s collection of customer viewing data, LeEco again pushed the message that all was well despite the delays. “LeEco is committed to the Vizio deal and it is priority for us, the process is on the right track, please stay tuned,” the company told TechCrunch. But word that LeEco is now exploring other scenarios with privately-held Vizio suggests that everything is not on the right track. The question now is whether it’s due to China’s restrictions around overseas-bound capital or LeEco’s finances and a regret to spend so much in the first place. The Verge has again reached out to Vizio and LeEco for comment.

As long as black people are permanent victims of relentless white racism, cops should not chase them, juries should not convict them, judges should not sentence them, schools should not punish them, and white victims should not complain about the black crime and violence so wildly out of proportion.  This is what a growing number of lawmakers, professors and, of course, reporters are prescribing as a way to “improve the way our system serves justice.” The latest came on NPR a few days ago when Georgetown Law professor and former federal prosecutor Paul Butler broke it down for the racially unenlightened: “If you go to criminal court in D.C., you would think that white people don’t commit crimes,” Butler said. “White people don’t use drugs, they don’t get into fights, they don’t steal, because all you see are African American people.” Before you pack your child off to Georgetown Law school -- or if you usually do not believe something too ridiculous to be true -- you might want to hear the distinguished professor wax at length on this video: Racial Jury Nullification at Georgetown Law. One group of “African American people” Butler will never see in a D.C. court are the black people who beat the white husband of an NPR executive into a bloody, broken mess on the D.C. Metro line. You can find the details here from my account at the American Thinker, but not from NPR, which never covered it. NPR Another Victim of Black Violence and Denial. Neither will Butler find the black people who attacked the NPR producer from Kentucky, in D.C. on company business. You can find the details of that in the scintillating best seller Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry. But not on NPR. And yes, professor, black criminality is just as wildly out of proportion in Washington as it is in the rest of country. Even more so. Butler says there are two justice systems in America, one for white people and one for black. He proposes to correct this inequity with a system of racial jury nullification to promote the new entitlement of black criminality: “I encourage any juror who thinks the police or prosecutors have crossed the line in a particular case to refuse to convict.” To make his case, Butler trotted out some information from the National Institute of Health which he says proves that black people and white people use drugs in the same amount, but black people are arrested and convicted many times more than their drug-using white counterparts. QED: Courtroom racism is rampant and if you do not see that, well, you know what that makes you. That is part of the greatest lie of our generation and here is why. The National Institute of Health -- and everyone else who repeats that bogus claim -- are using info gathered from the Census Bureau: Instead of filling out a questionnaire, sometimes the Census Bureau will go into a home and ask the occupants a series of other questions, including if they use illegal drugs. When they do, black and white people basically give the same answers in the same amounts. That is called self-reporting and it boils down to this: can we depend on drug users to tell the truth about their drug use? Short answer: No. Long answer, when you actually test people, doctors find there are two determinants of whether the person was actually telling the truth about their drug use: One, were they recently released from prison? Two, are they black? Yes, they actually say that. Here’s a summary of a few of the peer-reviewed studies from the scintillating best seller Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry: Some doctors down at Johns Hopkins University actually found out what happens when you test the reliability of self-reporting of marijuana and other drug use among black people. A study of 290 African American men in Baltimore, Maryland undergoing treatment for hypertension showed that self-reporting of illicit drug use is unreliable. Only 48 of the participants reported drug use but urine drug tests revealed that 131 had used drugs. With self-reporting, drug use among black people was 16 percent. With testing, 45 percent. Ooops. There’s more. Different study. Different journal.  According to the medical journal Addictive Behaviors, “underreporting of cocaine was documented with urine testing validation as well where African Americans in comparison to Caucasians who were urine positive were about 6 times less likely to report cocaine use when other factors are controlled for.”  Translation: When you ask, white people and black people report using cocaine in about the same amount. But when you test, black people are six times more likely to use cocaine. And lie about it.  More from the same journal for you science junkies: “The present study also identified predictors of discrepancies between self-report and hair testing. Race was the most salient predictor of cocaine disagreement.” “Even when other factors were controlled for, the self-report and hair test results for African Americans were more discrepant than for non-African Americans, a finding consistent with past studies (Fendrich, et al., 1999; Feucht, Stephens, & Walker, 1994).” “In a large study of youth (9 − 20), underreporting of cocaine was documented with urine testing validation as well (Fendrich & Yanchun, 1994) where African Americans in comparison to Caucasians who were urine positive were about 6 times less likely to report cocaine use when other factors are controlled for.” This is hardly new: ask a cop what happens when they pull over a black person for anything from a routine traffic stop to investigating a murder. ’99 percent tell us we are only doing that because they are black,’ said dozens and dozens of active and retired cops to me over the last five years. What Butler wants, many cities already have: they are called Bronx juries -- where black people tend not to convict black defendants. Even Hollywood uber-liberal David Simon had to acknowledge that in his 2013 book: The effect of race on the judicial system is freely acknowledged by prosecutors and defense attorneys-black and white alike -- although the issue is rarely raised directly in court. Race is instead a tacit presence that accompanies almost every panel of twelve into a Baltimore jury room.  Once, in a rare display, a black defense attorney actually pointed to her own forearm while giving closing arguments to an all-black panel: “Brothers and sisters,” she said, as two white detectives went out of their minds in the back row of the gallery,“ I think we all know what this case is about.” In a Cleveland nail salon, a black customer was raging in and out of the store when confronted with the manager who restrained her, then fought with her until the police arrived. “You can’t do this to me,” she said in a viral video. “I’m black… And besides, you are white and you don’t know shit.” A few days later a few dozen protestors gathered to remind reporters that putting your hands on a black woman for any reason is illegal. Even if she is trying to steal from you. in Philadelphia, the NAACP is demanding the district attorney prosecute an Asian business owner after chasing and shooting a black robber with a knife -- and the businessman’s money. The NAACP joined hundreds of parents and groups around the country who wonder why people with guns have to defend themselves against black people with bad intentions? Like the sister who said her brother should not have been shot during a home invasion robbery because “where else is he going to get his money?” Or the parents who criticized the Pizza Hut employee for shooting their son while he was trying to rob them. After all, it wasn't their money and didn’t insurance cover it? So why did their son have to die just for committing an armed robbery? Crime is the new black entitlement. Down in Jackson, Mississippi, a black city councilman said the black leaders of that city should encourage black people to “throw rocks and bricks and bottles” at police if they chase black criminals into their town. “That will send a message we don’t want you in here.” The councilman would also like the taxpayers of Jackson to pay for any loot that a black citizen may have stolen. Thus removing any other need for police to chase the “babies” in that city after they commit a crime. And no: I would not expect you to believe it without seeing him say it here: Video: Crime Is The New Black Entitlement. Next stop, Madison, Wisconsin: a black pastor who was a top official at the University of Wisconsin and who now sits on the bench as a judge, echoed the councilman about arresting black criminals: “I just dont think they should be prosecuting cases of people who steal from Wal-Mart,” said Dane County Judge Everett Mitchell. “I dont think Target -- or all those other big box places that have insurance -- should be using that as justification to use aggressive police practices.” “They do that all the time to justify why they are going to over police our children,” said the judge. The over-policing thing was a hot topic on the Democrat presidential campaign trail last year. Berry and Hillary each tried to outdo the other with the sympathy for the plight of the black criminal: Hillary talked about why more black people are in prison than white people “for no good reason.” And Bernie loved talking about the racist over-policing of black people as well. “What we have to do is end over-policing in African-American neighborhoods,” Bernie said during the Democrat debate in Milwaukee. “The reality is that both the African American community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates. Reality is four time as many blacks get arrested for marijuana.” There’s that big lie again. And there are the thousands of reporters and public officials eager to repeat it with enthusiasm, without a trace of truth. Let’s head over to Philadelphia to hear from Judge Wayne Bennett, who writes a blog called the "Field Negro." Bennett had just read one of the columns from the Great Thomas Sowell where he talked about the modest contributions of your humble correspondent to the field of black criminality and journalistic denial. Sowell wanted to know how crime as the new black entitlement could happen. Bennett supplied a popular rationale: White people deserve it.  “No matter how violent young black punks are towards white people, it will never make up for all the violence against people of color throughout this nation’s history.” This judge could have been channeling the former President of the United States and thousands of those who worked for him and made black on white racial hostility mainstream. One of the most active fronts in this fight for crime as the new black entitlement are the schools. For eight years, the Obama administration warned school officials throughout the country that there is no reason to believe there is any difference between white and black children when it comes to behavior and grades. So any difference in discipline and academic performance can be the result of one cause only: White racism.  That caused schools around the country to stop calling police for criminal offenses such as drug use and assault. And replace it with “restorative justice,” which involves lots of talking and lots of promises to never do it again. In New York City, the mayor last week ordered city schools to “stop documenting” what school officials calls minor crimes such as drugs and other misconduct. The reason is known to every teacher and administrator in America: Black students are victims of white racism in the classroom that causes teachers to pick on them for no reason whatsoever. Thus resulting in lower grades and more suspensions. No more. The list of public officials calling to make crime the new black entitlement is long and growing. Out in Kansas City, they liked their mayor Emmanual Cleaver so much they named a freeway after him. Now he’s a congressman where he serves as an enthusiastic member of the Black Caucus: every member of that caucus at one time or another has agreed: Black people and white people commit the same amount of crime, but the only reason black people are arrested more often is because of too many police in black neighborhoods. ‘Take the police out of black neighborhoods and put them in white neighborhoods and you would have the same amount of crime,’ they say, over and over and over. In Kansas City, large groups of black people descend dozens of times a year on that town’s entertainment district called the Country Club Plaza. There they cause violence and mayhem and property destruction with predictable regularity. On one of Cleaver’s visits to his hometown, Cleaver told a local reporter he did not support curfews to outlaw the large scale black mob violence at the Plaza, because “all that would do is make a lot of black kids angry.” Colin Flaherty is the author of the #1 Amazon Bestseller Don’t Make the Black Kids Angry.
