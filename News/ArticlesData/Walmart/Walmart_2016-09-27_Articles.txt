Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 28, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is flush with cash thanks to a portfolio reboot that's involved selling off a few valuable brands, including Duracell batteries and Coty beauty products. Yet weak operating trends have produced two consecutive years of disappointing dividend raises for income investors. The consumer products giant boosted its payout by 3% last year and by just 1% in 2016. So today I'm looking at Target (NYSE:TGT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ): Three stocks that investors might prefer over P&G right now. Here's how the dividends stack up against each other. Dividend comparison Metric Procter & Gamble Target Coca-Cola Johnson & Johnson Yield 3% 3.5% 3% 2.7% Last raise 1% 7% 6% 7% Payout ratio 76% 44% 77% 57% Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Capital IQ data. Last raise is the most recent percent change in the dividend. Target for the yield Target's stock is out of favor right now in part due to a slowdown in the retailing industry. Yet the company has stumbled enough to separate itself from peers -- and not in a good way. Customer traffic dropped last quarter, even as Wal-Mart's rose. And Target's comparable-store sales are negative at the same time that grocery competitor Kroger has pushed its growth streak past 50 straight quarters. Investors have punished the stock for those missteps: Target is now valued at less than 13 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 for both Kroger and Wal-Mart. Investors who believe the retailer will recover from this recent slump, as it has many times in its near 50-year history, might be enticed by that discount -- especially considering that Target boasts a market-beating 3.5% dividend yield, a low payout ratio, and a strong track record for recent dividend increases. Coca-Cola for the profits Like P&G, Coca-Cola is making a major structural change that it hopes will produce a leaner, more profitable, and faster-growing enterprise. Rather than sell off parts of its portfolio, though, the beverage giant is refranchising a large portion of its bottlers. Coke is aiming to produce a turnaround in the disappointing operating trends that drove volume growth of just 1% through the first two quarters of 2016. CEO Muhtar Kent and his team have identified several levers that the company can pull to achieve that goal, including focusing on emerging markets like China and India while investing heavily in non-soda brands like waters and juices. Its hefty dividend, meanwhile, should continue climbing at a steady pace as the refranchising initiative boosts profitability. Johnson & Johnson for innovation Johnson & Johnson may not pay as meaty a yield as P&G right now (2.7% vs. 3%), but that's partly because the stock is up so sharply. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years including dividend reinvestments, compared to a market-lagging 71% rise for P&G. JNJ Total Return Price data by YCharts. Its dividend growth rate is impressive, too: J&J's payout has improved at a 7% compound annual rate over the last five years and by nearly 9% over the past decade. Yet one of the best reasons to like J&J over Procter & Gamble is that, while both companies admit that innovation is critical to their entire business model, only one has demonstrated consistent success at it. Johnson & Johnson dedicates $9 billion to research and development each year and investors see the fruits of that spending: Roughly 25% of sales last year came from products that J&J introduced in just the past five years. In contrast, P&G hasn't launched a new $1 billion product in over a decade. Procter & Gamble pays one of the most dependable dividends on the market, raising it for 60 consecutive years. As impressive as that streak is, however, the latest hike was for less than $0.01 per share. Income investors have plenty of options for stronger dividend growth than that.

One of the sources said the US retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against US rival Amazon.com Inc, which has been expanding rapidly in a market that Bank of America Merrill Lynch has forecast will surge to $220 billion in value of goods sold by 2025 from about $11 billion last year. Wal-Mart operates 21 wholesale stores in the South Asian country, but is discouraged from setting up its own bricks-and-mortar shops by rules that limit foreign ownership for multi-brand retailers to 51 percent and the cost of setting up shops in a country as large as India. For Flipkart, a cash infusion from Wal-Mart would come in handy at a time when funding from traditional investors into the online space such as venture capital is proving harder to obtain amid worries about valuations in India. "India does not lend itself to big box retail since rentals are very very expensive. So the road ahead is either a Flipkart or an Amazon," said Kashyap Chanchani, managing partner of the Rainmaker Group, a Mumbai-based tech and digital media investment banking firm. "Which is why it is natural for Wal-Mart to look at Flipkart as they cannot acquire Amazon." The sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. CUT-THROAT COMPETITION Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Its current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. A Wal-Mart bet on Flipkart would come at a time when Amazon is planning an aggressive expansion into India. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of the online retailer, said in June it would invest an additional $3 billion in India after investing $2 billion already, and has recently rolled out its Prime membership service in the country. Bank of America estimated Amazon could increase its market share to 37 percent by 2019 from 31 percent now, approaching the 44 percent held currently by Flipkart. But concerns about profits continue to weigh on the sector, as severe competition is forcing the online retailers to resort to heavy discounts while they also need to invest in infrastructure such as warehouse centres. Indian brokerage Kotak estimated Flipkart, Amazon and smaller rival Snapdeal lost a combined 50 billion rupees ($751.46 million) in the year ended in March 2015. The online retailers do not disclose financial data but analysts say losses likely have increased since then. Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc, down from as much as $15 billion earlier this year. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com Inc, giving the US firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

 Walmart might invest a billion dollars into one of Amazon's biggest rivals Avery Hartmans Sep. 28, 2016, 9:32 AM 5,388 facebook linkedin twitter email print Joe Raedle/Getty Images Walmart is fighting back against Amazon's e-commerce dominance — and it's enlisting help from the startup world to do it.  The retail giant is reportedly in talks to invest up to $1 billion in Flipkart, India's largest online retailer, according to a new report from Bloomberg's Saritha Rai. Flipkart, which is valued around $15 billion , sells everything ranging from electronics to apparel to housewares online. In January, the company was rumored to be planning an IPO, but by March, investors had lowered their valuations of the company. This isn't the first time Walmart has spent billions to gain market share online. Less than two months ago, the company spent $3 billion to buy Jet.com, a New Jersey-based e-commerce startup that had positioned itself as a rival to Amazon. The deal was meant to help boost Walmart's online business, which has struggled to gain much traction against Amazon, the leader in online retail. Walmart has generated about $14 billion in annual e-commerce sales, compared with Amazon's $99 billion in annual revenue. Now, the investment in Flipkart could go a long way toward helping both companies gain a foothold against Amazon. An investment from Walmart would not only go a long way toward helping Flipkart fight Amazon in India, but would help Walmart fight Amazon on its home turf. Flipkart is facing mounting competition in India from Amazon. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in June that the company plans to invest another $3 billion in the country, adding to the $2 billion investment the company made in 2014.

Police arrested John Bean, the 46-year-old principal of Highcrest Elementary School, on Saturday and Supt. Michael Emmett said he has been placed on administrative leave during the ongoing investigation.  New York Boy Who Offered Home to Refugee Meets President Obama Police responded to the Wal-Mart on Flatbush Avenue just after 1 p.m. on Saturday and store staff members said Bean was following children in the store and “attempting to surreptitiously photograph them,” especially when they were not with their parents, the incident report says.  One witness said the children were girls between 6 and 8 years old and Wal-Mart staff members said Bean, who has three children of his own, was holding a small toy and using it to hide his iPhone.  The police officer who responded to the scene asked Bean what he was doing and he responded that he was shopping, but he did not have a shopping cart, according to police. When the officer asked Bean if he’d been taking photos and following children, Bean diverted his eyes, tried to walk away as police said they were detaining him and he tried to resist arrest, according to the incident report.

Authorities seized the SIM card and send the phone to a lab to check what's on it. VideoKanye West at Concert: 'I Would Have Voted for Trump' Police also reviewed surveillance from the store and said it appeared Bean was looking more at the aisles and people than the store merchandise. The principal was charged with interfering with an officer for resisting arrest and second-degree breach of peace, according to police.  UpdatedMissing Congressman's Son Found Safe Police said they immediately notified the Wethersfield Police Chief, as well as security for the Wethersfield Board of Education when they started to investigate and the board of education took immediate action. "I placed John Bean on administrative leave, effective September 26, 2016," Emmett said of the arrest. "It would not be appropriate for me to comment regarding the circumstances leading to Mr. Bean’s arrest, as the matter remains under investigation."

Some do try to escape on foot, as happened last week at the Kearny Walmart, but this particular suspect took a shopping cart along with him. Needless to say, he did not get far. Shortly after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Sept. 20, Officer Michael Alvarez responded to the report of the man heading west on Harrison Ave., pushing a Walmart cart full of stolen merchandise. Cart and suspect were spotted at Harrison and Sanford Aves., just a couple of blocks from the store. When Alvarez ordered him to stop, police said he abandoned the cart and began to run. A foot pursuit ensued and ended with the man reportedly seeking refuge underneath a parked car. (Note to the flight-prone: This is not an intelligent move.) By then, backup had arrived, and Brian Blozen, 41, of Bloomfield, was taken into custody on charges of shoplifting and resisting arrest. Police said the cart contained $728 worth of assorted stolen goods. The cart itself was also listed as a purloined item. (Note to otherwise law-abiding shoppers: If you take a cart off store property, you are technically a shoplifter.)  ••• Other recent reports from the Kearny police blotter included the following: Sept. 16 Officer Jordenson Jean was on radar enforcement detail on Harrison Ave. at the N.J. Turnpike at 4 p.m. when the driver of a 2011 Jaguar stopped — reportedly in the middle of the right lane, thereby blocking traffic — to ask him for directions to Newark Airport. Police said Jean “quickly realized that the man was already flying” and during questioning he admitted to having had a few vodkas prior to driving up from Washington, D.C. Following field sobriety tests, and an Alcotest at headquarters, Paul Freed, 71, of Fort Lee, was charged with DUI, careless driving and delaying traffic. Sept. 17 At 5 a.m., Officers Dominic Dominguez and Dave Bush responded to a male-female dispute in the area of Town Hall Park. While they were attempting to gain information from the disputants, the male party — Julian Quiroz, 24, of Elizabeth — reportedly became uncooperative and tried to walk away. At that point, police said, Jonathan Fair, 39, of New Providence, confronted Quiroz and accused him of having assaulted the female. A fistfight ensued. The officers ordered the men to cease and desist, and when these commands were ignored, tried to separate the combatants. Ultimately, police said, OC spray had to be used to subdue the duo, both of whom were charged with simple assault and resisting arrest. ••• Shortly after 10 a.m., Officer John Donovan responded to a report from a concerned citizen who had just witnessed the theft of a package from a residence on the 200 block of Forest St. The culprits fled in a silver Toyota, which was soon spotted and stopped by Officer Alan Stickno at Forest and Quincy Ave. Police said the witness identified the occupants, who admitted to taking the package after seeing it being dropped off by a FedEx truck. “The truck had no sooner pulled away than the theft occurred,” a police spokesman noted. Both the wheelman, Dominic Yorke, 24, of Newark, and his companion, James Bradford, 24, of Newark, were charged with conspiracy and receiving stolen property. Bradford, who reportedly was the one who actually grabbed the package, was also charged with theft. And what was the prized merchandise?  Denims. ••• Officer Derek Hemphill responded to an 8:30 p.m. alert from Kmart that a man had attempted to steal condoms from the store and, when confronted, fled on foot. Police said that, while Kmart did not have an off-duty KPD officer working security, both nearby ShopRite and B.J.’s did, and those officers —  P.O. Esteban Gonzalez at B.J.’s, and Sgt. Michael Gonzalez at ShopRite — heard Hemphill’s BOLO and the suspect was nabbed in the B.J.’s lot following a foot pursuit. Police said the man identified himself as Tjon White, but a search incident to arrest produced some paperwork from the Irvington PD indicating that might not be his real name. Hemphill contacted Irvington and a photo of the suspect proved he was actually Troy Johnson, 48, of Newark, police said. A records check showed he also had a $250 warrant for a prior shoplifting arrest in Kearny. Johnson ended up in the Hudson County Jail on a new charge of shoplifting ($123 worth of condoms), resisting arrest and hindering apprehension. Kearny Municipal Court Judge Thomas D. McKeon added another $5,000 to the $250 bail. Sept. 19 Officer Hemphill was on patrol  at 5 p.m. when his computer alerted him that the owner of a 1993 Toyota on the 500 block of Forest St. had a suspended license and three motor vehicle warrants — two from Newark, $350 each; one from Florence, N.J., $380.  Jesus Battista, 20, of Newark, was charged on those and with the license offense, misuse of license plates and operating an unregistered and uninsured vehicle. The other jurisdictions were notified. ••• Shortly after 10 p.m., Officer Esteban Gonzalez pulled over an Illinois-registered Toyota for disregarding a red light at Kearny and Midland Aves. Driver Evgeny Maximkin, 30, of Kearny, received a summons for that offense and was also arrested — on a $448 MV warrant out of Rutherford, which was notified that he was in custody. Sept. 20 Officers Rich Poplaski and Tom Floyd executed an arrest warrant at 4:30 p.m. at a residence on the 100 block of Hoyt St., where they reportedly found the suspect — an alleged bail-jumper wanted by the Middlesex  County Court — hiding in a closet. Police said Clark Yanez, 27, of Kearny, was also found to have no-bail robbery warrant from the Hudson County Sheriff’s Office and was sent to the Hudson County Jail. Sept. 21 Officers Michael Gontarczuk and Sean Podolski, on patrol in South Kearny at 9 p.m., stopped a 1999 Audi with heavily tinted windows and a “decrepit” temporary plate — its expiration date obscured — travelling east on the Belleville Pike.  Police said driver Lordwins Barthelemy, 29, of West Orange, had a suspended license and, in plain view in the car, the officers saw a partially smoked marijuana cigar. A search incident to arrest reportedly produced a plastic bag of suspected pot, and a warrant check revealed two: $750, Union Township, driving while suspended; $500, Belleville, traffic violation. Barthelemy was charged in Kearny with: possession of pot and paraphernalia; driving while in possession of a CDS; having fictitious registration, and operating an unregistered and uninsured vehicle, along with the suspended-license and tinted-windows violations.  McKeon added $2,500 to his bail.  Sept. 22 Officer Hemphill was investigating a 1 a.m. noise complaint on the 100 block of Forest St. when he saw Kevin Demauro, 23, of Kearny, park a 2014 Ford and then stumble out of the vehicle. When the officer asked him if he was okay (he could have had pneumonia, right?),  Demauro had trouble talking and was observed clenching a small bag that appeared to contain pills, police said. Following FSTs, he was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, possession of Xanax and drug paraphernalia and possession of a CDS in a MV. ••• At 12:30 p.m., a Vice detective, reportedly aware that its driver — Glenn Yakabofski, 44, of Kearny — was in possession of a CDS, stopped a 2002 Toyota at Devon St and Garfield Ave. When Yakabofski got out, he allegedly attempted to discard a glass vial of suspected cocaine under the car. Advised that he was under arrest, he shoved the detective, refused to be cuffed and had to be taken to the ground, at which point he tried to discard a second vial, police said. Patrol units arrived as backup, and Yakabofski was arrested for possession of coke and paraphernalia, possession of a CDS in a MV, aggravated assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. Kearny EMS was summoned to HQ to attend to cuts and scrapes the suspect sustained in the struggle.

Local Submit Event Search « Hero: Townville Firefighter Jamie Brock Stops School Shooter | Main | Rising Pension Costs Hurt State, Employees » Wednesday Sep282016 Report: 50 of Americans Check Amazon When Shopping Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:52AM More than half of U.S. online consumers begin their product searches on Amazon.com's website or mobile app, a survey found. That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. "Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers," said Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach. "Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices." The survey results are bad news for Wal-Mart and other retailers trying to make headway against Amazon in online shopping. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 13 percent to $385 billion this year, according to eMarketer. Wal-Mart last month agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion, its biggest attempt yet to catch up. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company's $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership. "Amazon keeps adding layers and is innovating at a faster pace than everyone, especially with Prime," Blackledge said. "Prime members have the Amazon app on the front screen of their smartphones. That definitely hurts Wal-Mart." Alphabet Inc., owner of the Google search engine, can withstand the pressure from Amazon because its advertising revenue is diversified, including video ads on streaming site YouTube, said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service. "This trend has been taking place for the past four or five years and it has still not hurt Google search," he said.

One of the sources said the U.S. retailer was looking to invest between $750 million and $1 billion in Flipkart, but the final value and size of the stake would depend on the outcome of talks about the Indian company's overall valuation. He added Wal-Mart and Flipkart were also contemplating a collaboration that would see them leverage each other's expertise in retail and supply chains in India. Both sources declined to be identified because the talks are preliminary and have not been made public. Wal-Mart in India and Flipkart declined to comment. A deal would pit Wal-Mart against U.S. rival Amazon, which has been expanding rapidly in the South Asian country's retail market and is now Flipkart's biggest competitor. Wal-Mart only operates wholesale stores in India. "With Amazon slowly taking a lead over the Indian players, all these unicorns including Flipkart and Snapdeal are out there in the market to raise funds," the source said. "Companies like Wal-Mart would be more long-term investors, but there aren't too many like them to write such big cheques." Flipkart has been valued at about $11.5 billion, local media reported last month, citing a U.S. regulatory filing from investor Valic, a division of American International Group Inc . The company was valued at as much as $15 billion earlier this year, but cut-throat competition, reduced private funding, and elusive profitability is putting pressure on e-commerce players in India. Launched in 2007 by two former Amazon employees, Flipkart sells everything from cellphones to suitcases and cosmetics. Current investors include Tiger Global Management and Accel Partners. Flipkart and smaller rival Snapdeal have been looking to raise fresh capital to compete with deep-pocketed Amazon in an industry that relies on steep discounts on products and heavy spending on marketing, technology and delivery networks to lure customers. India's Economic Times newspaper, which first reported the talks on Tuesday, said a meeting between the two sides was scheduled for this week. Wal-Mart agreed in June to take a 5 percent stake in China's JD.com, giving the U.S. firm a ringside seat in JD.com's bitter rivalry with Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .

Walmart and Flipkart are in discussions for forging an alliance, sources close to the development said. Reuters Walmart in an emailed statement said: "As a policy, we do not comment on speculative reports." Flipkart spokesperson said: "It is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations." The likely talk comes close on the heels of the US retailer entering into a deal with China's second-largest ecommerce firm JD.com in June amid growing competition from Alibaba Group Holding. As per the terms of the deal, Walmart will get a 5 percent stake in JD.com worth $1.5 billion in exchange for selling its online grocery store to the Chinese ecommerce firm. Two months later the US retail major announced up a deal to acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion to spruce up its ecommerce business. According to market watchers, the Flipkart-Walmart tie-up will help the companies compete strongly against US-based Amazon. Amazon has committed about $5 billion towards its Indian business and is aggressively ramping up its supply and delivery operations. Walmart had earlier established a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group. However, Walmart eventually sold its stake to the partner. For Flipkart, a minority stake sale could bring in fresh funds into the company and help further compete with Amazon. Also, Flipkart can leverage Walmart's global supply chain and use the latter's wholesale stores in Jammu, Chandigarh etc. among other locations for pickup and delivery points. In case of Walmart, holding a minority stake in Flipkart will help it to have a presence in the country's growing ecommerce market besides allowing it to sell goods through multiple channels, the Economic Times report said earlier this week. The US-based retailer can also eye the home-grown etailer's rising user base. Last week, Flipkart said it has crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. The Bengaluru-based company has also doubled its user base over the last year and added 25 million users in the past six months alone. also see Rs 500, Rs 1000 crackdown impact: Amazon, Flipkart, Shopclues stop Cash-on-Delivery Demonetisation: Both Flipkart, Snapdeal now allow cash on delivery to improve sales Rs 500, Rs 1,000 note ban: Amazon's cash on delivery orders back on track The company is engaged in a battle for supremacy with Amazon and another domestic challenger Snapdeal, where all three will be slugging it out to notch up robust volumes in the forthcoming festival sales offer starting later this week.

(Reuters/Kevork Djansezian) Share Written by Suneera Tandon September 28, 2016 Quartz india The world’s largest retailer might make a big play for India’s $22-billion (pdf) e-commerce market. Walmart is in preliminary talks to invest up to $1 billion in India’s largest online retailer, Flipkart, in exchange for a minority stake in the Bengaluru-based e-commerce company, according to several media reports published on Sept. 28. The two companies have held early talks and may be meeting sometime this week to take the discussion forward, The Economic Times newspaper reported quoting unidentified sources. “As a policy, we don’t comment on speculative reports,” a Walmart India spokesperson said. A Flipkart spokesperson also refused to comment on what she labelled as “rumours.” The investment could come at the perfect time for the Indian company as it struggles to raise fresh funding at its desired valuation, even as several investors have devalued it. The deal could also help Flipkart in its battle against the Indian arm of American e-commerce giant Amazon. While Flipkart grapples with poor investor sentiment, Amazon has been making big bets on India. In June 2016, the American online giant announced an additional investment of $3 billion (Rs20,000 crore) in India, taking the company’s total monetary commitment to the country to $5 billion—far more than the total funds raised by Flipkart (around $3.2 billion) and homegrown rival, Snapdeal (around $1.7 billion). For Walmart, which has been in the Indian market for over a decade, this potential deal may finally provide the push needed to grow beyond the brick-and-mortar business, helping it expand its network in India’s online retail market, much like it did in China with JD.com. Since it entered India in 2007, Walmart has been struggling with strict government regulations that have hindered its growth in the country’s $600-billion retail market. India does not allow 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) in supermarket chains. The American retailer first partnered with Bharti Retail to open Best Price Modern wholesale stores (that allow small businesses and shops to buy in bulk, 100% FDI is allowed in such a business) in India. In 2013, the partnership fell through following differences between the two companies. What’s more, the partnership battled corruption allegations as Walmart’s top employees were accused of bribing officials to get stores opened. Since then, Walmart has been on a solo journey in India, cleaning up its act and awaiting government policies that would make it easier to invest fully in front-end supermarket stores. Meanwhile, it has remained in the wholesale business, running 21 such stores across India. In 2014, it decided to grow its wholesale business online, linking its in-store inventory to its websites. Now, a partnership with Flipkart can potentially propel it into an entirely different orbit. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

It happened at the store in Mcdonough, Georgia just south of Atlanta. A family requested the police-themed cake for an officer’s retirement party. The Walmart workers apparently thought the request was racist and refused to make it. A friend of the officer’s family posted the story online and it caused quite a stir. Even the city’s police chief had something to say about it. “Officers go out and put their lives on the line for people, regardless of color, creed, sex, or national origin. It doesn’t matter to us.” Walmart has since issued this statement: “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’ve reached out to the family to make this right and offer our apologies.” The manager of the store reached out to the officer’s family and offered to make the cake, but another store had already taken care of it. Walmart then donated some things for the retirement party along with a gift card. Take Our Poll ❯❯ Click the Icon below to share this post...

Published on September 27, 2016. Reprints Reprints Andrew Bruce, CEO of Publicis Communications North America Credit: David Hall Most Popular Partnerships between agencies and clients in which both entities are working toward shared objectives are key for the industry's future, said Andrew Bruce, CEO of Publicis Communications North America, during a panel at Advertising Week. Mr. Bruce added that a "partnership feels so much more open" and allows the agency to become part of a client's world and ambitions. "It's a sign that we are more than an advertising agency and we are bringing more to [the relationship]," he said. For example, he said Publicis Groupe has an opportunity to align itself with Walmart, which is "daunting, but exciting." This summer, Publicis announced that it will create a new entity to house Walmart's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, along with other pieces of business that do not involve advertising. DDB Chicago CEO Paul Gunning spoke on the panel about new Omnicom Group agency dedicated exclusively to McDonald's, saying the review process involved four main themes: the consolidation of marketing services across Omnicom agencies, access to data, breaking down silos within Omnicom and McDonald's and transparency on both the agency and client sides of the business. One of the reasons the relationship with McDonald's is unique, according to Mr. Gunner, is because "the client is willing to transform and is transforming as much as the holding company." He said the agency is looking to make a massive impact on McDonald's and its sales, and in order for that to happen, the fast-feeder, Omnicom and outside partners, like Google and Facebook, "need to all work together to even have a shot at making a big pivot in this brand's history." Vik Kathuria, head of global agency partnerships at Oracle Marketing Cloud, said agencies have to bring the client and consumer into the center of their thinking and emphasize nimble, efficient strategies. "It's not about the past, present or future; it comes down to structuring the organization in a way that benefits the consumer," he said, adding that Publicis' new operating model could be headed in the right direction. Last week, Publicis announced that the North America region will operate under a single P&L for all of its creative agencies as part of its continuing effort to breakdown silos. Mr. Bruce said on the panel that the new model helps with collaboration because it makes the group put the right people in the room to solve specific problems or take advantage of opportunities for clients. The future of agencies may also rely on an "Uber-type model," where people come together from all different agencies or offices, said John Gerzema, CEO of BAV Consulting. He said small and big agencies may eventually all work together and people may not wind up working in the same office everyday.

LUCIE, Fla. A woman was dragged the length of a football field by a car after she fought with a man over a Walmart gift card Monday, city police said. Police were called to the Walmart in Port St. Lucie, Florida, where they found a 48-year-old woman who was in the parking lot with several cuts, bruises and a head injury. Security footage revealed she had tried to get inside the vehicle, but that it left before she could. The driver was later identified as 27-year-old David Squitieri. Investigators say the woman returned several items for Squitieri to the Walmart to get a gift card for him. When she brought him the card back, police said the two fought over the amount of the money she would receive for returning the items. As he ran to his car, she followed, attempting to get in the car, according to police. On the video, the woman is seen grabbing on to the door of the car as it drives away. Police said she was dragged for 100 yards. The 27-year-old later told police he paid the woman $20 to return the items for him in the store, and then she was supposed to give the gift card to him. But when she returned, they fought over the card and she hit him several times, according to the report. He said he was able to snatch the card and leave. The relationship between the two is unknown. Squitieri was arrested and faces charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

(Screengrab of Fox News video) By Jen Krausz   |   Tuesday, 27 Sep 2016 02:40 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A request for a "Blue Lives Matter" cake for a woman who wanted to celebrate her dad’s retirement from being a police officer was reportedly refused by three workers at a Georgia Wal-Mart. According to Fox News Columnist Todd Starnes, the woman was told by the Wal-Mart workers that the cake was racist and nobody felt comfortable decorating it. She wanted the cake for her father’s retirement party after 25 years on the force. The woman, who didn’t want Starnes to mention her name, said she would find another bakery. A Wal-Mart manager later gave her a gift card and made the cake free of charge, stating that Wal-Mart supports law enforcement. He had to make the cake himself because his decorators continued to refuse to make it, however, Starnes said. A picture showed a hand-decorated cake with badly printed block letters spelling out "Blue Lives Matter." Starnes called for the decorators to be fired, but there are no reports that anything has happened to them so far. "'I work in retail,' the officer's daughter told me," Starnes stated in his Fox News Column. "'If I didn’t want to deal with a customer — and said "No" — I would get fired.'" Starnes ended his column by saying, "Just because Wal-Mart is the home of low prices, doesn’t mean they have to hire a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots." Friend of the family Taylor Wilkes said she will not shop at Wal-Mart even though they tried to make the situation right. "If you ask me, I think he just did that because, thanks to you all, this got so much attention, and he didn’t want it to go farther than it did," Wilkes said, according to WGCL-TV. She also described the meeting as "scripted and insincere," according to the station.

A news report on Tuesday said Walmart was in early talks to pick up a minority stake in Flipkart, which claims to be bigger than Amazon in India. While neither Bentonville-headquartered Walmart nor Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal-founded Flipkart commented on the issue, a source said it may not make much sense for the American brick-and-mortar giant, with significant online ambition, to pick a minority stake in Flipkart at the valuation it commands. The Bengaluru-based company had past estimated its own value at over $15 billion last year, but many of its investors have marked down the worth since then. Even after the markdowns, which are theoretical, Flipkart is valued at $10-$11 billion. “A minority stake in Flipkart will not give Walmart any substantial play in the online space, while paying a big price for it,” the source said, explaining why such a deal was unlikely. The talks between the two could be for other strategic tie-ups, rather than a stake deal, another source said. Walmart has been in negotiations with several e-commerce companies, including Shopclues and Snapdeal, for presence across online platforms. However, many analysts have pointed out that there’s a reason for Walmart to gain traction in the online market in India. The biggest trigger is Chinese online major Alibaba finalising its direct India foray. In fact, in China, Walmart invested $1.5 billion to pick up a 5 per cent stake in JD.com, or Jingdong Mall, formerly 360buy, to compete with Alibaba. Amazon, which has been investing heavily in India - $5 billion committed in the last three years - is a natural rival since Walmart has been trying hard to take on Bezos’ company in the home market. When it comes to partnership, Walmart has not had a happy past in India. It had entered in a partnership with Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises for a wholesale business. The JV’s plan was to subsequently open retail stores, where 51 per cent foreign direct investment was permitted in 2012 under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. But the partnership broke in 2013 as the multi-brand retail policy was not going anywhere and the two partners developed differences. Currently, Walmart operates a wholesale business in the country, which allows 100 per cent FDI. Besides, at 21-odd wholesale stores that it runs in India, Walmart offers online services in the business to business space. The American retailer is also exploring the possibility of entering the food retail business, where 100 per cent FDI has been allowed.

By Jerry Davis September 27, 2016 Target recently staked out a position in the culture wars by announcing that it will build private bathrooms in all its locations, after earlier allowing transgender customers to use whichever room corresponds with their gender identity—both actions sparking anger from many conservatives. While big business hasn’t always been on the vanguard of social justice, in recent years companies like Target, Apple and even Wal-Mart have increasingly taken positions that put them squarely on the side of socially progressive activists. So how did Che Guevera—the face of the Cuban Revolution—become CEO of corporate America? When I first began studying the interactions between social movements and corporations 25 years ago, it was rare to see business take a public stand on social issues. Yet today we see organizations ranging from General Electric to the NCAA weighing in on transgender issues, something that would have been hard to imagine even a decade ago. From custom abiders to bullies Traditionally, corporations aimed to be scrupulously neutral on social issues. No one doubted that corporations exercised power, but it was over bread-and-butter economic issues like trade and taxes, not social issues. There seemed little to be gained by activism on potentially divisive issues, particularly for consumer brands. A watershed of the civil rights movement, for example, was the 1960 sit-in protest by students that began at a segregated lunch counter in a Woolworth store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and spread across the South. Woolworth’s corporate policy had been to “abide by local custom” and keep black and white patrons separated. By supporting the status quo, Woolworth and others like it stood in the way of progress. But negative publicity led to substantial lost business, and Woolworth eventually relented. In July, four months after the protest started—and after the students had gone home for the summer—the manager of the Greensboro store quietly integrated his lunch counter. In general, companies were more worried about the costs of taking a more liberal stand on such issues, a point basketball legend and Nike pitchman Michael Jordan made succinctly in 1990. Asked to support Democrat Harvey Gantt’s campaign to replace segregationist incumbent Jesse Helms as a North Carolina senator, Jordan declined, reportedly saying “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” And companies presumed that taking controversial positions would lead to boycotts by those on the other side. That’s what happened to Walt Disney in 1996 as a result of its early support for gay rights, such as “gay day” at its theme parks. Its stand prompted groups including America’s largest Protestant denomination, the Southern Baptists, to launch a boycott, calling Disney’s support for gay rights an “anti-Christian and anti-family direction.” The eight-year boycott, however, was notably ineffective at changing Disney policy. It turns out that too few parents had the heart to deny their children Disney products to make a boycott effective. Since then, some of the biggest U.S. companies have taken similar stands, in spite of the reaction from conservatives. For example, when the Arkansas legislature passed a bill in March 2015 that would have enabled LGBT discrimination on the grounds of “religious freedom,” the CEO of Wal-Mart urged the governor to veto the bill. Not surprisingly, given Wal-Mart’s status in the state and the corporate backlash that accompanied a similar law in Indiana, the governor obliged and eventually signed a modified bill. That din’t sit well with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, however, who argued in The New York Times that companies in those states were joining “left-wing activists to bully elected officials into backing away from strong protections for religious liberty.” He warned companies against “bullying” Louisiana. Why have corporations shifted from “abiding local custom” around segregation and other divisive social issues to “bullying elected officials” to support LGBT rights? Changing environment In my view, there are two broad changes responsible for this increased corporate social activism. First, social media and the web have changed the environment for business by making it cheaper and easier for activists to join together to voice their opinions and by making corporate activities more transparent. The rapid spread of the Occupy movement in the fall of 2011, from Zuccotti Park in New York to encampments across the country, illustrates how social media can enable groups with a compelling message to scale up quickly. Sometimes even online-only movements can be highly effective. When the Susan G. Komen Foundation cut off funds to Planned Parenthood that were aimed at supporting breast cancer screenings for low-income women, a pop-up social movement arose: Facebook and Twitter exploded with millions of posts and tweets voicing opposition. Within days the policy was walked back. Mozilla’s appointment of a new CEO who had supported a California ballot proposal banning same-sex marriage also generated outrage online, both inside and outside the organization. He was gone within two weeks. More recently, Mylan’s exorbitant price hikes on its EpiPen took place over several years, but an online petition fueled by social media this summer turned it into a scandal and a talking point for presidential candidates. In each case, social media allowed like-minded “clicktivists” to draw attention to an issue and demonstrate their support for change, quickly and at very little cost. It’s never been cheaper to assemble a virtual protest group, and sometimes (as in the Arab Spring) online tools enable real-world protest. As such, activism is likely to be a constant for corporations in the future. Millennials don’t like puffery Second, as consumers and workers, millennials are highly attuned to a company’s “social value proposition.” Companies targeting the sensibilities of the young often tout their social missions. Tom’s Shoes and Warby Parker both have “buy a pair, give a pair” programs. Chipotle highlights its sustainability efforts. And Starbucks has promoted fair trade coffee, marriage equality and racial justice more or less successfully. In each case, transparency about corporate practices serves as a check on puffery. Social mission is even more important when it comes to recruiting. At business school recruiting events, it is almost obligatory that companies describe their LEED-certified workplaces, LGBT-friendly human resource practices and community outreach efforts. Moreover, our employer signals something about our identity. Value alignment is part of why people stay at their job, and among many millennials, socially progressive values—particularly around LGBT issues—are almost a given. In this situation, corporate activism may be the sensible course of action, at least when it comes to LGBT issues. According to the Pew Research Center, for example, support for same-sex marriage has increased from 31 percent in 2004 to 55 percent today, and there is little reason to expect a reversal. Risks remain Even as trends lead to more corporate activism, the reaction hasn’t always been as the businesses expected. Businesses on the vanguard of social issues themselves can become targets if and when they slip up. When Starbucks attempted to promote a dialogue about race after the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner by police in 2014, its method—asking baristas to write “race together” on cups to encourage conversations—was widely ridiculed. Some even regarded the effort as a misguided marketing ploy rather than a sincere effort to promote understanding. In 1998, William Clay Ford Jr. became chairman of Ford Motor and aimed to turn the company green by improving fuel economy and “greening” its production processes. The company even put an energy-efficient “living” roof on a truck assembly plant. Its continued reliance on its profitable line of gas-guzzling SUVs, however, prompted some to accuse Ford of hypocrisy. Red and blue companies? While prominent companies like Starbucks and Target have taken stances associated with liberal causes, some businesses have gone the other direction. Chick-fil-A aimed to implement “biblical values” and supported anti-gay groups in the 2000s. Those groups returned the favor by encouraging like-minded people to dine there on “Chick-fil-A appreciation day.” Hobby Lobby famously sought to abstain from providing funding for birth control for employees on religious grounds. Koch Industries, overseen by the famous Koch Brothers, has long been a lightning rod for boycotts due to the right-wing proclivities of its dominant owners. And small businesses across the country are not always shy in advertising their conservative political orientations. As states have seemingly divided into red (for conservative) and blue (for liberal), might we expect the same thing from corporations, as consumers and employees drift toward the brands that best represent their views—red companies and blue companies? It is already easy to look up political contributions by companies and their employees. For example, Bloomberg, Alphabet and the Pritzker Group lean Democratic; Oracle, Chevron and AT&T tend Republican. In the current electoral climate, it is not hard to imagine this continuing.

(Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) Eight-cent eggs: Consumers gobble cheap food as grocers squirm By Craig Giammona • Bloomberg Sep 27, 2016 (…) Daniel Acker Shoppers push carts through the grocery department at a Wal-Mart in Chicago on Nov. 25, 2015. (Bloomberg photo by Daniel Acker) Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Albertsons recently advertised a deal you don't normally see on your finer cuts of meat: "buy 1 get 1 free" specials on "USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak." And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, N.J., you could pick up a dozen eggs at Walmart. (OK, the price was actually $1.14.) A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck — 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It's the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 — with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn't only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 — a little more than the price of a pint of beer. "The severity of what we're seeing is completely unprecedented," said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. "We've never seen deflation this sharp." Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Walmart in Secaucus, N.J., to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of "Angus steak burgers" fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Walmarts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. "Wherever I find the good deals — that's where I'm at," Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart Stores, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. "It starts to border on irrational pricing," said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. "People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins." Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi's German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market — famously derided as "Whole Paycheck" — is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives In recent years, Kroger — the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores — cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company's stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don't even notice. "The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out, because it's fascinating — in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money," McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen's lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer's budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin' Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, 63, a retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, N.J. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 — one of the great food deals of recent memory. "That's a good price," she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

Flipkart, so far, led the e-commerce market in India beating rivals that included another homegrown player Snapdeal as well as the world’s largest e-commerce company Amazon. Its biggest strength was the first mover advantage it had over the rivals. Maintaining the leadership, however, was turning out to be challenging, of late. With the blessings of its deep-pocket parent ($2 billion already invested and $3 billion more committed), Amazon India has been making fast inroads into the market and Flipkart’s inability to raise fresh funds and continued high cash burn was increasingly making its position as the market leader untenable. So much so that most observers in the industry were predicting that the pecking order might change post the festive season with Amazon emerging the eventual winner in India. This, however, might not become a reality if Walmart, indeed, picks a stake in Flipkart. Both Walmart India spokesperson and Flipkart did not respond to email queries sent by TechCircle saying as a policy they don’t comment on rumours or speculations. What is in it for Flipkart? On the face of it, it makes eminent sense for Flipkart to shake hands with Walmart. The world’s largest company’s strengths as an offline retailer alongside its access to smart technology and ‘real time pricing algorithm’ it now owns post the acquisition of Jet.com, can help Flipkart strengthen its game in India. The technology helps in reducing prices of products in real time based on various factors including the number of products and the distribution centres. This has the potential to revolutionize the prevailing customer experience and pricing patterns in the Indian e-commerce industry where deep discounting has become the bane for most companies. But all this is in the long run. The immediate reprieve that Flipkart is likely to get out of the proposed tie-up with Walmart is access to much-needed funds. According to media reports, Flipkart has not been able to raise funds since last year because of difference of opinion with regards to its valuation with prospective investors. Fresh funds will help the company sail through for some more time after the much-awaited festive season, which is likely to leave most e-commerce players bruised given that deep discounting is still the route they are taking to woo customers. Indeed, the new FDI rules do not allow e-commerce marketplaces to directly offer discounts to customers, but the incumbents in the market are offering financial incentives to help sellers on their platforms to offer deep discounts to customers. For Flipkart, partnering with Walmart has many positives to it. “But the question is – will the investors, who see Flipkart as the Amazon of India, agree to it,” asks Sahni, adding: “No one wants to let go. If that was the case, Flipkart would have given in to Amazon a year ago. Snapdeal is not giving up. Alibaba is gearing up.” Flipkart’s current valuation may be another reason for investors to hesitate in parting with the equity in the company. The company suffered seven successive markdowns with some of its investors placing the e-commerce company’s valuation at less than $10 billion in comparison to $15.2 billion valuation it commanded till September last year, which was based on its last funding round in mid-2015. For Walmart, however, it makes eminent sense to pick up a stake in Flikpart now. What is in it for Walmart? Besides picking a stake in Flipkart at a reasonable valuation, the tie-up will have other advantages for Walmart. To begin with, it will get a toe-hold in the world’s most attractive e-commerce market. Walmart, for whom online retailing is a clearly a missing link in its larger business plans, the partnership will help it hoist its flag in the Indian e-commerce space. If it were to do that alone, it might take the company years to do so. To be sure, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. It had entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises but in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. The e-commerce market is expected to double to Rs 2,11,005 crore by December this year, according to the estimates of IAMAI (Internet & Mobile Association of India) and IMRB International. The e-commerce market grew 30% between December 2011 and December 2015, making it very attractive for those wanting to set foot here. Besides Walmart, there are other players queuing to get a share of this pie. China’s Alibaba, which has a market cap of $258.01 billion, is likely to make some big moves here sooner than later. “We are planning to enter the e-commerce business in India in 2016. We have been exploring very carefully the e-commerce opportunity in this country, which we think is very exciting on the backdrop of Digital India,” Alibaba Group president J. Michael Evans had said earlier this year. Then there is Japan’s Rakuten, which is said to be evaluating the Indian market. In this backdrop, this might be the right time for Walmart to enter India and partner with the country’s largest e-commerce company. Like this report?

Home Economy Economic Activity Retail retail Eight-cent eggs: Consumers gobble cheap food as grocers squirm Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Tuesday, September 27, 2016 10:25 am By Craig Giammona Bloomberg News retail Dave’s announces 1st Cranston location, 10th overall (Sept. 26, 2016) Fastest-growing & innovative companies Blount feeds its future (Sept. 23, 2016) philanthropy Edesia and Russell Morin Catering announce philanthropic initiative (Sept. 16, 2016) Call it the Great Grocery-Store Giveaway of 2016. In Austin, Texas, Randalls slashed prices for boneless beef ribs by 40 percent, to $3.99 a pound. Not to be outdone, the H-E-B grocer down the street charged $1 a pound less. Not long ago, Albertsons advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat: “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, N.J., you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. OK, the price was actually $1.14. A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck -- 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago, you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 -- a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston, had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, N.J., to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals -- that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. ‘Irrational pricing’ “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com Inc. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market Inc. -- famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” -- is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger Co. -- the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores -- cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. CEO Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. CEO’s lament “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out, because it’s fascinating – in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, a 63-year-old retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, N.J. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 -- one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

A news report on Tuesday said Walmart was in early talks to pick up a minority stake in Flipkart, which claims to be bigger than Amazon in India. While neither Bentonville-headquartered Walmart nor Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal-founded Flipkart commented on the issue, a source said it may not make much sense for the American brick-and-mortar giant, with significant online ambition, to pick a minority stake in Flipkart at the valuation it commands. The Bengaluru-based company had past estimated its own value at over $15 billion last year, but many of its investors have marked down the worth since then. Even after the markdowns, which are theoretical, Flipkart is valued at $10-$11 billion. “A minority stake in Flipkart will not give Walmart any substantial play in the online space, while paying a big price for it,” the source said, explaining why such a deal was unlikely. The talks between the two could be for other strategic tie-ups, rather than a stake deal, another source said. Walmart has been in negotiations with several e-commerce companies, including Shopclues and Snapdeal, for presence across online platforms. However, many analysts have pointed out that there’s a reason for Walmart to gain traction in the online market in India. The biggest trigger is Chinese online major Alibaba finalising its direct India foray. In fact, in China, Walmart invested $1.5 billion to pick up a 5 per cent stake in JD.com, or Jingdong Mall, formerly 360buy, to compete with Alibaba. Amazon, which has been investing heavily in India - $5 billion committed in the last three years - is a natural rival since Walmart has been trying hard to take on Bezos’ company in the home market. When it comes to partnership, Walmart has not had a happy past in India. It had entered in a partnership with Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises for a wholesale business. The JV’s plan was to subsequently open retail stores, where 51 per cent foreign direct investment was permitted in 2012 under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. But the partnership broke in 2013 as the multi-brand retail policy was not going anywhere and the two partners developed differences. Currently, Walmart operates a wholesale business in the country, which allows 100 per cent FDI. Besides, at 21-odd wholesale stores that it runs in India, Walmart offers online services in the business to business space. The American retailer is also exploring the possibility of entering the food retail business, where 100 per cent FDI has been allowed.

Flipkart, so far, led the e-commerce market in India beating rivals that included another homegrown player Snapdeal as well as the world’s largest e-commerce company Amazon. Its biggest strength was the first mover advantage it had over the rivals. Maintaining the leadership, however, was turning out to be challenging, of late. With the blessings of its deep-pocket parent ($2 billion already invested and $3 billion more committed), Amazon India has been making fast inroads into the market and Flipkart’s inability to raise fresh funds and continued high cash burn was increasingly making its position as the market leader untenable. So much so that most observers in the industry were predicting that the pecking order might change post the festive season with Amazon emerging the eventual winner in India. This, however, might not become a reality if Walmart, indeed, picks a stake in Flipkart. Both Walmart India spokesperson and Flipkart did not respond to email queries sent by TechCircle saying as a policy they don’t comment on rumours or speculations. What is in it for Flipkart? On the face of it, it makes eminent sense for Flipkart to shake hands with Walmart. The world’s largest company’s strengths as an offline retailer alongside its access to smart technology and ‘real time pricing algorithm’ it now owns post the acquisition of Jet.com, can help Flipkart strengthen its game in India. The technology helps in reducing prices of products in real time based on various factors including the number of products and the distribution centres. This has the potential to revolutionize the prevailing customer experience and pricing patterns in the Indian e-commerce industry where deep discounting has become the bane for most companies. But all this is in the long run. The immediate reprieve that Flipkart is likely to get out of the proposed tie-up with Walmart is access to much-needed funds. According to media reports, Flipkart has not been able to raise funds since last year because of difference of opinion with regards to its valuation with prospective investors. Fresh funds will help the company sail through for some more time after the much-awaited festive season, which is likely to leave most e-commerce players bruised given that deep discounting is still the route they are taking to woo customers. Indeed, the new FDI rules do not allow e-commerce marketplaces to directly offer discounts to customers, but the incumbents in the market are offering financial incentives to help sellers on their platforms to offer deep discounts to customers. For Flipkart, partnering with Walmart has many positives to it. “But the question is – will the investors, who see Flipkart as the Amazon of India, agree to it,” asks Sahni, adding: “No one wants to let go. If that was the case, Flipkart would have given in to Amazon a year ago. Snapdeal is not giving up. Alibaba is gearing up.” Flipkart’s current valuation may be another reason for investors to hesitate in parting with the equity in the company. The company suffered seven successive markdowns with some of its investors placing the e-commerce company’s valuation at less than $10 billion in comparison to $15.2 billion valuation it commanded till September last year, which was based on its last funding round in mid-2015. For Walmart, however, it makes eminent sense to pick up a stake in Flikpart now. What is in it for Walmart? Besides picking a stake in Flipkart at a reasonable valuation, the tie-up will have other advantages for Walmart. To begin with, it will get a toe-hold in the world’s most attractive e-commerce market. Walmart, for whom online retailing is a clearly a missing link in its larger business plans, the partnership will help it hoist its flag in the Indian e-commerce space. If it were to do that alone, it might take the company years to do so. To be sure, Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. It had entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises but in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. The e-commerce market is expected to double to Rs 2,11,005 crore by December this year, according to the estimates of IAMAI (Internet & Mobile Association of India) and IMRB International. The e-commerce market grew 30% between December 2011 and December 2015, making it very attractive for those wanting to set foot here. Besides Walmart, there are other players queuing to get a share of this pie. China’s Alibaba, which has a market cap of $258.01 billion, is likely to make some big moves here sooner than later. “We are planning to enter the e-commerce business in India in 2016. We have been exploring very carefully the e-commerce opportunity in this country, which we think is very exciting on the backdrop of Digital India,” Alibaba Group president J. Michael Evans had said earlier this year. Then there is Japan’s Rakuten, which is said to be evaluating the Indian market. In this backdrop, this might be the right time for Walmart to enter India and partner with the country’s largest e-commerce company. Like this report?

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    More than half of U.S. online consumers begin their product searches on Amazon.com Inc.’s website or mobile app, a survey found. That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. “Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers,” said Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach. “Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices.” The survey results are bad news for Wal-Mart and other retailers trying to make headway against Amazon in online shopping. E-commerce sales are expected to increase 13 percent to $385 billion this year, according to eMarketer. Wal-Mart last month agreed to buy e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion, its biggest attempt yet to catch up. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company’s $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership. “Amazon keeps adding layers and is innovating at a faster pace than everyone, especially with Prime,” Blackledge said. “Prime members have the Amazon app on the front screen of their smartphones. That definitely hurts Wal-Mart.” Alphabet Inc., owner of the Google search engine, can withstand the pressure from Amazon because its advertising revenue is diversified, including video ads on streaming site YouTube, said Ali Mogharabi, an analyst at Morningstar Investment Service. “This trend has been taking place for the past four or five years and it has still not hurt Google search,” he said.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

Home Industry Companies Amplus to invest Rs 90 crore in Walmart’s rooftop solar plants Amplus to invest Rs 90 crore in Walmart’s rooftop solar plants Amplus Energy Solutions has committed an investment of Rs 90 crore to install and commission 15 rooftop solar power plants for world's leading retailer Walmart in India. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: September 27, 2016 6:09 PM The company has already commissioned a 297-kWp (kilowatt peak) rooftop solar plant for Walmart’s Best Price store at Agra, it added. (Source: Reuters) Amplus Energy Solutions has committed an investment of Rs 90 crore to install and commission 15 rooftop solar power plants for world’s leading retailer Walmart in India. Gurgaon-based Amplus plans to fund the investment through the money it raised from a global infrastructure investment fund, I Squared Capital. It raised $150 million last year from the fund, the company said in a statement. The company has already commissioned a 297-kWp (kilowatt peak) rooftop solar plant for Walmart’s Best Price store at Agra, it added. It plans to commission 11 more plants for Walmart in the next 4-5 weeks in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh, it said. Walmart India has signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Amplus to solarise their 15 Best Price outlets. Once completed, these plants over their lifetime will help in saving 1,72,000 MT CO2, which is equivalent to planting 2.15 lakh trees. “We have pledged to meet 50 per cent of our energy needs through renewable energy and this partnership is testimony to the commitment. We are pleased that the rooftop solar plant has been commissioned at Agra and we will be monitoring the power generation through Amplus’ cloud based software,” Walmart India President & CEO Krish Iyer said.

A number of my Georgia readers alerted me to the story and on Saturday night I spoke directly with the police officer’s daughter. She asked that I not divulge her name and I’ve agreed to honor her request. “I was so shocked,” she told me. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” For the record, Walmart has confessed that most of her allegations are true. I’ll have more on that a bit later in this column. The police officer’s daughter went to the Walmart on Willow Drive on Sept. 22 to order a flag for her father’s retirement party. He was leaving the force after 25 years on the job. She showed the bakers a photograph of the police officer’s flag — the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter told me. As an alternative, she suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. But that design was also rejected by Walmart’s cake decorator. “She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter told me. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?’” After being rejected for a third time, the 21-year-old told the bakers, “I’ll find another bakery, thank you.” She was much more polite than I would’ve been, folks. “I was disappointed,” she told me. “I go to Walmart all the time — at least once a week, spend hundreds of dollars. I just wanted to make my dad a cake to show how much i appreciated him.” A friend of the family posted an item about the incident on Facebook and it wasn’t long before the Walmart store manager called the police officer’s wife and daughter and apologized. “He said he was so sorry,” the daughter told me. “He offered to make the cake free of charge and he gave me a $50 gift card.” A Walmart corporate spokesperson confirmed most of the story. “Our goal is to always take care of customers,” the spokesperson told me. “But, sometimes we misstep. We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.” Walmart did not say if one of their associates called the cake racist. “I can confirm an associate made a mistake that has since been corrected for the customer,” the spokesperson told me. So how did Walmart right their wrong? The answer to that question is going to curdle your Fruit Loops, folks. The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “It doesn’t look professional.” I’ve attached photographs of Walmart’s handiwork — it’s absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. “I work in retail,” the officer’s daughter told me. “If I didn’t want to deal with a customer and said ‘No,’ I would get fired.” Unfortunately, her father’s retirement party [was] Sunday night, so [there was] no time to go elsewhere. “It irritates me that in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Walmart was looted and the cops were protecting them,” she said. “And you can’t make a cake for the people who are protecting you?” Walmart needs to make this right and they can start by delivering a professionally decorated cake to the police officer’s family. The three cake decorators need to be told: either decorate the cake or be fired. Just because Walmart is the home of low prices doesn’t mean they have to hire a bunch of low class, anti-cop bigots.

Ltd for an equity partnership, according to a report. The Economic Times reported, citing two sources it didn’t name, that “the companies are engaged in early talks and a meeting is scheduled this week”. These discussions, reportedly, include the world’s largest retailer picking up a minority stake in Flipkart. A Walmart India spokesperson told TechCircle in an email statement that “as a policy we don’t comment on speculative reports”. Flipkart said in a statement that “it is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” TechCircle had written in August about speculation of a possible deal when Walmart bought US web retailer Jet.com. Walmart had bought Jet.com for $3.3 billion in the largest ever buyout of a US e-commerce startup. In June, Walmart had announced acquiring a 5% stake in Chinese ecommerce giant JD.com for about $1.5 billion. According to the report in The Economic Times, the ongoing discussions may lead to a similar deal with India’s Flipkart. Krish Iyer, CEO, Walmart India Earlier this month, Walmart India CEO Krish Iyer had said at an event that the company was evaluating the policy guidelines of 100% foreign direct investment in food retail. Walmart has been present in India for almost a decade now. The company had entered into an equal joint venture with Sunil Bharti Mittal’s Bharti Enterprises. However, in 2013, it bought out its partner and decided to go solo. Walmart operates 21 Best Price wholesale offline stores in nine states in India. E-commerce sales in the US in 2015 totalled $340 billion, a 14.6% increase over 2014’s $298.3 billion, according to non-adjusted estimates released by the US Department of Commerce.  India, according to industry body Assocham, is one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world and is likely to touch $38-billion in gross merchandise value (GMV) this year, a 67% jump over the $23 billion it clocked last year. Still, it is tiny in comparison with the US. The Indian market is attractive for Walmart for a couple of reasons. Most e-tailers with global ambitions cannot ignore this fast-growing market. Also, its arch rival Amazon is quite bullish on India. Amazon India VP Amit Agarwal in May had announced that India is the second-largest market for Amazon in terms of new customers. “The partnership is a win-win for both the players. Flipkart gets access to Walmart funds and Walmart gets to put the first strong footstep in the Indian market,” says Anil Kumar, founder of RedSeer Consulting. “Overall, it is still pretty early to comment where the next turn in the tide will come from.” In India, Amazon is competing with the country’s largest e-commerce company Flipkart and Snapdeal even as other global companies such as China’s Alibaba and Japan’s Rakuten are readying to stake a claim in the market. This is why Flipkart can be a possible partner or an eventual buyout prospect for Walmart. Heavily funded by global investors such as Tiger Global, Naspers, Iconiq and Accel Partners, Flipkart, according to media reports, has been struggling to raise fresh funds to keep its growth momentum going. There have been media reports in the past to suggest that Flipkart has held talks with Amazon for a buyout but the latter walked away from the table owing to high valuation sought by the company. Walmart employs around 2.3 million people in its 11,527 stores across 28 countries and recorded $482 billion in total revenue last year. But the world’s largest retailer may be worried about its declining online sales in the US while Amazon continues to grow impressively, both in the US and India. Also, Walmart’s online sales were a mere $13.6 billion in 2015 against Amazon’s $107 billion. Like this report? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our top reports.

Vegan. Think. Eat. Thrive.™ News Food Planet Travel Buzz Investors Demand Food Giants Address Factory Farming By Anna Starostinetskaya | September 27, 2016 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Kraft, Heinz, Walmart, and 13 others put under pressure to mitigate meat risk with plant-based protein. Last week, the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative (FAIRR) sent a demand letter to 16 major food companies—including Walmart, Unilever, Kraft, Heinz, Nestle, Costco, and Whole Foods Market—to inquire about their plans to address the growing crisis of the material impact of factory farming. In the letter, investor coalition FAIRR pointed out the risks of industrial animal production based on their findings from a recent Oxford University study revealing that a global reduction in meat consumption would result in $1.5 trillion in healthcare related savings by 2050. “The world’s overreliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis,” FAIRR Founder Jeremy Coller says. “Intensive livestock production already has levels of emissions and pollution that are too high, and standards of safety and welfare that are too low.” Coller calls upon corporations to provide a strategy to combat the effects of factory farming because he says the planet “simply can’t cope with the projected increase in global protein demand.” The coalition, comprised of influential investors such as Robeco, Aviva Investors, and Boston Common, amongst others—and with a combined fund of over $1 trillion—put out the call to action because, according to Coller, “Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble, and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4% annually over the next five years.” Tweet Email Too Faced Acquired by Estée Lauder for $1.45 Billion Vegan-friendly makeup brand vows to never test on animals despite acquisition.

Not long ago, Albertsons advertised a deal you don’t normally see on your finer cuts of meat: “buy 1 get 1 free” specials on “USDA Choice Petite Sirloin Steak.” And what does $1 buy these days? In North Bergen, New Jersey, you could pick up a dozen eggs at Wal-Mart. OK, the price was actually $1.14. A mile away, check out Aldi, the German supermarket discounter, which can actually break the buck -- 12 eggs for 99 cents. A year ago, you would have paid, on average, three times that price. In a startling development, almost unheard of outside a recession, food prices have fallen for nine straight months in the U.S. It’s the longest streak of food deflation since 1960 -- with the exception of 2009, when the financial crisis was winding down. Analysts credit low oil and grain prices, as well as cutthroat competition from discounters. Consumers are winning out; grocery chains, not so much. Their margins and, in some cases, their stock prices, are taking a hit. Eggs and beef have have grown especially inexpensive, and it isn’t only an American phenomenon: In England, Aldi recently offered its prized 8-ounce wagyu steaks from New Zealand for about $6.50 -- a little more than the price of a pint of beer. “The severity of what we’re seeing is completely unprecedented,” said Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years. “We’ve never seen deflation this sharp.” Mushkin, who researches local markets, recently found that prices of a typical basket of grocery items in Houston, had fallen almost 5 percent over the past year. He credits, in part, the discerning behavior of shoppers like Manny Sinclair. On a weekday lunch break, the 43-year-old contractor stopped by a Wal-Mart in Secaucus, New Jersey, to pick up turtle food and paper towels. Patient Shoppers Sinclair typically buys groceries at his local ShopRite but has recently noticed the steals he now finds at discounters. He glanced at the meat case, where a 12-pack of “Angus steak burgers” fetched $15.82 and grass-fed ground beef could change hands for $4.96 a pound. Sinclair was intrigued but, in the classic logic of a shopper in an age of deflation, figured he might find even lower prices elsewhere. Along with two Wal-Marts, a Target and an Aldi, the area even offers a Family Dollar that features a small refrigerated section. “Wherever I find the good deals -- that’s where I’m at,” Sinclair said. At first, falling prices helped grocers. Low-cost commodities pushed down the tab for meat and packaged food and boosted profits. Now, deflation has turned ugly for the industry. Led by Wal-Mart, retailers are pushing down prices, eating away at their profit margins. ‘Irrational Pricing’ “It starts to border on irrational pricing,” said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “People are lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins.” Supermarkets are facing competition not just from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Aldi but also dollar stores and online retailer Amazon.com Inc. It could get worse. Lidl, one of Aldi’s German competitors, is building three distribution centers on the East Coast and plans to open U.S. stores by 2018. Even Whole Foods Market Inc. -- famously derided as “Whole Paycheck” -- is trying to compete on price through digital coupons and promotions on items such as beer and produce. In recent years, Kroger Co. -- the largest grocery store chain in the U.S., with nearly 2,800 stores -- cut prices to compete with Wal-Mart and managed to increase its market share and sales. But deflation has been hard on the supermarket chain. The company’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value this year, as price cuts weighed on profits. Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen expressed frustration that many customers don’t even notice. CEO’s Lament “The other thing that’s always hard is getting your message out, because it’s fascinating – in our research, most people are saying their basket of goods costs more money,” McMullen said on a call with analysts this month. The likely reason for McMullen’s lament: Food, on average, makes up only about 15 percent of a consumer’s budget. Except for gas and other energy-related items, prices for most other goods are going up, if only modestly. At the same time, restaurant food can still be pricey. The situation makes for some strange contrasts: In Chicago, a pound of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee sells for $4.99 at a Jewel-Osco store, less than the cost of a venti pumpkin spice frappuccino at Starbucks. Albertsons Cos. owns Jewel-Osco, as well as Randalls, home of the cheap Texas ribs. Elena Rosa, a 63-year-old retired health aide, was blasé when she steered her shopping cart past the refrigerator case at Aldi in North Bergen, New Jersey. She paused, noting a dozen eggs for less than $1 -- one of the great food deals of recent memory. “That’s a good price,” she said, before moving on without buying a carton.

A win-win deal may be in making Sep 27, 2016 13:52 IST #Alibaba   #Amazon   #Ecommerce   #Etailers   #Flipkart   #JD.com   #Jet.com   #Retailer   #Walmart Stores   By FP Staff Faced with rising competition from the online retail giant Amazon at home and other global markets, US-based multi-billion dollar retail czar Walmart Stores Inc has been steadily ramping up its presence in the online retail business through minority stake buys in etail companies of late. While having a presence in India for quite some time through its Wholesale Best Price stores, Walmart is evaluating its strategy to team up with the country's largest ecommerce company Flipkart to counter Amazon's growing influence here. AFP According to a report in The Economic Times, Walmart is looking at buying a small equity stake in Flipkart for which both the companies are likely to hold talks later this week. However, both Walmart and Flipkart have termed the news as speculative. The likely talk comes close on the heels of the US retailer entering into a deal with China's second-largest ecommerce firm JD.com in June amid growing competition from Alibaba Group Holding. As per the terms of the deal, Walmart will get a 5 percent stake in JD.com worth $1.5 billion in exchange for selling its online grocery store to the Chinese ecommerce firm. Two months later the US retail major announced up a deal to acquire Jet.com for $3.3 billion to spruce up its ecommerce business. Although Walmart remains undisputed leader in the US retail market, its ecommerce business has been facing challenging times in recent years. In 2015, Walmart's ecommerce sales stood at $15 billion as against a whopping $99 billion revenue posted by Amazon from its online sales, the ET report said. Back home, there is no clarity on the percentage holding and total value Walmart could negotiate with Flipkart. But the deal could be win-win situation for both. For Flipkart, a minority stake sale could bring in fresh funds into the company and help further compete with Amazon. Also, Flipkart can leverage Walmart's global supply chain and use the latter's wholesale stores in Jammu, Chandigarh etc. among other locations for pickup and delivery points. In case of Walmart, holding a minority stake in Flipkart will help it to have a presence in the country's growing ecommerce market besides allowing it to sell goods through multiple channels, the ET report added. The US-based retailer can also eye the home-grown etailer's rising user base. Last week, Flipkart said it has crossed the 100-million registered users mark, becoming the first e-commerce company in the country to hit the milestone. The Bengaluru-based company has also doubled its user base over the last year and added 25 million users in the past six months alone. The company is engaged in a battle for supremacy with Amazon and another domestic challenger Snapdeal, where all three are slugging it out to notch up robust volumes in the forthcoming festival sales offer starting later this week. also see Rs 500, Rs 1000 crackdown impact: Amazon, Flipkart, Shopclues stop Cash-on-Delivery Demonetisation: Both Flipkart, Snapdeal now allow cash on delivery to improve sales Rs 500, Rs 1,000 note ban: Amazon's cash on delivery orders back on track The Jeff Bezos-controlled Amazon has already announced big plans for India. The Seattle-based online giant had last year announced a plan infuse $3 billion in Indian operations, taking its total investment commitment for the country to $5 billion. Expanding into other verticals of the online segment, Amazon is on the verge of launching Prime Video in India, and has partnered with Karan Johar's Dharma Productions and Vishesh Films, which will give the company access to about 80 blockbustres. The teaming up with the Dharma and Vishesh is also aimed at gaining more customers and fighting Flipkart. A recent Bank of America Merrill Lynch report had said Amazon is improving its foothold in India and it could be the second biggest player after Flipkart in the online retail market by 2019. The country could also become Amazon's second largest market (after the US) as it plans to invest $5 billion here. "For last couple of months, Amazon India gross sales are higher than that of Flipkart standalone (excluding Myntra)... We now expect Amazon's GMV (gross merchandise value) market share to improve to 37 per cent by 2019 from 21 per cent in 2015 and expect it to be close No 2 behind Flipkart," the report said. While revenues are relatively small to Amazon's global scale, Amazon India could generate $81 billion in GMV and $2.2 billion in operating profit by 2025. Most of Amazon's gains have come at the expense of Snapdeal and other sellers, not Flipkart, according to the report. Flipkart still remains the market leader in India and "even in terms of customer satisfaction, reports indicate that it remains the leader, ahead of both Amazon and Snapdeal", according to the report. Whoever wins the battle in the end, one thing is for sure there are interesting times ahead for e-commerce customers in India.

Calvin S. Cunningham, 25, appeared on suspicion of being a fugitive from justice, two counts of attempting to elude, possession of a stolen vehicle, hit-and-run injury and first-degree assault. On Saturday, Cunningham entered the Wal-Mart at 221 N.E. 104th Ave. and allegedly stole a BB gun, according to court documents. He was contacted by store employees at the front door, and they attempted to detain him, but he threw the gun at one of the employees, according to a probable cause affidavit. Another employee followed him outside, and Cunningham took out a hatchet and started swinging it at him, the affidavit states. At about 3:30 a.m. Sunday, a Vancouver police officer saw Cunningham driving a blue Subaru Impreza in the 13600 block of Southeast 19th Street. He recognized Cunningham from a bulletin from the prior day’s incident, a separate probable cause affidavit states. The officer attempted to stop the vehicle near Southeast 136th Avenue and 19th Street. Cunningham made a U-turn and sped in the officer’s direction, colliding with his patrol car, court records said. The officer said he experienced pain in his neck and left knee. Cunningham did not stop and eluded the officer on Southeast McGillivray Boulevard at speeds in excess of 80 mph, according to court documents. Another officer saw the Subaru about 20 minutes later near Southeast Chkalov Drive and McGillivray. That officer attempted to stop Cunningham, whose vehicle was traveling more than 90 mph, the affidavit said. Cunningham later ditched the car near North Garrison Road and East Mill Plain Boulevard and ran, according to court records. Police later caught up with him. The car he was driving was reported stolen, court documents said. During his court appearance, Judge Gregory Gonzales appointed Cunningham an attorney and set his bail at $125,000, court records show. He will be arraigned Oct. 7.   Jessica Prokop Columbian Courts Reporter  360-735-4551  @jprokop16  Send an Email Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Walmart Refuses to Produce a 'Thin Blue Line' Retirement Cake? A viral Facebook repost reported Walmart's bakery employees refused to sell a 'thin blue line' retirement cake to a policeman's daughter because they deemed it racist. Kim LaCapria Sep 26, 2016 Share - - On 23 September 2016 Facebook user Taylor Wilkes published a post reporting that her "buddy's sister" went to a WalMart store in Georgia to order a "thin blue line" cake for her police officer father's retirement party, but workers there refused her order on the grounds that it was "racist": #BOYCOTTWALMART: So my buddy's sister went to Walmart in McDonough, GA to have a cake made for their father's retirement party. He's retiring from being a police officer. She asked Walmart to make a "thin blue line" cake to commemorate his extensive and honorable service as a dedicated police officer. Walmart refused to honor her request due to it being "racist." Three separate people in management denied her request for this reason. To me, this is appalling. There is nothing racist about the symbolism behind the "thin blue line," yet people CHOOSE to make EVERYTHING about race. I'm so tired of it. It's literally exhausting for me to think about now. It's only ignorant people who continue to spread this negativity. People need to educate themselves. Bottom line. I'm just waiting for the day that our American flag is deemed "racist" by ignorant instigators who are just looking for attention and for something to be upset about. It's really getting ridiculous. But a few days later, Fox News opinion columnist Todd Starnes published an article on the subject, reporting what the (unnamed) officer's daughter told him: She showed the bakers a photograph of the police officer’s flag — the black and white version of Old Glory with a blue line. “One of the bakers told me the design could be perceived as racist and nobody feels comfortable decorating the cake,” the police officer’s daughter told me. As an alternative, she suggested a chocolate-frosted cake with a horizontal, frosted blue line. But that design was also rejected by Walmart’s cake decorator. “She said, ‘I don’t feel comfortable doing this,’” the cop’s daughter told me. “I asked her, ‘Is there something wrong with cops?’” After being rejected for a third time, the 21-year-old told the bakers, “I’ll find another bakery, thank you.” This is where the story gets confusing. Reportedly a Walmart manager stepped in and produced the cake requested himself, and although his efforts were less than satisfactory, they had to do because there was no time to obtain a replacement cake: The manager offered to make and decorate a new cake. But there was just one problem — the cake decorators refused to comply. “So the manager told me that he would decorate it — but it looked terrible,” the police officer’s daughter said. “It doesn’t look professional.” I’ve attached photographs of Walmart’s handiwork — it’s absolutely embarrassing and unacceptable. Unfortunately, her father’s retirement party is Sunday night — so there’s no time to go elsewhere. The cake depicted in an attendant photograph was a simple black cake divided in half by a blue horizontal stripe, with the words "Blue Lives Matter" rendered in frosting above and below the stripe. The cake did not include any inscription or decoration featuring the name of the retiring officer, or any reference to retirement: On 24 September 2016 (the date of the putative party) Tyler Wilkes published an update about Walmart's response to the controversy, confusingly reporting that the Walmart manager's offer to step in and make the cake had been turned down because a cake had already been obtained from Kroger, which contradicted the Fox News account stating that the manager had already produced a cake that looked "terrible" but had to be used because "there’s no time to go elsewhere" [for a replacement cake]: Update on the Walmart situation: The manager at Walmart met with my friend's sister and offered to make the cake (which had already been taken care of by Kroger) and apologized for the mistake. He stated that Walmart fully supports law enforcement and donated some extra stuff for the retirement party along with a gift card in lieu of the cake. If you ask me, I think he just did that because, thanks to you all, this got so much attention, and he didn't want it to go farther than it did. The way the meeting was described to me was that it was very scripted and not very sincere. So, although the mistake was "made right," I will still not be shopping at Walmart due to the "quality" of employees they hire. But that's just me. Please share this post just like you shared the other one so that people may get the update and form their own opinion ... Myself as well as my friend, who wishes to remain anonymous, thank you for your continued support in this matter, as well as your unwavering support for law enforcement! #ThinBlueLine #BoycottWalmart Starnes' account claimed that "Walmart has confessed that most of [the daughter's] allegations are true" but merely quoted the same Walmart statement we received, which confirmed only that the customer had been contacted and offered an apology but not any of the details of the issue: Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep ... We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores. We're glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right. Even more confusingly, a Walmart spokesperson told us that the woman had originally ordered a cake with a blue line alone, not a cake bearing the words "Blue Lives Matter" or any other inscribed phrase, and added that the cake seen above was "not the cake" that left the store — as requested, Walmart said, the customer received a cake that simply featured a "thin blue line" and bore no inscription.  In the aftermath of the controversy, the McDonough, Georgia, Walmart's Facebook page was inundated with one-star reviews and angry comments, similar to outrage expressed during a similar controversy over an "ISIS cake."

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 29 September 2016 Wal-Mart in talks to invest up to US$1bil in Flipkart BANGALURU: Wal-Mart Stores Inc is in advanced discussions to invest as much as US$1bil in India’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt, as the two companies battle Amazon.com Inc in e-commerce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, would take a minority stake in Flipkart under the proposed agreement, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still under way, the person said. Flipkart’s most recent valuation was about US$16bil, according to research firm CB Insights. Flipkart is the largest online retailer in India, but its lead has been under assault as Amazon steps up investments in the country. Chief executive officer Jeff Bezos said in June he planned to spend a further US$3bil in India to gain customers in the fast-growing market. A deal with Wal-Mart would give Flipkart additional capital to fight back and more expertise in battling the e-commerce pioneer. “If the deal goes through, the competitive intensity between Flipkart and Amazon will shoot up,” said Gautam Chhaochharia, the Mumbai-based head of India research at UBS AG. The deal has potential benefits for Wal-Mart too. Beyond any eventual financial return on its investment, Wal-Mart would gain exposure to India’s expanding e-commerce market and have the opportunity to challenge Amazon on more equal footing than the US. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said she could not immediately provide comment. A Flipkart spokesman said, “It is our policy not to comment on rumours or speculations.” India is the next big potential retail prize after the US and China, where foreign players have made little progress against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. India’s online market will expand at an average of 45% annually in the next four years and reach US$28bil by 2020, according to estimates from Kotak Institutional Equities. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had earlier established a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group, which runs the country’s largest telecommunications operator Bharti Airtel. But the business failed to take off and Wal-Mart eventually sold its stake to its partner. If a Flipkart deal materialises, Wal-Mart would be able to support its new ally with money and its decades of retail experience. “With its main competitor Amazon getting very aggressive, Flipkart needs a solid partner to bolster its operations with not just capital but also branding, logistics, sourcing and other retail experience, they won’t be able to pull it off with small partners,” said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive officer of the Gurgaon-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight. Amazon has been gaining group with major investments in infrastructure and partnership. The company has committed a total of US$5bil to the India market, including the latest pledge from Bezos. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: flipkart , amazon Related Stories Amazon may bid for stake in Dubai online retailer Souq.com How about six-hour work days?

Schneiderman to implement new quality control measures for its herbal supplements sold nationwide. The announcement made Wednesday comes more than a year after the attorney general ordered Walmart, Walgreens, Target and GNC stores to pull store-brand herbal supplements off their shelves after DNA tests showed few or none of the listed herbs in the products. The findings included NBTY-manufactured supplements sold at Walgreens and Walmart. Most Popular Korean firm leaves Stony Brook, Start-Up NY Mortgage rates jump after Trump election LI vitamin maker NBTY changes its name Chili's manager takes away vet's free meal Zwanger-Pesiri to pay $8M in plea deal Under the agreement, NBTY will phase in DNA bar coding on herbal ingredients within two years and invest no less than $250,000 in herbal authenticity genetic research. The agreement also requires NBTY to implement annual testing to detect allergens, such as peanuts, milk, soy, eggs, and wheat. And it requires ingredient makers to submit to third-party certification and double on-site audits of major suppliers. The attorney general’s office did not find evidence that NBTY failed to comply with FDA requirements or industry standards, NBTY general counsel Stratis Philippis said in a statement. “While it is NBTY’s position that DNA testing of herbal dietary supplements is an emerging science in developmental stages, NBTY and the [attorney general] have a shared commitment to promote the development of the most accurate, reliable standards and testing methods,” Philippis said. “We hope this will help create reliable DNA testing that could be an additional tool for authenticity testing of herbal raw materials for our entire industry.” “When consumers take an herbal supplement, they should be able to do so confident that the plant on the label is the plant in the bottle,” Schneiderman said in a statement. “Consumers can only have that confidence if the companies that sell herbal supplements employ the best and most reliable testing measures for combating fraud and ruling out dangerous allergens.” advertisement | advertise on newsday NBTY’s brands include Sundown Natural, Nature’s Bounty, Pure Protein, Osteo Bi-Flex, and Ester-C.

Home Top 50 How To Magazine Franchise Events Subscribe Did Your Customers Get Tattoos of Your Logo? These Did. KFC | Youtube Rose Leadem Online Editorial Assistant Would you get inked for your favorite brand? You’d be surprised how many people actually answer “yes.” For many people, having a brand’s logo tattooed on them is an embodiment of the impact that company has made on their lives. For others, these logo tattoos are just for “fun.” Check out these 10 companies who have inspired customers to get inked. 1 / 8 Tough Mudder | Twitter Tough Mudder It’s not uncommon for a diehard Tough Mudder competitor -- or even just a fan -- to get inked with the logo. Tough Mudder encourages it. After someone gets the logo tattooed, he or she is instructed to submit a copy of the receipt so they can be awarded free entry to the next Tough Mudder competition. 2 / 8 Anytime Fitness | Twitter Anytime Fitness Much like Tough Mudder, 24-hour fitness franchise Anytime Fitness encourages and reimburses customers who brand their bodies with the “running man” logo. But to Anytime Fitness and its brand evangelists, the tattoo is more than just a logo -- it’s a symbol of their “Anytime Story,” a time when they overcame an obstacle or reached a goal. Since May of this year, more than 3,000 people got Anytime Fitness tattoos. 3 / 8 Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty Images Apple Even though Apple is one of the most popular brands ever, it’s still surprising to see how many people take their loyalty a step further. One loyal fan says he got his Apple tattoo in honor of his wife -- because they shared the same anniversary date as Apple's founding. The Virgin Mary and her sacred Apple tattoo by Sweety Follow @sweetytattoo to see more of… https://t.co/2MbJxDNq3x pic.twitter.com/UIosMgUKCW— NYHC Tattoo (@NYHCtattoo) September 11, 2016 Others -- well -- they must simply love Apple, getting tattoos ranging from the company’s early rainbow-filled logo to MacBook power buttons. Check some out here. 4 / 8 Bloomberg | Getty Images Wal-Mart Apparently, Wal-Mart has a few diehard fans too. The “Save Money. Live Better.” motto must have really spoken to these customers -- at least enough to convince them that a tattoo was in order. If Trump's brand was the sum of all his voters it'd be this Wal Mart tattoo. pic.twitter.com/EeAkCK8Xbx— Kenny Ellsworth (@kenny_ellsworth) June 15, 2016 5 / 8 Stian Ytterdahl | Facebook McDonald’s These people must really be lovin’ it. From golden arches to happy meals -- McDonald’s fans get pretty crafty with their tattoos.   One fan’s “artistic” endeavors even circulated the news. Norwegian teenager Stian Ytterdah got his McDonald’s receipt tattooed on his right arm as a “joke” with his friends. But a week later, he got the same receipt tattooed on his left arm, reports ABC News. 6 / 8 Coca-Cola Coca-Cola Since its bubbly beginnings in 1886, the refreshing beverage brand took the world by storm. It hasn’t lost momentum since. A number of people get the long-lived Coca-cola logo tattooed on their bodies -- but to many it’s more than just a “logo,” it’s a fashion statement. Check out some "refreshing" Cola tattoos here. 7 / 8 KFC | Youtube KFC That “Finger Lickin’ Goodness” is irresistible to some customers, so much so that they decided to get it stamped on their bodies forever. One superfan even agreed to get a KFC Double Down sandwich tattooed on his leg for a commercial. Referred to by KFC as the “Ultimate KFC Double Down Fan,” the unnamed man reminisces about the first time he tried the sandwich while on the first date with his girlfriend. “I guess that’s how it all started,” he says in the video. 8 / 8 John Hawkins via Wordpress Wordpress For Jeff Matson, Wordpress is more than just a web platform: “Wordpress is a way of life,” he states on his blog. Matson says that Wordpress changed his life and taught him that he can do, create and be anything. Wordpress won’t live on forever, Matson says, which is why he got something to remind him of it. Matson’s not the only one who feels this way about Wordpress either. Check out Wordpress’ fan art page for a list of other customers who got the “W” logo inked on their bodies.

So Mwirotsi took action. She drove to Walmart and bought each of them one. As it turned out, the woman and her family were refugees who had been in the United States less than three months. “She had to find a job to pay back her ticket fare, she couldn’t speak or write any English, and she was being kicked out of her place,” Mwirotsi said. “So I set out to help her find a job, and since then, I’ve focused on helping refugee families relocate better.” Mwirotsi started collecting anything that might help ease a family’s transition—from clothes and towels to toiletries and furniture—but quickly realized the children of these families needed something more. The majority of the African children she knew were typically grouped together with African-American children, which Mwirotsi says created a big problem. “They’re not the same thing, and each group has different issues,” she said. “For Africans, English is usually a second language, they are from below-poverty homes with high illiteracy rates and there are usually no high school or college graduates within the home. “The result is that many African kids don’t feel comfortable or fit in at school or after-school programs.” Without direction or a sense of belonging, and because of an often complex set of issues at home, Mwirotsi noticed many refugee children were getting into trouble. So in 2010, she called Freedom for Youth Ministries in Des Moines and asked if she could use their space to start an African dance class for the kids on Saturdays. More than 20 showed up to the first classes and Freedom for Youth adopted it as part of its weekly programming. Mwirotsi saw swift improvements in attitude and behavior from kids who attended, which naturally made her want to do even more. Then she met Pastor John Kline of Zion Lutheran Church and learned that his church was providing ESL [English as a second language] classes, food and clothing to hundreds of refugee kids and their families across Iowa. Each Wednesday evening, the church hosted 200-300 children, offering dinner and activities. Seeing what other members of the community were doing, Mwirotsi—who has always been passionate about education and technology—thought long and hard about how else she could help. “I wanted to help intelligent kids who happened to be refugees by providing opportunities and keeping them in school,” she said. “I wanted to empower them and give them knowledge so that they could create change around them. To me, the model for these kids was: ‘Okay, you came from Africa and a refugee camp. Your opportunities here are a blessing. How can you take advantage of them?’” Her solution for empowerment? Coding. Mwirotsi was already helping her young daughter use Khan Academy, a nonprofit educational website, for coding lessons. She had friends and colleagues focused on technology use in Kenya, and she had recently been inspired by a TEDxVienna talk about SMS-based solutions for smartphones in Africa. Additionally, she knew that some of the best-paying careers were in the STEM fields. Mwirotsi realized that learning coding skills now could open doors for the kids she worked with down the road. The initial problem At first, Mwirotsi had no funding to get a coding class or program like the one she envisioned off the ground. True to her nature, she didn’t let that stop her. “When I have passion for something, I figure out a way to do it,” she said. Late last year, Mwirotsi reached out to local colleges and universities to see if any of them could help. She put together a proposal for the program she had decided to call “Pi 515: Pursuit of Innovation“—515 representing the area code of Des Moines, the home base of many of the refugees she knows—and circulated it to everyone she knew. Initially, Mwirotsi aimed to reach 20 middle and high school refugee students. The goal was to support them as they learned to write computer code for an app or website that would help alleviate hunger or address some unmet community need. In addition, the program also would provide adult mentoring and college prep. A week before Pi 515‘s first class in early April, Mwirotsi panicked. “We didn’t have a teacher yet,” she explained. “We couldn’t pay for one either. I knew the important thing was to get started, though, and we could just focus on the basics at the beginning.” So Mwirotsi continued preparing for the class. Then during a conversation with Matthew Brown—a fellow church-goer at Zion—she happened to mention the new program was in need of a volunteer teacher. Much to Mwirotsi’s surprise, Brown responded that he taught computer science and immediately offered to instruct the class for free. Releasing the burdens of the past, looking to the future Students learn to code through Pi 515, a program for refugee children living in Des Moines.  So far, 35 students are enrolled in Pi 515, but Mwirotsi continues to receive calls from additional parents wanting to sign their kids up. The classes—offered twice a month on Saturday mornings—focus on coding for the first half then bring in community mentors and leaders to speak about relevant topics, such as how to dress for work and what goes into starting a business, for the second half. Mwirotsi eventually hopes to offer classes more frequently and to expand lessons to include even more areas like computer repair. Currently the biggest challenge she faces is cost. As a free program, Pi 515 incurs a lot of hidden expenses that must somehow be covered. “Transportation is coming out of my own pocket, but we can’t afford not to do it…We have to step up,” Mwirotsi said. She also makes sure each child gets something to eat during their classes. “So often, they come and they haven’t had breakfast and maybe they won’t get lunch, and then are they focused? No. So I figure out a way to provide something.” She wanted to hold classes at Creative Visions in Des Moines, but the space wasn’t big enough and there weren’t enough computers. Right now, classes are held at different locations around the city. But for the program to grow to Mwirotsi’s dream size of about 100 students, it’ll need a new home base. She’s still working to secure partnerships with and support from Des Moines University, Grandview University and Des Moines Public Schools. And going forward, Mwirotsi hopes more local mentors and instructors will step up to share their knowledge with her classes. In the meantime, Mwirotsi gives all she can to the kids of Pi 515, utilizing every ounce of support she can gather here in Iowa. She recently brought six high school students—including two brothers who want to be engineers and a young woman interested in becoming a doctor—to the Iowa Youth Institute at the World Food Prize, where they learned how to make biodiesel and dissect corn as well as watched student presentations and spoke with professors about scholarships. One of the students, a 10th-grader named Olive, has already finished all her high school required math courses as well as two advanced math classes. Her plan was to simply to finish high school, but after attending the Institute, she felt inspired to take pre-calculus and consider applying to colleges. “I’m just trying to get them to dream bigger and be inspired to contribute to their world,” Mwirotsi said. “They have to release the burdens of the past and look to the future.” For more information about how to support Pi 515, contact Nancy Mwirotsi. -siliconprairienews.com/ Tweet Filed under Diaspora News, Habari za Nyumbani · Tagged with Comments are closed.

A loss prevention officer said he spotted a woman placing pillow cases, glue and a filter in her purse. She then left the store without paying for the items, valued at nearly $40. Police charged the woman suspect with petty theft in Rocky River Municipal Court. Identity theft, Lorain Road: A woman came to the North Olmsted police station Sept. 19 to report the Citibank fraud department had contacted her about someone opening a credit card in her name. The victim told the bank she never authorized the opening of the account. The bank reportedly told the woman she would not be responsible for the charges. Police said there are no suspects at this time. Criminal mischief, Lorain Road: The manager of the Boston Market restaurant called police about 7 a.m. Sept. 20 to report someone had thrown a rock through a window on a door to the restaurant. The manager discovered the vandalism when arriving in the morning to open. No one appeared to gain entry to the restaurant. Driving under suspension, Lorain Road: Police stopped a car near Columbia Road about 10:30 a.m. Sept. 20 for having expired Colorado license plates.

She was charged with driving under suspension and driving with expired license plates. Petty theft, Great Northern Mall: A Macy's loss prevention employee called police to the store Sept. 20 and reported witnessing an employee take $60 from the cash register and hide it on her person.

The witness asked the man if he intended to drive. The man assured the witness he didn't, but then got into a car and started to drive away. Based on the witness description, police found the car driving erratically on Lorain Road and stopped the driver. A breath test showed his blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit.

EMBED </>More News Videos <iframe width="476" height="267" src="http://abc13.com/video/embed/?pid=1530237" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> A man claims he was denied an Uber ride because of his service dog. (KTRK) KTRK Wednesday, September 28, 2016 NASHVILLE, TN (KTRK) -- An Uber driver has been suspended after allegations that the driver denied an MTSU student a ride after arriving to pick him up, finding out he was blind, and not allowing his guide dog inside of her car. Thomas Jones, who has retinitis pigmentosa, said he takes Uber all the time due to his inability to see well enough to drive. On Sunday, Jones took an Uber to Walmart to get groceries and dog food for his guide dog, Blake, but when he ordered an Uber to leave Walmart, the Uber driver allegedly told Jones that the dog could not ride in the car unless it was in a cage. "Usually when they pull up, I just open the door and he gets in and I get in behind him," Jones said of his dog Blake, during normal Uber rides. Jones said the Uber driver at Walmart ended up canceling his trip and driving away, leaving him stranded with no ride. Jones called police who arrived on scene, and he filed a police report before the officers drove him home. Representatives from Uber said drivers have to review and agree to guidelines before giving rides. One of those guidelines is that service animals should always be allowed in Uber cars. Uber is currently looking into the incident in Murfreesboro with Jones, and if they find that the Uber driver did indeed deny a ride to Jones based on the fact that he had a service dog, then they will revoke the driver's ability to drive for Uber.

Walmart May Invest $1B In Flipkart To Fight Amazon Overseas Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart May Invest $1B In Flipkart To Fight Amazon Overseas September 28, 2016 12:21 pm EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler gaining on Amazon walmart jet.com Flipkart investment retail online retail e-commerce amazon Walmart’s apparent plan to become more like Amazon wasn’t realized when the company launched its $50/year Prime-rival Shipping Pass or after the company snatched up e-commerce site Jet.com for $3.3 billion. But not one to give up, the big box retailer is now reportedly in talks to invest more than $1 billion in fellow Amazon competitor Flipkart.  If the hefty investment becomes a reality, Walmart would become a minority stakeholder in India-based Flipkart, Bloomberg reports, citing the all-powerful “person familiar with the matter.” Flipkart, which is the largest online retailer in India, would gain additional capital to stave off Amazon’s growing presence in the country. Analysts tell Bloomberg that if the deal goes through, the competitive intensity between Flipkart and Amazon would increase significantly. “With its main competitor Amazon getting very aggressive, Flipkart needs a solid partner to bolster its operations with not just capital but also branding, logistics, sourcing and other retail experience, they won’t be able to pull it off with small partners,” Devangshu Dutta, chief executive officer for retail consultancy Third Eyesight, tells Bloomberg. The deal could also prove helpful for Walmart, which stands to increase its exposure in India. Spokespeople for both Walmart and Flipkart did not provide comment on the possible deal.

A 25-year-old Florida man is behind bars after police found him asleep Friday morning in a Walmart parking lot behind the wheel of a stolen truck. Robert Hardister told police he’d borrowed the 1998 black Ford F-150 from a friend to move furniture to his new apartment. He’d paid the friend $20, he said. >> Read more Floridoh! stories  >> Read more trending stories  He parked in the Walmart parking lot to get some sleep before a construction gig later that day. Hardister said he didn’t know the truck was stolen, but police still charged him with vehicle theft. He has pleaded guilty to multiple theft charges and spent time in jail for them in the last few years, court records show. Hardister is being held in the Palm Beach County jail on a $4,500 bond, according to court records. Hardister’s distinctive mug shot shows his face nearly covered in tattoos. If photos from previous bookings in the Palm Beach County Jail are an indication, Hardister appears to have gotten most of the facial ink since Feb. 15, 2013, when he was arrested by Tequesta police for an out of town warrant. In that mugshot, Hardister sports only a tear drop under his right eye and a tattoo on the right side of his neck. Eleven months later when arrested by Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies on a fraud charge, Hardister had added a tattoo to the left side of his neck. Hardister’s mugshot on Feb. 17, 2013, after an arrest on several charges including burglary shows added artwork including a star under his right eye and lettering on his neck, left cheek and chin. By the time Hardister was arrested in July for a probation violation, his face was almost entirely tatted up, leaving only a small area on the right side of his face without ink. Hardister did not show any new markings on his face following his arrest Friday by Jupiter police for alleged vehicle theft. But his hair — brown in previous mugshots — had been bleached blonde.

Bakery workers told the woman the cake was “racist,” to which she wasn’t quite sure how to respond. “I was so shocked,” the woman, who did not want to share her name, said. “I didn’t know what to do or say or anything. I was trying not to lose my temper or make a scene.” The bakery manager ended up making the cake, and the retail giant said in a statement, “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We’re glad we were able to connect with the family to apologize and make this right.” It’s unclear if the workers will face any disciplinary action. [ Fox News ] Filed Under: Gun Bazaar, Police mate556 That is fine.

Have them fired, that is a given. But really, what are the numbers of people that do this in comparison to the numbers that don’t, but have the same opinion and intend to mess with your food. I have never understood why American cops eat out in uniform. Edeco Yeah, lucky they didn’t get a special ingredient. I’m not surprised by cops eating out in uniform… they’re a little myopic about their image, and the places that will give them freebies or fawn over them are, you know, some evidence to believe they’re getting clean food, if one wants to believe and not think too hard about it.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, would take a minority stake in Flipkart under the proposed agreement, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, the person said. Flipkart's most recent valuation was about $16 billion (roughly Rs. 1,06,356 crores), according to research firm CB Insights. Flipkart is the largest online retailer in India, but its lead has been under assault as Amazon steps up investments in the country. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said in June he plans to spend another $3 billion in India to gain customers in the fast-growing market. A deal with Wal-Mart would give Flipkart additional capital to fight back and more expertise in battling the e-commerce pioneer. "If the deal goes through, the competitive intensity between Flipkart and Amazon will shoot up," said Gautam Chhaochharia, the Mumbai-based head of India research at UBS AG.The deal has potential benefits for Wal-Mart too. Beyond any eventual financial return on its investment, Wal-Mart would gain exposure to India's expanding e-commerce market and have the opportunity to challenge Amazon on more equal footing than the US. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said she could not immediately provide comment. A Flipkart spokesman said, "It is our policy not to comment on rumors or speculations." India is the next big potential retail prize after the US and China, where foreign players have made little progress against Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. India's online market will expand at an average of 45 percent annually in the next four years and reach $28 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Kotak Institutional Equities. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had earlier established a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group, which runs the country's largest telecommunications operator Bharti Airtel. But the business failed to take off and Wal-Mart eventually sold its stake to its partner. If a Flipkart deal materializes, Wal-Mart would be able to support its new ally with money and its decades of retail experience. "With its main competitor Amazon getting very aggressive, Flipkart needs a solid partner to bolster its operations with not just capital but also branding, logistics, sourcing and other retail experience, they won't be able to pull it off with small partners," said Devangshu Dutta, chief executive officer of the Gurgaon-based retail consultancy Third Eyesight. Amazon has been gaining group with major investments in infrastructure and partnership. The company has committed a total of $5 billion to the India market, including the latest pledge from Bezos. "They know how to work against competitor Wal-Mart, they will know what to expect," Chhaochharia said. Wal-Mart has been renewing its efforts to battle Amazon online. In August, Wal-Mart agreed to buy Jet.com Inc. for about $3.3 billion and put founder Marc Lore in charge of the combined company's online operations. A Wal-Mart-Flipkart tie up may prompt moves from other competitors in the India market. Alibaba has been funding Snapdeal.com, the third-largest competitor in Indian e-commerce, and has long considered the country a prime expansion opportunity as it seeks to generate half its revenue from outside China. But if Amazon and Wal-Mart both stepping up their investments, Alibaba may have to consider doing the same, either with Snapdeal or on its own. In Alibaba's most recent post-earnings conference call, Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told analysts that India was a prized market where his company has investment in Snapdeal as well as an online payments service and mobile browser. "We're very well strategically positioned in these emerging markets, and that's the start of our international activity," he said at the time. © 2016 Bloomberg L.P.

Commission Votes To Move Forward With Lawsuit Against Walmart Posted: Tuesday, September 27, 2016 8:32 PM EDT Updated: Tuesday, October 4, 2016 8:32 PM EDT By Blayke Roznowski, Reporter BioEmail Connect Biography BlaykeRoznowski@9and10news.com Follow @BlaykeTVNews Leaders in an Upper Peninsula community unanimously decided to sue Walmart. The vote was made during the Chippewa County commission meeting Tuesday night in Sault Ste. Marie. The county has an issue with a state policy called dark store taxes. Big box stores like Walmart can use a loophole so they pay less in property tax. They do this by arguing their purpose-built stores are too big for other businesses, reducing their value. Commissioners say the loophole has cost the county hundreds of thousands of dollars that would've gone to things like police services. The county is still figuring out how much money they can put toward the lawsuit. They hope to have final approval by next week.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Archive Authorities have 'person of interest' in fire at Wal-Mart in Sturbridge Tuesday Sep 27, 2016 at 8:47 PM Sep 28, 2016 at 2:51 PM Steven H. Foskett Jr. Telegram & Gazette Staff @SteveFoskettTG STURBRIDGE - Firefighters and the state fire marshal's office are investigating a fire Tuesday at Wal-Mart at 100 Charlton Road.  Authorities said the fire was determined to have been set, with the investigation moving from an "origin and cause phase" to a criminal phase. No arrests have been made, although investigators have a "person of interest," Fire Lt. Earl J. Dessert said Wednesday morning. The store remained closed Wednesday morning. The building was evacuated and nobody was hurt in the fire. An investigator was there Tuesday to try to determine the cause and origin of the fire with local police and fire investigators, the fire marshal's office said.  According to the Fire Department, around 5:25 p.m., dispatchers received calls from Wal-Mart reporting a fire in the building. A second alarm was struck that brought in more personnel and mutual aid from Southbridge, Charlton, Spencer and Brimfield. The fire was out when police arrived; the incident remained under investigation, the Fire Department said.  The Auburn Fire Department reported on social media that equipment was being brought in from other towns to clear smoke from the building Tuesday night. Erica Jones, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said it was unclear Tuesday night when the store would reopen. She said the store provided security footage to police, and indicated in a statement that the fire was caused by someone in the store.  "We're upset that someone would do something so reckless and dangerous in our store," she said in an emailed statement. "Thankfully, we were able to evacuate and no one is injured. We are grateful to the fire department for their quick response."   Interim Fire Chief Paul D. Ford said Wednesday morning that much work needs to be done before the store can open. “Whenever there is an incident like that, the health department is brought in,” Chief Ford said. “For the most part, all food products have to go and the dry chem creates a lot of mess.” About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Register/Subscribe Subscriber Services T&G E-Edition Worcester Living E-Edition NIE Business Matters Coupon Values FAQ Photo reprints (non-commercial use) Commercial photo licenses Advertising Advertising Contacts Propel Marketing - Digital Marketplace Media Kit Place an Ad Jobs Real Estate Pets Legal Notices News Contact Us Letters to the Editor Submit a Press Release Events Copyright/Terms of Use Marketing About Us Visions Contact Us The Item The Banner Reprints & Licensing Propel Marketing © Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media, LLC.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Jul 16th 2016 9:30AM Whether you've eaten the lobster substitute at Red Lobster, or bought less-than-100% Parmesan cheese from Walmart, the fake food industry probably impacts your life. And, most likely, you didn't even notice it. Larry Olmsted, author of 'Real Food/Fake Food', published an article in Eater on Thursday outlining some of the most common deceptions in the food service industry. Here are three food that raise some of the biggest questions for the expert, as described in the article. 1. Kobe beef The supplies of Kobe beef are so low that, according to Olmsted, more than 99% of supposed "Kobe beef" sold in the US is simply a lie. Since Kobe beef costs more than $20 an ounce, if you're purchasing something that isn't absurdly expensive that is supposedly made of Kobe beef, you're probably being scammed. 2. Red snapper According to an expert involved in DNA species testing, 94% of the time you order fish labeled red snapper, it is actually a different fish. Olmsted says that New York sushi restaurant Sushi Nakazawa refuses to serve red snapper because the risk of fraud from suppliers is too high. A rule of thumb: if the fish is expensive and you haven't seen it displayed whole, there's a good chance it's an imitation. And, even then, it's hard to differentiate between wild-caught and farmed fish. 3. Truffles Real truffles are trendy, prized, and extremely rare. If it's not shaved in front of you, your truffle is likely simply a chemical combination — especially if it's marketed as "truffle oil."

Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Bengaluru/New York: Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is in advanced discussions to invest as much as $1 billion into India’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt. Ltd, as the two companies battle Amazon.com Inc. in e-commerce, according to a person familiar with the matter. Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, would take a minority stake in Flipkart, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Final terms of the deal have not been worked out and negotiations are still underway, the person said. Flipkart’s most recent valuation was $16 billion, according to research firm CB Insights. Flipkart is the largest online retailer in India, but its lead has been under assault as Amazon steps up its investments in the country. Chief executive officer Jeff Bezos said in June that he plans to spend another $3 billion in the country to gain customers in the fast-growing market. Also read: Has Flipkart lost No 1 slot to Amazon? The deal could benefit both Wal-Mart and Flipkart. The Indian retailer would get access to much-needed capital as funding becomes more difficult to obtain in the country, while Wal-Mart would gain exposure to India’s expanding e-commerce market and challenge Amazon on more equal footing than in the US. Flipkart declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart said she could not immediately provide comment. After the US and China, India is the next big online retail market and both Amazon and Wal-Mart have been pursuing the opportunity. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart earlier had a retail joint venture in India with Bharti Group, which runs the country’s largest telecommunications operator Bharti Airtel. But the venture failed to take off and Wal-Mart eventually sold its stake to its partner. The rate of growth in traditional retail has been modest. But Kotak Institutional Equities recently estimated that online retail will average 45% annual growth rates in the next four years and touch $28 billion by 2020.

Gambone / Hesperia Star Hair’s the thing. When it comes to wigs and other supplies designed to keep your mane looking beautiful, no store in the area carries a wider selection than Hair Emporium in Victorville, according to its owner Omar Lago. For the past 25 years, Omar and his wife Paula’s business has been supplying top-quality products at reasonable prices, as well as personalized service to area residents. “Our very first shop was called Earrings & Things and we were next to Sally’s Beauty Supply in the Von’s shopping center on Bear Valley Road,” said Lago, a native of Los Angeles. “Customers from Sally’s would come into the shop and request that we carry wigs and hair extensions. “Paula and I started looking into it and started bringing those products into our store. Before long, we realized we needed a larger space.” Lago and Paula went on to open Hair Emporium in the same shopping center that housed the old Wal-Mart store on Bear Valley Road and Balsam Avenue. Lago admits that when the chain’s store closed three years ago, he and his wife experienced a decline in sales. “The closure of Wal-Mart definitely affected us,” said Lago. “But we found a spot that’s far bigger and better.” Hair Emporium is now located in the Bear Valley Plaza Shopping Center at 12475 Mariposa Road. According to Lago, the space is significantly larger than the former location and much more accessible. “This new store is big and spacious and our customers just love coming in here,” said Lago. “And you can see us from the freeway, which makes us much easier to find.” Along with wigs and extensions, Hair Emporium sells a variety of other products and accessories, such as makeup, shampoos and conditioners, fashion scarves, jewelry, barrettes and scrunchies. In addition, it offers a selection of hair adornments for youngsters. “We are very well established and work with 20 different distributors,” said Lago. “Customers are amazed when they come in for the first time and see all that we have to offer.” Lago said Hair Emporium will be expanding again in the near future by adding a salon inside the store. It will offer everything from wig fittings to haircuts to hair extension applications. “We’re very excited about the salon and hope to make an announcement soon about the date we will officially open,” Lago said. Hair Emporium is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. The store offers a 5 percent discount for seniors, as well as a 10 percent discount for military personnel, cosmetologists and chemotherapy patients.

Woman falls from moving car at Wal-Mart; Port St. Lucie man arrested Jan Lindsey, Special to Treasure Coast Newspapers 5:09 p.m. EDT September 27, 2016 David Alexander Squitieri (Photo: CONTRIBUTED PHOTO BY ST. LUCIE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE) 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINEMAILMORE PORT ST. LUCIE — A Port St. Lucie man was arrested Monday after an altercation during which he drove through a Wal-Mart parking lot with a woman hanging from his car, according to Port St. Lucie Police. David Alexander Squitieri, 27, of the 400 block of Southeast Thornhill Drive, was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, records show. He was being held Tuesday at the St. Lucie County Jail in lieu of a $15,000 bond. The 48-year-old Port St. Lucie woman sustained a head injury, cuts and scrapes when she fell from the moving car about 4:15 p.m. in the parking lot of the store in the 1800 block of Southwest Gatlin Boulevard, according to a Port St. Lucie Police arrest affidavit. She was treated at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center in Fort Pierce. The woman had agreed to return items to Wal-Mart for Squitieri in exchange for $20, according to an arrest affidavit. An argument erupted after she received a $150 gift card for the returned items, the affidavit states. Squitieri grabbed the card and ran to his car with the woman following. He started driving before the woman could get fully inside the vehicle, drove about 100 yards before she hit the pavement, and then left, the affidavit states.

(Pennsville Police Department) Print Email Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com By Bill Gallo Jr. | For NJ.com Today's Sunbeam Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 27, 2016 at 2:29 PM, updated September 27, 2016 at 4:12 PM comments PENNSVILLE TWP. — Police are seeking the public's help in a finding a woman they say is preying on the elderly and stealing their credit cards. Pennsville authorities have released several images of the suspect taken by surveillance cameras at the Pennsville Walmart, Pennsville Acme and Penns Grove Rite-Aid— all places she is using the stolen credit cards to make purchases. Store surveillance camera images from businesses in Salem County show two vehicles used by a woman Pennsville police want to question in the theft and use of credit cards belonging to the elderly. (Pennsville Police Department)   The woman was captured on a Walmart surveillance camera reaching into a woman's purse and removing a credit card, police said. The woman has been using numerous stolen credit cards — all believed to have been taken from elderly females — to buy goods. Authorities believe she follows her victims around a store, makes small talk with them and, when she gets the chance, removes their credit cards/wallets without the victims' knowledge. The suspect is also wanted by New Castle County, Delaware, police for using a credit card stolen from there to make purchases in Salem County, Pennsville authorities say. The wanted woman has apparently been using two different vehicles — one a four-door white Pontiac G6 and the other a dark colored, possibly dark gray, Ford Expedition that may be registered in New Jersey. Authorities also released photo of those vehicles. Anyone with any information or who can identify this person is asked to contact Det. Michael Gibison of the Pennsville Police Department at 856-678-3089 Ext. 504. Bill Gallo Jr. may be reached at bgallo@njadvancemedia.com. Follow Bill Gallo Jr. on Twitter @bgallojr.

(WXIA) – A McDonough, Georgia Walmart is facing a backlash after employees there refused to make a “Blue Lives Matter” cake for a retiring police officer, and the story is going viral. The officer’s daughter said it was a cake for the officer’s retirement party, after serving for 25 years. She said the store’s refusal left her puzzled and devastated. Jordan Harkins said employees initially declined her request. After a friend posted about the incident on Facebook, a manager called her to apologize and make the cake. Walmart’s corporate communications department also issued an apology. Here is the following statement: “Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores.” “It doesn’t make up for the fact that it should have never happened in the first place,” Harkins said.   Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Reddit Pinterest Google Tumblr More Send to Kindle LinkedIn Pocket Like this: Like Loading...

Rase  BAY CITY, MI — Police are alleging a 17-year-old stole a handgun from a car, then was lured into an arrest with the prospect of meeting up with a prostitute. At about 9:15 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 25, a Bay County sheriff's deputy responded to a motor vehicle break-in complaint in the 3700 block of Wheeler Road in Bangor Township. The complainant said a brick had been thrown through the front passenger window of his Jeep Sahara and his 9mm Glock stolen, court records show. The man went on to tell the deputy the gun had been between the driver seat and the emergency brake, though its butt would have been visible from outside, court records show. The deputy found two bricks in the Sahara and what appeared to be blood. The complainant's girlfriend also told the deputy her purse was stolen from the Sahara. She added someone had attempted to use two of her stolen credit cards at the Bangor Township Walmart at about 7 a.m., court records show. The deputy also seized a camouflage cooler at the scene, which the complainants said was not theirs. The cooler contained keys, shoes, chargers, and pill bottles, one of which bore the name Brady J. Rase, court records show. A neighbor at the scene also told the deputy his GMC Sierra had also been rifled and a bag of change was missing from its glovebox, court records show. The deputy went to Walmart and viewed surveillance camera footage. The footage depicted what appeared to be Rase using the stolen credit cards in an attempt to buy a holster. When the cards were declined, he paid for the holster in cash, court records show. Police went to Rase's house. His mother told them he came home at about 5:30 a.m. with what appeared to be a woman's bag. At about 7 a.m., his stepfather dropped him off at Walmart, the mother told police. Police searched Rase's bedroom and found shards of glass, bloody tissues, the woman's stolen purse containing her wallet and passport, and car keys belonging to another resident in the 3700 block of Wheeler Road, court records show. Bay County Central Dispatch pinged Rase's cellphone, the results of which indicated he was in Bay City. A Bay City police officer then messaged Rase via Facebook, posed as a prostitute, and asked him to meet up at a local hotel, court records show. Police went to the hotel and encountered Rase, the stolen gun holstered on his right hip, court records show. Also in his possession were the woman's credit cards, court records show. Rase on Monday, Sept. 26, appeared in Bay County District Court for arraignment on three counts of felony firearm and single counts of larceny of a firearm, breaking and entering a vehicle causing damage, and carrying a concealed weapon. Rase is to appear for a preliminary examination before District Judge Timothy J. Kelly at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 12.

The $99 device will go on sale in late October at various retailers, including Walmart. The hub works with many smart home protocols and devices to control a variety of smart locks, lights, and other products. With that $30 price increase comes some new upgrades. In addition to the Bluetooth Low Energy, Kidde, Lutron Clear Connect, Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and ZigBee support, the new hub has a more powerful Wi-Fi radio and Ethernet port. It also has a Thread radio, so it will one day work with Google-backed protocol. Related: Control4 debuts Alexa integration, making your smart home a whole lot smarter The hub is also designed to be very user-friendly. Nathan Smith, Wink founder and chief technology officer, told Digital Trends it’s one of the reasons the company wanted to partner with Walmart:He says just about anyone can set it up and get it working, even those who don’t consider themselves gadget-lovers. For one thing, the redesigned app automatically detects the hub when you plug it in. If the hub is having problems connecting a device you’re setting up, it will still be communicating with your phone. “Everyone’s had that experience where they’re setting up one of these products and they’re looking at the little spinner and wondering, will this work, will this not work?” says Smith. Instead of giving you a generic message saying setup failed, the app will let you know exactly what’s wrong and point you to the troubleshooting guide. For those current Wink users who want to update to the new hub, there’s also a new backup system that allows you to port over all your existing devices and scenes. “It’s a lot easier than walking around your house and trying to find every device you’ve connected,” says Smith. While the hub itself doesn’t have voice-recognition technology, it does work with Amazon’s Alexa. “In order to get full advantage out of these products and maintaining a  connected home, you need sort of a mesh of different types interfaces,” says Smith. “We don’t really think pulling out your phone, unlocking it, and going into an app is always the right way to operate something.” Voice is great for command and control, he says, while wearables are great for seeing status updates, and phones work well for setup and configuration. In April 2015, Wink replaced affected hubs when an update bricked some devices. Smith says the new hub is better and more secure but admits it may take time to win back trust. “At the end of the day, all you can do is try to move forward after there’s any setback and try to learn from it,” said Smith. “It’s a tricky industr,y the same way it was tricky at the advent of the web. It’s just constant refinement and user research.”

Cahalan was recently honored with a $490 gift card and iPad from Walmart as part of its Commander in Teach(ers) program. Walmart estimates that teachers spend about that much out of their own pocket during a school year. Cahalan has been with the district for 19 years. She was nominated by school principal Cynthia Meszaros. Taylor Walmart manager Aaron Quimby and co-manager David Williams made the presentation.

 Consumer confidence surges to post-recession high Elena Holodny Sep. 27, 2016, 9:38 AM 1,397 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shoppers look at merchandise at a Walmart store in Secaucus, New Jersey Thomson Reuters Consumer confidence just surged to its highest level since the recession. The latest reading on consumer confidence from the Conference Board came in at 104.1 for September, up from the prior month's 101.8. The index touched 105.6 in August 2007, according Joe LaVorgna, chief US economist at Deutsche Bank. Meanwhile, economists had forecast that the index dropped to 99.0 this month, according to the Bloomberg consensus. “Consumers’ assessment of present-day conditions improved, primarily the result of a more positive view of the labor market," said Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. The report noted that consumers are  feeling better about jobs: the proportion of those expecting more jobs in the upcoming months rose to 15.1% from 14.4%, and the proportion of those expecting less jobs dropped to 17.0% from 17.5%. Moreover, those expecting a drop in incomes to decreased to 10.3% from 11.0%. However, those expecting incomes to increase dropped to 17.1% from 18.5%. "Consumers are not buying into 'doom and gloom' right now. It is amazing that the election is as close as it is ... " wrote Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta in a note after the report.

EST September 27, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST MCDONOUGH, GA -- A Georgia Walmart is facing a backlash after employees there refused to make a "Blue Lives Matter" cake for a retiring police officer. The officer's daughter says it was a cake for the officer's retirement party, after serving for 25 years. She says the store's refusal left her puzzled and devastated. A viral social media post has put the store in the spotlight. Taylor Wilkes, a police officer, created the Facebook post, which has received 4,700 shares. She created the post after hearing after hearing what happened to her friend, Jordan Harkins, who wanted a Blue Lives Matter cake made for her father, a retiring police officer. "I don't see how a thin blue line on a cake can be perceived as racist," Wilkes said. Our sister station WXIA 11Alive News reached out to Harkins via Facetime and asked what the store's employees told her. "She said she didn't feel comfortable making that cake," Harkins said. Harkins said employees initially declined her request, saying the cake might offend some people. After the social media post spread, Harkins said a manager called her to apologize and make the cake. 11Alive News talked with the Walmart manager, who said they fixed the problem. A representative from Walmart's Corporate Communications Department sent the following statement: "Our goal is to always take care of customers. But, sometimes we misstep. We have addressed this issue with everyone involved and are taking steps to make sure no other customers have this kind of experience in our stores." "It doesn't make up for the fact that it should have never happened in the first place," Harkins said. She says she was able to take the cake they finally made to her dad's retirement party. A Walmart spokesperson says they're glad they were able to get in touch with the family to apologize for what happened.

(Photo: Andrew Burton, Getty Images) Herbal supplements marketed by one of the nation's top suppliers will soon undergo stricter screening to ensure they contain the products their labels promise consumers. NBTY, which sells ginseng, ginkgo biloba and nearly 22,000 other products under popular brands such as Solgar and Nature's Bounty, agreed to the testing in an agreement announced Wednesday by New York state's top law enforcement official. The company is the third to enact plans for screening that exceeds federal standards since a 2015 study commissioned by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman failed to confirm the presence of genetic material for many of the plants depicted on labels of many herbal supplements sold at GNC, Target, Walgreens and Walmart stores. Instead, the study showed the pills contained inexpensive fillers, such as powdered rice. The findings covered some NBTY-manufactured supplements sold at Walgreens and Target. Schneiderman's office demanded that the companies stop selling the products, and subsequently reached agreements with GNC and Nature's Way. "When consumers take an herbal supplement, they should be able to do so confident that the plant on the label is the plant in the bottle, and that every reasonable precaution was taken to ensure the product's authenticity and purity," Schneiderman said in a statement announcing the similar NBTY agreement. AMERICA&#039;S MARKETS 14 AGs seek herbal supplements industry review In a written response, NBTY General Counsel Stratis Philippis said, “We are pleased that through cooperation and mutual understanding we have reached an agreement with the New York Attorney General.” Philippis said that there was "no evidence" the company "deviated or failed to comply with FDA requirements or industry standards" and that "DNA testing of herbal dietary supplements is an emerging science." "We hope this will help create reliable DNA testing that could be an additional tool for authenticity testing of herbal raw materials for our entire industry going forward,” he said. The tougher safeguards will include: ► DNA barcoding, a scientific technique used to verity the identity and presence of plant species. NBTY agreed to start the testing on herbal supplements within two years.  ► An annual testing protocol to detect potential allergens, including peanuts, milk, soy, eggs and wheat, in finished herbal products. ► Doubling the number of on-site audits of the company's major ingredient suppliers. ► Investing at least $250,000 in herbal authenticity genetic research. Based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., NBTY employs more than 11,000 associates worldwide and has manufacturing, packaging, warehouse, distribution and administration facilities across the United States and Canada. The company was acquired in 2010 by The Carlyle Group, one of the world's largest private equity firms.

Business Chicago loses major food trade show at McCormick Place FMI Connect Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune PepsiCo offers product samples for guests at the FMI Connect trade show on June 21, 2016, at McCormick Place in Chicago. The Food Marketing Institute has said it will cancel its 2017 trade show. PepsiCo offers product samples for guests at the FMI Connect trade show on June 21, 2016, at McCormick Place in Chicago. The Food Marketing Institute has said it will cancel its 2017 trade show. (Phil Velasquez / Chicago Tribune) Corilyn ShropshireContact ReporterChicago Tribune Chicago has lost one of its bigger trade shows, as the Food Marketing Institute said Wednesday it is pulling the plug on an event that traditionally has drawn thousands of food manufacturers and retailers from around the world to the city. In announcing its decision to cancel FMI Connect, scheduled for June 2017, FMI President and CEO Leslie Sarasin said the group needed to refocus its event strategy after the trade show "has fallen short of achieving the precise formula necessary for meeting today's industry needs." This year's show brought 6,500 attendees and 490 exhibitors to Chicago, but attendance was down from past years, said David Fikes, vice president of communications at Arlington, Va.-based FMI. "It was reflective of the food retail industry going through some massive changes in the last 10 years," Fikes said. The number of places where food is being sold has expanded in recent years, from supermarkets to megamarkets such as Target and Wal-Mart, pharmacies such as CVS and Walgreens, and online. "The trade show that was so important to the industry in previous years didn't seem to be as vibrant a place for (our members) to come and conduct business," he said. Chicago hosted the trade show 24 times from the early 1980s to 2007 before it moved elsewhere. The 2008 show was in Las Vegas. In 2012, organizers announced the show would return to Chicago in 2014. Fikes said the hope was that coming back to Chicago might be the "magic" it needed to draw more attendees. However, it was not to be, Fikes said, although he could not provide figures on how much attendance has declined in recent years. A few other food industry associations that plan their trade shows to coincide with FMI Connect said they have no plans to cancel their events in Chicago next year. The United Fresh Produce Association and the Global Cold Chain Alliance both said they intend to proceed with their events set for June. The Global Cold Chain Expo has grown so large that it has moved to McCormick Place's West Building. "We're growing from 28,000 to 42,000 square feet of space," said spokesman James Rogers. FMI Connect in 2016 occupied more than 200,000 square feet at McCormick Place. The cold chain group, which represents businesses that provide distribution and other services for the temperature-controlled food industry, has seen more interest as customer preferences turn to fresh foods, such as produce and fresh meat. Choose Chicago, the city's tourism bureau, and the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, which owns and operates McCormick Place, did not respond to requests for comment about the loss of the FMI show. crshropshire@tribpub.com Twitter @corilyns Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Microsoft canceling conference a 'significant loss' for Chicago in 2016 McCormick Place stepping up security in wake of terror attacks Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 61°

According to a Bloomberg report, food prices have now fallen for nine straight months in the US, marking the longest streak since the 1960s with the exception of the 2009 financial crisis. The reason for cheaper food is attributed to low oil and grain prices, not to mention intense competition from discount grocers and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT), which is leading the way with pushing down prices to steal market share from other grocers but at the expense of their profit margins. Meanwhile, shares of Kroger Co (NYSE: KR) hit a new 52-week low of $29.81 on Wednesday. The company reported its Q2 results earlier this month in which sales fell short of expectations and management provided a poor outlook. Related Link: Kroger Shares Lower As Q2 Sales Miss, Outlook Reduced Jennifer Bartashus, analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said food pricing is starting to "border on irrational pricing." Stores are "lowering prices just to draw traffic, without thinking about their margins." Either way, consumers are the big winner in a food deflation audience. "The severity of what we're seeing is completely unprecedented," Scott Mushkin, an analyst at Wolfe Research who has studied grocery prices around the country for more than ten years told Bloomberg.

Life & Style Books Onetime Chicagoan eyes violence through shooting deaths of 10 young people ‘Another Day in the Death of America’ "Another Day in the Death of America" by Gary Younge. "Another Day in the Death of America" by Gary Younge. Lloyd SachsChicago Tribune On Nov. 23, 2013, 10 kids between the ages of 9 and 19, in places ranging from Houston to Charlotte, N.C., to our despairing, ever-in-mourning Chiraq, died of gunshot wounds. Seven of them were black, three Hispanic and one white. They died in circumstances ranging from a gang retaliation to a hunting accident to the worst kind of home invasion: a random bullet flying through a window and into the head of the young victim. Had Gary Younge chosen to write about one of those killings, or two, the emotional payoff of his uncomfortably titled "Another Day in the Death of America" would be powerful enough. Take the death of 9-year-old Jaiden Dixon, who after responding to the doorbell in his home in Grove City, Ohio — a suburb of Columbus named "best hometown" in the central part of the state — was fatally shot in the head by the man who fathered his brother Jarid. RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR The shooter, who had a death wish, got it answered when, after driving to nearby Groveport to fatally shoot the long-estranged mother of his 18-year-old daughter, went down in a hail of bullets in a Wal-Mart parking lot in a case of "suicide by cop." Jaiden, a lover of animals and computer games who liked playing "glide" with his best friend Sidney — the game involved jumping off a platform with an open umbrella — would never get up to play it again. Or take the death of 18-year-old Tyshon Anderson, who died in a four-story walkup on East 80th Street in South Chicago, around the corner from his home, when someone walked up to him on the stairway and shot him in the head. Described in a news report as a "typical teenager" and steeped in the gang life, Tyshon was just out from his latest stint in prison and, according to his grandfather, was "trying to get his life straightened out." "The pathos in this account," writes Younge, "is in the assumption that had he been in prison he would still be alive." Gary Younge Linda Nylind photo Gary Younge, author of "‘Another Day in the Death of America." Gary Younge, author of "‘Another Day in the Death of America." (Linda Nylind photo) An editor-at-large for the London-based Guardian newspaper and a columnist for the Nation whose previous books include "The Speech: The Story Behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Dream," Younge called Chicago home from 2011-15 after spending time as the Guardian's New York correspondent. One of the saddest aspects of "Another Day in the Death of America" is its lack of surprise. Even the revelation from a Lawndale woman speaking to the Tribune) that "even some of the dogs had ceased barking at the sound of gunfire" elicits little more than a half-raised eyebrow. Chicago, and too many other cities, have become so numbed by the frequency of these killings — seven a day, reports Younge, and this dated statistic does not include the mass shootings that get most of the attention before inevitably fading from the mass consciousness — that many of them don't even get reported. "Another Day in the Death of America" is not a book geared toward penetrating the walls of detachment and even indifference that everyday citizens build to deal (or not deal) with the violence. The walls that allow many people in starkly segregated Chicago, for example, to brush off reports of the latest tragedies in the kill zones where African-Americans and Hispanics are at such grave risk. Younge's anecdotal style has a measured strength. A story about an ill-fated Indianapolis youth, told against the backdrop of the annual National Rifle Association convention in that city ("Nine Acres of Guns and Gear"), occasions a level discussion of gun control. The assassination of 18-year-old Pedro Cortez in San Jose, Calif., for daring to wear the wrong color shows how the epidemic of "senseless" killings afflicts communities of all ethnic colors. The author's difficulty in finding and questioning relatives of the young shooting victims proves a stumbling block he can't always get past. "One should be cautious when drawing conclusions about people's characters from social media," he acknowledges, but Facebook "moments" play a sizable role in his accounts — nowhere more unsettling than in his telling of the shooting of 16-year-old Houston kid Edwin Rajo by his best friend, Camilla, a member of the Southwest Cholos gang. She thought there were no bullets in her gun, her first, when she pointed it at Edwin, agreeing to his request to "make out like you're gonna shoot me." On the day after the tragedy, she posted, "life's a b---- i don't (want it) to end like this." There's not much that Younge, or anyone, with any amount of access, could add to that.

(The Huntsville Times/Eric Schultz) ( ) By  Dennis Pillion | dpillion@al.com AL.com Email the author Follow on Twitter on September 28, 2016 at 3:57 PM, updated September 29, 2016 at 7:02 AM Print Email Alabama Power Company posted a request for proposals this week for renewable energy projects that could bring additional solar, wind, geothermal or other kinds of renewable energy to Alabama.  Alabama's largest utility has announced more than 90 megawatts of solar power projects since late last year, and John Kelley, Alabama Power's director of forecasting and resource planning, said the company wanted to weigh its options for additional renewable energy projects in the future. "Alabama Power supports renewable energy, where it makes sense for our customers," Kelley said in a news release announcing the RFP. "Renewable markets change a lot, and this proposal gives us a chance to see what may be out there in the 2017 and 2018 time frame." Last year the utility received approval from the Alabama Public Service Commission to develop up to 500 megawatts of renewable energy projects, and has since moved forward with a handful of those, including solar power installations at Anniston Army Depot and Fort Rucker and a 72 megawatt solar farm in Chambers County developed with Walmart. Those projects were planned with specific customers in mind, to meet the customers' renewable energy goals.  Walmart has a long-term goal of being supplied by 100 percent renewable energy, and aims to produce or procure 7 billion kilowatt hours of renewable power by 2020. The U.S. Department of Defense aims to offset 25 percent of the power used in all its facilities with renewable generation by 2025, and the Army, Navy and Air Force have been instructed to secure one gigawatt of renewable energy each. Alabama Power's RFP calls for several kinds of renewable projects including solar, wind, geothermal, tidal or ocean current projects, low-impact hydro, gas derived from sewage treatment processes, gas derived from solid municipal waste or landfill projects, hydrogen sourced from renewable resources, biomass materials and/or gases derived from biomass materials. The projects could range in size from 5 to 80 MW, and could be "turnkey" proposals that Alabama Power would own upon completion, or power purchase agreements lasting 10 or 25 years. In addition to its own resources, Alabama Power purchases substantial amounts of wind energy from facilities in the Midwest.  Alabama Power spokesman Michael Sznajderman said via email that any projects selected through the RFP process would count under the 500 megawatt certificate received last year. Individual projects would still have to be approved by the PSC. Notice of intent to bid must be received by 6 p.m. CDT on Oct. 14, 2016. Completed bids must be received by 6 p.m. CST on Nov. 15, 2016.

The man started yelling obscenities when he was allowed to put on shoes but no socks before being removed from the residence. Monday, Sept. 19 • Police observed a man without socks or shoes walking along Briarwood Drive, and when questioned, he said he was waiting for his girlfriend who was getting a coffee at Tim Hortons. When police asked him if a girl walking away from Tim Hortons was who he was waiting for, he said yes, then denied it when he realized she was walking in the wrong direction. Searching his car, police allegedly found Dilaudid, oxycodone pills, heroin and cocaine, along with needles and red and white envelopes used to package heroin. Tuesday, Sept. 20 • A car parked at Motel 6 had matching plates to a warrant out for a man, which was confirmed by the West Seneca Police Department. Police found the man staying in a room at the motel. • Police pulled over a woman driving along Broadway for failing to signal a turn. The woman reportedly had packages used to distribute heroin in her car, and a further search of the vehicle allegedly found packages containing fentanyl and a hypodermic needle. • Two women were reportedly caught shoplifting at the Wal-Mart on Transit Road, allegedly attempting to remove the tags from merchandise before storing items in shopping carts. One woman was caught first while the other abandoned her cart and attempted to exit the store. Both women were transported to the police station, and their car was towed. Wednesday, Sept. 21 Police pulled over a man for having blue lights around his license plate. The man’s license was suspended, and he had a stay-away order of protection from the woman in the passenger seat. Depew Monday, Sept. 19 • A man who recently purchased a truck was worried about getting pulled over after finding a bullet in the center console. Police advised the man who brought his truck to the station to check for any more bullets and hand them over to police. • Police pulled over a man driving 35 mph in a 20-mph school zone along Transit Road. The man’s license was suspended due to eight previous incidents. Tuesday, Sept. 20 • While waiting for the school bus to pick up his son on St. Mary’s Street, a man observed a driver pass the bus while it was stopped with red lights flashing. Police followed up with a man matching the description of the driver, who denied what was said. Video footage and a statement taken from the bus driver confirmed that the man blamed for the incident was guilty. • Police responded to a report of an unresponsive man at Columbia Avenue. The man was found deceased in the basement. There was no sign of foul play. Wednesday, Sept. 21 • A company in Colorado sent $16,000 worth of tech merchandise to an address on Terrace Boulevard after receiving purchase orders.

Thursday, Sept. 22 • A man believes his sister in-law and her daughter went to his residence in the middle of the night to tape something to his vehicle, as they allegedly did something similar in the past. In the morning, the man noted several scratches to the tailgate of his truck and a cosmetic bag was found near the truck, which the man believes is the sister-in-law’s. • While driving under the viaduct along Transit Road just past Walden Avenue, a woman heard a loud noise on top of her vehicle as she passed under the bridge. The noise was caused by something hitting the car’s sunroof. Police believe the impact was caused by someone throwing things off the bridge or due to decay of the bridge itself. Friday, Sept. 23 • Police responded to complaints of suspicious activity on Walden and Bissell avenues. A business owner said his employee found a balloon along Bissell Avenue containing what police believe to be cocaine.

The notes will be guaranteed by its subsidiary Distribuidora Liverpool, S.A. de C.V and will rank pari passu with all of Liverpool's and its subsidiary unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. Net proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and a portion of the purchase price of Liverpool's recent acquisitions. A full list of the company's ratings is provided at the end of this release. In Fitch's view, Liverpool's recent acquisitions will strengthen the company's business position by expanding its target market and geographic footprint, positioning it as a relevant player within the Latin American region in terms of scale and purchasing power. Fitch revised Liverpool's Rating Outlook to Stable from Positive on Aug. 11, 2016, reflecting Fitch's view that a rating upgrade for Liverpool will be unlikely in the next 12 months as the company will increase its debt levels enough to fund the acquisition of Suburbia and a percentage of Ripley Corp. S.A.'s (Ripley) equity. Fitch believes these agreements will not have an impact on Liverpool's 'BBB+' rating given its solid balance sheet and current low leverage. The addition of Suburbia to Liverpool's portfolio should strengthen its business position in the medium- to low-income segment, create opportunities to capture synergies, and open the possibility to expand its financial business to Suburbia. On Aug. 10, 2016, Liverpool announced it reached an agreement with Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (Walmex) to acquire 100% of Suburbia for MXN19 billion. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017 and needs approval by the antitrust commission. The company plans to fund the MXN19 billion-transaction with a combination of cash and debt and Fitch does not foresees any material acquisition until leverage returns to historical levels. In July 2016, Liverpool entered into an agreement to make a public bid for at least 25.5% and up to 100% of the traded shares of Ripley. The value to be paid could range between USD310 million and USD580 million, depending on the percentage of the public shareholders' acceptance. Fitch's base case takes into account that Liverpool will get a minority stake of Ripley and will account for this investment by the equity method. KEY RATING DRIVERS Liverpool's ratings reflect the company's leading business position in Mexico, geographic diversification, and multiple store formats, all of which support its consistently positive operating cash flow generation and ample financial flexibility. In addition, the consumer finance division and the real estate portfolio strengthens its existing retail operations. For the first six months of 2016, sales through own credit cards accounted for approximately 42.6% of consolidated revenue and Liverpool owns approximately 83% of its retail space. Strong Market Position Liverpool is the leader in the middle-, middle-high and high-income segment of department stores in Mexico. During the last 12 months (LTM) ended June 30, 2016, the company's retail revenues reached MXN83.5 billion, 13.6% above 2015. As of June 2016, the company operates 113 stores across 57 cities throughout Mexico: 80 under the name of Liverpool, 29 Fabricas de Francia, and four stores in the format Liverpool Duty Free. Around 80% of total units are owned by Liverpool. The company also has 25 shopping malls operating in 16 cities and owns a non-controlling 50% stake in Regal Forest Holding Co., which has 14 different store brands selling consumer durable products in 20 countries around Central and South America and the Caribbean. Regal Forest investment is recorded under the equity method of accounting. Format and Business Diversification Provides Stable Cash Flow: Liverpool has a diversified revenue base; for the LTM ended June 2016, 87.3% of total revenues were contributed by its retail segment, 9.7% from its financial services division and 3.1% from real estate. During the first half of 2016, retail total segment revenues grew 13.6% compared to the same period the year before, while same store sales (SSS) grew 9.1%, slightly below the average of 9.2% average for department store growth cited by the Asociacion Nacional de Tiendas de Autoservicio y Departamentales (ANTAD). Fitch believes that the company is well positioned to continue its business strategy given the current demographic and socioeconomic fundamentals in Mexico, with a growing middle class, low inflation rates, higher real wages and higher remittances due to the peso depreciation. Consumer Credit Division Supports Retail Business Fitch positively factors into Liverpool ratings the funding of its credit card portfolio which has been historically with internal generated funds and has presented an effective loan portfolio management through the business cycles. During challenging economic times with high unemployment rates, Liverpool has restricted its credit offering and the limits of existing customers' credit lines to avoid excessive portfolio growth and high non-performing loan (NPL) rates. The company has an average NPL index of 3.7% during the last five years and it has not been above 5% of the total gross loan portfolio. As of June 30, 2016, Liverpool had approximately 4.1 million credit card accounts. Its net credit card portfolio of MXN28.7 billion covers its debt by 2.0x and considering Fitch's total pro forma debt related to acquisitions, the same portfolio would cover it by 0.7x. Recent Acquisitions Pressure Liverpool's Credit Metrics: Fitch believes Liverpool's credit metrics, after the acquisition of Suburbia and investment in Ripley, will recover their historical levels in the medium term given its retail expertise and consistent operating and financial track record. As of June 2016, Liverpool's adjusted leverage measured as total adjusted debt/EBITDAR was 1.2x. According to Fitch's estimations, debt is expected to rise in 2017 to nearly MXN40 billion from the MXN14.5 billion in June 2016, resulting in adjusted leverage of 2.6x in 2017, after the Suburbia and Ripley's acquisitions. FX Exposure Partially Mitigated Fitch estimates that around half of Liverpool's merchandise is exposed to exchange rates. Merchandise exposure is mitigated by re-pricing some articles after inventory restocking; a proportion of exchange rate movements are absorbed by the final customer. The company currently has USD300 million of senior notes due in 2024. This USD-denominated debt has hedges in place that cover interest and principal, which are currently below the market spot rate. The upcoming USD500 million senior notes to be issued will also be hedged, covering foreign exchange rates fluctuations. Adequate Liquidity & Debt Maturity Schedule The company has good liquidity backed by its cash on hand and cash flow generation; also, the current loan portfolio covered total debt as of June 2016 by about 1.4x. Liverpool's next debt maturity is a local bond for MXN2.1 billion due on March 2017. Liverpool has good access to domestic and international capital markets if needed, which further strengthens its financial flexibility. In addition, the company's large portfolio of owned stores and shopping malls provides solvency through an important base of unencumbered assets. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Liverpool include the following: --Liverpool gets a 47% stake of Ripley in 2016 with a combination of cash and debt. --Consolidation with Suburbia takes place in 2017; the transaction is funded 100% with debt. --Revenue growth in the mid-single digits during 2018-2019. --EBITDA margin between 15%-16%. --Average capex around 7.2% of revenue in 2016-2019. --Dividends in line with company policy of 15% of previous year's net income. --Adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio to remain below 3.0x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that individually, or collectively, could result in a negative rating action include: an expansion strategy financed primarily with debt, a sustained adjusted leverage ratio (gross adjusted debt/EBITDAR) above 3.0x, consistently negative free cash flow (FCF) below Fitch's expectations, a substantial deterioration in non-performing receivables (more than 90 days), and lower profitability margins. Factors that individually, or collectively, could result in a positive rating action include: a successful integration with Suburbia, strong operating cash generation, a strengthening in the company's credit profile through a funds from operations (FFO)-adjusted leverage (adjusted debt/FFO) below 2.0x and adjusted debt/EBITDAR ratio below 1.5x, consistently positive FCF throughout the business cycle, and geographic diversification. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Liverpool as follows: --Long-Term Foreign and Local Currency IDRs 'BBB+', Stable Outlook; --Long-Term National rating 'AAA(mex)', Stable Outlook; --Short-Term National rating 'F1+(mex)'; --USD300 million senior notes due 2024 'BBB+'; --Long-term Certificados Bursatiles issuances (LIVEPOL 08,10,10U,12,12-2) 'AAA(mex)'; --Short-term Certificados Bursatiles program for up to MXN5 billion 'F1+(mex)'.

Crunch Network Large CPGs are under attack by startups… and consumers are winning Posted Sep 28, 2016 by Tien Tzuo (@tientzuo) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber teams with Sears on new rewards program for drivers and riders Tien Tzuo Crunch Network Contributor Tien Tzuo is the CEO of Zuora. More posts by this contributor: To compete with Amazon, Walmart should cut itself in half How Prince and Bowie started streaming music services How to join the network Consumer packaged goods are big business — valued at more than $2 trillion — with much of that market share dominated by CPG powerhouses like Unilever, P&G and Nestlé. These CPG leaders know a lot about packaged goods — a lot about how to manufacture and market and sell at scale. But, as is becoming more and more apparent, they don’t really know very much at all about their customers. And this is proving to be a problem. The issue is built into the category: The large CPG companies don’t sell directly to their consumers. They sell to retailers like Walmart, who then sell to consumers. So the CPG giants miss the whole direct-to-consumer relationship. They have no access to — or insight into — the people who actually buy and use their products. And now they’re under attack by a new breed of digitally native, vertically integrated startups that are reinventing what it means to buy everything — from razor blades to toothbrushes to mattresses. Bonobos, Warby Parker, Birchbox, Harry’s, Casper… the list goes on. These guys are keenly interested in establishing smart relationships with their customers, and they are establishing flexible, recurring revenue-based business models to make it happen. In this new environment, it’s getting harder for CPGs to grow as they’ve traditionally done. Look at P&G (owner of the Gillette razor brand) which lost 12 percent share of the men’s razor and blade industry last year, while upstart direct-to-consumer razor startup Dollar Shave Club claimed 5 percent of the market. The big vendors can try to buy their way out of the problem — much like how Unilever eventually bought Dollar Shave Club. But in order to stay relevant, they’re going to have to embrace digital transformation and incorporate direct-to-consumer strategies into their own business model. Here are seven strategies that leading CPGs can — and must — adopt to better engage with consumers in the digital age. E-commerce. As recently as 2013, only about 3 percent of non-food consumer packaged goods was purchased through online sales. But online sale of consumer packaged goods is starting to pick up, and the CPG powerhouses are getting on board. In the 2014 Customer Channel Management Survey from McKinsey, which surveyed 50+ CPG leaders, e-commerce was “ranked as the second leading driver of change over the next five years.” The potential for CPG online sales is only going to grow as e-commerce giants like Amazon increase their focus on the sale of groceries and personal care products with Amazon Pantry. In addition, CPGs can explore distribution to niche online retailers like Ulta or Drugstore.com, as well as individual brands selling direct to consumers online. Social. Leading CPG companies are used to selling their consumer goods through the middleman of retail partners and rely heavily on in-store marketing to propel their brands. Startups, without the deep pockets of these CPG powerhouses, must look elsewhere to create their brands. Consumers have changed — and the consumer packaged goods industry needs to respond. Social is the solution. People have always looked to their networks for trusted recommendations, but now this old-school practice has met the digital age as consumers look to their online social networks for product suggestions. Companies can use social platforms to spread the word and build their brands, while capitalizing on accessible platforms like YouTube to generate buzz. For example, Dollar Shave Club led a master class in social with their hilarious 2012 YouTube video introducing their brand: “our blades are f**king great.” Just six hours after release, their entire inventory sold out and the video has gone on to garner over 4.75 million views. When done well, social is an effective (and inexpensive) way to connect directly with consumers to create accessible, and sought-after, brands. Digital first. Brick-and-mortar retailers used to be paranoid about people coming into their stores and then finding cheaper things online. Now people are doing online research and using retail stores as showrooms. The digital influence has flipped the script. Smart companies are using digital to create a brand, and a brand experience, rather than push products. For example, look at a company like Casper, which doesn’t promote itself as merely a mattress company, but rather a digital-first brand focused around the concept of sleep. Subscriptions. The CPG industry is made up of products that people are always going to need, and that frequently need to be replaced. You know what this sounds like? An industry ready to be subscriptionized! A subscription model isn’t just about the recurring revenue derived from repeat purchases; it’s a key to developing ongoing relationships. When your consumer becomes a subscriber, that establishes a relationship — and that foundation is one that businesses can build on and monetize. Niche focus. We’ve seen CPG leaders cutting smaller brands and not seeking out new brands as they instead focus their efforts on a small number of core brands. For example, P&G announced last year that they were planning on divesting about 100 “non-core” brands in favor of honing their focus on 70 choice brands. Related Articles Away, The Direct-To-Consumer Luggage Brand, Packs Up $2.5 Million FTC Officials Back Tesla's Right To Sell Cars Direct To Consumers Rue La La’s Founder Returns With M.Gemi, Direct-To-Consumer Italian Footwear But consumers don’t care about “distribution efficiency” for CPG companies. They care about getting the products they need, when they need them. Consumers don’t want less choice and mass-produced products. They want convenience, accessibility and an improved consumer experience. This is why companies like oral care product Hello are making their mark with their niche products, quirky flavors and a personable approach to consumers. In-store technology. As consumers demand ever-improved shopping experiences (and the best deals), many retailers are looking to technology to enhance the consumer experience. This includes more prosaic options like price-checking stands, but it’s also transformative technology like Sephora’s Fragrance IQ, an interactive kiosk that uses tech to provide consumers with customized fragrance recommendations. And it’s also beacon technology: hardware that sends push notifications to targeted consumers. This means that RiteAid can send you discount coupons as soon as you enter the store. Internet of Things. We’re just starting to see the potential of IoT, but already we can see that it poses a huge opportunity for CPG companies. As connected devices become more popular, they’re going to completely cut out the middleman, with washing machines ordering more detergent when they’re running low, or refrigerators placing a milk order. In short, consumers have changed — and the consumer packaged goods industry needs to respond. The leading CPG Goliaths may not yet be fearing the advancing Davids, but they should be watching. The share shift to these direct-to-consumer brands is gaining momentum, and these upstart brands are collectively leading a movement. If the CPG giants can ride the wave of digital transformation and adapt to the Subscription Economy, they will continue to drive growth while putting the “Consumer” back into “Consumer Packaged Goods.” Featured Image: ferlistockphoto/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Consumer packaged goods eCommerce Popular Posts Featured Stories Nom Launches Redesigned App VIDEO | 3:17 | Apps Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 18 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 20 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 21 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 21 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From TechCrunch Confirmed: DraftKings and FanDuel are merging into one company 18 minutes ago | Fitz Tepper This weekend, Alexa will tell you what’s on sale 45 minutes ago | Brian Heater Apple adds former Wall Street Journal editor to its China PR team 2 hours ago | Jon Russell French IoT startup Sigfox confirms €150M Series E at €600M valuation 3 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Comment moderation powered by Up Next Uber teams with Sears on new rewards program for drivers and riders Posted Sep 28, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

Atkins was convicted of capital murder Thursday, Sept. 22 and faces the death penalty or life in prison without parole.Prescotte Stokes III/pstokes@al.com  A jury in Mobile County today voted 10-2 to execute Saraya Atkins for the 2014 shooting death of Robert Perry. After a little more than seven hours of deliberations over two days, the jury read their verdict Wednesday Morning at Circuit Court. After the verdict was read Judge Michael Youngpeter told the jury that the decision was merely a recommendation. Youngpeter will make the final ruling on the sentence on Nov. 3 at 2:00 p.m. inside his courtroom. Family members of Atkins and Perry did not show any emotion after the verdict was read. Atkins, dressed in a white buttoned down blouse and gold cardigan turned to her mother, Shawnette Spicer and said, "I'm alright mama," before being led out of the courtroom by deputies. Before leaving the courtroom Spicer hugged one of Perry's family members and said, "God bless you. I'm sorry and I love you. I'm not mad at you." Both families declined to speak to the media after leaving the courtroom. Mobile District Attorney Ashley Rich said no one in the courtroom was happy about the outcome. "They're not happy that someone received the death penalty," said Rich. "Saraya Atkins made those choices and put us in trial and put us in a death penalty case." Saraya Atkins receives death penalty for 2014 robbery, murder Atkins was convicted earlier this month of capital murder, robbery and theft in the death of 66-year-old Perry. Prosecutors said Atkins and another woman, Kymberli Lindsay, 27, shot Perry to death on March 11, 2014. The shooting came after Perry had been asked by his stepdaughter Stephanie Finney, 45, to take her to look at a used car she wanted to purchase from a man on Craigslist. Perry, said Rich earlier in the trial, drove his wife's red Toyota Prius to Finney's home on Bayou Jonas Drive to pick her up. Finney had planned on cashing her $1,900 income tax check at the money store in the Walmart in Tillman's Corner to meet the seller of the used car at that same Walmart. Rich told jurors Atkins had been facing some personal troubles of her own that led her and Lindsay to cross paths with Perry and Finney that day. Rich, during the trial said Atkins and Lindsay decided to ride to the Bel-Air Mall and find a license plate to steal off another white Chevrolet vehicle that matched her own. Rich said video surveillance at the Dillard's store shows both women unscrewing the license plate off a woman's vehicle and putting it on Atkins car. As soon as Finney left the store, Lindsay followed her to see what vehicle she got into before getting back in the car with Atkins. Perry and Finney drove to the back side of the Garden Center at Walmart to meet the seller of the used car. Atkins and Lindsay pulled into a parking space at a distance and watched. Finney decides not to buy the car after checking it out with Perry and they decide to head home. Atkins and Lindsay realize this and follow the pair, 15 miles away, to Bayou Jonas Drive. Once they get about half way up the street, Atkins speeds up and cuts Perry off forcing him to slam on his brakes and hit the rear of Atkins car in the wet weather. "She gets out the car with that loaded revolver screaming, 'Give me your wallet,'" said Rich. Perry rolled down the window and tried to give her his wallet and Atkins screams again. "I don't want your wallet. I want her wallet," said Rich to the jurors. Finney handed her wallet to Atkins, who reached inside the driver side window with the revolver to get the wallet. Perry tried to grab the gun and the wallet fell. He told Finney to run before the first gunshot went off and missed Perry going through the open passenger door as Finney tried to escape. During the struggle for the gun, Perry gave up and tried to slide out the passenger side of the car. The second shot struck Perry in the left arm and pierced his jugular vein and exited his right side. The third gunshot went into the driver seat and into the gas tank. "She opens the car door as he's dying and takes the wallet and flees," said Rich. Most Read Get email notifications on your comments ...

The United Way of the Upper Ohio Valley is working with agencies all across the Ohio Valley to make access to healthy eating easy. In its second year the Walmart West Virginia Foundation funds the grant to provide more than $63,000 to 16 different agencies from Brooke County to New Martinsville. The agencies feed thousands of people including children, families, and senior citizens through food baskets, meal services, or even home deliveries. West Virginia is ranked as a state with one of the highest percentage of overweight children and Executive Director George Smoulder says after the first year they can already see big changes in the way West Virginians are choosing to eat. "Children at one of the childcare centers are now demanding that they have salads each day, and they never did that before, this is the second year that we've had this program, and it's exciting when you hear those kinds of stories. So you can start to see how it's becoming incorporated into the lives of the people that are receiving these fruits and vegetables from the children all the way to the adults," said Smoulder. Agencies will submit monthly receipts to the United Way to keep track of all of their purchases. This year, the program will also add an educational piece. During the program, people of all ages will learn more ways to enjoy cooking and eating fruits and vegetables.

News-Press , KHOU 2:47 PM. CDT September 28, 2016 "We can bring the economic values back to Dunbar," says Fort Myers entrepreneur Curt Sheard. Big Boi's BBQ, Sheard's barbecue sauce, will be available at Walmart soon. He hopes to build a distribution plant for his sauces in the Dunbar community. (Photo: Kinfay Moroti/news-press.com) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST FORT MYERS, Fla. — When Curt Sheard looks around Dunbar, he sees the sweetest of memories. He sees summer days when he and his friends walked home from the pool, sticky with the juice of mangoes they’d pluck from trees. He sees the acre where he was raised by a hard-working father and a mom who stopped the school bus she drove one afternoon to give Sheard a whupping after she spotted him running from a girl. He was a husky kid and the girl, he explained, “had really long nails.” Sheard, 43, laughs at this memory and leans back as if drawing joy from the past as he chatted outside the STARS Complex in Fort Myers. Cheerleaders and football players were arriving for practice for the Dunbar Rattlers, the youth travel league of which he’s the vice-president. Dunbar can be rife with danger, but its history is rich and its pride is deep. From the outside, its prospects for becoming a safe and prosperous community may seem bleak but there are dreamers like Sheard with aspirations that are only bright. “I’ve never sold drugs. I’ve never done drugs,” said Sheard, who is on the cusp of the biggest deal of his life. “At the same time I am Dunbar … I’ve traveled around the world and there’s no place like home.” I’m the past, current and I strive to be the future.” His dream is his survival tool. The father of two is working to exhaustion, running on four hours of sleep most nights as he launches his Big Boi’s BBQ sauces and rubs into 16 Walmarts from Bradenton to Naples in Florida along with working full-time as a construction project manager and volunteering for the Rattlers. Big Boi’s is set to arrive in stores Oct. 7.  He scored the deal after pitching during an open call this summer at Walmart headquarters. But to be clear, Sheard doesn’t see Dunbar as place where he needs tools to survive. Dunbar pales in comparison to Afghanistan, where Sheard lived from 2011 to 2013 in Taliban territory as he managed the construction of an Army base. Dunbar does reflect a compression of extremes in Lee County: poverty, unemployment, and homicides. Five years ago, Fort Myers ranked fifth in the nation out of cities of its size for murder, beating out the once-notorious Compton, Calif. The bloodshed has not abated. Often, the victims and perpetrators of the city’s most violent crimes have ties to Dunbar. But that’s not the Dunbar Sheard focuses on. On the evening we met, he pointed out the basketball courts and football fields teeming with kids and the warmth and respect extended to him by those who passed by. It’s not that Sheard is blind to negativity. “We’re the heart of the city and if the heart is not right, the city is not right … I think you’ve got to appreciate Dunbar because I do appreciate what it has to offer but you have to be willing to be part of the solution and a lot of people are like ‘I’m too scared.’” His teenage son and daughter attend Dunbar High. “My children interact with the same kids getting in trouble or they’re friends of friends of friends so my children may be one or two people removed from an incident, so if I can affect that 14-year-old-boy who’s out on the football field today or that 13-year-old girl who is out here cheering today so they can make a smart choice tomorrow, that may save my child’s life.” This season, the Rattlers began barricading streets near its practice fields so kids and parents would feel safer without cars driving by. They rent lights for the fields.  He does keep “his head in a swivel” but bad things can happen anywhere. The bad things don’t distract him from his dream. “Yeah, we’re f---ed up in our churches. We’re f---ed up in our houses. There’s no community support. There’s no police support and there’s no city and county support but at the same time, I’ve made the conscious choice that I’m going to put my brand back here in the same town where I grew up.” Sheard’s choice of words came from a place of being frustrated with journalists he sees as eager to pounce on the worst, when he sees so much good. “I’m not living in a world with rose-colored lenses. I choose to put on the biggest pair of yellow lenses so I can see clearly enough where my path is clear. So no, I see the negativity but I refuse to allow it to separate me from my goal or ambition.” Sheard has strategic goals to broaden distribution for Big Boi’s sauces. He hopes to grow big enough to open a manufacturing plant in Dunbar along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and bring jobs to a community with a smattering of employment opportunities. Big Boi's BBQ Sauce   (Photo: www.bigboisbbq.org) Barbecue has long been his passion. After becoming the first in his family to graduate college, the former Army officer returned to Fort Myers, where he opened (and soon closed) a barbecue restaurant. At one point, he sold Mason jars of his sauces out of his Honda Accord. He tested his recipe with cooks around town. “It was, ‘Man, it’s alright,’ or ‘It’s pretty good’ or ‘You got something.’ In my community and my culture, I’ll take it to the bank because on the other side of the tracks, white people are going to love it.” Railroad tracks remain a color barrier in Fort Myers, though mandated segregation was repealed in 1963. The tracks still largely, though not entirely, divide where black people live and white people live. Last year, a black city councilwoman worried about placing a voting location in Dunbar, east of the tracks, out of concern white people would fear crossing the tracks. Yet, if there were no dreamers in Dunbar, there would be no hope for a day when people don’t feel the need to adapt their lives to the fear of being shot. Learning how to cope with the murder of a loved one wouldn’t be a common part of growing up. Fear and hope can co-exist. A dream can be as sweet as a memory. And, in Sheard’s case, the dream tastes like barbecue sauce.

The investors, which include the fund arm of insurer Aviva and several Swedish state pension funds, wrote to the food companies on Sept. 23 urging them to respond to the “material” risks of industrial farming and to diversify into plant-based sources of protein. Among the companies targeted were Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco and Walmart, a statement by the Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative, which organized the investor group, said on Monday. “The world’s over reliance on factory farmed livestock to feed the growing global demand for protein is a recipe for a financial, social and environmental crisis,” said Jeremy Coller, founder of the FAIRR initiative and chief investment officer at private equity company Coller Capital. Pollution from intensive livestock production is already at too high a level, while safety and welfare standards are too low and the industry cannot cope with the projected increase in global protein demand, Coller said. “Investors want to know if major food companies have a strategy to avoid this protein bubble and to profit from a plant-based protein market set to grow by 8.4 percent annually over the next five years,” Coller said. The campaign follows an Oxford University study which said $1.5 trillion in healthcare and climate change-related costs could be saved by 2050 if people reduced their reliance on meat in their diet. The study also pointed to growing political pressure on companies to change, citing a consultation in Denmark on the introduction of a red meat tax and a Chinese government plan to reduce its citizens’ meat consumption by 50 percent, FAIRR said. Ella McKinley, ethics analyst at Australian Ethical Investment, which is taking part in the campaign, said the need to change food production models was essential to help to limit climate change. “Forward-looking companies can move now to encourage more sustainable diets by reducing reliance on meat and growing the market for plant-based protein alternatives. In the process, companies make their own protein supply chains more resilient to future shocks,” she said. The other companies written to by FAIRR were General Mills, Mondelez International, Ahold-Delhaize, The Co-operative Group, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Kroger Company, Marks & Spencer, Wm Morrison Supermarkets, Ocado, Sainsbury’s and Whole Foods Market. A Nestle spokeswoman said the company did not use much meat, “so our main strategy is not to focus on replacing the meat that we do use as its impact would be minimal. Our main opportunities lie in innovating new products using alternate proteins.” “In terms of timetables and targets, this is still a relatively new area, where in many countries the consumers are not fully prepared to replace or reduce meat in their diets. Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet.” Kraft Heinz declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. The Co-Op said it had yet to receive the letter. Mondelez also declined to comment because it had not yet seen the letter, while a Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We’re aware of the issue and are looking forward to receiving a copy of the letter.” A Walmart spokesman said the company was not familiar with the campaign and so could not provide comment, while a Kroger spokesman said the firm had not received the letter but was happy to talk with the investor group. The remaining companies were not immediately available to comment. Among the other investors to join the campaign were Nordea Asset Management, the fund arm of Norwegian lender Nordea, Boston Common Asset Management, and Impax Asset Management, as well as a number of charities and other ethical investors.

But what she’s hearing over her phone isn’t what she wanted to hear, “Some guys called me and said they were officers from the IRS and I owed 3-thousand or more for back taxes. They told me there was a warrant that was not yet signed. And if I told anybody, if I lost contact with them. If I hung up that the police would be at my door in 45 minutes,” said Frink. Frink was scared. Not for herself, but for 2 month old son, Gabriel. “ I was terrified of my son growing up without me”. Desperate to stay out of jail, she rushed to Walgreens and then Walmart. Emptying out her savings to pay off agents who she thought were IRS agents, but they were impostors. It was a scam. “They left me with no money and a two year old”. Looking back, she realizes there were signs it was a scam. “I knew the IRS didn’t make phone calls and I still fell for it. “ They did not sound like they were from the IRS. “One sounded Australian. The other one sounded Spanish.” Their demands were unusual. “Looking back. I-Tunes gift cards really?” In the end, her fear of being separated from her son, made her ignore the red flags. “They use your fears against you.” So she’s telling her story, so you don’t fall into the same trap. “What kind of person could do that to people?” These types of scams are fairly common over the phone, and some by email. If you encounter a situation like this, it’s recommended that you contact local law enforcement, before you send any money or card information. Even if they claim they are from, a government agency.

Whether you prefer bath bombs, salts or bubbles, a bath can help you relax and unwind when you need it most. Want to make the most of your soak sesh? Try these tips to enjoy your most relaxing bath ever. Set (Waterproof) Mood Lighting Bright, overhead bathroom lights might be great for getting ready in the morning, but they aren't exactly ideal for a relaxing bath. Candles can set the mood well, but they're a fire hazard, and if they get wet, they'll go out. Rather than risk it, you can invest in some inexpensive—but totally effective—waterproof flameless candles to perfect your bath experience. You can get a pack of 10 for $12 at Walmart, and they're totally submersible. Use a Caddy for Books and Beverages An easy way to up your bath time relaxation factor? Bring a cup of tea or a glass of wine to the tub with you. If you don't have an easy place to put your beverage of choice within reach, invest in a caddy that can hold all your bath accessories. The below caddy from Pottery Barn also features an adjustable book rack for those of you who like to get lost in a good read during bath time, but if you'd rather DIY it, you can also make a bath tray or caddy yourself with this tutorial from TFD Style. Mercer Bathtub Caddy, $79 from Pottery Barn (Image credit: Pottery Barn) Incorporate Essential Oils Bubble baths are great already, but you can easily turn your soak time into an aromatherapy session to really help you de-stress and unwind by incorporating essential oils. The American College of Healthcare Sciences suggests mixing 5 drops of lavender oil, 3 drops of ylang-ylang oil, and two drops of bergamot oil, then adding 3 drops of that mixture to a full bath to help you relax. Create a Bath-Time Playlist Before your next bubble bath, take some time to create the perfect relaxation playlist, so you can soak to your favorite tunes. Your playlist should be long enough to get you through an entire bath, and whatever your preferred genre is, make sure it includes songs that will soothe you and help you unwind. If you'd rather someone else do the work, there are tons of already made chill-out playlists on Spotify to choose from. Buy a Bath Pillow Unless you're lucky enough to have a super cozy bathtub, you may find it difficult—I definitely do—to get comfortable, especially when you try to lay back and your neck hits the edge of the tub. A bath pillow (be it inflatable or foam) that attaches to your tub can ease that discomfort so you can lay back and relax without any neck pain. You can find in most stores and online, and there are plenty of styles and designs to choose from so you can find one that works well for you and matches your bathroom decor.

As per the report, Walmart might take a minority stake in Flipkart which is a major rival for Amazon India. Both the companies are apparently engaged in early talks and a meeting is scheduled this week. The latest report comes only a week after Flipkart announced that it has over 100 million registered customers across desktop website, mobile application and mobile websites. The gap between Amazon and Flipkart in terms of gross merchandise value (GMV) is closing, with investors and analysts estimating it to be 15-20%. If the funding goes through, Flipkart could use it to further compete with Amazon. Both Walmart and Flipkart have not commented on the possible investment.  Earlier this year it was reported that Chinese retail behemoth, Alibaba is planning to foray into Indian e-commerce market. The e-commerce market in India is expected to nealry double to Rs 2,11,005 crore by December, according to industry body Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and IMRB.

He snapped a quick picture and tapped a text message to his contractor friend, Darryl Jarreau. "Hope it stops raining soon," he said. "Me, too" was the reply. "If we get water, can we be first on your list to repair?" "Yes." "Thanks. It's getting too close for comfort." Genre didn't like to raise undue fear, so he reassured his wife, Pat, 60, that all was fine. He knew that the Greystone Golf and Country Club community had never flooded. Besides that, when he had hired Jarreau 11 months earlier to build their dream home, a four-bedroom, three-bath house south of Denham Springs, he insisted on an extra foot of foundation for added peace of mind. Now as the water surrounded their garden's sugar kettle, peace of mind was a fleeting memory. Four miles to the north, Krysta Oliszewski, 41, and her son Conner, 20, watched the water rising around their timeworn, three-bedroom mobile home. She had often seen the streets flood in Magnolia Estates, a subdivision where a single mom can find cheap rent and security, provided the doors stay locked. But flooding had never reached this high, or this quickly. When it washed over the mobile home's deck, she realized they were in trouble. When it seeped up through the floor, she realized they were going under. And she realized she had no plan. "I didn't know what to do," she said. "I was in a sheer panic." She called her mother, who asked, "Can you get out?" Oliszewski wasn't sure. "I gathered what I could," she said. "I wrapped my laptop in three layers of garbage bags and grabbed documents," and stepped into the cold, muddy water. She and her son slogged through ankle-, waist- and then chest-deep water for more than a mile before they found land. "When the water got to ankle-deep" again, she said, "I just dropped to my knees and started bawling. It was surreal." . . . . . . . The Louisiana Flood of 2016 killed 13 people, displaced tens of thousands of others, caused an estimated $8.7 billion in damage and destroyed some 60,000 houses. But across the 22 parishes that were declared disaster areas, the damage and recovery have been far from uniform. For many, the difference came down to elevation, planning and resources. With two feet of water in their house, Ferdie Genre, a retired accountant, and his wife were the last to be rescued from Greystone on Aug. 13. "Two good Cajuns from Morgan City took us out of here at 9:30 at night" in a boat, said Pat Genre, a retired social worker. At midnight, they were mustered into a Walmart parking lot where they waited with a crowd of neighbors and strangers for 17 "miserable" hours. Some men grew impatient and sought to throw a brick through the window. Others stood up and talked them down. Soon they were in a Humvee headed to a FEMA shelter in Satsuma, where they spent four days before being recognized by their son's girlfriend, who took them into her home. Four days after they evacuated, their house had drained. By the next weekend they had met with their contractor, mucked the house with 17 of Ferdie's former coworkers and moved into a donated 40-foot travel trailer parked in their driveway. Friends, family, forethought and their means put them on the fast track toward recovery. Tents, travel trailers and a tale of flood recovery In Magnolia Estates, Oliszewski, who makes a living painting houses and doing odd jobs, made do at her mother's home in Baton Rouge for six weeks. Then she ran out of patience. "I love my mom," she said, "but I need my space." When a group of "church ladies" offered a tent, she headed back to her own trailer lot. "At least I have privacy," she said. Setting up the tent was easy, and neighbor two doors down offered a working shower. A small air conditioner, a mattress and a few table lamps made it downright homey. Not everyone in Magnolia Estates was as comfortable. On Oliszewski's block alone, 18 flooded mobile homes were supplanted by four small campers and 10 tents. During a visit Sept. 21, more than five weeks after the flood, Raymond Merrow's front yard looked like a squatter's camp. After his own mobile home flooded, he offered his land to a mishmash of nomads with nowhere else to settle. Three tents and a dry-rotted camper were crammed together there. Debris littered the trampled mud. Seven steps over plywood and carpet remnants led to a garden-hose shower and open latrine, shielded by a green tarpaulin. Flies swarmed incessantly. To the left, Alicia Chiasson, 30, coughed and hacked as she crawled from her 5-by-8-foot, four-person tent. She and her fiancé, Corey Dabadie, 25, were living in it with a ragged pile of clothes, a small air mattress and a corner filled with junk food. "That's our dresser, our bedroom and our kitchen," she said. "I just want to take a hot shower. I've had the same clothes on for five days." Crystal Rabalais, 34, felt traumatized sitting outside her tent, on what used to be her trailer's front porch. She said she, her husband and their 7-year-old daughter survived a harrowing rescue through floodwater that was over their heads. "About 7 feet deep, like somebody stuck a plug in a bathtub," she said. "I'll have to take my little girl to counseling after what she went through." Oliszewski grew more frustrated as she tried to network through the FEMA help line.  She finally lost her composure with a representative who told her that someone else, a stay-over friend, had claimed her renter's assistance. "Well, he has no proof that he was the primary," she said, slamming her open palm onto the back of her old truck. "He doesn't even get friggin' mail here," she pleaded. After an endless back and forth, she hung up. "They're telling me they still don't have the documents in my file. That's the problem. That's what makes me mad. He has no proof, and they just hand him $2,000. That's my rent, for my kids. He knew what he was doing all along," she said. . . . . . . . At Greystone, Pat Genre lifted a heavy suitcase from beside her bed in the travel trailer, which was comfortable although snug for the retired couple after four weeks of condensed living. She ran the zipper around the case and flipped open the cover. Atop their evacuation clothes and envelopes of financial records was a small plastic storage container. "This is what I saved," she said as she lifted the top. One-by-one, she laid out her small collection of treasured photographs. "Here's my dad and my aunt. Here's my grandmother," she said. "And here's one from our wedding I was able to save." She fought back tears as she repacked her container. Ted Jackson  One by one, she laid out her small collection of treasured photographs. "Here's my dad and my aunt. Here's my grandmother," she said. "And here's one from our wedding I was able to save." She fought back tears as she repacked her container. Her big wedding album was trashed. "It was all brown. I just threw it away." There are so many things that money can't replace, like her grandmother's blanket chest filled with photos and home movies of family long gone. "Once you live a few years on this planet, you make those connections to those people ... ." She paused, took a deep breath as a tear swelled in her eye. But with stoic, Southern grace, she quickly wiped it away. "It's not just pictures," she said. "It's your memories." The Genres know they have financial resources, friends, family and foresight. They hope to have their house back together by Christmas and get back to their retirement. Pat hopes to refashion her grandmother's ruined blanket chest into something new, with an added story. "It's going have warped sides, but that's our brown badge of courage," she said. "That's experience." In Magnolia Estates, Oliszewski balanced on a sewer pipe and carefully crossed a bog to the back of her trashed trailer. There among the debris, she found her son's cherished steel footlocker, fabricated by her brother years before. She lifted the heavy lid and unpacked the few treasures remaining of her life. "It's my high school memorabilia ... prom pictures and my yearbook." She pointed to glamour shot of a young woman holding a baby. "That's me and my oldest son, Conner. It was waterproofed," she said. "I was so worried about it." After all her loss from the storm, Oliszewski also is saying farewell to Conner, who is moving to Missouri looking for opportunity. As he turned to leave, he bear-hugged her with such enthusiasm that he lifted her off the ground. Krysta Oliszewski, 41 hugs her 20-year-old son, Conner goodbye.Ted Jackson  He drove away, leaving her with her thoughts. On her bed, she wrapped herself in one of her last remaining family heirlooms, a quilt made special for her by her grandmother. "I'm so glad this survived," she said. She's looking forward to getting her FEMA renter's assistance. And for now, at least, the tent's not so bad. "It's big enough for me," she said, "and it's temporary." "You make do," she said. "I'm a survivor. I have no choice." oceans of trouble 1996 Pulitzer Prize-winning series Oceans of Trouble: Are the world's fisheries doomed?

Seven-year-old Bella has started taking a clipboard with her to the shops so she can assess them. Because someone has to keep standards up. Bella hasn’t shared her marking system with her dad Tony, but he says the spot checks started last weekend when he took her with him on some errands to Home Depot (basically America’s version of B&Q) and Sears. ‘She asked if she could bring her clipboard with a cat on it,’ he told Metro.co.uk. ‘Of course I said yes. ‘Then she was in her own little world just checking things off, pretending she was some sort of corporate boss.’ While in the store, Dad couldn’t resist taking some pictures. He later shared them on Twitter writing: ‘My daughter brings a checklist to stores now and just makes random checks. It makes everyone uncomfortable.’ My daughter brings a checklist to stores now and just makes random checks.

Kalyani Pandey   September 28, 2016 16:05 IST A man talks on his mobile phone in front of a Walmart store [Representational Image].Reuters Wal-Mart, American multinational retail chain, is in advanced round of negotiations with Flipkart to invest about $1 billion into India's largest online market place. The move is seen as a joint effort to battle Amazon. Wal-Mart will take a minority stake in Flipkart, according to sources quoted by Mint. Final terms of the deal are yet to be worked out since the talks are still believed to be underway. The deal is seen as a win-win situation for both Wal-Mart and Flipkart. At a time when the Indian e-commerce is under pressure to obtain funding, the capital infusion would give the firm a much needed boost. The deal would also give Wal-Mart exposure into the Indian e-commerce market. Why advertise with us?

According to media reports, in June, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos had said that he plans to invest $3 billion into the company's India operations in a bid to gain more customers in the fast growing market. After US and China, India is the next big potential emerging market where foreign players have made little progress against Alibaba Holding Limited, Bloomberg reported. So far, Wal-Mart's India operations have been limited to business-to-business (B2B) segment in the country, selling products to businesses, organisations and educational institutes. India's e-commerce market is estimated to grow 67 percent to $38 billion (Rs 2.51 lakh crore) in 2016 from over $23 billion (Rs 1.52 lakh crore) last year, boosted by a rise in Internet and mobile users, according to a study by an industry body Assocham. The country's e-commerce market was worth about $3.8 billion in 2009. It went up to $17 billion in 2014 and to $23 billion in 2015, said DS Rawat, Secretary General, Assocham had said earlier this year.

The Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return Initiative wrote to food titans like Kraft Heinz, Nestle, Unilever, Tesco, and Walmart to make the case that switching to vegetable proteins serves shareholder interests, Reuters reports. But it’s not just about risk: The group of investors, which has over $1 trillion under management, is also motivated by environmental and social concerns. The financial argument is that the demand for meat is going to increase dramatically, driving up prices, as incomes rise and a new middle class starts eating its scrumptious flesh rations. Skyrocketing prices would be bad for companies that buy animal protein as an ingredient. It could even create what I like to call an exploding meat bubble, where meat prices spike and then crash as people switch to alternatives. Nestle responded to the Reuters story to say the company was moving in that direction: “Our focus is to innovate great tasting solutions to encourage consumers to try them and over time make small, sustainable shifts towards a higher plant-based, more balanced diet.” There’s a lot to consider when it comes to meat.

Mni Wiconi: The Stand at Standing Rock takes us to the scene of the standoff over the pipeline, where gathered protesters face police violence. The phrase Mni Wiconi, which means “water is life” in Lakota, has been used to rally support for the movement. The pipeline’s original route was rejected because it was a threat to Bismarck’s water supply, but it now poses that same risk to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux. Despite recent developments that make approval for the pipeline likely, Winona LaDuke, founder of Honor the Earth, warns against despair in the short film: “Don’t operate out of fear; operate out of hope. Because with hope, everything is possible.” Abigail Bechtel 4 hours ago Vanishing Act NSIDC Um, where did all of the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice just go? Into the ocean, it seems. New satellite data show the total area of global sea ice dipping wayyy below the National Snow and Ice Data Center’s record for this time of year. In fact, Arctic sea ice has dropped well below the next-lowest seasonal extent ever observed (which was in 2012). That year’s all-time record low was narrowly avoided in September, the month when Arctic sea ice levels typically are at their lowest. But the fact that ice levels are lower now than they were this same time in 2012 is part of what makes this latest data so alarming. Meanwhile, Antarctic sea ice is also much lower than usual at the end of the Southern Hemisphere’s winter. Both the #Antarctic and #Arctic #seaice extents are abnormally small. That's the story. pic.twitter.com/nObJ4WqsUl — Aarne Granlund (@granlund_aarne) November 17, 2016 We’ve gotten somewhat used to broken records here, but watching sea ice levels flatten out when they should be peaking is well beyond normal understanding of record lows and highs. Meanwhile, the temperature at the North Pole right now is a not-cool 36 degrees F above average. Is this what the Upside Down feels like? Amelia Urry 19 hours ago path of lease resistance Pete Souza A woman who fought predatory oil and gas leasing on Native lands got the Presidential Medal of Honor. It’s not often that the highest civilian honor in America goes to an accountant, but Elouise Cobell was no ordinary accountant. Cobell grew up on a reservation in Montana in the 1950s, a time when America was flush with cash. But Cobell’s home, like many, didn’t have a telephone, running water, or electricity, even though the Blackfeet Tribe owned acres of valuable land. The Blackfeet knew what was up. The land was being leased out by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior, and the money never made it back to the reservation. Cobell learned accounting and banking, which ultimately led her to file a landmark, 15-year-long lawsuit. When it was over, the Department of the Interior agreed to pay $3.4 billion to compensate for decades of lost revenue and to purchase land that had been split up so that it could be returned whole to the tribes. The process of freeing Blackfeet land from oil and gas leases continues today. The Department of the Interior announced a settlement with one of the last companies holding a lease to Badger-Two Medicine, the site of many Blackfeet creation stories. Cobell died in 2011, but the ideals that motivated her live on, most visibly at Standing Rock. Heather Smith 19 hours ago What A Time To Be Alive Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is a bad idea. Even Bill O’Reilly knows that. Many have agreed that President-elect Donald Trump has some questionable ideas when it comes to climate policy. Today, we get to add anthropomorphized gym sock O’Reilly and known cup goblin Starbucks to that list! On Wednesday’s episode of The O’Reilly Factor, he advised Trump on a number of items to consider as he prepares to take office. On this list: “Finally, President-Elect Trump should accept the Paris treaty on climate to buy some goodwill overseas. It doesn’t really amount to much anyway, let it go.” Well, the thing is, it does actually amount to a lot. Here’s a confusing screenshot, because this action item appears under the heading “What President Obama Failed to Do,” when President Obama did, in fact, succeed in accepting the Paris Agreement. On Thursday morning, a coalition of 365 major companies and investors submitted a plea to Trump to please, come on, just support the goddamn Paris Agreement, because to do otherwise would be a disastrous blow to the United States’ economic competitiveness. The list includes Starbucks (the nerve!!!!), eBay, Kellogg, and Virgin. Anyway, Trump’s whole “refusing to acknowledge climate change” thing seems like a bad look. Eve Andrews 19 hours ago deeds not words Lisa Bynum If this Republican donor loves clean energy, then why did he back fossil-fuel friendly candidates? Last year, Jay Faison announced that he was going to spend $175 million promoting conservative solutions to climate change and backing Republican candidates who supported clean energy. Faison has been showered with loads of positive press ever since. The problem is, Faison opposes actual strategies to mitigate global warming such as carbon pricing or regulation of carbon pollution. He supports policies, like more fracking, that are sure to make it worse. Faison spent money on behalf of Republican members of Congress in crucial swing states and districts. Faison’s ClearPath Action political action committee backed 15 candidates for Congress, and 13 won last Tuesday. Some of the winning candidates, including Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr, have consistently sided with the fossil-fuel industry and against environmental protection. If Portman and Burr had lost, Democrats would have had two more climate-friendly Senators to fight the GOP’s plans to repeal every Obama-era climate regulation, approve every oil and gas pipeline, and eviscerate the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s tempting to say Faison’s work has proved counter-productive, but the results suggest ClearPath’s goal was to help Republicans, not the Earth. Ben Adler 20 hours ago flint water crisis Shutterstock Flint still doesn’t have safe drinking water. More than two and a half years since Flint’s water crisis started, Mayor Karen Weaver has extended the city’s state of emergency, which was set to expire on Monday. Both the state and federal states of emergency expired in mid-August. “The fact of the matter is we still cannot drink our water without a filter,” Weaver said Tuesday in a statement. “That is why I have signed a declaration to renew the state of emergency in the City of Flint until the lingering issues have been resolved and the water is deemed safe to drink.” The crisis started after the city’s emergency manager switched the municipal water supply to the Flint River in April 2014, exposing thousands of Flint residents and 6,000-12,000 children to lead-contaminated water. Even small amounts of lead exposure can lead to serious health consequences for children. By extending the city’s state of emergency, Weaver hopes to renew attention on the city’s water crisis. In September, the Senate authorized $220 million and the House authorized $170 million in federal aid for Flint and other cities dealing with lead contamination, but there are mixed signals on the fate of the funding.

Going into the debate, there was a double standard, Meyers said on Tuesday's Late Night. After rolling a clip of a conservative talk show host's advice to Clinton (don't laugh, don't smile, don't cough), he declared, "She has to act like a ninja bank robber weaving through a grid of red lasers. Meanwhile, Trump just has to be a C+ Walmart greeter." Based on the expectations his supporters helped set up, "all Trump had to do was be a normal person and he would have been declared the winner," Meyers said. "Yet he still managed to lose." Trump wasn't prepared for the "most important 90 minutes of his campaign," Meyers continued, so he gave rambling non-answers about cyber warfare and terrorism and made a strange comment about the possibility that "somebody sitting on their bed weighing 400 pounds," not Russia, hacked the Democratic National Committee. "Trump is so superficial he even fat-shamed a dude he just made up," Meyers quipped. If he really wanted to make a splash, he said, Trump should have released his tax returns, rather than interrupt Clinton to say he's "smart" because he doesn't pay any federal income tax, and if he did, that money would be "squandered." "Oh, the government would squander your money?" Meyers asked. "Says the guy who covers his penthouse in gold like an old prospector who just won the lottery." Watch the video below. Catherine Garcia   Seth Meyers wasn't impressed by Donald Trump's debate performance September 28, 2016 making the case Edit The Wall Street Journal argues Trump should liquidate his business — or face some serious 'political damage' 10:09 a.m. ET   Alex Wong/Getty Images In an op-ed published late Thursday, The Wall Street Journal laid out why President-elect Donald Trump's "best option" to avoid a perceived conflict of interest between his business and his government is to "liquidate his stake" in the Trump Organization. While Trump has floated the idea of a "blind trust," turning the company entirely over to his adult children, The Wall Street Journal joined critics of the idea in saying it won't be enough. Typically, The Wall Street Journal reported, a "blind trust" is an "independent manager, not family members," and the assets being protected generally aren't as highly visible as, say, Trump's array of properties and brands. These disparities have already raised eyebrows, and the Journal contends it will only get worse: The political damage to a new administration could be extensive. If Mr. Trump doesn't liquidate, he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position. For example, the House and Senate are eager to consider tax reform — and one sticking point will be the treatment of real estate, which will be of great interest to the Trump family business. Ditto for repealing the Dodd-Frank financial law, interest rates and so much more. [The Wall Street Journal] As "painful and perhaps costly" as Trump's break-up with his businesses may be, the "presidential stakes are too high" for him to do anything else, the newspaper concludes. Head over to The Wall Street Journal to read more about what troubles Trump's business could cause him. Becca Stanek   The Wall Street Journal argues Trump should liquidate his business — or face some serious 'political damage' 10:09 a.m. ignorance is bliss Edit This Georgia man is blissfully unaware of who won the election 10:02 a.m. ET   Worried you won't like the next president? Here's an idea: Don't find out who it is. A Georgia man named Joe Chandler has done exactly that, warding off election results by using headphones and wearing a sign that reads, "I don't know who won and don't want to. Please don't tell me." FoxNews: 'Don't tell me': Georgia man deliberately stays in the dark on election results https://t.co/Hd6oJQNmD5 pic.twitter.com/GTT3cky6N7 — Smart People (@wanthillaryout) November 17, 2016 Chandler decided to remain blissfully ignorant after seeing the stress the election caused his friends. "I was invited to an election party to stay up into the night with everybody gnawing their nails, hanging on, and I thought, 'Oh, there has to be a better way,'" he explained. He originally intended to check the results the next morning but gradually kept putting the moment off to preserve the calm of not knowing. Chandler, who works from home and did not particularly like either major-party candidate, is pleased with his choice. "Having subtracted myself from this political fracas and all of the mayhem of the digital media, I kind of found the center of the cyclone," he says. "It is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance." Bonnie Kristian   This Georgia man is blissfully unaware of who won the election 10:02 a.m. dad in chief Edit This is what Obama wanted his daughters to know after Hillary Clinton lost the election 9:51 a.m. ET   Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images President Barack Obama has done a lot of comforting and reassuring since Donald Trump won the presidential election last week. One White House source told The New Yorker that when meeting with staffers the day after the election, Obama and his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, were "almost like grief counselors." But there was perhaps an even tougher conversation Obama needed to have: the one with his daughters, Malia and Sasha. Obama revealed what he wanted them to know in an interview with The New Yorker: "What I say to them is that people are complicated,” Obama told me. “Societies and cultures are really complicated. ... This is not mathematics; this is biology and chemistry. These are living organisms, and it's messy. And your job as a citizen and as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect and understanding. And you should anticipate that at any given moment there's going to be flare-ups of bigotry that you may have to confront, or may be inside you and you have to vanquish. And it doesn't stop. ... You don't get into a fetal position about it. You don't start worrying about apocalypse. You say, okay, where are the places where I can push to keep it moving forward." [The New Yorker] Obama himself admitted, though, that he doesn't "believe in apocalyptic — until the apocalypse comes. I think nothing is the end of the world until the end of the world." Read more about how he is feeling in the face of an impending Trump presidency at The New Yorker. Jeva Lange   This is what Obama wanted his daughters to know after Hillary Clinton lost the election 9:51 a.m. what next Edit Will Democrats filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominee? If they do, the GOP might nuke the filibuster. 8:46 a.m. ET   Joe Raedle/Getty Images Democrats are squirming at the thought of Donald Trump's upcoming opportunity to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court. And while they're thinking about giving the Republicans a taste of their own medicine by obstructing any nominee, it could come with a potentially crippling cost. The Democrats are still smarting over their counterparts' treatment of President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, who despite being nominated in February has still not gotten a congressional confirmation hearing. But payback in the form of a filibuster of Trump's nominee could cost Democrats the tools they have left as a minority, Politico reports. Currently, the Senate requires a 60-vote minimum to confirm a Supreme Court nominee, a practice that the Republicans have threatened to end if the Democratss don't play ball. "We're going to confirm the president's nominee one way or the other. And there's an easy way and there's a hard way," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) has said. It's an open question as to how Democrats will proceed. They'll be under immense pressure from their political base to reject a nominee perceived as anti-abortion and anti-environment. They'll also have to weigh whether playing nice on one nominee may give them more leverage to play hardball later on, when Republicans may be sweating their own political future ahead of the 2020 election [...] Democrats say it's too early to decide how they'll proceed. But they admit they're worried about who Trump will pick and what it will mean for the future of the Senate. [Politico] Read more about the threat to the filibuster, and what it could mean for Trump's Supreme Court nominees, at Politico. Jeva Lange   Will Democrats filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominee? If they do, the GOP might nuke the filibuster. 8:46 a.m. This just in Edit Trump picks Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director 8:04 a.m. ET   Win McNamee/Getty Images Three-term Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) will be nominated CIA director for Donald Trump's incoming administration. Pompeo had been a Marco Rubio supporter and was hesitant to back Trump in the general election, but came around to help Indiana Gov. Mike Pence prepare for the vice presidential debate. The Wichita-based representative met with the president-elect's transition team earlier this week, McClatchy DC writes. Pompeo is a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and has been a supporter of the Patriot Act and the National Security Agency's collection of bulk data. He has also outspokenly opposed President Obama's Iran nuclear deal. Pompeo came under fire in 2013 for suggesting Islamic faith leaders encouraged radical terrorist attacks. Jeva Lange   Trump picks Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director 8:04 a.m. This just in Edit Donald Trump reportedly picks Jeff Sessions for attorney general 7:48 a.m. ET   JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images Four-term Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) is Donald Trump's pick for U.S. attorney general, CBS News learned Friday morning. Sessions was an early and outspoken supporter of Trump and was among the top candidates rumored to be tapped for the position. In addition to promoting Trump, Sessions has been "a hard-liner on free trade and immigration, arguing that prospective immigrants don’t have constitutional protections," Bloomberg Politics writes. "He has opposed efforts to overhaul prison sentencing, back off the war on drugs and legalize marijuana." Sessions also voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and was against the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell." As America's top lawyer and law enforcement officer, Sessions would potentially play a large role in vetting Trump's Supreme Court pick. Decades ago, Sessions lost an appointment to the federal bench after a 1986 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where witnesses accused Sessions of calling some civil rights organizations "un-American" and the NAACP "communist inspired." He later made it to the Senate and holds a top position in the Judiciary Committee. Jeva Lange   Donald Trump reportedly picks Jeff Sessions for attorney general 7:48 a.m. yeezy season Edit Kanye West tells angry audience he would have voted for Donald Trump 7:29 a.m. ET   Kanye West may have posed for a selfie with Hillary Clinton, but he would have been a Donald Trump voter if he had decided to cast a ballot this year, the rapper told his audience in San Jose, California, on Thursday night. "[The Democrats] thought they had me because ... just because I was black or just because I was a celebrity," West told the audience to loud boos. "But Trump is our president. And that would've been my vote, so I feel right." West had stopped the concert to expound on politics and many concertgoers in the blue state took the opportunity to leave: Just walked out early with a bunch of other concert goers since @KanyeWest decided to talk his whole concert!!! @Ticketmaster #REFUND us!!! pic.twitter.com/lXA988bNWj — David Kim (@kimcheeman) November 18, 2016 "[Voting for Trump] don't mean that I don't think that black lives matter," West went on. "That don't mean I don't believe in women's rights, that don't mean that I don't believe in gay marriage." West's wife, Kim Kardashian, and his in-law, Caitlyn Jenner, have also expressed their support of Trump. "At first I thought, 'Oh my God, I'm so Hillary [Clinton],' but I had a long political call with Caitlyn last night about why she's voting Trump. I'm on the fence," Kardashian said in June. After outcry, she backtracked to say "I'm with her." West himself has long been a Democratic supporter, donating $1,000 to Barack Obama's 2012 presidential campaign and $15,000 to the Democratic National Committee before the last midterm. But others saw this coming. In late September, Hot Air responded to the Kardashian news by writing "This Twilight Zone episode of an election can only end in January with Trump taking the oath of office as Kim, Caitlyn, Kris, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall, Kylie, and of course Kanye look on from the dais behind him."

Ten show homes will be open on Saturday  four duplexes and six estate homes  and each builder involved in the development will have a home to show on the weekend, said Melcors regional manager Sue Monson. We want everyone to see the great builder group that weve been working with in Jensen Lakes, she said. We have seven premier builders and each of them offer something unique to the market. Jensen Lakes is St. Alberts first beachside community. The development is located north of Villeneuve Road and northwest of Walmart. It features a mix of residential housing and some commercial and amenities such as 40 acres of parks and ponds, five kilometres of pathways, a 20-acre freshwater lake, beach club and private island. The first phase of residential development was recently completed. Paired homes and estate homes are currently being sold in the Boardwalk Phase One and the Shoreline Phase One respectively. Both neighbourhoods are located in the north-east quadrant of the development. Melcor plans to introduce other housing options shortly, namely single family detached homes and townhouses. It will have a really healthy cross-section of housing so that we can meet the needs of anybody who wants to live there, said Monson. There will be a number of affordability brackets all represented in the same neighbourhood. Homes are expected to start at $375,000. Price tags for larger estate homes, which will be located on the island, could go up into the millions. The school site, which will house both Sister Alphonse Academy and Joseph M. Demko School, and a commercial site are both underway and expected to be complete in 2018. Melcor recently announced an agreement with Landmark Cinemas for an eight-auditorium movie theatre located within Jensen Crossings, which will be located at the corner of Jensen Lakes Boulevard and the St. Albert Trail. Other future tenants have yet to be confirmed. The private beach and lake area will be developed in 2018 or 2019, said Monson, who indicated that excavation for the lake itself has already started. Seven builders are involved in the Jensen Lakes development: Daytona Homes, ReidBuilt Homes, Augusta Fine Homes, Canyon Spring Homes, Kanvi Homes, Kimberley CustomBuilt, and Sarasota Homes. The total development accounts for 500 acres of land in the northwest of the city. Jensen Lakes grand opening event will be held from noon to 4 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 1 and will feature food and drink, prizes and free family portraits.

The grand jury handed down a one count indictment to Calvin Donald Eaton, 48, of 1201 Lazear-Wilhelm Road, Wheeling. Eaton was charged with "driving in an impaired state causing death." The fatal accident occurred on Route 20, near Porters Falls, on November 24, 2015. According to a police report previously filed in the case, a tanker truck, operated by Eaton, went off the right side of the road for an unknown reason. It then came back onto the right side of the road, but crossed the center of the road, striking a 2014 Jeep Wrangler coming from the opposite direction. A 61-year-old man died as a result of the accident. Eaton was allegedly on the job at the time of the accident and was found to have a blood alcohol content over the legal limit. Jesse James Wiley, 37, 296 North State Route 2, Lot 96W, was handed down a two count indictment, charging him with two counts of failure to update sex offender registry information. Count one alleges that in October of 2014 Wiley did not update his registry information during the month of his birth, as required by law. Count two alleges that Wiley did not update his registry information in October 2015 either. Jeremy Keith White, 30, of 217 Rural Street, Paden City, was handed down two separate indictements by the grand jury. The first indictment contains two charges - daytime burglary and petit larceny. The charges allege that White entered into the residence of another where he allegedly stole an iPad and a pistol. White's second indictment charges uttering a forged note or bill, and possession of a counterfeit bank note with intent to deliver. The first charge alleges that White attempted to make a purchase with a $50 forged United States Federal Reerve Note, knowing the note was forged. Count two alleges that White possessed less than ten forged bank notes, knowing them to be forged, with the intent to utter them. Dylan Cole Fruner, 20, of 510 Marvin Avenue, New Martinsville, was handed down a twelve-count indictment by the grand jury, containing six charges of forgery and six charges of uttering. The first two counts, forgery and uttering, allege that Fruner forged the signature of another on a check, made payable to New Martinsville's Wal-Mart, in the amount $369.94. This check was then cashed at Wal-Mart. Charges three and four allege forgery and uttering, respectively, with a check made payable in the amount of $369.94 to Wal-Mart. Counts five and six allege forgery and uttering, respectively, with a check made payable in the amount of $369.94 to Wal-Mart. Counts seven and eight allege forgery and uttering, respectively, occurring at Wal-Mart with a check made payable in the amount of $347.68. Counts nine and 10 allege that Fruner forged the signature of another on a check, made payable to Mayo's Exxon, in the amount of $100. Fruner then allegedly cashed this check. Counts 11 and 12 allege that Fruner forged the signature of another on a check, made payable to Wal-Mart, in the amount of $369.94. he then allegedly cashed the check. Derek Bryan Fruner, 23, of 510 Martin Avenue, New Martinsville, was charged by the grand jury with conspiracy to utter and uttering - principal in the second degree. The first count alleges that Derek Fruner conspired with Dylan Fruner to commit uttering. The second count alleges that Derek Fruner aided Dylan Cole Fruner in the uttering of a check, issued payable to Wal-Mart, in the amount of $369.94.

(Joe Behnken, The Associated Press) Rams nickelback Lamarcus Joyner has been on the field for 134 of their 148 defensive snaps (84.5 percent). Joyner was called for defensive holding twice in the opener but went penalty-free in victories over Seattle and Tampa Bay. (Joe Behnken, The Associated Press) By RICH HAMMOND / STAFF WRITER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF THOUSAND OAKS – Rams cornerback Lamarcus Joyner has nine healthy toes and one strong spirit, and that’s good enough for a secondary that faces another significant test this week. Joyner is hanging in there, still playing through a broken toe he suffered in the opener. Not only is Joyner surviving, he’s thriving as the Rams’ nickelback against some teams that aren’t shy about throwing the ball, and the Rams face another one Sunday at Arizona. The Cardinals are averaging 39 pass attempts per game this season, but if they think they can test Joyner, there’s not much evidence that they will succeed. Joyner, whose role on the team was questioned at the start the season, arguably has been the Rams’ top cornerback, even with a sore left foot. ”It’s all mental,” Joyner said after Tuesday’s practice at Cal Lutheran. “Once the game starts, the adrenaline starts rushing, so if you’re mentally prepared, your body will follow you.” Joyner left practice wearing sandals and no indication of a bad toe, but said he expects the recovery process to take two more weeks and that the toe becomes more sore during games, when he runs around at full speed. Joyner’s play, however, hasn’t indicated any discomfort. A third-year pro out of Florida State, Joyner is a full-time starter for the first time in his career and leads all Rams defensive backs with 21 tackles. He’s thriving after a tumultuous training camp. Joyner was ejected from the Rams’ second preseason game, then starred in a nationally televised drama when an episode of HBO’s “Hard Knocks” captured Joyner in the office of Coach Jeff Fisher. Joyner talked about his frustration with his role and how he was prepared to “go work at Walmart.” Fisher promised Joyner that his role on the team would be significant, and there was no deception. The Rams primarily have played a nickel defense this season, and Joyner has been on the field for 134 of their 148 defensive snaps (84.5 percent). Joyner was called for defensive holding twice in the opener but went penalty-free in victories over Seattle and Tampa Bay. Joyner is in his third season with the Rams and playing more than ever. “You can never predict what’s going to happen,” Joyner said, “but the coaches said I was going to have a big role, and so far they have fulfilled their words. I’ve been put in positions to help this defense out a lot, so I’ve really been enjoying that this year.” The Rams have played so much nickel, with only two linebackers on the field, that at times during the Seattle game, adjustments forced Joyner, listed at 5-foot-8, 184 pounds, closer to the line of scrimmage alongside linebackers Alec Ogletree and Mark Barron. And he’s doing it with a sore foot. “That’s why we drafted him,” Fisher said. “We watched him for a couple of years there at Florida State, and he’s one of those guys. He shows it every day.” It’s tough to imagine Joyner getting a bigger test than the one he passed last week at Tampa Bay, on a humid, steamy late afternoon when Tampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston attempted 58 passes. Now, though, the Rams must face a pass-happy Arizona offense that is looking for a bounce-back effort. Quarterback Carson Palmer threw five touchdowns in his first two games this season, but in last week’s loss to Buffalo, Palmer threw zero touchdowns and four interceptions. Joyner said he knows the Cardinals will look to get their passing game back on track. “It makes it fun for the secondary,” Joyner said. “As a defensive back, you want the quarterback to throw the ball around. It gives you more opportunities. It was fun. Then you have a great quarterback like Jameis Winston, so it can be kind of scary because he’s a guy who can embarrass you out there. It makes you focus in and play fundamentally strong.” Contact the writer: rhammond@scng.com Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular O.C.

Firms are passing on the chance to purchase 650 Walgreens stores that are being peddled by the Deerfield, Ill., company — a recently started sale process prompted by a Federal Trade Commission antitrust review of the $17 billion Walgreens Boots Alliance-Rite Aid merger, sources familiar with the matter said. The PE firms feel the stores, sprinkled across the country, are not of a high-enough quality or quantity to support a profitable operation, sources said. A combined Walgreens and Rite Aid would have almost 13,000 stores — so the 650-unit lot represents about 5 percent of the total. The merger of Walgreens, the No. 2 chain, and Rite Aid, No. 3, would create the country’s biggest drug chain with a roughly 46 percent market share — when not including Walmart and other big box chains — topping the reach of CVS Health. “My sense is this is a pretty tough asset to sell,” a source close to private equity firms said. “Even though Walgreens is offering to help [a buyer] build the corporate infrastructure on an arm’s-length basis.” The source added: “These stores are cats and dogs around the country.” While Walgreens and the FTC would like one buyer, it will likely be hard to find a single PE firm willing to take all the stores at a reasonable multiple, the source said. Last week, Walgreens, along with the biggest US drug-store chain, CVS, met with FTC officials, sources following the situation said. CVS would like to buy some of the Walgreens stores in areas in which they do not compete, sources said. It is not known whether the FTC would allow such a purchase. Rite Aid shares on Tuesday closed up 3 cents, to $8.07. Walgreens in 2015 agreed to buy Rite Aid for $9 a share. SEE ALSO Walgreens-Rite Aid deal gets new life from FTC :0 Walgreens Boots Alliance, whose acquisition of Rite Aid is seen... Walgreens-Rite Aid deal gets new life from FTC Walgreens agreed to sell up to 1,000 stores to get the merger through regulators. There is a track record of private equity and Rite Aid. Leonard Green & Partners invested in Rite Aid in 1999 and generated a poor return when exiting most of its stake in 2013. Walgreens declined comment beyond its Sept. 8 press release. At that time, it said it remained actively engaged with the FTC regarding its review of the pending acquisition. As a result of the progress of these discussions with the FTC staff, Walgreens said it was exploring potential divestiture remedies to address certain issues raised in those discussions. Walgreens also said it expected the most likely outcome would be that the parties would be required to divest more than the 500 stores previously communicated, but still continued to expect that fewer than 1,000 stores would be required to be divested. In addition, the company continued to believe the acquisition would close in the second half of calendar 2016. CVS and the FTC did not return calls.

"Mysterious letter" warns against "Chinese danger" involving State Grid deal Author: Michaël Torfs Belga Tue 27/09/2016 - 11:07 Update: Tue 27/09/2016 - 13:13 Michaël Torfs A mysterious letter reached a number of Belgian ministers yesterday. The letter, which later turned out to be issued by the Belgian Intelligence Service, warns against a deal with the Chinese company State Grid that wants to buy a stake in the Belgian gas and electricity network of distributors Eandis. However, Eandis has reacted this morning by saying that they keep their faith in the Chinese investors. "State Grid Corporation of China" is the world's second biggest company after American supermarket giants Walmart, boasting a turnover of 300 billion, 1.1 billion customers and some 2 million employees. CEO Liu Zhenya wants to expand across the globe and is believed to have 35 billion at his disposal for investments worldwide. There had been contacts with Belgian distributors Eandis in the past, and the Chinese even travelled to Melle for prospection. State Grid recently made a concrete bid worth 830 million euros to acquire a 14 percent stake in Eandis. Local councils across Belgium are now voting separately whether to approve the deal or not, as Belgian giants Eandis have their gas and electricity network across the country. Belgium's local municipalities and cities own Eandis together. Some have voted in favour, like Ostend, while others voted against, like Sint-Niklaas, with others like Ghent asking for more time. However, the Eandis management will have the biggest say in the matter (see below). "Mysterious letter" warns against the deal It seems a deal is imminent, but the issue has been sparking controversy in recent days after the news emerged. Yesterday, various Belgian ministers received a letter warning them that the deal may involve risks. The letter was said to be issued by "an official body" without further detail. It later turned out that it was compiled by Belgian Intelligence officers. Energy supplies are vital to a country and are, of course, of the utmost importance. The letter warns that State Grid have close links with the Chinese regime, the Communist party, the Chinese army and the Chinese Intelligence Services. A deal would allow the Chinese to spy on Belgian technology, it suggests. The letter also mentions that a similar offer by State Grid in Australia, had eventually been rejected by the Australian authorities. State Grid would mainly want the deal to acquire Belgian know-how, opponents claim. VRT Eandis sees no problem Meanwhile, Eandis itself has also reacted. The management says it is in favour of the deal, as the Chinese will only acquire 14 percent. This could not trigger Chinese interference, they say, adding that Eandis is using technology that everyone can acquire. The issue has reached the highest political levels meanwhile. The Flemish Energy Minister Bart Tommelein (liberal) has spoken out against an accord with the Chinese, making a U-turn on the matter. A final decision on whether the Chinese deal will be accepted or not, is expected next week.

Niki Everette said she found this razor blade in her Wal-Mart shopping cart Tuesday morning. Niki Everette  Everette said the incident happened Tuesday morning at the Atmore Wal-Mart on North Main Street. About 10 minutes into her shopping trip with her two daughters, 1-year-old Claire and 3-year-old Ansleigh, she said she felt something sharp stab her finger. She discovered the blade when she looked under the handle. After taking a few photos with her phone, she then pulled it out and took it to management. She said the blade looked dirty.  Everette is glad she wasn't seriously cut by the blade. But she is even more relieved about the safety of her youngest daughter. "I usually put Claire in the seat part (of the cart) but for some reason I didn't," Everette said. This isn't the first time an incident like this has happened, Everette said. Another woman found a razor blade in her cart at the same store about six months ago, she said. No one was hurt. After turning in the object, Everette said managers checked if she was OK and apologized about the incident. Store officials and Atmore police are collaborating to figure out who planted the razor blades. Erica Jones, Wal-Mart senior manager of corporate communications, said employees are now regularly checking all the shopping carts. Officials are also looking for suspects by watching surveillance video. "We are dumbfounded that someone would do this in our store," Jones said. "This is appalling." Store officials aren't the only one taking extra safety precautions, according to Everette.   "I will be checking my buggy from top to bottom from now on no matter what store it is," she said. "You can never be too careful anymore." Most Read Get email notifications on your comments ...

City leaders are greeting washed-out night skies with a call for updated lighting standards for homes, streets and businesses. Before you dismiss the move as bureaucratic drivel, consider this: You can gaze upon the Milky Way from a Walmart parking lot in Flagstaff, Arizona, population 70,000. In the southern half of Castle Rock, 30-some miles from Denver to Fort Collins’ 65, a black, star-studded sky belies the city’s population of 57,000. SKY SHOW: Visit Rocky Mountain National Park after dark Both cities have cutting-edge policies in place that regulate outdoor lighting to curb light pollution. If Fort Collins does the same, it can prevent light pollution from severing the community’s link to the cosmos. “We just aren’t connected enough to the universe around us,” said Andy Caldwell, director of Fort Collins’ Stargazer Observatory and an astronomy instructor at Front Range Community College. “We need to understand that we’re part of a bigger picture, we’re part of the universe. And if you can’t go out at night and see it, then it’s out of sight, out of mind.” Here’s an easy way to understand just how light-polluted Fort Collins has become: A nice, dark sky — picture the stars above the Grand Canyon — is about 30 percent brighter than the night sky free of light pollution. Central Fort Collins, on the other hand, is now 1,400 percent brighter than the natural night sky. You can see Jupiter, the Big Dipper and a smattering of stars, but you’ll have to hit the outskirts of town to spy the Milky Way. Light-polluted skies don’t give way to a celestial wonderland for about 60 miles. CITY REGULATIONS: The sign rule that changed Fort Collins' look and feel Buy Photo Stars shine above radio towers on top of Rist Canyon Saturday, January 2, 2015.  (Photo: Austin Humphreys/The Coloradoan) Light pollution pretty much starts and ends with outdoor lighting. Bare bulbs, charming old-fashioned streetlamps, floodlights pointed at a sign for a business, anything that isn’t totally shielded and pointing straight down contributes to light pollution. So do white-toned lights compared to yellow- and amber-toned lights. Fort Collins changed its residential building codes in 2014 to require new single-family homes to use outdoor lighting fixtures with a seal of approval from the International Dark Sky Association. But apartment complexes and commercial buildings don’t have to do that. Ginny Sawyer, city project and policy manager, hopes to make the lighting standards universal for new structures by the end of the year. It’s difficult to change standards for existing buildings, but city leaders hope education can fill the gap. ENVIRONMENT: Meet Larimer County's 5 biggest polluters Even if it can’t, updated building codes will help bring back the stars as structures are torn down and renovated. If you’re wondering how you can help preserve the stars above Fort Collins, city staff and local stargazers have one piece of advice: Change your porch light. The International Dark Sky Association has a page online devoted to outdoor lighting guidelines. “The general reaction is, oh, it’s just one light, it’s not going to make much of a difference,” said Greg Halac, outreach coordinator for the Northern Colorado Astronomical Society. “But multiply that by 100,000, and it does.” Other city strategies to save our stars Streetlights: The city operates more than 30,000 of them, but changing all their bulbs in one fell swoop would be pricey. The city is opting instead to test different kinds of lighting as bulbs burn out, experimenting with different color spectrums and brightness levels. Experimental streetlights are being used at city hall and the city's building at 215 N. Mason St.   Natural areas: City leaders want dark-sky certification for all of them. Fort Collins’ natural areas and Larimer County’s open space departments are applying for “dark sky park” recognition for Soapstone Prairie Natural Area and Red Mountain Open Space, respectively. (Those areas are among the darkest in the county.) The International Dark Sky Association label recognizes the areas for “possessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights and a nocturnal environment that is specifically protected for its scientific, natural, educational, cultural heritage, and/or public enjoyment.” Where to stargaze in Fort Collins The Northern Colorado Astronomical Society holds stargazing events. Visit nocoastro.org for more information. The Stargazer Observatory at Observatory Village in southeast Fort Collins holds open houses during the third Saturday of the month, weather permitting.

John Bean, principal of Highcrest Elementary School, was arrested over the weekend at the Walmart plaza on Flatbush Avenue in Hartford. Police said Bean resisted arrest, and was charged with breach of peace. The arrest came as a shock to many, like the Tolland superintendent of schools, who said Bean always went above and beyond and spent hours of his own time working for the better of the children. Bean was an assistant principal of Tolland Intermediate School. He was named principal in Wethersfield two-and-a-half years ago. "I have nothing but positive things to say about Mr. Bean. The information regarding his arrest does not make sense to me,” said Tolland Superintendent Walt Willett. Before Tolland, Bean was a teacher in South Windsor, winning teacher of the year in 2014. Many people took to social media not believing the arrest. “I personally know this man, he taught my children - I can honestly say - John is probably one of the most honest, humble and stand up guys I've ever had the pleasure in knowing,” said John Pereira. “He's a really nice guy who does a good job. I hope he doesn't lose his job over this,” Jon Michael Reynolds said. Bean was placed on leave from the elementary school. He is expected to appear in court on Wednesday.

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 2:20 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Clinton debate showing lifts stocks but oil weighsBy John Biers | AFP – Tue, Sep 27, 2016 10:55 PM AEST Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo Financial markets cheered Hillary Clinton's performance in the first US presidential debate, with stocks and high-risk currencies staging a 'relief rally' as investors hailed her as the victor over Republican rival Donald Trump Global stocks got a boost Tuesday from Democrat Hillary Clinton's strong performance in the first US presidential debate. Equity markets in Asia finished solidly higher, along with US stocks, which were also buoyed by a surge in consumer confidence. But gains were partly offset by weakness in petroleum-linked shares due to lower oil prices. Democrat Clinton is viewed as less of a economic and political wildcard for Wall Street than Republican Donald Trump, and so her success buoyed hopes that she can win in the November election. "Clinton appeared to edge the first debate which has provided a lift for investors, albeit only a slight one as the polls remain extremely close and the campaign has a long way to go," said Craig Erlam at traders Oanda. US investors were also cheered by American consumer confidence rising in September to the highest level since the Great Recession, according to the Conference Board. Shares of retailers Wal-Mart Stores, Macy's and Best Buy all gained 1.0 percent or more. But European stocks posted modest declines, weighed down in part by a sharp drop in oil that hit big petroleum producers such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP and France's Total. The decline in oil prices was sparked by comments from Saudi Arabian and Iranian officials signaling low odds for an agreement in Algeria by major oil producers to limit production. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.6 percent, while the Nikkei in Japan climbed 0.8 percent. The London stock market ended the day 0.2 percent lower, Frankfurt was down 0.3 percent and Paris slid 0.2 percent. One of the biggest movers in the foreign exchange market was the Mexican peso, which rallied against the dollar following the US presidential debate. Trump has vowed a get-tough approach on the US' neighbor to the south, including the building of a massive wall between the two countries that Trump says Mexico will pay for. The dollar fell to as low as 19.369 pesos, more than 2.3 percent. Near 2200 GMT, the dollar was at 19.380 pesos. "The Mexican peso is particularly sensitive to the election and will likely remain very volatile over the next month or so," said Erlam of Oanda. - Key figures at 2100 GMT - New York - DOW: UP 0.7 percent at 18,228.30 (close) New York - S&P 500: UP 0.6 percent at 2,159.93 (close) New York - Nasdaq: UP 0.9 percent at 5,305.71 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 6,807.67 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.3 percent at 10,361.48 (close) Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.2 percent at 4,398.68 (close) EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.5 percent at 2,970.84 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.8 percent at 16,683.93 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 1.1 percent at 23,571.90 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 0.6 percent to 2,998.17 (close) Euro/dollar: DOWN at $1.1217 from $1.1254 late Monday Dollar/yen: UP at 100.36 yen from 100.30 yen Pound/dollar: UP at $1.3011 from $1.2976 @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Crean enlisted to help Latrobe ValleyAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7365 -0.0051 -0.68% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5967 -0.0002 -0.03% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6946 -0.0031 -0.44% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

The mother quickly looked and realized that the other vehicle had also struck her stroller knocking it over and damaging it. Thankfully her child was still in the vehicle and there was no injuries to the mother or the child. The mother made eye contact with the driver and made motions for her to speak to her about the damage to the vehicle and stroller but the other driver quickly left. The suspect vehicle is described as a dark colour Jeep Patriot with no licence plate. The driver appeared to be a female in her 50`s – 60`s with dirty blond hair and glasses. There was nothing distinguishing about the vehicle but when it left, it headed towards the Source in the Quarry. If you have any information about this incident, please contact the Cochrane RCMP at 403-851-8000 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS.

Gordon will also be behind the wheel at Martinsville Speedway (Oct. 30), making a total of eight starts for Gordon in 2016.

I’m really enjoying driving this car again. It has been a lot of fun. Everyone has been doing a great job and putting a huge effort in.” Kasey Kahne on racing at Dover “I’ve always thought that Miles is a really cool trophy to win. As a fan watching I always thought that it was really unique. It also puts a good explanation of that racetrack into a trophy because that’s a really good description of what we fight and what you deal with at Dover. I think that’s a very fitting trophy and it would be great to have one.” Chase Elliott on racing at Dover “There is no doubt Dover is my favorite track. I wish we raced there every single weekend. It suits my driving style. I anticipate it to be a tough race since it’s a cutoff race and there will be guys driving their hearts out to stay in the Chase. This Lowe’s team is due for a win. I would love to get number 11 at Dover this weekend.” Jimmie Johnson on racing at Dover “Alex (Bowman) has been doing a great job, and I’m just happy to do whatever I can to help the (No. 88) team. I’ve always loved Dover. It’s one of the tracks that I feel confident going to, so I’m looking forward to getting back in the car and working with (crew chief) Greg (Ives) and the No. 88 team again this weekend.” Jeff Gordon on racing at Dover ** The opinions expressed on this site are not necessarily those of the publisher.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Hayley Peterson Sep 27th 2016 3:59PM An unlikely company has suddenly catapulted to the top of the fashion world: Amazon. Amazon is now the biggest seller of clothes online in the US, with its apparel sales totalling $16.3 billion last year, Bloomberg reports. That's more than the combined online sales of Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's, Gap, and Victoria's Secret parent L Brands in the same period, according to Bloomberg. Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. Facebook/Amazon Fashion The company's rise as a leader in apparel sales has been swift and relatively quiet. Amazon made one of its first major pushes into the category 10 years ago with the purchase of clothing website ShopBop. Three years later, Amazon bought online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million. 11 PHOTOS Unbelievable finds from Amazon Fashion See Gallery Unbelievable finds from Amazon Fashion MI IM Slip On V-Cut Out Stacked Heel Bootie, more colors available (Amazon) SHOP NOW French Connection Mozart Mix Knits (Amazon) SHOP NOW 3x1 Women's WM3 Crop Selvedge Jeans (Amazon) SHOP NOW Steve Madden Women's Edit Bootie Casual, more colors available (Amazon) SHOP NOW BB Dakota Women's Zalika Faux Suede Coat (Amazon) SHOP NOW Wildfox Academy Stripes Dreams Sweater (Amazon) SHOP NOW Stuart Weitzman Highland Over-the-Knee Boot, more colors available (Amazon) SHOP NOW Jack by BB Dakota Pradera Cotton Twill Army Jacket (Amazon) SHOP NOW J Brand Women's Maria Velvet Flare Pants (Amazon) SHOP NOW Guess Women's Kielo Faux Fur Vest (Amazon) SHOP NOW Up Next See Gallery Discover More Like This of SEE ALL BACK TO SLIDE SHOW CAPTION + HIDE CAPTION – Over the past couple years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first ever New York Men's Fashion Week. The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Barneys New York fashion director Julie Gilhartogue — whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant — and vogue editor Caroline Palmer. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Also in the last few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman. That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated — not things that Amazon is necessarily known for. Facebook/Amazon Fashion But Amazon's strategy appears to be working. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period. Facebook/Amazon Fashion Department store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing. The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the last 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley. Facebook/Amazon Fashion But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. "We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion," the analysts wrote in a recent note In a 2012 interview with the New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason for why Amazon was investing in fashion: "Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item," than with cheaper products, he said.

That means that heading into the busy holiday season, the company is advancing its lead over major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and search engines as the starting point for online shopping. Fifty-five percent of those surveyed go to Amazon first when searching for products, an increase from 44 percent a year earlier, according to a Labor Day weekend poll of 2,000 people released by the Internet marketing firm BloomReach Inc. The second annual survey showed search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, and retailers losing ground to Amazon. Search engines were the starting point for 28 percent of those surveyed, declining from 34 percent a year earlier. Specific retailers were the starting point for 16 percent, down from 21 percent. Amazon Prime, the Seattle-based company's $99-a-year subscription that includes delivery discounts, video and music streaming and online photo storage, has been key to overshadowing competitors in the minds of consumers, said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge estimates Amazon had 49 million prime members in August and subscription growth is accelerating. Amazon has added free same-day delivery and two-hour delivery to Prime subscriptions, as well as food delivery in many cities, increasing the value of membership.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

But Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 764.00 +7.60 +1.00% Global Yellow Pages Ltd AWS ▼ 0.1610 -0.0090 -5.29% Tesla Motors Inc TSLA ▼ 187.19 -1.47 -0.78% Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000 on Tuesday. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. Earlier this month, RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney also predicted Amazon shares would hit $1,000. I’m completely on board with this bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. 2. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. 3. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.

Forbes 9/27/2016 Micheline Maynard, Contributor © Provided by Forbes Media LLC Grocery delivery trucks are a common sight on the streets of New York, Boston, San Francisco and Washington. Companies like Peapod have saved countless hours for busy professionals who just can’t squeeze in a trip to the store to pick up milk and eggs. But a bold prediction from a food industry analyst is raising questions about the future of online grocery sales. Kurt Jetta, chief executive of TABS Analytics, says the sector’s moment is over. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.22 +0.27 +0.25% Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN ▲ 405.92 +1.36 +0.33% Sanofi SA SNYNF ▼ 81.85 -0.95 -1.15% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 763.42 +7.02 +0.93% “TABS Analytics is making the call: online grocery is failing,” Jetta declared at a recent webinar.  He based the declaration on a survey of 1,000 consumers in the company’s fourth annual food and beverage study. Of that group, only 4.5 percent purchased groceries regularly online, and TABS says it has yet to break 5 percent in the four years of its study. Moreover, 69 percent of those surveyed have never bought groceries online, and just 15 percent become repeat online grocery buyers once they’ve given it a try. That loyalty rate should be five times higher, Jetta said during his presentation, given that 70 percent of consumers have a favorite grocery store. He told food companies and grocers, “Stop investing in online grocery until you can figure out why there is such a high level of dissatisfaction with the format.” The company says Amazon.com, which is expanding its Amazon Fresh delivery service in major markets, was the only top retailer to see an increase in online grocery delivery during the past year. To be sure, TABS Analytics is going against conventional wisdom and market activity. Online grocery seems to be drawing new entrants almost every week. In Detroit, the app called Shipt is arranging grocery deliveries from Meijer grocery stores in the area. Participants pay an annual $99 fee, including $25 in groceries, or $14 a month to try it out. The Detroit Free Press says the company is looking to hire 200 more drivers. Shipt already delivers for grocery stores in 26 other markets. Minneapolis consumers can now order groceries online from four Wal-Mart stores, and pick them up in the stores’ parking lots. Wal-Mart offers the service at more than 60 stores around the country. I’ve sampled online delivery in the Boston area from the Roche Bros. grocery chain (it’s also available from rival Stop and Shop, through the delivery company Peapod, which has markets across the United States). The online delivery service was a godsend when I was home sick with bronchitis earlier this year, and I’ve noticed that many of my neighbors also get their groceries dropped off. But, I’m also picky about the quality of food I buy, and I mix up my deliveries with trips to brick and mortar stores. The TABS analysis has already come in for some criticism within the grocery industry, prompting the company to defend some of its points. It says online grocery purchases have been around as long as other types of online buying, such as baby products, vitamins and premium cosmetics. Those sectors are doing fine, while consumers seem to try online purchases and then lose interest. “It’s not an inevitability that online grocery will fail,” TABS said in a news release. “But if nothing changes with the current dynamics, the declining penetration (31% in 2016 vs. 34% in 2015) and the extremely low repeat rates make the demise of online grocery a mathematical certainty.” The firm goes on, “It’s not like we want online grocery to fail. But as it stands, there are no facts to suggest that a massive boom from this channel can be expected any time soon, or ever, really.” Meanwhile, if you rely on that truck that pulls up to drop off a box to your doorman, you might want to keep placing orders so that it will keep arriving.  Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices More From Forbes Jamie Dimon's Decision Not To Be Treasury Secretary Could Cost Him Forbes Is There Another 'You' Out There In A Parallel Universe?

Digital Foodie will work closely with IGA and its retailers to develop marketing offers and training programs for converged groceries proven to achieve a high level of consumer adoption with profitable results for grocers. “The retail grocery industry is undergoing a digital transformation that requires grocers to provide converged services including on-demand and in-store solutions to extend and enhance their current bricks and mortar business and to fend off digital inroads by competitors such as Walmart, Amazon and other large grocery chains,“ said Kalle Koutajoki, CEO of Digital Foodie. “We have nearly a decade of experience in deploying online grocery in the most competitive on-demand grocery markets in the world, while simultaneously ‘cracking the code’ to achieving retailer profitability. I am very excited about this partnership, and with our platform and secret sauce to profitability, IGA retailers can jumpstart their on-demand business instantly while keeping the control of the store brand.” Freshop’s program option will provide full digital personalized engagement and online shopping for IGA’s independent retailers. The company’s full-service offering powers mobile, web and app-clickable circulars, full product catalogs, recipes to shopping lists, list building, and the personalized offers critical to IGA’s independent grocers. Freshop, known throughout the industry for its efficient processing, also offers integration with loyalty platforms, PCI compliant payments, ADA compliant websites, and walkpaths for order fulfillment and outstanding support, all for one simple charge per store.

    Home | About | Archives | Sponsorship | Contact Us | Submit / Suggest            Online Grocery Is Failing, Except For Amazon, Finds TABS Analytics Study by TABS Analytics Posted: Tuesday, September 27, 2016 at 3:34PM EDT The TABS Analytics Fourth Annual Food and Beverage Study found once again that online grocery shopping continues to be weak, with just 4.5 percent of consumers regularly purchasing food and beverages online compared to 78 percent of consumers regularly purchasing food and beverages from brick and mortar grocery outlets. Although regular online grocery purchasing increased by half a percentage point since the 2015 study (from 3.9 percent in 2015 to 4.5 percent in 2016), it has yet to break five percent in the four years TABS has conducted this study. Amazon was the one bright spot in online grocery shopping, with the ecommerce giant realizing a two percent increase in shopper penetration from 14 percent in 2015 to 16 percent in 2016, the TABS study found. Amazon was the only online shopping domain to increase shopper penetration in 2016. Walmart.com remained flat in penetration at 12 percent in both 2015 and 2016, while the grocery banners, overall, dropped from 16 percent in 2015 to just 11 percent in 2016. Target.com saw a two percent grocery penetration decline from seven percent in 2015 to five percent in 2016. The decline in Target.com penetration mirrors their exit from the curbside pickup service. “This study underscores that online grocery is failing,” said Kurt Jetta, CEO and founder of TABS Analytics. “For the fourth year in a row, consumers have turned their backs on buying groceries online no matter how much online grocery retailers try to entice them. Sixty-nine percent of consumers never buy groceries online. With only 15 percent of consumers stating loyalty to shopping for groceries online, this is not a sustainable business model, especially when you consider the industry loyalty rate benchmark is 70 percent. Food companies and grocers need to figure out why there is such a high level of dissatisfaction with the online channel before they continue to invest any further in it.” TABS Analytics Fourth Annual Food and Beverage Study, conducted in August 2016, was developed to uncover detailed information about the U.S. CPG consumables categories and how consumer buying patterns of these categories are shaped by the promotions offered. The survey panel consisted of 1,000 geographically and demographically dispersed consumers between the ages of 18 to 75. The 15 consumables categories analyzed were carbonated beverages, salty snacks, cereal, yogurt, water, ice cream, cookies, fruit juice, refrigerated juices, crackers, frozen pizza, frozen novelties, candy, popcorn, and isotonics (sports drinks). Brick and Mortar Grocery Remains Favorite Channel For the fourth year in a row, the grocery brick and mortar channel continued to dominate all other shopping channels with 78 percent of U.S. consumers regularly preferring to shop in brick and mortar grocery stores. The grocery shopping channel remained stable compared to 2015, Target had a four percent decrease in regular shopping trips from 29 percent in 2015 to 25 percent. Costco, Rite Aid, and BJS all registered a two percent decrease in regular shopping trips compared to 2016. Grocery continues to lead food and beverage purchases, with a 26 percent share for consumers regularly purchasing at a specific outlet (defined as 6 or more times per year). Grocery share was nine points higher than its nearest rival, Walmart. Only Target, Dollar, Costco, and Walgreens broke the five percent share mark. Online’s share of regular purchases was up slightly but was just 1.6 percent. The online share gain was driven by an increase in the expansion of curbside pickup services (called click and collect) across the country. Even with a significant investment in that ecommerce platform, though, only 1.0 percent of Americans say they use the format regularly for grocery shopping. Concentrate on Households with Children, Not Millennials Unlike the cosmetics industry that thrives on millennials buyers, just over a quarter of millennials are heavy buyers of food and beverage consumables, compared to 35 percent of households with children who are heavy buyers of food and beverages. Just 20 percent of households with no children are heavy buyers. Millennials are also harder to target with deals than other demographic groups since their participation in deals is well below the national average, particularly circulars and free standing inserts. Despite an uptick in participation in 2016, millennials use of circulars remains a full 12 percentage points below the study average of 42 percent. The gap for free standing inserts is even larger at 14 percentage points below the study average of 34 percent. Weak Promotions Equal Weak Sales The 2016 TABS Food and Beverage Study corroborated industry trends of declining transactions in consumables. The vast majority of the directional changes in category trends are due to the decrease of heavy buyers. “TABS Analytics Fourth Annual Food and Beverage Study backs up that CPG manufacturers and retailers need to make a significant investment in promotional activity to sustain and grow their businesses. Weaker promotions is directly correlated to weaker sales trends,” said Jetta. “Sustained promotional levels of 15 percent to 20 percent of sales are needed to kick-start declining sales trends and bring heavy buyers back.” About TABS Analytics Operating since 1998, TABS Analytics, formerly TABS Group, based in Shelton, Conn., is a technology-enabled analytics firm.

My Review 3 Stars (out of 5) "You're killin' it, Smalls" This was an anticlimactic shoot-em up with zero message and even fewer "give-a-shits." I didn't hate it. I didn't love it. I didn't fully understand the point of it. "But Alec, Drew Lock's mesmerizing performance was Heisman worthy. I mean, bro, he had 402 yards and 5 touchdowns… at the half!" Yea, I don't think that means what you think it means, bro. "Mizzou put up a team-record 79 points! 79, brah. 79!" Again, I don't think that means what you think it means. "Dude, 79, am I right? Uh huh huh. Nice." That definitely does not mean what you think it means. Wait, what the hell do you think "79" means? (Please don't @ me) Anyway, I can't for the life of me scrounge up enough effort to over-analyze what amounts to nothing more than a bargain bin find at your local Walmart. Any statistic birthed from this game comes with one mighty big asterisk: *FCS. But, I'm here to do a "job", so… here you go. Why This Game Was Worth Watching 1) A much needed palette cleanse 2) Points are nice 3) 79 points are nicer 4) Clay Travis 5) Doubles as the rare Anti Anti-Bullying campaign video 6) SEVENTY-NINE, BRAH! Why It Wasn't 1) It was Delaware State (see Roger Sherman) Delaware State went 1-10 last year with a 1-point win over another team that went 1-10. Here's what happens when they play an SEC team pic.twitter.com/ZD8NAzNe4g — Rodger Sherman (@rodger_sherman) September 24, 2016 Summary: Unnecessary, yet fun… up to a point. Like, point 58. But I don't want to judge. If you enjoy sitting down for 3 hours while your buddy defeats Mario Bros. on invincible STAR mode then this was the game for you. 5 stars, am I right? Though, if you find that particular act of "recreation" repulsive after no more than five minutes, you probably won't care much for what Saturday's exhibition had to offer. I fall somewhere in between. Hence, my 3 star rating. Visual Summary: (Third-string tight end punishes defender in 2nd quarter following first-career reception) What do you think?

Courtroom video shows Brice Rhodes repeatedly vowing to track down Louisville Judge Amber Wolf and her family. Rhodes was in court on charges of attacking and injuring one inmate in August, and spitting on another in September. Brice Rhodes is accused of killing three people. (Louisville Metro Corrections) "I'm gonna keep talking because I don't want to have to see you back here for this," Judge Wolf said during the tense exchange, which was captured on video obtained by WDRBand the Courier-Journal. "I don't care! I don't care!" Rhodes replies, according to the station. "Don't you think I'm gonna [expletive] find out where you live at? ... [expletive] I don't give a [expletive] about none of that! I didn't do [expletive]! I'll be out!" Armed Kentucky man preparing for doomsday at Walmart questioned "So you're saying you're going to find out where I live at?" the judge replied. "I don't give a [expletive] about none of that!" exclaimed Rhodes, who was strapped into a chair and wearing a faceguard. "You got family! I'll be out!" Rhodes threatened Judge Amber Wolf on Friday. (WHAS) "Okay," Wolf said. Rhodes will face charges of terroristic threatening and intimidating a participant in the legal process. Kentucky man stabs father during Sunday service at Baptist church He was already charged with killing 16-year-old Maurice Gordon and 14-year-old Larry Ordway in Shawnee in May. Their burned bodies were dumped behind an abandoned house, according to authorities. Judge Wolf kept her composure as she was being threatened. (WHAS) Detectives say Rhodes killed the teens so they wouldn't speak about his involvement in a prior shooting death. Judge Wolf, who stood firm against Rhodes, showed her compassionate side last month when she allowed an inmate to meet his 1-month-old baby for the first time in her courtroom. Earlier this year, Judge Wolf expressed outrage when a woman was brought into her courtroom without proper clothing. With News Wire Services Kentucky man tries to rob Chuck E.

(AMZN) Is Going to $1,000 Amazon stock is powered by the triumvirate of business: a legacy baseline, growthy projects and an all-time great leader By Tom Taulli, InvestorPlace Writer & IPO Playbook Editor  |  Sep 27, 2016, 2:35 pm EST     Popular Posts: The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World Why Mobileye NV (MBLY) Stock Is a Buyout Lock 3 Absolutely Frightening Trends for Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Recent Posts: Bank of America Corp (BAC) Stock: Is the Trump Boost Over? Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Stock Is Screeching to a Halt The 7 Best Tech Stocks in the World View All Posts Since the dawn of the Internet Age in the mid-1990s, hundreds of dot-coms have come and gone. But Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has built a lasting empire — and made many people very rich in the process. Amazon stock has logged an astounding 47,000%-plus gain during its existence, and it’s now worth $387 billion by market capitalization. Source: Mike Seyfang via Flickr And yet, AMZN still feels like a scrappy startup. During the past 12 months, it has been one of the biggest gainers among large-cap stocks (up roughly 55%). Even Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) has only gained 40% in the past year. And it has done so not just on the back of its giant retail operations, but thanks to explosive growth in cloud services and expansion in streaming video. Can Amazon stock keep up the momentum? JPMorgan certainly thinks so — its analysts boosted their price target on AMZN from $925 to a nice, clean $1,000. That would be a return of more than 20% from today’s prices. I’m completely on board with JPMorgan’s bullishness on Amazon stock. Here are three reasons why: #1: Amazon, The E-Commerce Juggernaut Amazon has spent billions of dollars building its e-commerce platform — not just website development, but building warehouses, installing logistics systems and even deploying robots. AMZN also was smart in developing the Prime program — not just for the one-hour delivery, but because add-on services such as music and video help engage users. 10 Stocks That Should Be in Your Portfolio Right Now All in all, Amazon has built an enormous moat that most rivals can’t touch. According to eMarketer, AMZN controls nearly three-quarters of the U.S. e-commerce market. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT)? Try 3%. E-commerce still is a growth market, too. Based on research from Forrester, e-commerce sales are forecast to improve from $344 billion in 2015 to $480 billion by 2019. Consumers are shifting their buying habits, moving away from traditional brick-and-mortar operators like Macy’s, Inc. (NYSE:M) to digital platforms. Amazon stock should reap the benefits this holiday season, just like the rest. In anticipation of the spurt in revenues, AMZN has opened 18 new fulfillment centers, up from just six last year. It’s just prudent planning. After all, Signal and Shift Communications say about 43% of internet users already are thinking about using Amazon as their primary holiday shopping source. Amazon Web Services (AWS) One longstanding knock against Amazon stock was the company’s long history of net losses. But these are becoming a thing of the past. For the past five quarters, AMZN has pumped out profits — including three quarterly earnings that reached record levels. Yes, the aforementioned e-commerce business remains a low-margin category. But Amazon is countering that with its high-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which provides cloud services to businesses. In the latest quarter, AWS revenues spiked from $1.82 billion to $2.89 billion. That’s nice. Operating income came to a $718 million. That’s just flat-out juicy. The cloud market represents a megatrend in the tech industry. The technology tends to be cheaper than legacy systems, but allows for better analytics and training with less overall maintenance. Amazon isn’t alone. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are ramping their cloud efforts, too. The prospects look bright for this part of the market, with Morgan Stanley predicting that global spending will jump from $70 billion last year to $141 billion by 2019. Jeff Bezos Has Been Great for Amazon Stock Jeff Bezos is one the world’s best CEOs. During the past two decades, he has fended off scores of tough competitors (and even buried a few), and survived grueling recessions and tech busts. A key to his success has certainly been the undeniable focus on his customers. He once summed up his thinking with this little phrase: “Put the customer first. Invent. And be patient.” Bezos hasn’t won on every front, of course. Anyone remember the ill-fated Fire Phone? But innovators rarely have unscathed records, and Bezos has plenty of success — like the Kindle and Echo — to make up for the failures. How Tesla Motors (TSLA) Turned a Hack Into a Competitive Advantage Bezos also has a good sense of finding breakout opportunities, such as AWS, which he built from scratch and turned into a cash cow in roughly a decade. That’s ultimately what will move the needle for Amazon stock.

Wink -- the brand initially launched as an app for GE + Quirky products -- unveiled the second edition of its hub today. With a slimmer design and a faster processor, the Wink Hub 2 also has more memory and locally stored automations for quicker smart home reactions. Available starting in late October at Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon and on Wink's site, the Wink Hub 2 will sell for $100 (£75 or AU$130 converted). If you'd rather, you can still buy the original Wink Hub for $70 (or about £120 in the UK), and I'm glad to hear the company isn't phasing it out. Second-gen home hubs don't have a good track record. The Lowe's Iris smart home system ran into glitches -- and angry customers -- when it pushed everyone from its first-gen system to its second. Wink will let customers make the transition when they're ready, though the updated app that coincides with the new hub will have a tool to help you make the shift if you're already invested in the Wink system. The second SmartThings hub also disappointed with its confusing app and performance issues. With its primary competitors faltering, Wink could seize control of the hub market if its second hub avoids similar issues -- if there's any hub market remaining. The idea of controlling a smart home from a single platform is still enticing, but Apple, Google and Amazon are all making plays to do just that without a hub. Still, the Wink Hub 2 is checking the right boxes. It includes antennas to respond to just about any smart home device. Features Wi-Fi radio that supports 2.4 and 5GHz networks Ethernet port Bluetooth Low Energy radio Thread radio Support for Kidde Support for Lutron Clear Connect Z-Wave antenna Zigbee antenna The Hub will also store schedules and product-to-product triggers you create on its hard drive, which will hopefully make your smart home more responsive. We'll see if that's enough to help Wink stand with tech giants like Google, Amazon and Apple as the race for smart home control heats up.

TERRY AHNER/TIMES NEWS ‹ Prev 1 of 4 Next › Family store ends long run of serving customers By Terry Ahner tahner@tnonline.com For many Lehighton residents, it was a quick stop to pick up keys, screws and other household items. But, come 5 p.m. Friday, Lehighton Hardware will shut its doors for good after more than 90 years in business. Store co-owner Scott Griffith cited increased operating expenses, along with lower profit margins, rising taxes and increased competition as the primary reasons why the decision was made to close the store. Griffith, who lives in Chicago, co-owns the store with his two sisters, Jane, of Villanova, and Georgene, of Schnecksville. He said the fact that buyers purchase items online, along with the presence of Walmart and Lowe’s, were other factors that resulted in the decision. The store was once a mecca of business from the railroad workers and neighbors. Coal was delivered from the store. In the early days, the store held deeds for people, according to paperwork Griffith found in the store. Window repairs have given way to vacuum-sealed triple pane windows. House locks are becoming keyless entries. The store was basically breaking even over the last five years, said Griffith. “Is it disappointing? Absolutely. But you can’t justify breaking even every year,” Griffith said. “We feel sorry. We thank all the patronage over the years.” Griffith said his family is looking for someone to buy the building, which has been for sale for about a year, and added, “We do have some feelers out there.” Customers, such as John Muffley Sr. of Lehighton, wasted no time taking advantage of the store’s going-out-of-business sale. Muffley said he stopped by the store to pick up some paint, and added that he’ll miss “the store, the people.” So, too, will Carol Roth of Lehighton, who said she and her husband regularly frequented the store for various needs. “I was surprised,” Roth said. “My husband shops here for household items, and I shop for holiday items like lights and flags.” Clarence Getz of Franklin Township said he’s been a customer for years. “I had no idea,” Getz said. “You just keep hoping they will find a buyer.” Getz didn’t have to give it much thought as to what he’ll miss most about the store. “The people,” he said. “It’s personal, knowing the people.” The store has three employees, including manager Linda Guy, who will be retiring after 47 years. Getz said he feels for the employees who will have to look for work elsewhere. “It’s sad,” he said. “I know they were good people; it’s a shame to have it come to this.” The business was founded in 1923 as Lehighton Hardware, and was originally located on First Street (the site of the current Rite Aid store), owned by Mahlon Kistler. A fire destroyed that building in 1964, and the business was moved to its current location, at 116 S. Second St. Scott Griffith’s father, George, and his wife, Betty, purchased the store in 1972 after Mahlon Kistler died. Kistler was George Griffith’s stepfather. The store was then taken over by Scott Griffith and his two sisters in 1998. When Griffith was trying to decide if he should help with the store or go to college, his father pushed him toward college. He never came back. “I am so grateful and blessed that Dad worked hard to give us all an education.” Login or register to post comments PrintThis ShareThis American Flags Home News Classifieds Entertainment Lifestyle Obituaries Sports Customer Service About Us Advertise Digital Guidelines Privacy Policy Photos Reproduction is prohibited without the express written consent of the Times News, LLC. © 2016

Bragg area to a growing number of communities across the country (NY, PA, NC, SC, VA, WA). Vietnam vet, Ex-POW, and activist, Ray Schrump sees potential to save many lives. Fayetteville, NC (PRWEB) September 27, 2016 The largest military base in the world will now be part of the regional NCServes Networ,k bringing together Raleigh, Durham and Fayetteville areas’ human service providers across the state to more effectively manage medical, financial, employment, housing and other resource requests from veterans and their families. This new network affiliate, known locally as NCServes RDU/Fayetteville, is the second of four launching statewide. It is part of the Institute for Veteran and Military Families (IVMF) at Syracuse University’s national portfolio of America Serves programs that has connected thousands of veterans, service members, and military families to more than 6,300 types of comprehensive services in less than two years. NCServes RDU/Fayetteville will enable local service members, veterans, and their families easy access—online or in person—to a comprehensive array of services, resources, and care organized specifically around their needs. By linking local providers, it is designed to ensure that positive and quality referrals are made throughout the “Triangle” region spanning Durham to Cumberland. The initiative is driven by a shared software platform that connects all participating federal, state, and non-profit veteran service providers allowing them to make, quick, smart referrals and track outcomes. NCServes RDU/Fayetteville then follows-up on the progress of requests, greatly reducing denial of services experienced by service members and veterans due to capacity or eligibility restrictions. “This would have saved lives, if we had something like this when I came back from Vietnam,” said retired Army Lt.Col. Ray Schrump. Now a leading veterans' advocate in Fayetteville, NC, then-Maj. Schrump was a Green Beret serving in the Vietnam War when he was captured in 1968. Released in 1973 after serving many grueling years as a POW, Lt.Col. Schrump has been a fierce advocate for veterans and has been active in the Fayetteville-area effort to launch the NCServes Network. The NCServes RDU/Fayetteville network is locally coordinated by the United Service Organizations of North Carolina (USO-NC) in partnership with IVMF. All software, trainings, and licenses are all provided at no cost to the North Carolina community thanks to generous support locally by the Walmart Foundation, the Leon Levine Foundation and The Foundation for the Carolinas. “For 75 years, the USO of NC has accomplished its mission of keeping America’s service members connected to family, home, and country, throughout their service to the nation by delivering innovative programs, morale-boosting services and leveraging key partnerships in the community,” said retired Army Lt.Col. John Falkenbury, President, USO of North Carolina.  “Serving as the Coordination Center for Fayetteville, the largest defense community in the world, and tying it into to our efforts in Raleigh, Durham and around the state will create a seamless provider network with “no wrong door.”” Individuals looking for services can engage the NCServes RDU/Fayetteville network four different ways: 1. By phone at the network’s toll-free number 1-800-459-8387 where they can speak with a qualified professional to secure a referral for services and the commitment for follow up. 2. Online via the NCServes website at NCServes.org. 3. In-person at the NCServes RDU/Fayetteville participating NCServes regional providers. 4. Via North Carolina’s State resource line: NC4Vets.com and (844) NC4-VETS “After 26 years in the Army, I’m proud to bring an effort like this home to Ft. Bragg, where it belongs,” said retired Army Colonel Jim McDonough, Managing Director of IVMF and a former Director of the New York State Division of Veterans’ Affairs. “After years of ground work with really dedicated partners, and working closely with NCDMVA Secretary Wilson, the Governor and the State of North Carolina, we are proud to see this initiative grow from Charlotte, to Raleigh/Durham, and now Fayetteville.” In November, NCServes Coastal will launch the network to the US Marine Corps and Air Force installations of the Carolina Coast, tying in to adjacent networks in South Carolina and Virginia.

Roosevelt during World War II for six key community organizations to come together and lift the morale of service members both on the Homefront and downrange.  This heritage of community networks has demonstrated a lasting impact on service members, veterans and their families.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Krystal Steinmetz Sep 27th 2016 12:08PM It's likely you're shelling out less money to pay for groceries than you have in the past. According to Business Insider, many of America's big supermarket chains are reducing their prices amid "ongoing food-price deflation and growing pressure" from the proliferation of discount grocery chains like German-owned discount chain Aldi. Although slashed prices at the grocer typically offer shoppers a reason to celebrate, it's not surprising that the grocery stores themselves don't seem as thrilled. The continued price cuts continue to squeeze profits and tug down company shares. RELATED: 10 supermarket traps you should always avoid: 11 PHOTOS 10 supermarket traps See Gallery 10 supermarket traps Large shopping carts According to Martin Lindstrom, the larger the shopping cart, the more likely you are to spend. The marketing consultant told The Consumerist, "We doubled their size as a test, and customers bought 19% more." Pleasing aromas and colorful sights Walking into a grocery store and smelling freshly baked goods and flowers, especially if you're in a good mood, is a surefire way to get you to throw a few unnecessary items into your cart as your begin shopping experience. Fresh produce first​ After you've already been tricked into picking up a loaf of bread or some flowers, supermarkets also get you by placing the produce in the front of the store. By doing this, they fool you into believing you're being healthier by shopping for fruits and veggies first so you won't feel bad if you decide to stock up on a few unhealthier snacks along the way to checkout, too. Mist on produce You may think the mist on fresh fruits and veggies is helping the produce, but in all actuality, it makes them rot faster. Also, be sure to shake off the access water before purchasing your produce -- the mist tends to add additional weight, making the price go up. Slow, boring music Have you ever wondered why most grocery stores play some sort of elevator music? It's because they want you to take your time while shopping. Many stores play music slower than the average heartbeat, so pop your headphones in and play upbeat music to combat this trick. 10-for-$10 promotions It's common to believe you're getting a great deal during a 10-for-$10 promotion, but say, if a can of beans was originally 87 cents, you're actually paying more versus buying 10 of the same cans when they aren't on "sale." Dairy being in the back of the store The reasoning behind the age-old trick of placing milk and other dairy products in the back of the store may surprise you. Although it forces you to walk through various aisles, the true reason is because trucks unload their shipments in the back of store, and since milk needs to be refrigerated immediately, the easiest place to keep it is in the back. More expensive items at eye level If you've ever wondered why all of the expensive items seem to be the most accessible, there's a reason behind that, too. Supermarkets place cheaper items on the lower and higher shelves and reserve the middle, or eyesight level, shelves for their most expensive products. Buying premium deli products Just because you are buying a seemingly fresh cut of meat or fish from the deli and paying a higher price, doesn't necessarily mean the product is of better quality. Often times, the meat was previously frozen meaning you may have to use it sooner than meat you would buy from the frozen section. Changing the layout of the store... often Don't get too comfortable with your local supermarket's layout. Markets believe that when a person remembers where there items they plan on buying are, they'll spend less time in the store and will ultimately spend less money.

In a price check last year, Business Insider found Aldi's prices were about 30 percent lower than Walmart's. To help prevent stores like Aldi from wooing their customers away with low prices, Business Insider says Kroger has decreased the cost of 1,000 popular grocery items in many of its stores. Dollar General, Trader Joe's and Walmart have also worked to slash prices this year. Aldi has 1,500 stores in the U.S. now, with plans to construct 500 more stores over the next two years. Lidl, another German-based discount supermarket chain, also plans to open up shop in the U.S. The company told Business Insider that it has plans to open stores in "dozens of cities" in the U.S. Where do you shop for groceries?

Wink -- the brand initially launched as an app for GE + Quirky products -- unveiled the second edition of its hub today. With a slimmer design and a faster processor, the Wink Hub 2 also has more memory and locally stored automations for quicker smart home reactions. Available starting in late October at Home Depot, Walmart, Amazon and on Wink's site, the Wink Hub 2 will sell for $100 (£75 or AU$130 converted). If you'd rather, you can still buy the original Wink Hub for $70 (or about £120 in the UK), and I'm glad to hear the company isn't phasing it out. Second-gen home hubs don't have a good track record. The Lowe's Iris smart home system ran into glitches -- and angry customers -- when it pushed everyone from its first-gen system to its second. Wink will let customers make the transition when they're ready, though the updated app that coincides with the new hub will have a tool to help you make the shift if you're already invested in the Wink system. The second SmartThings hub also disappointed with its confusing app and performance issues. With its primary competitors faltering, Wink could seize control of the hub market if its second hub avoids similar issues -- if there's any hub market remaining. The idea of controlling a smart home from a single platform is still enticing, but Apple, Google and Amazon are all making plays to do just that without a hub. Still, the Wink Hub 2 is checking the right boxes. It includes antennas to respond to just about any smart home device. Features Wi-Fi radio that supports 2.4 and 5GHz networks Ethernet port Bluetooth Low Energy radio Thread radio Support for Kidde Support for Lutron Clear Connect Z-Wave antenna Zigbee antenna The Hub will also store schedules and product-to-product triggers you create on its hard drive, which will hopefully make your smart home more responsive. We'll see if that's enough to help Wink stand with tech giants like Google, Amazon and Apple as the race for smart home control heats up.

Starting September 27th, the first person to refer the most investors who join StartEngine by December 31st, 2016 will win a grand prize of $20,000 from StartEngine along with a free Elio Motors vehicle. Los Angeles, CA (PRWEB) September 27, 2016 StartEngine, the leader in Online Public Offerings, today announced the launch of its innovative investor referral competition. Starting September 27th, the first person to refer the most investors who join StartEngine by December 31st, 2016 will win a grand prize of $20,000 from StartEngine along with a free Elio Motors vehicle. If the winner gets over 50,000 sign ups, StartEngine will double the cash and will give away $40,000. The launch of this competition follows on the heels of the recent Jet.com announcement. Their own contest winner, Eric Martin, received 100,000 Jet shares and is now set to be a millionaire after that company was acquired by WalMart in a $3.3 billion deal. “We are thrilled about launching the first referral competition in our industry as this will excite and engage all types of investors,” Howard Marks, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of StartEngine said. “Eric Martin is an investor. He made an investment as an ordinary person before the JOBS Act permitted people like him to invest. Today, everyone can too. With OPOs you can go on StartEngine and invest in emerging companies, although everyone may not have Eric’s luck. We need people like Eric to help us spread this message to the world.” This announcement comes after the new Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF) rules went into effect on May 16th, allowing companies on StartEngine to raise up to $1M. Companies on StartEngine were already raising up to $50M through Regulation A+. Both regulations allow accredited and non-accredited investors – the rest of the general population from middle class families, to hard working dads, to minorities – to invest easily in privately held companies for the first time in 80 years. Last February, StartEngine helped Elio Motors raise nearly $17M from 6,345 investor, 94% of which were non-accredited investors. “People can spread the word and invite their communities to join our momentum through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media channels” Co-Founder and CEO Ron Miller said. “Now that the world of finance has gone online, we are committed to providing solutions that will drive engagement from those looking to capitalize on meaningful investment opportunities, while driving funding to startups and emerging businesses. Our goal is to help entrepreneurs achieve their dreams, while also providing investment opportunities to everyone and through referrals, and, we feel we can accomplish this goal.”     StartEngine also recently announced the StartEngine Marketing Fund, which advances companies that list on StartEngine up to $50,000 to help them market and promote their crowdfunding campaigns. Another incentive program recently announced was StartEngine’s fee-free Small OPO program (under Reg CF).

Events Close Provided Coney Additional charge filed against man who exposed self to shoppers in Wal-Mart IAN RICHARDSON irichardson@siouxcityjournal.com Sep 27, 2016 (…) Coney Provided SIOUX CITY | A Sioux City man charged in August for exposing himself to female shoppers at Wal-Mart is facing an additional charge after police say he exposed himself to passengers on a city bus earlier that day.  According to court documents, 50-year-old Douglas John Coney boarded the Southern Hills bus around 5 p.m. Aug. 2. At the time, passengers observed that his pants were undone.  Documents say as he walked to his seat, Coney's pants were caught on a witnesses' stroller and fell down, exposing his genitals. Documents say Coney sat near three witnesses, who were accompanied by a 2-year-old child, for the 30-minute bus ride to the downtown MLK station. During the ride, documents say the witnesses observed Coney exposing his genitals and touching them three to five times during the trip. Witnesses told the bus driver, and Coney was kicked off the bus, according to documents.  Coney then proceeded to the Wal-Mart on Floyd Boulevard, where he was arrested around 5:30 p.m. for exposing himself to multiple female customers while riding around the store on an electric scooter. Coney pleaded not guilty last week to that charge.  Coney was charged Monday with an additional indecent exposure charge and is being held in the Woodbury County Jail on $5,000 bond.  Coney Provided More information Milford man charged with sexual abuse MILFORD, Iowa | A Milford man is facing a sexual abuse charge after authorities say he performed a sex act with an underage female earlier this year.

Majority Of Shoppers Using Amazon To Search For Products, Even If They Buy Elsewhere Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Majority Of Shoppers Using Amazon To Search For Products, Even If They Buy Elsewhere Image courtesy of Alan Rappa September 27, 2016 9:32 am EST By Ashlee Kieler@akieler where's your shopping start? amazon shopping window shopping retail walmart survey For years we’ve talked about “showrooming” — the practice of going to a bricks-and-mortar retailer just to look at a product you intend to buy online, and now Amazon has apparently supplanted traditional search engines as the place for most Americans to begin their product hunt. Bloomberg reports on a recent survey from BloomReach, which found that 55% of 2,000 people surveyed visit Amazon first when searching for products, while 28% of shoppers turn to search engines, such as Google and Yahoo, as a starting point. The number of people window-shopping, if you will, on Amazon represents an 11% increase over the same survey results in 2015. “Amazon has become the reference point for shoppers,” Jason Seeba, head of marketing for BloomReach, tells Bloomberg. “Shoppers will go to Amazon first to find a product and check prices.” Last year, 44% of consumers began product searches with Amazon, while 34% started with search engines. Trips to physical retailers for browsing and comparison shopping continues to decline, the survey found, with just 16% of shoppers making trips to big box stores or mall, down from 21% last year. Those rates aren’t exactly welcome news for retailers like Walmart and Target, which have struggled in recent years to compete with Amazon. Still, Walmart’s recent $3 billion purchase of Jet.com could propel the company toward a more even playing field. The retailer also this year launched a $50/year free-shipping option called ShippingPass, to compete with Amazon’s $99/year (or $10/month) Prime membership that includes free two-day shipping on thousands of products. But ShippingPass and the addition of Jet.com to its portfolio might not be enough to help Walmart move past Amazon’s appeal, analysts says, noting that the e-commerce giant continues to add “layers” to its services. “Prime members have the Amazon app on the front screen of their smartphones. That definitely hurts Walmart,” John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Blackledge, told Bloomberg.

Unfortunately for pet parents, each tail wag, tug-of-war and cuddle session has a side effect, especially during fall shedding season. Fortunately, Eureka has the "pawfect" solution: The Ultimate Clean Pet Upright Vacuum (AS3451A). The Ultimate Clean Pet combines Eureka's popular deep-cleaning AirSpeed® Technology with a No-Tangle Brushroll™, Arm & Hammer Fresh Home Allergen Filter, a full suite of pet-hair-removing accessories and an extra-large dust cup so pet owners can clean longer -- and pick up more in a single pass -- all while worrying less about vacuum maintenance. "Maintaining a clean home with pets can be a challenge. Busy pet owners need an approachable, reliable solution that makes what once was a daunting task easy to accomplish," said Jillian Hillard, director of product marketing for Eureka. "With the new Ultimate Clean Pet, pet owners can feel confident that they have a dependable vacuum to whisk hair away quickly, and get them back to spending time with the people and pets they love." The Eureka Ultimate Clean Pet provides all the top features pet owners need at a great value, including: Superior suction: AirSpeed® Technology removes hair and debris from floors and furniture thanks to a more direct air path from the floor into the dust cup -- meaning less distance for dirt to travel. Self-cleaning brushroll: the No-Tangle Brushroll™ removes tangles with the press of a pedal to make maintenance easy and keep your vacuum running at peak performance. Simply press the patented Brushroll Clean™ pedal for about 10 seconds, and tangled hair and dirt are cut away from the brushroll and whisked into the dust cup. For deep cleaning on all floors, the brushroll also turns on for carpets and off to safely clean all hard floor surfaces. Effective hard floor pick-up: the Scatterproof Crumb Cleaner™ picks up debris without scattering it around the floor, guaranteeing a deep, confident clean. Cleaner, fresher air: the Arm & Hammer Fresh Home Allergen Filter reduces dust and allergens. Multisurface hair removal: the Pet Pal™ Cleaning Tools Plus removes pet hair from stairs, furniture and wherever pets might play using the on-board Pet Power Paw®, crevice tool and a dusting brush with plastic teeth to grab pet hair from hard-to-clean areas. "Whether cleaning carpets, bare floors or hard-to-reach areas, pet owners can trust that the Ultimate Clean Pet will provide the powerful, high-quality performance that makes cleaning and life easier," said Hillard. The Eureka Ultimate Clean Pet is available exclusively at Walmart and Walmart.com for a suggested retail price of $178. For more information, consumers can visit eureka.com.
