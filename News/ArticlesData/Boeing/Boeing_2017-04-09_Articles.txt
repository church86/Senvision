The first versions of the plane were feeble by today's standards: the 737 100 “boasted” a range of just 1,150 miles (1,850km) and offering just 107 seats. Both of those features were, however, a little better than rival planes of the time like the DC-9. Also saving money was a design that pinched elements of Boeing's 707 and 727 while allowing the plane to operate with a flight crew of just two. The first models were also easily adapted to fly people, cargo, or both. The design also called for low maintenance so that the plane could be used to reach destinations where ground support was minimal. Boeing even offered a “gravel kit” to allow use of unpaved runways. The plane was not a big hit in its early years: for four years in the 1970s Boeing shipped fewer than 30 planes. But it - pardon the pun – took off in the 1980s as airline deregulation and rising middle class incomes increased demand for air travel. 5 perfect 10's! #OTD 50 yrs ago, the 737 made its first flight. Learn more about where we are today: https://t.co/vyP7I31hGz #avgeek #Boeing pic.twitter.com/P6PXTXyy8q — Boeing Airplanes (@BoeingAirplanes) April 9, 2017 Early in the 1980s decade Boeing refreshed the plane, adding the 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500 to the range and adopting a distinctive non-circular engine inlet. Range and capacity increased, as did fuel economy, and the plane started selling a hundred or more units a year. In the early 1990s another round of updates produced the “Next Generation 737”, complete with distinctive winglets, seat counts of 149 on the model -600 and 700, 189 on the 737-800 and a whopping 220 seats and 5,400km range for the top-of-the-range model 737-900ER. The plane soon became so reliable that became a favourite of low-cost airlines. The two paragons of that model, Southwest and Ryanair, made a virtue of operating all-737 fleets, further accelerating demand for air travel and for more 737s. Boeing can therefore now deliver 737s at a rate of more than one a day and has unfilled orders for more than 4,500 of the planes on its books. Many of those orders are for the new “737MAX” variant, sporting the X-wing - officially the “Advanced Technology Winglet” - that will again reduce fuel consumption and noise. Boeing will start shipping the new variant in May 2017 and they'll start to appear at the world's airports not long afterwards.

There's also a “business jet” variant for those who can afford their own plane. All those variants have added up to 9,448 shipments, making it the world's most popular airliner. It's also been involved in 168 accidents that have seen the aircraft written off as a result, and over 3,000 fatalities. ® Tips and corrections 6 Comments More from The Register Boeing's X-Wing 737 makes first flight British-made winglets debut on new version of world's most popular airliner 19 Comments Pilot posts detailed MS Flight Sim video of how to land Boeing 737 Vid This'll come in handy if the pilots are unconscious AND you have Wi-Fi 108 Comments NASA books second Boeing space taxi CST-100 Starliner to lift more 'nauts to ISS 26 Comments Did you almost prang a 737 jet with a drone over Dallas?

Boeing is one of several large businesses that would see a property tax cut under Republican lawmakers’ plan to fix how Washington state pays for schools. Drew Perine Staff file, 2009 i By Melissa Santos msantos@thenewstribune.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When it comes to taxing businesses to pay for schools, state lawmakers in Olympia remain of two minds. While Democrats are proposing business tax hikes, a Republican plan would give many of Washington’s largest corporations a sizable property tax cut. Those breaks would include a $7.4 million annual reduction for Boeing, a $6 million cut for Puget Sound Energy and a $1.8 million break for Alaska Airlines, according to new estimates from the state Department of Revenue. Other corporations projected to receive property tax breaks topping $1 million a year under the Republican plan include Walmart, CenturyLink, Avista, BNSF Railway Co. and Weyerhaeuser. Some other big Washington businesses, including Microsoft and Amazon, would see their property taxes go up under the Republican plan. Still, statewide the GOP proposal would result in a net tax decrease of $92 million a year for owners of nonresidential parcels worth $5 million or more. Costco, Comcast and the owners of the Tacoma Mall are among those that would see property tax cuts of several hundred thousand dollars a year if the Republican plan becomes law. “I have a retired grandmother in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle who’s going to see hundreds of dollars in tax increases so that Walmart can receive millions of dollars in tax reductions.” State Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle Democrats say the tax breaks show that the Republican plan is unfair, because it simultaneously would raise taxes for property owners in high-cost areas such as Seattle and Bellevue. “What that means in real-people language is I have a retired grandmother in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle who’s going to see hundreds of dollars in tax increases so that Walmart can receive millions of dollars in tax reductions,” said state Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle. Republicans who control the state Senate say companies in rural and suburban areas could use the extra help, and that lowering their taxes is simply a byproduct of fixing how the state pays for schools. “It’s by no means the point of our bill, but it goes toward the inherent inequity in the levy system,” said state Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia, referring to disparities in how much money rich and poor school districts can raise in local property-tax levies. “If we can not only fix the underlying levy system, but also bring our overall state economy closer together so we don’t have these two economies that change at the Seattle city line, then that’s a good thing for all of us,” said Braun, the lead Senate budget writer. In the McCleary school-funding case, state lawmakers are working to comply with a court order to fully fund basic education. To do that, the state must take on the full cost of teachers’ and other school employees’ salaries, part of which now are being paid unconstitutionally through local school district property-tax levies. Republican Senate leaders aim to solve that problem by enacting a new statewide property tax of $1.55 per $1,000 in assessed property value, while eliminating local school district levies starting in 2019. That means property taxes in some areas, including many rural and suburban school districts, would go down, because right now their local levy rates are higher than the GOP’s proposed flat rate. For that reason, Boeing’s facilities in and around Everett would get a cut in property taxes of about $2.9 million annually under the Republican plan, according to the Revenue Department’s estimates. The aerospace company already benefited from more than $300 million in tax breaks from the state in 2015. It goes toward the inherent inequity of the levy system. State Sen. John Braun, R-Centralia At the same time, areas with high property values and low levy rates — such as Seattle, Mercer Island and Redmond — would see big tax increases under the Republican proposal. That’s why companies in those areas, including Amazon and Microsoft, would see their taxes rise. David Schumacher, the budget director for Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, said others besides tech giants would have to pay more under the GOP plan. “The problem is that in Seattle, Mercer Island and Bellevue, you don’t have to be rich to see your property taxes going up,” he said. “Every business in Seattle is not Amazon.” The Revenue Department analysis didn’t consider the potential effects of new, more modest local levies that school districts could enact starting in 2020 under the GOP plan. If school districts enact those additional taxes, large companies in their boundaries wouldn’t necessarily see the same tax breaks. Democrats who control the state House are largely looking at options other than property-tax changes to solve the McCleary problem. Their budget proposal would raise about $3 billion in other taxes, without substantially altering local school-district levies. Under the House Democrats’ proposal, businesses with a taxable revenue of more than $250,000 would see a 20 percent hike in their business and occupation tax rates, a change that would bring the state about $1.2 billion in revenue every two years. While the Democratic plan would exempt many small businesses from paying B&O taxes and allow others a $100,000 deduction, about 72,000 companies that bring in more than $500,000 a year would feel the full brunt of the 20 percent tax increase. House leaders also want to enact a new tax on capital gains, such as income from the sales of stocks and bonds, which Republicans have sharply criticized as the first step toward enacting a general income tax in Washington. A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the $7.4 million property break the company would receive under the Senate GOP plan, or which approach the company favors to solve McCleary. The Washington Roundtable, a business group, hasn’t taken a position on the House and Senate tax proposals, either, said Steve Mullin, the organization’s president. The roundtable’s members include executives from several businesses that would see property-tax reductions under the Senate Republican plan. Mullin said that although his group hasn’t weighed in on either tax package, he sees the Senate GOP’s plan as being more progressive than Democrats give it credit for. In promoting some of their tax proposals this year, including the capital gains tax, Democrats have talked about the need to make wealthy individuals pay their fair share. “When you look at the whole Washington system, this change would make it more progressive on average,” Mullin said of the GOP’s property tax plan. “Wealthy individuals and businesses in high-value areas are going to proportionally pay more taxes.” Melissa Santos: 360-357-0209, @melissasantos1 Tax changes for businesses under GOP plan An analysis by the state Department of Revenue looked at how a Republican plan to fix funding of Washington’s schools would affect nonresidential taxpayers with parcels valued at $5 million or more, based on the companies’ tax bills from 2016. The analysis looked at the effects of imposing the GOP’s proposed statewide property tax of $1.55 per $1,000 in assessed value, while eliminating local school district property tax levies starting in 2019. The analysis doesn’t account for potential tax increases that could come from districts enacting new, more modest local levies starting in 2020, as the GOP plan allows.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 April 2017 by Military News Boeing Soars Ahead of Airbus in the Order Race to Start 2017 Over the past few years, Boeing (NYSE: BA) has typically trailed its top rival Airbus (NASDAQOTH: EADSY) in terms of bringing in aircraft orders. This has been a recurring concern for investors. However, Boeing may be able to snap its losing streak this year. With the first quarter in the books, Boeing is far ahead of Airbus in the order race for 2017. Boeing starts 2017 on a tear Order activity has been slowing across the aerospace industry since 2014, driven by a combination of buyer fatigue after several years of strong orders, economic weakness in certain markets, and lower fuel prices (which made it less urgent to replace older planes). Last year, for the first time since 2009, Boeing failed to sell as many planes as it delivered. Boeing fell short of its aircraft sales target in 2016. Image source: Boeing. As a result, Boeing entered 2017 with fairly modest sales expectations for the year. On the company’s January earnings call, CEO Dennis Muilenberg said that Boeing would probably capture a similar number of net orders to the 668 it brought in during 2016. So far, Boeing has had no trouble finding buyers for its planes. Last week, it reported that it received 198 net orders during Q1. This was far ahead of the 121 net orders it logged in the first quarter of 2016. As always, the 737 family led the way, with 167 net orders: 70 for the current version and 97 for the upcoming 737 MAX. Boeing also received 15 orders for the 767 as part of the U.S. Air Force tanker program and 11 orders for the 787 Dreamliner. Most importantly, the struggling current-generation 777 won nine orders last quarter. This will help Boeing avoid any further production cuts beyond what it has already announced. Of note, Boeing’s Q1 order activity did not include the company’s previously announced deal with Singapore Airlines for 39 widebodies. That order hasn’t been finalized yet. Airbus flops While Boeing’s Q1 order performance was all the company could have hoped for and more, Airbus had an extremely quiet quarter. In fact, as of the end of February, it had more cancellations than orders for the year. Airbus’ order momentum has cooled off in the first few months of 2017. Image source: Airbus. During March, Airbus at least managed to get back into positive territory. The company ended Q1 with just six net orders year to date, consisting of nine net orders for the popular A320 narrowbody family and three orders for the A350 widebody, offset by four A330neo cancellations and two A380 cancellations. The A330neo and A380 cancellations were widely expected. However, they hit Airbus’ two weakest products. The A380 backlog continues to shrink and Emirates seems to be the only airline truly committed to the jumbo jet. Meanwhile, the A330-800neo is down to just six orders from a single customer, making it doubtful that Airbus will proceed with development. Thus, the A330neo „family” may end up having just one member: the larger A330-900neo. It’s still early Clearly, Boeing had a strong start to 2017, while Airbus did not. However, it’s way too early for Boeing executives — or investors — to take a victory lap. Aircraft orders tend to come in spurts, and three months isn’t a very long time. Airbus could catch up in a hurry if it reels in two or three big deals. Furthermore, Airbus is still well ahead of Boeing in terms of its total order backlog. As of the end of March, Airbus had 6,744 unfilled airplane orders, exactly 1,000 more than Boeing. These massive backlogs mean that Boeing and (especially) Airbus have most of their production locked in for the next decade. For now, they should focus on filling in the remaining gaps relative to their production plans. Boeing did a great job in that respect last quarter. 10 stocks we like better than Boeing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As he explained, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued Boeing and Airbus the required permit for selling their accorded 180 airplanes to Iran and accordingly, Boeing will deliver the first 777 airplane to Iran by the said time. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi announced in mid-January that renovation of the fleet of Iran’s flag carrier airline Iran Air has begun, adding that according to the contracts with world major plane makers, Iran Air is to receive 200 new planes, of which 100 will be purchased from Airbus and 80 from Boeing. The first, second and third planes that Iran has purchased from the European aviation giant Airbus landed in Tehran on January 12, March 11, and March 25,  2017, respectively.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Rubio: Cancel Boeing deal to hurt Russia, Syria By Anna Giaritelli (@anna_giaritelli) • 4/9/17 10:53 AM Anna Giaritelli Breaking News Reporter The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/AnnaGiaritelliHeadshot1.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., on Sunday said a new multi-billion dollar deal between Boeing and an Iranian airline "should be canceled." "We should be increasing sanctions significantly on Iranian and Russian interests that are helping Assad. In particular, this Boeing deal should be canceled," Rubio said. Last week, Boeing said it had agreed to sell $3 billion in airplanes to an Iranian airline, though President Trump could thwart the deal. Rubio also said Sunday he is "concerned" about the Trump administration's Syria strategy following Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's comments about tackling the Islamic State before stabilizing Bashar Assad's country. The Foreign Relations Committee member is worried that new comments by Tillerson do not take the necessary steps against helping Syria and its allies. Rubio pointed to the difference between statements Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made last week about removing Assad and what Tillerson said on Sunday. "What I'm telling you is I think the strategy he seems to be outlining is based on assumptions that aren't going to work. There is no such thing as Assad, yes, but ISIS, no. This focus that you can defeat ISIS as long as Assad is there is not true. They are two sides to the same coin," Rubio told ABC "This Week" anchor George Stephanopoulos. "This idea that we can defeat ISIS and then figure it out, it won't work." Rubio had praised Trump's missile launches at the Syrian air base on Thursday, but following new reports that the airfield is up and running again, he said the U.S. must abandon its Libyan-like approach to stabilizing a country, which Tillerson referenced earlier.

Passengers also helped with the process, which took place soon after the take-off on the flight, which started its journey from Guinea's capital Conakry to Istanbul via Ouagadougou. The mother named Nafi Diaby, was 28 weeks pregnant and she complained of labor pains soon after the flight took off from the airport. The baby named Kadiju and her mother were reported to be in good health but were tired after the entire process. The flight crew transported the pair to a hospital immediately after the Boeing 737 landed in the Burkina Faso capital. According to a statement issued by the Turkish Airlines Friday, they confirmed the pair was safe. “After the smooth landing of Boeing B737-900 type aircraft to the Ouagadougou Airport, the mother Nafi Diaby and her newborn baby girl were taken to the hospital in order to be kept under observation for a while. Turkish Airlines’ Ouagadougou station officials reported that the baby and the mother currently do not have any health problems. And they also added that they’re still closely taking care of the mother and the newborn baby who named as “Kadiju”, on their stay at hospital,” the statement read.

Most airlines around the world authorize pregnant women to travel on flights until they are 36 weeks pregnant. However, they require providing a doctor’s certificate from 28 weeks onward that confirms the expected date of birth.

April 10, 2017 0700 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:190557 Publish Date: Sun, 09 Apr 2017 19:13:35 GMT Service: Business First Boeing aircraft to land in Tehran American airplane giant Boeing will deliver its first plane to Iran within a month, said an official of the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development. Earlier in 2015, Iran and Boeing had successfully reached a deal based on which the latter agreed to sell 80 planes to Iran. The preliminary agreement had been subject to restrictions set by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury, according to Mehr News Agency. Only recently has it endorsed Boeing's lucrative deal with Iran to sell 80 such planes, along with allowing the purchase by Iran of 100 Airbus different models. The first Boeing to land in Tehran will be a Boeing 777, famous and much vaunted for its flight security. The plane will be operated by Iran Air. The plane is part of the deal which includes 79 other short- and long-range Boeing planes to renew Iran's antiquated air fleet. Turkish Airlines placed an order with the company for Boeing 777 and is now unwilling to receive it, so Iran will be its destination. Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy roads and urban development minister, said: "This is the brand-new plane. Boeing 777 which will be landing in Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport. The first date when Boeing is supposed to deliver its first plane is 2018, however, our order matched this Boeing model and it is a propitious time to receive one." Iran received three Airbus planes earlier, with the last landing in Mehrabad Airport late March.     KeyWords Boeing aircraft Iran   Related News : Boeing offers three aircraft models to Iran Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran, Netherlands to cooperate in water management Techno-engineering services exports exceed $4b Pakistan urged to reconsider FTA with Iran BP announces annual income from joint gas field with Iran in North Sea First Boeing aircraft to land in Tehran Zanganeh: IPC oil contracts will boost foreign investment Italy’s finance minister: Banks should be given time to sell bad loans Greece plans to cut corporate tax in 2020 South Korean financial services industry saw robust growth last year Iran, Kazakhstan ink MoU on agricultural cooperation Most Visited 86% of Trump counties earn less per year than 27 White House staff US will tackle North Korea alone if necessary: Trump Trump grants Pentagon greater warfighting control amid more deployments in ME war zones US won’t accept Assad participating in elections: Haley Judge to Trump: No protection for speech inciting violence Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner makes surprise visit to Iraq South Korea, Japan, US start 3-day joint exercise on Korean Peninsula Flynn failed to disclose income from Russian entities: White House Anti-war groups protest US strikes against Syria Trump praises Sisi at White House visit despite protests outside Arkansas to rush executions due to expiring lethal drug No point in ‘alarmist rhetoric’ over US undemocratic measures under Trump www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/4013 sec

Earlier in 2015, Iran and Boeing had successfully hit a deal by which the latter airline industry giant agreed to sell 80 planes to Iran. The preliminary agreement had been subject to restrictions set by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the US Department of the Treasury. Only recently has it endorsed Boeing's lucrative deal with Iran to sell 80 such planes, along with allowing purchase by Iran of 100 Airbus different models. The first Boeing to land in Tehran will be a Boeing 777, famous and much vaunted for its flight security. The plane will be operated by Iran Air (Homa). The plane is part of the deal which includes 79 other short- and long-range Boeing planes to renew Iran's antiquated air fleet. Boeing 777 is the plane the order for which the company received from Turkish Airlines, and now with the latter unwilling to receive it, Iran will be its destination.  Asghar Fakhrieh Kashan, deputy-Minister of Roads and Urban Planning, confirmed the news for Mehr News; "this is the brand-new plane, Boeing 777 which will be landing in Tehran's Mehrabad Airport; the first date when Boeing is supposed to deliver its first plane is 2018; however, our order matched this Boeing model and it is a propitious time to receive one," he said.  Iran had received 3 Airbuses earlier, with the last having landed in Mehrabad Airport late March.    SH/3948549 Related News Iranian airliner buys 60 Boeing airplanes Second post-JCPOA Airbus lands in Mehrabad Aseman Airlines to buy Rolls-Royce jet engines Iran finalizes deal with ATR Contracts with Boeing, Airbus still in force Tags Airbus Boeing Iran Air OFAC Comment * Name Email or Website * Your Comment * Please enter the correct answer 3 + 2 = TOP 10 Good ties with Iran highly important to Slovakia Navy flotilla makes 1st voyage to Kazakhstan 2 bodies uncovered in Sefid Sang village SNSC to endorse new oil deals: Oil Min.

Aerospace blog Production on Boeing’s KC-46 program already a year behind Dan Catchpole Sun Apr 9th, 2017 9:07pm BusinessNews You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Boeing is adding a sixth test aircraft to avoid further delays to its new aerial refueling tanker program. A sixth test airplane is slated to start flying by late April, a company official said. The company’s Everett-based KC-46 program is already a year behind schedule and is at risk of slipping further, according to a recent federal report. Boeing’s current plan to start delivering KC-46 tankers in September requires the company to complete remaining tests twice as fast as the current pace and deliver airplanes faster than previously planned, according to a Government Accountability Office, or GAO, report from late March. Also, the Air Force and Boeing are negotiating changes to their contract. Boeing could have to cover the Air Force’s additional costs caused by the late deliveries, according to the report. The company already has covered about $1.5 billion in cost overruns on the development program so far, including $243 million before taxes announced in April 2016. While the aerospace giant has spent more than anticipated to develop a military tanker based on its popular 767 commercial jet, the overall cost to taxpayers has steadily declined since Boeing won the Air Force contract in 2011. The deal to develop and deliver 179 tankers was expected to cost $51.7 billion in 2011. That has dropped 14 percent to $44.4 billion this year, according to the report. The contract includes a fixed-price deal worth $4.9 billion for developing a KC-46 tanker with the ability to handle multiple combat and support missions, and options for the U.S. military to buy production versions of the tanker. The Air Force ordered the KC-46 to upgrade its aging tanker fleet, which largely consists of 1950s-era KC-135 tankers. Boeing agreed to deliver the first batch of 18 combat-ready airplanes by August 2017. Production and design problems have delayed development. The company plans to start delivering three tankers a month in September 2017. Complete delivery of the first batch would be by February 2018, the company says. “We’re continuing to build aircraft on pace in the factory and currently have more than 20 aircraft in the production flow,” which Boeing streamlined last year to increase output, company spokesman Chick Ramey said. However, it will take several more months to deliver refueling pods hung on the tankers’ wings. The pods can extend a hose for an aircraft needing to take on fuel in flight. With a pod attached to each wing, the KC-46 can refuel two aircraft at a time. It also has a hose and boom — essentially a giant straw — that can extend from its fuselage. The wing pods will not be delivered until October 2018, according to the GAO report. The test airplanes are meeting or beating the Air Force’s performance requirements so far, according to the report and a Boeing spokesman. The KC-46s are consuming less fuel than expected, and so far have needed less maintenance work than anticipated. Boeing expects that even after the test planes add flight hours, the aircraft will still need less replacement parts and other maintenance than as required by the military, according to the report. “Regarding flight test, we continue to make steady progress,” Ramey said. Boeing believes the GAO is overestimating how long finishing tests will take, he said. The company and Air Force are looking to eliminate unnecessary tests or rearrange test schedules to move things along more quickly. “The test team expects to be much more efficient during the second half of testing now that the design has stabilized,” Ramey said. “We’re also shortly going to be adding a sixth aircraft to the flight test program, which will help complete additional ground and flight” tests.

Photo / Zunum Aero Imagine taking your next trip of a couple hundred miles. New York City to Boston, for example. Or Houston to Dallas. Tampa to Miami. The obvious choice now might be to drive. But what if you could show up at an airport at one of those cities, bypass security checkpoints, board a small hybrid-electric plane with luggage in hand, and be on the ground at your destination in about an hour - all for US$25 (NZ$36) each way? A company called Zunum Aero hopes to make that a reality, so that future travelers who normally take a car, bus or train for regional trips won't think twice about flying. The Washington state-based start-up says that since 2013, it has been developing a fleet of hybrid-electric planes that would make those kinds of inexpensive, short-haul flights possible. The company has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures, subsidiaries of their respective companies. It also faces a number of competitors and obstacles, particularly battery limitations. But if successful, it could significantly change regional air travel, where options have shriveled and costs have crept up in recent decades. "Think of it as Tesla of the air," said Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. "[Or] think of it as an electric bus in the air." Zunum Aero emerged from "stealth mode" on Wednesday to announce its ambitious goals: to be flying routes of up to 700 miles (think Atlanta to Washington, DC) by the mid-2020s and then routes of up to 1,000 miles (think Los Angeles to Seattle) by 2030. The start-up also laid out an array of promises: Door-to-door travel times cut in half. Lower operating costs. Airfares that would be 40 to 80 percent lower. All on quiet hybrid aircraft that would produce 80 per cent less emissions. Indeed, part of the company name was inspired by "tzunuum," the Mayan word for the hummingbird, for the bird's speed and efficiency. Continued below. Related Content Your Views: Readers' Letters MP Winston Peters questions China link with Northland road and rail plans Recruiters don't care about social media "To be perfectly honest, we've been wanting to tell the story for four years," Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar told The Washington Post. "What we've been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation." Kumar thinks operating costs for the company's hybrid-electric planes could be 40 to 80 per cent lower than for conventional aircraft. A small range-extending generator would be integrated into early planes, kicking in on longer flights where battery power isn't enough. The eventual goal would be for battery technology to become advanced enough to have planes relying entirely on electricity, eliminating fuel costs altogether, Kumar said. There are several reasons that people rarely choose to fly for short regional trips. Flying often means allotting extra time for getting to the airport, going through security and then boarding. Also, the airline industry's shift to larger planes and big-city hubs created what Kumar calls a "regional transport gap." Flights from midsize cities are now often routed through hubs, meaning door-to-door times for those trips are no better than they were 50 years ago, Kumar said. And air options for smaller communities have been dwindling or disappearing, he added. Today, 97 per cent of US air traffic comes from 2 percent of the more than 5,000 airports in the country, according to the 2014-2034 FAA Aerospace Forecast. About 95 per cent of trips under 500 miles are taken by car, according to the US Department of Transportation's National Household Travel Survey. For trips between 500 and 750 miles, about 61 per cent of travelers drive and 34 per cent fly. For trips between 750 and 1,000 miles, a little more than half of travelers fly and 42 per cent drive. Kumar and his team think this is where electric-hybrid planes can step in. Whereas a Boeing 737 today seats anywhere from 85 to more than 200 passengers, a Zunum plane would have from 10 to 50 seats. Because the Transportation Security Administration imposes fewer regulations on smaller aircraft, those passengers would likely be able to skip long security lines. Removing luggage check-in options also would save on time on the ground, he said. The resulting trip would feel more like a cross between private corporate air travel and hopping on a bus. Still, the company is not without its competitors and detractors. This year, a Massachusetts-based start-up called Wright Electric announced similar plans to roll out "zero-emissions electric airliners designed to save money and our planet" within a decade. The Y Combinator-backed company, however, told BBC News that it was relying on continued advances in battery technology. "The battery technology is not there yet," Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly, told the BBC. "It's projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon." It remains too early to tell what the commercial aviation industry will look like by the mid-2020s and whether one-way fares in the US$25 range would be feasible then. Even now, it is not unheard of for low-cost carriers such as Frontier or Spirit to offer double-digit airfares on domestic routes. That hasn't stopped others from diving into hybrid-electric aerospace projects. Airbus has also been developing its "E-Fan" hybrid electric aircraft since 2014, and in 2015 it became the first all-electric twin-engine plane to cross the English Channel. Though the "E-Fan" has only two seats, Airbus is hoping the technology will lead to a regional airliner or helicopter. Plans for helicopter-esque electric "VTOL" (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft have also been emerging from Silicon Valley lately. The Verge's Andrew J. Hawkins reported that Uber, Airbus, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and Google co-founder Larry Page are all working on developing their own VTOLs. "Because nothing says 'I'm very rich and I hate traffic' like a flying car project," Hawkins wrote for the technology site. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX said it was confident in investing in Zunum Aero "because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space." Simi compared the push for hybrid-electric planes to the airline industry's advancement from strictly propeller planes to jet aircraft. "It's that type of transformation," Simi said. "We're very excited about where this is going. It's still very early, of course. We now have a seat at the table at what we believe is going to be an amazing change." - Washington Post By Amy B Wang Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

The airline moved to allay concerns after its CEO, Bjorn Kjos, said the runway is too short to accommodate the take-off of a fully-laden New York-bound Boeing 737MAX aircraft. Norwegian will use the aircraft on its Providence (Boston) route from July — Cork Airport’s first direct transatlantic service. But despite always insisting it planned to launch a Cork-New York route in 2018, Mr Kjos told the Irish Examiner on Friday calculations show Cork’s runway is just too short for a MAX aircraft to take off for New York’s Stewart Airport a further 250km south of Providence. “The problem in Cork is the runway. If it was longer it is highly likely we could have done Stewart,” he said. “Normally Boeing end up producing a better aircraft than the prototype but it remains to be seen if it is possible to fly to Stewart. If possible, we will do it. As it looks with the figures we have so far, it’s a little bit too far.” But a spokesman for the airline said last night: “The door remains open to a potential Cork-New York route once we take delivery of the new Boeing 737MAX aircraft this summer and learn more about its operational capabilities. "For now, our priority is to deliver the first ever transatlantic flights from Cork Airport, with the new Boston-Providence service, and we are delighted that the route is already proving to be one of our fastest selling.” Aviation sources suggest the airline could use the European-made Airbus 321LR — it has 30 on order — on the New York route. But Norwegian said they have to use US-made Boeing. “Mr Trump wants American jobs and we are flying Boeing aircraft. We’re setting up a lot of American jobs and also a lot of bases. So we are doing exactly what the president wants,” Mr Kjos said.

Marco Rubio. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) By Solange Reyner   |   Sunday, 09 Apr 2017 04:05 PM Close  More ways to share... Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The United States should sanction countries helping Syria, Republican Sen. Marcio Rubio said on Sunday. "We should be increasing sanctions significantly on Iranian and Russian interests that are helping Assad, and particularly this Boeing deal should be canceled," Rubio told George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s "This Week," referring to a deal Boeing had agreed to last week which would sell $3 billion worth of airplanes to an Iranian airline. Rubio also said the U.S. should be concerned with suppressing the air defenses of the Assad regime following last week's chemical weapons attack in the Syrian village of Khan Sheikhou which left more than 85 people dead and hundreds more injured. Many blamed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for the attack, and President Donald Trump acted quickly to send a message that chemical weapons would not be tolerated when he signed off on Friday's U.S. attack in which ships fired more than 50 cruise missiles at the Sharyat Airbase in Syria. Rubio on Sunday also said he was concerned about the White House’s direction following comments by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that the U.S. would first and foremost focus on taking down ISIS. "What I'm telling you is I think the strategy he seems to be outlining is based on assumptions that aren't going to work. There is no such thing as Assad, yes, but ISIS, no. This focus that you can defeat ISIS as long as Assad is there is not true. They are two sides to the same coin," Rubio said. "This idea that we can defeat ISIS and then figure it out, it won't work."

With its future at stake, America's premier space agency is rolling the dice. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 9, 2017 at 10:00AM On Tuesday, March 21, President Donald Trump signed a bill into law, officially funding NASA to the tune of $19.5 billion this year. The new law, officially dubbed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, goes into effect on October 1 -- not a moment too soon, given that Trump's own budget proposal, published last month, suggests that by 2018, he hopes to cut NASA's budget to just $19.1 billion. SpaceX wants to occupy Mars (and all NASA may get is this t-shirt). Image source: SpaceX. New thinking in space Why does Trump want to cut the NASA budget? In part, it's because his view of the space agency is that it's trying to do too much. As the Trump Administration sees it, NASA's mission should be to advance the exploration of deep space, the region far outside Earth orbit. Closer to home, though, Trump sees the region between Earth and Moon as one that can be "rapidly and affordably" developed and exploited by private industry. Already, private companies such as SpaceX and Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA) have proven themselves more than capable of keeping the International Space Station supplied with beans and biscuits, while start-ups like Axiom Space and Bigelow Aerospace have proposed building entirely new, privately built and operated space stations in orbit. Large satellite launch is also being well taken care of by private enterprise, including stalwarts Boeing (NYSE:BA), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) as well as newcomers SpaceX and Blue Origin. Meanwhile, a new generation of launch companies with names like Vector Space, Rocket Lab, and Virgin Orbit is arising to offer innovative ways to put small satellites in orbit on the cheap. Long story short? "It has become clear to the space community that the real innovative work is being done outside of NASA," argues Trump advisor and former Congressman Robert Walker. Now it's time to turn over Earth orbit missions (and maybe even lunar development) to private industry and point taxpayer-funded NASA farther downrange. Heeding the call How will NASA respond to Trump's call to go "where no [private company] has gone before," and leave the mundane tasks of space station supply, and even satellite launch, to private industry seeking private profits? Apparently, with a will. Perhaps irked by Walker's "innovative work" comment, earlier this year, NASA began floating plans to move up the schedule for a first manned spaceflight aboard one of its new Space Launch System (SLS) -- a multibillion-dollar project to build an interplanetary spacecraft (with help from Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital ATK) to carry astronauts to Mars. NASA had planned to conduct its first SLS launch on a drone mission (dubbed "EM-1") in late 2018, and only put crew aboard the spacecraft after all of the kinks had been worked out -- probably no sooner than 2021 (mission "EM-2"), and potentially as late as 2023. Now, though, the space agency says it could roll the dice and send astronauts up on the very first EM-1 mission instead. This move would be a big gamble for NASA. It would also require the "mitigation" of "potential technical and schedule challenges," says Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Allison Miller. And it would almost certainly delay the first launch of SLS into 2019, or perhaps even 2020. If NASA and its partners can get the work done on time, though, the upside could be substantial -- accelerating the proofing of SLS as capable of manned spaceflight by as much as three, or even four years. What it means to investors (and Elon Musk fans) So, why take the risk? Perhaps because the same private space companies that President Trump sees replacing NASA's role in Earth orbit are also challenging the space agency's new role as the vanguard of interplanetary exploration. Last year, Elon Musk announced a bold plan to send a lone drone "Dragon 2" spacecraft to Mars in 2018, followed by multiple similarly unmanned missions to preposition supplies on the Red Planet, followed then by a manned landing on Mars in 2025. If he succeeds in this, Musk and SpaceX could beat NASA, Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital -- all of the giants of spaceflight heretofore -- to Mars by nearly a decade. Last we heard, the earliest NASA thinks it can get there with SLS is 2034. Given the yawning gap in timelines, it's unlikely that NASA can beat SpaceX to Mars even with an accelerated "manning" of SLS. But if it's to have any chance at all of catching up to the private space pioneer, NASA must take some risks. The consequence of not taking those risks could be to concede that companies like SpaceX and its kin have made NASA obsolete -- putting billions of dollars in contracts with Boeing, Lockheed, and the rest, at risk -- and putting the fate of NASA itself in jeopardy.

Hybrid-electric plane maker Zunum Aero has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures PUBLISHED : Sunday, 09 April, 2017, 1:43pm UPDATED : Sunday, 09 April, 2017, 9:06pm Comments:   The Washington Post Share PrintEmail Imagine taking your next trip of a couple hundred kilometres. New York City to Boston, for example. Or Houston to Dallas. Tampa to Miami. The obvious choice now might be to drive. But what if you could show up at an airport at one of those cities, bypass security checkpoints, board a small hybrid-electric plane with luggage in hand, and be on the ground at your destination in about an hour - all for US$25 each way? A company called Zunum Aero hopes to make that a reality, so that future travellers who normally take a car, bus or train for regional trips won’t think twice about flying. The Washington state-based start-up says that since 2013, it has been developing a fleet of hybrid-electric planes that would make those kinds of inexpensive, short-haul flights possible. The company has some heavyweight investor partners, including Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures, subsidiaries of their respective companies. It also faces a number of competitors and obstacles, particularly battery limitations. But if successful, it could significantly change regional air travel, where options have shrivelled and costs have crept up in recent decades. “Think of it as Tesla of the air,” said Bonny Simi, president of JetBlue Technology Ventures. “[Or] think of it as an electric bus in the air.” Zunum Aero emerged from “stealth mode” on Wednesday to announce its ambitious goals: to be flying routes of up to 1,100km (think Atlanta to Washington, D.C.) by the mid-2020s and then routes of up to 1,600km (think Los Angeles to Seattle) by 2030. The start-up also laid out an array of promises: door-to-door travel times cut in half. Lower operating costs. Airfares that would be 40 to 80 per cent lower. All on quiet hybrid aircraft that would produce 80 per cent less emissions. Indeed, part of the company name was inspired by “tzunuum,” the Mayan word for the hummingbird, for the bird’s speed and efficiency. “To be perfectly honest, we’ve been wanting to tell the story for four years,” Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar said. “What we’ve been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation.” What we’ve been building towards is really exciting and we believe fundamentally is going to change the shape of regional aviation Zunum Aero chief executive Ashish Kumar Kumar thinks operating costs for the company’s hybrid-electric planes could be 40 to 80 per cent lower than for conventional aircraft. A small range-extending generator would be integrated into early planes, kicking in on longer flights where battery power isn’t enough. The eventual goal would be for battery technology to become advanced enough to have planes relying entirely on electricity, eliminating fuel costs altogether, Kumar said. There are several reasons that people rarely choose to fly for short regional trips. Flying often means allotting extra time for getting to the airport, going through security and then boarding. Also, the airline industry’s shift to larger planes and big-city hubs created what Kumar calls a “regional transport gap”. Flights from midsize cities are now often routed through hubs, meaning door-to-door times for those trips are no better than they were 50 years ago, Kumar said. And air options for smaller communities have been dwindling or disappearing, he added. Today, 97 per cent of US air traffic comes from 2 per cent of the more than 5,000 airports in the country, according to the 2014-2034 FAA Aerospace Forecast. About 95 per cent of trips under 700km are taken by car, according to the US Department of Transportation’s National Household Travel Survey. For trips between 800 and 1200 km , about 61 per cent of travellers drive and 34 per cent fly. For trips between 1200 and 1,600 km, a little more than half of travellers fly and 42 per cent drive. Kumar and his team think this is where electric-hybrid planes can step in. Whereas a Boeing 737 today seats anywhere from 85 to more than 200 passengers, a Zunum plane would have from 10 to 50 seats. Because the Transportation Security Administration imposes fewer regulations on smaller aircraft, those passengers would likely be able to skip long security lines. Removing luggage check-in options also would save on time on the ground, he said. The resulting trip would feel more like a cross between private corporate air travel and hopping on a bus. Still, the company is not without its competitors and detractors. This year, a Massachusetts-based start-up called Wright Electric announced similar plans to roll out “zero-emissions electric airliners designed to save money and our planet” within a decade. The Y Combinator-backed company, however, told BBC News that it was relying on continued advances in battery technology. Watch: the Airbus ‘E-Fan’ hybrid electric aircraft “The battery technology is not there yet,” Graham Warwick, technology editor of Aviation Weekly, told the BBC. “It’s projected to come but it needs a significant improvement. Nobody thinks that is going to happen anytime soon.” It remains too early to tell what the commercial aviation industry will look like by the mid-2020s and whether one-way fares in the $25 range would be feasible then. Even now, it is not unheard of for low-cost carriers such as Frontier or Spirit to offer double-digit airfares on domestic routes. That hasn’t stopped others from diving into hybrid-electric aerospace projects. Airbus has also been developing its “E-Fan” hybrid electric aircraft since 2014, and in 2015 it became the first all-electric twin-engine plane to cross the English Channel. Though the “E-Fan” has only two seats, Airbus is hoping the technology will lead to a regional airliner or helicopter. Plans for helicopter-esque electric “VTOL” (vertical takeoff and landing) aircraft have also been emerging from Silicon Valley lately. The Verge’s Andrew J. Hawkins reported that Uber, Airbus, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, and Google co-founder Larry Page are all working on developing their own VTOLs. “Because nothing says ‘I’m very rich and I hate traffic’ like a flying car project,” Hawkins wrote for the technology site. In a statement, Boeing HorizonX said it was confident in investing in Zunum Aero “because we feel its technology development is leading this emerging and exciting hybrid-electric market space.” Simi compared the push for hybrid-electric planes to the airline industry’s advancement from strictly propeller planes to jet aircraft. “It’s that type of transformation,” Simi said. “We’re very excited about where this is going. It’s still very early, of course. We now have a seat at the table at what we believe is going to be an amazing change.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: HOW TINY electric planes MAYRESHAPE REGIONAL AIR travel   Most Popular Viewed 1 Xi, Trump agree on trade and talks but at odds over N Korea 2 Trump’s granddaughter diplomacy?

Bjorn Kjos, chief executive of Norwegian, speaks after receiving the Irish Aviation Authority's award for outstanding contribution to aviation. The naysayers are wrong, according to founder and chief executive of Norwegian Air Bjorn Kjos. It is possible to make low-fare journeys from Europe to the US commercially viable, smaller airports are the future for passengers, and Cork is strategically one of the most important airports in Norwegian’s plans, he insists. Despite the disappointing confirmation that Cork to Stewart International Airport in New York is currently not viable for its mooted 2018 takeoff, Mr Kjos says the airline has not totally given up on the idea. Meanwhile, he says, it is in the hands of Cork people to make their first transatlantic flight to TF Green Airport in Providence, Rhode Island, this summer a surefire success. He categorically rejects the notion that Cork was used as a sentimental pawn in Norwegian’s campaign to get a licence to fly from Ireland to the US. Critics said Cork did all the running and campaigning, even enlisting Taoiseach Enda Kenny to lobby then-US president Barack Obama directly, yet received just three flights, while Dublin, Belfast, and even Shannon did considerably better. What does Mr Kjos say to the people of Cork who feel aggrieved? “Cork was one of the first cities I ever looked at because a lot of people in the New York area originate from this area. It is a lot of Irish-Americans who have very close ties with that part of Ireland. It was no coincidence. "We could have flown everything out of Dublin. I would reject that criticism because we are looking at catchment areas. We are looking at areas close to the Atlantic. Cork met that criteria and so did Shannon. Dublin is a large catchment area. We actually looked first at the cities outside Dublin,” he said. Cork to Providence is vital to Norwegian, he said. Far from being the poor relation, he says Norwegian will provide more flights than the three weekly in the summer if the demand is there. It is the winter schedule that Cork people need to get behind, he adds. “This route will do very well. Obviously it will do fine in the summertime but the question is whether it is possible to fly it year-round. We haven’t looked at that yet, we have to look at the bookings. The passengers will always decide the number of flights. If we have enough passengers to fly daily, then we will fly daily. "These people really deserve it. We could never have done this without fantastic support from people like IAA chief executive Eamonn Brennan, the Taoiseach, three transport ministers, and not least the people in Cork Airport. They have done an incredible job. Everyone supported us,” he said. Donald Trump’s presidency is already impacting Ireland and especially the people of Cork. Norwegian is compelled to use American-made Boeing aircraft for its US routes to keep on good terms with the Trump administration. The Boeing 737MAX aircraft is not able to make it to New York from Cork as Cork’s short runway, by international standards, means it can only carry so much fuel. European maker Airbus claims its anticipated A321Neo aircraft will make further journeys with less fuel. Cork Airport insiders insist a Cork-NYC flight will happen sooner rather than later with the Neo, whomever the carrier is. In the meantime, Norwegian has to play ball with the White House. “Mr Trump wants American jobs and we are flying Boeing aircraft. We’re setting up a lot of American jobs and also a lot of bases. So we are doing exactly what the president wants,” says Mr Kjos. Smaller airports are much more attractive, insists Mr Kjos. Far from the hustle and bustle of JFK in New York, O’Hare in Chicago, or Logan in Boston, airports like TF Green will be far more appreciated by Cork passengers, he says. “Providence is near Cape Cod, it is probably one of the most beautiful areas in the US. You have a lot of people living there and you can reach Boston easily. It is a very good start at the beginning of your vacation. It is very expensive to fly into New York, and very difficult to get slots. That was the main reason we picked TF Green because you can fly much cheaper. You cannot do €69 fares at JFK,” he said. Norwegian founder Bjorn Kjos rejects the notion that Cork was used as a sentimental pawn in the airline’s campaign to get a licence to fly from Ireland to the US. Bringing in US visitors to Cork is just as vital to make it viable year-round, he adds. “As a general rule, it is a lot of Americans that book with us. They fly to Ireland. More than 50% are booked from the US. Providence has 4m people in the catchment. It is fairly huge. The bookings have been very good actually. They have exceeded expectations. Now it is more to see if it is possible to fly on a year-round basis,” he said. If Boeing’s testing of its new 737MAX aircraft exceeds expectations, Cork to New York will be back on for 2018, he says. “As it looks with the figures we have so far, it’s a little bit too far. But the first prototypes Boeing produce are normally heavier than the actual production. So normally the aircraft they can fly better. We have to see the performance of the aircraft — is it doable with that type of aircraft. If Cork to New York is possible, we will do it.” READ MORE Visit the section home page here KEYWORDS norwegian air, business, finance, economy, travel, bjorn kjos, cork, new york © Irish Examiner Ltd.

(AP) — As Sandra Reddish sits down in her office at the Legacy of the Plains museum in Gering, she wonders aloud why anyone is interested in her. She has spent several years interviewing others, in particular the descendants of the "Issei," the first Japanese immigrants in Nebraska. She is also the executive director of the museum and has overseen a major overhaul to modernize it. Any conversation with Reddish is likely to be a passionate one. And it will always detract from her personal history. Reddish was raised on a farm outside of Lincoln. She came of age in the 1970s during the women's movement when women were working in nontraditional fields. She knew she was going to join the military and thought about joining the Navy. After visiting the recruiter's office and doing some research, she joined the Marines. "It was the toughest service and less than 10 percent were women," Reddish said. "I thought it would be an ultimate challenge." LATEST TRENDING VIDEOS: Story continues below She thought about becoming a drill instructor. As a drill instructor, she could tell people what to do. If she became a recruiter, she'd have quotas and she knew she was not a salesman. "Then, my dad got cancer," Reddish said. Reddish believed she could make something of herself outside of the military and decided to return to college to further her education. She attended Southeast Community College in Milford and was hired by Boeing Commercial Airplane Group to work in their plant in Wichita. Reddish lived in Wichita for 12 years. In the fall of 2003, Reddish was also studying at Kansas State University. "I was meeting with my professor and he said, 'Reddish. Did you know there's Japanese in Nebraska?'" she said. Reddish claims she was not a good graduate student because as soon as she heard about the Japanese in western Nebraska and they'd been there for more than 100 years, she was focused on them, not her school work. "I like road tripping. That's why I wasn't a good grad student," she said. "If I hear a good story, I'm off in a minute." She began researching, but found there was little to no information on the Japanese community, even at the State Historical Society. She was determined to find out more. "They are a small, minority group," she said. "There's this wealth of information of living history and nobody interviewed them." The descendants live scattered throughout the Panhandle and aren't concentrated in one area like the Czechs in Wilbur, the Star-Herald (http://bit.ly/2o2n9TX ) reported. She contacted Tom Miles, former Episcopal priest in Mitchell, where many Japanese settled. It was the only piece of information she had to go on. He told her about the Japanese in the valley and sent an email introduction for her to Cindy Yamamoto. Soon, the Yamamoto family was putting Reddish up in their basement so she could gather stories. "It was a good eight hour drive (from Kansas) and I had to stay over," she said. "I took my little tapes and people told me fantastic stories." In Scottsbluff, she learned about and visited the Japanese corner in Fairview cemetery. When she returned to Manhattan, Kansas, her professor asked about her dissertation on the Japanese people. "I said 'No, my dissertation topic is with World War I," she said. "So I came back (to Nebraska) in October 2004 with a tape recorder and started doing interviews." Any free time she had was spent in western Nebraska gathering stories. Even with the history Reddish has gathered, she knows there are still more stories the Japanese in Nebraska are reluctant to share. She still continues her interviews because she feels compelled to tell their stories. She knows if she doesn't ask the questions, they may never tell their stories. Reddish doesn't see herself as the only person who can tell the Japanese story, but she understands the importance of documenting history for future generations. "I just want the information out there," she said. "Hopefully, it will trigger more people into the research." Eventually, her research turned into a conference paper, which led to the short documentary, "The Invisible People," about Japanese immigrants in Nebraska for NET Television's "Nebraska Stories." As she speaks about the documentary, her allergies kick in. She apologizes several times, but remembers they aren't as bad today as they were when she was speaking the narration for the documentary. At the time, she was living in Lincoln and visited the studio to record voice overs and narration. She learned how to stand up straight, create a rhythm in her speech and speak slower. It's important to have a consistent voice throughout the documentary, but her allergies changed her voice just enough she had to return another day to re-record the audio. Reddish shifts gears once again and speaks of her desire to always be learning. She visits museums large and small whenever she can. "There are all these places and nobody utilizes them," she said. "They will give you access and you can start going through everything." But she also visits them with a critical eye. "If I can learn one fascinating fact, then this is an OK museum," she said. She is inspired by the people who have gone before her and amazed by others who have always known what they wanted to do with their lives. It's one reason she admires Winston Churchill. "I know he was a war monger and I understand his flaws," she said. "But he had such a sense of his own destiny." Reddish is also fascinated by World War I. In particular, she is interested in the transitions of world power, and how that set into motion events that are occurring today. Her deep need to always be learning has led Reddish to pick up information on a variety of topics. When she was in the Marines and stationed in bluegrass country, she bought a cheap banjo and took lessons. Although she never took formal lessons, she can also play the fiddle and mandolin. "I'm not a great player," she said. "But I dabble in bluegrass." With more than 120 oral histories under her belt, Reddish is happiest when she's interviewing other people. "If I could get paid to travel around and tell people's stories, I would," she said. "I'm always surprised at how much people are willing to tell you." Her first oral history was on women engineers. While working at Boeing, she conducted nine interviews. To her credit, a special collection on women engineers was named after her at Wichita State University. Reddish has a knack for knowing the right questions to ask and explaining why each story is important. "With history, you have to be intuitive," she said. "You have to know as you're looking through stuff, 'Wait a minute. Something doesn't seem right.' You have to trust your instincts." A couple from Florida once gave her some items from an uncle who was in the military. As Reddish looked through the items, she noticed a scrapbook contained several business cards with women on them. They seemed out of place, so she asked about the uncle. After a quick look online, she called the San Francisco Historical Society. The cards had women's names on them, but only one had an address. She was given the number to the public library, which requested she scan and send them for identification. "They were business cards for prostitutes," Reddish said. History is nothing but cold cases, she said. As she pours over facts and data, looks at trends and views receipts, Reddish notices when something is different, out of place. Her critical thinking skills and creativity are necessary to see what the documents are telling her. It's a passion of hers, but when she has the chance, she will be on the road, telling someone else's story. "I enjoy hearing people's stories and they need to get out and get exposure," she said. Reddish thrives in documenting the stories of others. ___ Information from: Star-Herald, http://www.starherald.com An AP Member Exchange shared by the Star-Herald Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The U.S. defense budget is by far the largest in the world, and the government relies heavily on the private sector to meet its needs. Likewise, many contractors rely on the government for a substantial share of their revenue. To determine the companies profiting the most from the U.S. government, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed contract data from the Federal Procurement Data System. Companies were ranked on total payments received from U.S. government contract obligations in the 2015 government fiscal year. Former President Barack Obama signed the Budget Control Act into law in 2011, effectively reducing the defense budget by roughly $1 trillion over the 10-year period through 2021. Since 2011, annual defense spending has declined by 12.5%, likely also as a result of the reduced involvement in the Middle East. The budget cuts reduced the resources available for military contracts. Between the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, annual contract spending fell by roughly $7.4 billion. Each of the five contractors receiving the most money from the federal government in fiscal 2015 -- Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Northrop Grumman -- were also in the top five each year since fiscal 2009. Also known as the big five, these companies have a longstanding relationship with the federal government and are unlikely to lose their status as top contractors in the near future. In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Rob Levinson, senior defense analyst at Bloomberg Government, explained, “These companies have been doing business with the federal government for so long, they know very well how to navigate that whole process, which winds up being a comparative advantage.” The top five contractors received more than 20% of annual U.S. government contract payments in 2015. The U.S. military requires extremely expensive equipment, including nuclear submarines, aircraft carriers, and fighter jets. “There just aren't that many companies that can do that,” and partially as a result, “[large contractors] have pretty consolidated positions,” Levinson said. Huntington Ingalls Industries, for example, is the only company capable of building the Navy’s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and one of two that builds the current fleet of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. Major federal contractors are certainly not immune to shifting market and industry environments. For instance, in the wake of recent budget cuts, the government has lowered its quality standards for many IT products, favoring the least expensive bid proposals over more expensive, higher quality options. From the perspective of the U.S. government, these businesses have more flexible quality standards and are more easily replaced by smaller companies, in stark contrast to weapons and infrastructure operations. As a consequence, many contractors are shifting focus from their lower margin business segments. SAIC, for example, recently spun off its IT services segment into a separate company called Leidos. Lockheed Martin also spun off its IT business into a separate entity and merged it with the newly-formed Leidos. The federal contracting industry is complex, and current trends are not necessarily bound to continue. Throughout his campaign, President Donald Trump promised to boost the defense budget and build up the military. Taking into consideration Trump’s outspoken disapproval of current U.S. trade policy as well, the new administration may invoke substantial change in the contracting industry. To identify the companies gaining the most from the federal government, 24/7 Wall St. analyzed data compiled by the General Services Administration and accessed through the Federal Procurement Data System. Companies were ranked on total payments received from U.S. government contract obligations in the 2015 government fiscal year. Data on individual contracts also came from the Federal Procurement System. Click ahead to see the 15 companies profiting the most from the federal government. 15. Health Net © healthnet.com    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $3.02 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $3.23 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -6.4% > Headquarters: Woodland Hills, California Health Net Inc. is a health care insurance provider headquartered in Woodland Hills, California. Health Net is a major contractor of Tricare, the health care program of the U.S. Department of Defense. Health Net provides civil health benefits to military personnel, veterans, retirees, and their dependents. The company has been Tricare’s primary health insurance contractor since 1988, the year the Tricare health care program began. The initial deal between Tricare and Health Net was at that time the largest U.S. government contract ever signed with a health care provider. It set a precedent for the government to outsource the bulk of its massive health care needs to a non-government provider. Today, Health Net serves all of the Tricare North Region, which consists of 2.9 million active and retired military personnel and family members. On July 21, 2016, the Department of Defense announced that Health Net would be awarded the Tricare West Region contract as well, placing an additional 2.9 million military personnel under the company’s care. 14. Booz Allen Hamilton  © REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $3.30 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $3.47 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -5.1% > Headquarters: McLean, Virginia Booz Allen Hamilton is one of the largest technology and management contractors in the world. The U.S. government reported in its fiscal 2015 $3.3 billion of obligated contract payments to Booz Allen. The company's main contractors within the U.S. government are the Army, Navy, and Air Force. While some of the company's contract awards are classified, some are not. Among them is a contract valued at $82.9 million over three years from the Department of Homeland Security to help strengthen cybersecurity defense of six federal agencies. Booz Allen Hamilton won another major contract in 2015, valued at $204 million, with the Health and Human Services department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The company will provide application lifecycle management for the department’s and the CDC’s information technology services. 13. Science Applications International Corp. © Wikimedia Commons    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $3.38 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $980 million > FY 2014-2015 change: 246.0% > Headquarters: McLean, Virginia Science Applications International Corporation is an information technology company doing business with the U.S. government and in various commercial markets. In the 2014 fiscal year, SAIC received an estimated $980 million in government contract obligations. The following government fiscal year, SAIC received $3.38 billion in contract payments. The 246% year-over-year increase was the largest of any major government contractor, and is likely the result of the company’s acquisition of Scitor Holdings for $790 million in May 2015. Scitor, a high-end intelligence-services provider, operated in areas in which SAIC had previously lacked expertise. Last year, SAIC was awarded a three-year contract potentially worth $900 million to provide services to the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical and Biological Defense of the U.S. Army. 12. Humana © Ty Wright/Bloomberg    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $3.61 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $3.59 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 0.6% > Headquarters: Louisville, Kentucky Health insurance company Humana generates approximately 73% of its revenue through government contracts. Humana began its relationship with the U.S. military in 1993, when it founded a subsidiary called Humana Military Healthcare Services. Today, Humana’s military subsidiary provides health care for the 3.1 million active and retired military personnel in the Department of Defense Military Health System Tricare South region, one of three regions under the nationwide Tricare health system. Humana won its first Tricare contract in 1996, and fought against the government’s decision to award it to rival provider UnitedHealth when it was up for renewal in 2009. Humana succeeded, and in February 2011 was awarded its sixth Tricare contract, which was worth a total of $23.5 billion over five years. 11. Huntington Ingalls Industries © Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $3.66 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $4.66 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -21.5% > Headquarters: Newport News, Virginia Huntington Ingalls Industries, a 2011 spinoff of defense contractor Northrop Grumman, is the largest supplier of combat ships for the U.S. Navy. The company has supplied approximately 70% of the Navy’s total fleet of warships. Huntington Ingalls is also the only company capable of building the Navy’s nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. Aircraft carriers account for 35% of the company’s revenue. Huntington Ingalls Industries relies heavily on the demands of the U.S. Navy, which has announced its intent to grow its fleet substantially over the next 30 years. The Navy currently has 274 deployable ships, and has stated a target fleet size of 308 ships. In the most recent update to the Navy Force Structure Assessment, however, the Navy outlined its need for a fleet of 355 ships. While the proposed fleet expansion would not fit under the current budget, President-elect Donald Trump has stated that his administration would lead a major naval buildup once in office. Huntington Ingalls is slated to build a large share of the new ships. 10. Bae Systems  © Bloomberg    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $4.44 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $4.99 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -11.1% > Headquarters: London, England Defense, aerospace, and security company Bae Systems is the only top 15 U.S. contractor based outside of the United States. While the company is headquartered in London, it has a significant presence in the United States -- likely due to its heavy dependence on U.S. government contracts. Of the approximately 82,500 Bae Systems employees, 33,800 work in the UK and 29,600 in the United States. Many of the thousands of contracts the U.S. government awards Bae Systems each year are for Navy systems. In December of last year, the company was awarded a five-year U.S. Navy contract worth up to $368 million, one of the larger, more recent deals. Under the contract, Bae Systems will provide systems engineering and support services to the Navy’s Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) office, which oversees the UK Dreadnought class of submarines. 9. Bechtel Group © Noah Berger/Bloomberg News    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $4.65 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $4.10 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 13.3% > Headquarters: San Francisco, California Bechtel is one of the largest construction and engineering companies in the United States, and one of the only private companies among the largest federal contractors. Founded in 1898, the company has since built some of the largest and most complex structures in the world. Notable projects include the Hoover Dam in 1935, the Bay Area Rapid Transit system in 1976, and the Channel Tunnel in 1994. In fiscal 2015, Bechtel received $4.65 billion in contract payments from the U.S. government. In the wake of shrinking federal defense spending, Bechtel has diversified its services through a number of acquisitions and partnerships in recent years. Under an ongoing government contract, the company has been building a plant for the disposal of nuclear waste left during the Manhattan Project. The contract was recently modified with a $3.1 billion incentive to help ensure the initial phase of the project is completed by 2022. 8. L3 Technologies © L3 Technologies > FY 2015 contract obligations: $5.45 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $5.79 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -5.9% > Headquarters: New York U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. federal government contracts accounted for approximately 70% of L3 Technologies’ annual revenue of $10.47 billion in 2015. In addition to the U.S. government, L3 customers include foreign governments and domestic and international commercial customers. The company’s largest deal last year was the Fort Rucker Maintenance Support contract with the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Life Cycle Management Command. For the duration of the arrangement, L3 will be responsible for maintenance and support primarily for rotary wing aircraft assigned to Fort Rucker and satellite units in Alabama. This contract alone accounted for 4.3% of L3's total 2015 sales. The contract will continue through September 2017. 7. United Technologies  © Yuri Gripas/Reuters    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $6.79 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $5.98 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 13.6% > Headquarters: Farmington, Connecticut United Technologies supplies aerospace systems, aircraft components, escalators and elevators, and climate control solutions to private, commercial, and government customers worldwide. The company has a large commercial segment, and government contracts account for just 12% of its total revenue. The largest deal between the U.S. government and United Technologies in the past year was a $1.5 billion contract for the development of propulsion systems for the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet. Like many large defense contractors, United Technologies has reorganized its business segments in response to a shrinking U.S. defense budget. The company completed the $9 billion sale of its Sikorsky helicopter unit to Lockheed Martin in November 2015. 6. Mckesson © Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $8.36 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $6.21 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 34.6% > Headquarters: San Francisco, California California-based pharmaceutical and information technology company Mckesson Corp. received over $8 billion in payouts through U.S. government contracts in 2015. Mckesson does not report the exact portion of operating revenue obtained through government contracts. However, while most companies on this list rely very heavily on their business relationships with the U.S. government, it is clear that a relatively small share of Mckesson's annual revenue comes from sales to the U.S. government. In fact, the company’s largest customer is CVS Health, which accounted for over 20% of total annual revenue. With $190.88 billion in reported revenue in its fiscal 2015, Mckesson Corporation is one of the largest companies in the world. 5. Northrop Grumman  © Kelly Schindler/US Navy/AP    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $10.64 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $10.26 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 3.6% > Headquarters: Falls Church, Virginia Aerospace and defense company Northrop Grumman derives nearly all of its revenue from U.S. and foreign government contracts. Nearly $20 billion of the defense company’s $23.53 billion revenue in 2015 came from the U.S. government alone. In what was likely one of the most important U.S. military deals in decades, Northrop Grumman was awarded in October 2015 the highly coveted $80 billion contract to supply the U.S. military with 100 Long Range Strike Bombers. While a protest filed against the deal delayed work on the contract, the contract was officially confirmed at the beginning of last year. The B-2 Spirit stealth bomber is the predecessor of Northrop’s newly named B-21 Raider warplane. 4. Raytheon  © Wikimedia Commons    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $13.11 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $12.62 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 3.9% > Headquarters: Waltham, Massachusetts The nature of threats change over time, and defense contractors frequently diversify their businesses to predict the demands of changing warfare and new threats. More than most major defense contractors, Raytheon is one such example. While perhaps better known for its missiles manufacturing and defense products, the Massachusetts-based defense contractor also has invested heavily in its cybersecurity operations. Raytheon purchased cyber security company Websense in the middle of 2015 for $1.7 billion. The deal was an indication of the growing threat of cyberattacks, as well as Raytheon’s effort to diversify and move into commercial markets and away from dependence on defense contracts. More recently, Raytheon won a $1 billion contract with the U.S. government to help protect over 100 federal civilian agencies against cyber threats. 3. General Dynamics  © General Dynamics Land System/AP    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $13.63 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $15.35 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -11.2% > Headquarters: Falls Church, Virginia Based in Falls Church, Virginia, outside Washington D.C., General Dynamics has a close relationship with the federal government, both in terms of business and geography. In the company’s 2015 fiscal year, $17.98 billion, or 57% of revenue, came from the U.S. government. GD’s primary operations are in aerospace, combat systems, information systems, and marine systems. Like other shipbuilders on this list, GD stands to benefit substantially from President Trump’s proposal to expand the U.S. Navy fleet. According to the company, a portion of its information systems and combat systems segments are actually owned by the government. The company is also relatively active with non-government customers. Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., a GD subsidiary, is known for its private business jets. According to the company, more than 2,500 Gulfstream jets have been sold since the 1950s. 2. Boeing © Stocktrek Images/Getty Images > FY 2015 contract obligations: $16.65 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $19.61 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: -15.1% > Headquarters: Chicago, Illinois While Chicago-based Boeing profits immensely from U.S. government contracts, the company is not nearly as dependent on federal spending as other major U.S. contractors. Of Boeing’s 2015 revenue of $96.11 billion, less than one-third, or $30.39 billion, came from its defense, space, and security operations. The remainder of the company’s 2015 revenue, $66.05 billion, was attributable to Boeing’s commercial airplane business. Of the revenue generated from defense contracts, 62% came from sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. Like many large U.S. manufacturing companies, including top government contractors, Boeing’s corporate strategy will likely change under President Trump. The widely expected higher military spending will certainly help Boeing. On the other hand, Boeing is the country’s largest exporter, and any new or revised trade regulations could have a major effect on the company. 1. Lockheed Martin © U.S. Navy/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock    > FY 2015 contract obligations: $36.26 billion > FY 2014 contract obligations: $32.23 billion > FY 2014-2015 change: 12.5% > Headquarters: Bethesda, Maryland In 2015, Lockheed Martin acquired helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp. for $9 billion. With the acquisition of the Black Hawk helicopter-maker, Lockheed’s annual sales rose considerable, and the company is now the world’s top helicopter manufacturer. While contractors have been generally reporting lower sales due to declining U.S. and Western European military spending, Lockheed’s sales have risen in each of the past three years. Sales to the U.S. government accounted for some 78% of Lockheed Martin’s $46.1 billion 2015 revenue. The F-35 jet fighter program, the company’s largest, accounted for 20% of total net sales in 2015. Despite the widely expected increase in military spending under President Trump, he has actually vowed to cut spending on the F-35 program.

As Sandra Reddish sits down in her office at the Legacy of the Plains museum in Gering, she wonders aloud why anyone is interested in her. She has spent several years interviewing others, in particular the descendants of the "Issei," the first Japanese immigrants in Nebraska. She is also the executive director of the museum and has overseen a major overhaul to modernize it. Any conversation with Reddish is likely to be a passionate one. And it will always detract from her personal history. Reddish was raised on a farm outside of Lincoln. She came of age in the 1970s during the women's movement when women were working in nontraditional fields. She knew she was going to join the military and thought about joining the Navy. After visiting the recruiter's office and doing some research, she joined the Marines. "It was the toughest service and less than 10 percent were women," Reddish said. "I thought it would be an ultimate challenge." She thought about becoming a drill instructor. As a drill instructor, she could tell people what to do. If she became a recruiter, she'd have quotas and she knew she was not a salesman. "Then, my dad got cancer," Reddish said. Reddish believed she could make something of herself outside of the military and decided to return to college to further her education. She attended Southeast Community College in Milford and was hired by Boeing Commercial Airplane Group to work in their plant in Wichita. Reddish lived in Wichita for 12 years. In the fall of 2003, Reddish was also studying at Kansas State University. "I was meeting with my professor and he said, 'Reddish. Did you know there's Japanese in Nebraska?'" she said. Reddish claims she was not a good graduate student because as soon as she heard about the Japanese in western Nebraska and they'd been there for more than 100 years, she was focused on them, not her school work. "I like road tripping. That's why I wasn't a good grad student," she said. "If I hear a good story, I'm off in a minute." She began researching, but found there was little to no information on the Japanese community, even at the State Historical Society. She was determined to find out more. "They are a small, minority group," she said. "There's this wealth of information of living history and nobody interviewed them." The descendants live scattered throughout the Panhandle and aren't concentrated in one area like the Czechs in Wilbur, the Star-Herald (http://bit.ly/2o2n9TX ) reported. She contacted Tom Miles, former Episcopal priest in Mitchell, where many Japanese settled. It was the only piece of information she had to go on. He told her about the Japanese in the valley and sent an email introduction for her to Cindy Yamamoto. Soon, the Yamamoto family was putting Reddish up in their basement so she could gather stories. "It was a good eight hour drive (from Kansas) and I had to stay over," she said. "I took my little tapes and people told me fantastic stories." In Scottsbluff, she learned about and visited the Japanese corner in Fairview cemetery. When she returned to Manhattan, Kansas, her professor asked about her dissertation on the Japanese people. "I said 'No, my dissertation topic is with World War I," she said. "So I came back (to Nebraska) in October 2004 with a tape recorder and started doing interviews." Any free time she had was spent in western Nebraska gathering stories. Even with the history Reddish has gathered, she knows there are still more stories the Japanese in Nebraska are reluctant to share. She still continues her interviews because she feels compelled to tell their stories. She knows if she doesn't ask the questions, they may never tell their stories. Reddish doesn't see herself as the only person who can tell the Japanese story, but she understands the importance of documenting history for future generations. "I just want the information out there," she said. "Hopefully, it will trigger more people into the research." Eventually, her research turned into a conference paper, which led to the short documentary, "The Invisible People," about Japanese immigrants in Nebraska for NET Television's "Nebraska Stories." As she speaks about the documentary, her allergies kick in. She apologizes several times, but remembers they aren't as bad today as they were when she was speaking the narration for the documentary. At the time, she was living in Lincoln and visited the studio to record voice overs and narration. She learned how to stand up straight, create a rhythm in her speech and speak slower. It's important to have a consistent voice throughout the documentary, but her allergies changed her voice just enough she had to return another day to re-record the audio. Reddish shifts gears once again and speaks of her desire to always be learning. She visits museums large and small whenever she can. "There are all these places and nobody utilizes them," she said. "They will give you access and you can start going through everything." But she also visits them with a critical eye. "If I can learn one fascinating fact, then this is an OK museum," she said. She is inspired by the people who have gone before her and amazed by others who have always known what they wanted to do with their lives. It's one reason she admires Winston Churchill. "I know he was a war monger and I understand his flaws," she said. "But he had such a sense of his own destiny." Reddish is also fascinated by World War I. In particular, she is interested in the transitions of world power, and how that set into motion events that are occurring today. Her deep need to always be learning has led Reddish to pick up information on a variety of topics. When she was in the Marines and stationed in bluegrass country, she bought a cheap banjo and took lessons. Although she never took formal lessons, she can also play the fiddle and mandolin. "I'm not a great player," she said. "But I dabble in bluegrass." With more than 120 oral histories under her belt, Reddish is happiest when she's interviewing other people. "If I could get paid to travel around and tell people's stories, I would," she said. "I'm always surprised at how much people are willing to tell you." Her first oral history was on women engineers. While working at Boeing, she conducted nine interviews. To her credit, a special collection on women engineers was named after her at Wichita State University. Reddish has a knack for knowing the right questions to ask and explaining why each story is important. "With history, you have to be intuitive," she said. "You have to know as you're looking through stuff, 'Wait a minute. Something doesn't seem right.' You have to trust your instincts." A couple from Florida once gave her some items from an uncle who was in the military. As Reddish looked through the items, she noticed a scrapbook contained several business cards with women on them. They seemed out of place, so she asked about the uncle. After a quick look online, she called the San Francisco Historical Society. The cards had women's names on them, but only one had an address. She was given the number to the public library, which requested she scan and send them for identification. "They were business cards for prostitutes," Reddish said. History is nothing but cold cases, she said. As she pours over facts and data, looks at trends and views receipts, Reddish notices when something is different, out of place. Her critical thinking skills and creativity are necessary to see what the documents are telling her. It's a passion of hers, but when she has the chance, she will be on the road, telling someone else's story. "I enjoy hearing people's stories and they need to get out and get exposure," she said. Reddish thrives in documenting the stories of others. ___ Information from: Star-Herald, http://www.starherald.com An AP Member Exchange shared by the Star-Herald Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Entertainment Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:13 Myrtle Beach weather forecast for 4.10 Pause 1:58 Mother takes pity on son's killer: 'Everybody deserves a second chance' 1:14 Know Your Locksmith 1:20 Surveillance video shows woman jumping out of trunk after kidnapping 1:20 Palmetto Police Motorcycle Skills Competition raises money for Camp Happy Days 1:16 Timeline: Coastal Carolina University cheerleading team investigation 1:26 Preparation is key for allergy season 1:25 Coastal Carolina flag raised at the SC Statehouse 1:55 Residents weigh in on school board's proposed raises 1:21 The National Zoo says final goodbye to Bao Bao the panda cub Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 6 days ago Zaben Detoffol of Travinia in Myrtle Beach has a very interesting concert lineup | Hot Pour 3:05 6 days ago Zaben Detoffol of Travinia in Myrtle Beach has a very interesting concert lineup | Hot Pour 1:34 12 days ago The Deck at House of Blues officially opens with live music, festivals and more 3:20 13 days ago Carrie Odom of The Original Shucker's Raw Bar in Myrtle Beach is a young Kim Basinger with an interesting shot | Hot Pour View more video Entertainment Sergio Garcia wins the Masters, ends drought at the majors John Clarke, beloved Down Under for his satire, dies at 68 Mexican drug lord gets his own miniseries, made in Colombia Jury to resume deliberations in ex-NFL star's murder trial Red Wings beat Devils 4-1 in last game at Joe Louis Arena Entertainment Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ RSS Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Mobile Apps & E Reader Text Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Advertise Rates Contests & Promotions Shopping Local Deals Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions e-Edition Home Delivery Vacation Hold Report a Delivery Error Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us FAQ RSS Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Mobile Apps & E Reader Text Alerts Newsletters Advertising Place a Classified Advertise Rates Contests & Promotions Shopping Local Deals More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

A plane landed with an extra passenger on board after a mother unexpectedly went into labour mid-flight. Turkish Airlines cabin crew along with some passengers helped deliver a baby girl, named Kadiju, at 42,000ft shortly after take-off from Conakry in Guinea to Istanbul. The baby and her mother were taken to hospital in Ouagadougou, the Burkina Faso capital, after the Boeing 737 airliner landed. Both are reportedly in good health. Turkish Airlines said in a statement: “The cabin crew, who saw a woman passenger named Nafi Diaby, 28-week-old pregnant traveller flying with Turkish Airlines’ TK538 Conakry (Guinea)-Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso) flight, was suffering child-birth pains, promptly responded to her in order to assist her childbirth during the flight. “After the smooth landing of Boeing B737-900 type aircraft to the Ouagadougou Airport, the mother Nafi Diaby and her newborn baby girl were taken to the hospital in order to be kept under observation for a while.” Most airlines allow would-be mothers to travel until they are 36 weeks pregnant, with some requiring a letter from a doctor or a midwife for those who are in their 28th week of pregnancy.

Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) dipped 32 cents last week (about 0.2%), closing at $143.34 on Friday. The stock posted a new 52-week high on Wednesday. But the company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities the comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company’s stock is up 23.76% year to date, well above Boeing’s 14.88% improvement. The week started out with an announcement from Imagination Technologies that Apple will cut its ties with the U.K.-based company within the next 15 to 24 months. The company supplies the graphics processing unit (GPU) for Apple products, and the London-traded company said that Apple “has asserted” that it is developing its own graphics design technology “in order to control its products” and that Apple will “be reducing its future reliance” on Imagination’s technology. That was bad news for the U.K. company and not especially interesting news for Apple investors who moved the stock up just 4 cents on the day of the announcement. Later in the week reports surfaced that the next iPhone would not ship on time. The first report blamed difficulties in manufacturing the curved glass OLED display and the second report noted challenges to the development of the device’s 3D sensing technology. Apple shares closed at $143.34 on Friday in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $147.61 in a price target range of $102 to $185 per share.

The regional hybrid-electric aircraft, which will have 10 to 50 seats, are being developed with backing from Boeing's HorizonX innovation cell and JetBlue Technology Ventures. Founder and CEO Ashish Kumar said that the company will first come out with a sub-20 seater hybrid aircraft.   MUST READ World`s largest hybrid aircraft comes to life “We hope to have the first prototype flying in two years and begin commercial production in early 2020s,” Kumar, a PhD in mechanical and aerospace engineering from Cornell University, was quoted as saying to TOI. With three years into development, Zunum aims to build regional hybrid-electric aircraft whose range will go up to 1,600 km by 2030. According to Kumar, Zunum's planes will be way cheaper for airlines to operate and will not go as high as commercial aircraft due to the distances they will be covering. “While they will be slower than other planes, their ability to land at airstrips closer to final destination will significantly reduce door-to-door time for flyers," Kumar added. Zunum claimed that the hybrid planes will cut emissions by 80%, falling to zero over time as battery densities improve. Among many advantages that the hybrid aircraft will offer, it will also reduce community noise 75%, enabling all-hours access to smaller airports. The planes will also sharply reduce operating costs, enabling ticket prices 40-80% below current fares, said the company founded in 2013.

Information regarding the Company’s track record and plan for continued value creation is available in its presentation to shareholders dated March 27, 2017. The presentation and other materials are available at www.arconic.com/annualmeeting. The Company urges shareholders to vote “FOR” the Company’s nominees and governance proposals on the WHITE proxy card. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170405006253/en/ Arconic Leadership Has Delivered $8 Billion in Shareholder Wealth Over the Last 8 Years The full text of the letter follows: April 5, 2017 Dear Fellow Arconic Shareholder: You have an important decision to make regarding your investment in Arconic at the upcoming Annual Meeting. The Arconic Board of Directors and management team are committed to shareholder value creation while upholding the highest ethical standards and principles of good governance. We want to ensure shareholders have the facts to make an informed decision, while Elliott Management continues to make misleading statements about Arconic. The Arconic Board and management team have outlined a detailed roadmap for the future success of the Company that we believe will enhance value for all shareholders. Core to this strategy is a focus on the right markets with advantageous growth characteristics – like the aerospace and automotive industries. We believe Arconic’s expertise in innovation and strong customer relationships will drive above-market growth in sales, and the Company will continue productivity enhancements and cost reduction actions to help drive profits. As a result of the Company’s leadership team successfully executing the complex, multi-year transformation of Alcoa Inc., and the launch of Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, the Company is in a strong position to continue driving value for shareholders. What is Elliott doing?Elliott is promoting a misleading view of Klaus Kleinfeld’s track record of Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”). In calculating TSR, three key questions should be asked: What is the start date for the analysis? What is the end date for the analysis? What are the relevant indices for comparison purposes? Regarding the first question, Arconic’s Board determined that the 62 percent1 plunge in the price of aluminum during Mr. Kleinfeld’s first months as CEO, and the impact of high financial leverage that Mr. Kleinfeld inherited, resulted in a dramatic stock price decline that was outside of management’s control. Therefore, our shareholder return analysis starting point is March 18, 2009, the point at which Alcoa Inc. was recapitalized. Second, in terms of end dates, we cannot imagine an analysis that does not include the separation of Alcoa Inc. into Arconic and Alcoa Corporation, given that it was a critical milestone in the Company’s strategic plan that has created significant value for shareholders. Third, separate from Elliott’s biased selection of start and end dates for its TSR analysis, we also looked at value creation for Alcoa Inc.’s shareholders since March 18, 2009, and found that Alcoa Inc. TSR outperformed both the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the overall S&P Metals & Mining Index since 2009.2 These well-established third-party sector indices serve as appropriate benchmarks for evaluating relative performance, given Alcoa Inc. was included in the S&P 500 Metals & Mining Index and the S&P Metals & Mining Index every year leading up to the separation. The fact is that CEO Klaus Kleinfeld has led Alcoa Inc., now Arconic, to create approximately $8 billion3 in shareholder wealth over the last eight years, reflecting total shareholder returns of 182 percent.4 In addition to Alcoa Inc. creating more value for shareholders than the S&P 500 Metals & Mining and the S&P Metals & Mining Indices,5 if you are a new shareholder and invested in Arconic on its first day of trading on November 1, 2016,6 you have seen a return of 57 percent. Arconic’s performance is significantly better than both the S&P 500 Industrials Index and the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense Index in that same timeframe.7 In fact, in a presentation to Alcoa Inc. on November 9, 2015, Elliott applauded the Board and current Arconic leadership for creating shareholder value: “Elliott would like to commend the Board and management team for the significant steps taken to build a better Alcoa [Inc.] and maximize value for shareholders.”8Has Elliott offered a plan? It has become increasingly evident that Elliott Management – an activist hedge fund investor – has no serious plan for the future of Arconic and instead has relied largely on misleading attacks on Arconic’s track record. The Board’s extensive review of Elliott’s claims has made it clear to us that they do not understand Arconic’s business or what is needed to maximize value for shareholders. In addition to using a misleading shareholder value creation analysis, Elliott: Misuses and misunderstands industry data Compares Arconic to companies that are different in structure or industry Advocates for a CEO who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO Fails to appreciate that close, collaborative partnerships with customers are critical for our future success Even setting aside Elliott’s many misrepresentations and attacks throughout its campaign, Elliott has not produced any operational plan for the future of Arconic. Does Elliott understand Arconic’s business? Elliott has shown a clear lack of understanding of Arconic’s business. Elliott made numerous revisions to its investor presentations to try to correct its flawed and misleading analysis of Arconic’s business, and it has concealed the changes. For example, Elliott revised its “perceived opportunity” in Arconic’s Global Rolled Products (“GRP”) business from $750 million in cost savings down to $245 million in cost savings, and it slashed the share price “percentage upside” that Elliott believed it could deliver from GRP margin improvement by over 65 percent.9 The fact is that this business is already in-line or better than its 10 largest competitors. And, Arconic’s management team has a strategy in place to further improve the cost and margin structure by approximately $100 million by 2019.10 In addition, Elliott compares the profitability of Arconic’s Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS) segment with the profitability of Precision Cast Parts (PCP), without acknowledging the significant differences between the two businesses. In reality, Arconic EPS is different in scale and business mix to PCP. In most segments where the two businesses are comparable, Arconic’s margins are in-line or better than PCP’s. In segments where there are differences, Arconic has been attacking the margin gap through technology investments, increased capacity utilization, strategic acquisitions and organic expansions. A recent report by aerospace analysts at Cowen and Company11 highlighted Elliott’s misleading analysis: “The margin gap between ARNC’s EPS segment and PCP (F15) cannot be eliminated for a host of reasons…. In effect, the benchmark that Elliott cites is an unrealistic bar. ” It has become clear that Elliott in fact has no idea how to actually operate Arconic to create value for shareholders.What is the nature of Elliott’s agreement with Larry Lawson? It appears that Elliott’s only concrete plan is to replace Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s current CEO, with Larry Lawson, a former Spirit AeroSystems CEO, who is legally restricted from serving as Arconic’s CEO due to a non-compete agreement with his former employer. Elliott failed to provide the full details of its relationship with Mr. Lawson when it began calling for him to become Arconic’s CEO. When Elliott’s agreement with Mr. Lawson was finally made public, it revealed the troubling fact that if Mr. Lawson became Arconic’s CEO, he would remain on Elliott’s payroll for years. In fact, Elliott has already paid Mr. Lawson approximately $6.6 million in consulting fees and indemnification payments and, in total, Elliott has agreed to pay him approximately $28 million over the course of the next two years. Shareholders must therefore ask how Elliott’s proposed compensation arrangements with Mr. Lawson would influence his actions if he were to become CEO, and whether he would truly serve the interests of ALL Arconic shareholders. Does Elliott’s analysis consider the importance of customer relationships? Customers are the lifeblood of our business. Our largest customers, key to our future success, including Airbus Group, The Boeing Company, United Technologies Corp., and GE Aviation have proactively expressed their support for the work Arconic is doing with them, its importance to their businesses and their respect and support for Mr. Kleinfeld, Arconic’s CEO: “What I particularly value is Klaus’ deep understanding of the critical levers to support OEM goals. As CEO of Airbus, I fully support his continued leadership of Arconic.”- Tom Enders, CEO, Airbus Group, March 2017“Klaus Kleinfeld and his team have…improved our business relationship by focusing in the right areas, increasing our collective competitiveness and delivering innovation and greater value to the customers we serve together.”- Dennis Muilenburg, Chairman, President & CEO, The Boeing Company, March 2017“[We] support Klaus and the rest of Arconic management as they remain focused on the investments that will secure sustainable, long-term growth for UTC, for Arconic, and for our entire industry.”- Greg J. Hayes, Chairman, President & CEO of United Technologies Corp., March 2017“Investments in technology and rate readiness are more important than ever within the supply chains of our growing aviation industry…GE supports Klaus and the Arconic commitment to those priorities and the long-term future of our industry.”- David Joyce, GE Vice Chair and GE Aviation President & CEO, February 2017What other misinformation is Elliott communicating? Because Elliott has no credible plan for Arconic, Elliott has sought to distract shareholders by mischaracterizing an agreement with Oak Hill. This is a false claim designed to mislead. When Arconic and Oak Hill resolved a working capital adjustment relating to the Firth Rixson transaction in August 2016, one of the many terms of the agreement was a commitment by Oak Hill to vote its Arconic shares in the manner recommended by the Arconic Board, which has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of Arconic’s shareholders. No additional value was given to Oak Hill by Arconic for the voting commitment and Oak Hill only held about two percent of Arconic’s shares and was free to sell them – and thereby terminate the commitment – at any time. In the end, the voting commitment did not have any effect at all. There was no election of directors or contested vote after it was entered into and, after carefully reviewing the commitment in the context of the current proxy contest, management and the Arconic Board decided to release Oak Hill from its commitment in order to facilitate the fullest participation by all shareholders in the current proxy contest. In short, Elliott has made false claims and mischaracterized an ordinary course agreement in a deliberate attempt to divert attention away from what is really at stake in this proxy contest: who are the best qualified director nominees to oversee the execution of the Company’s strategy to enhance shareholder value. Arconic’s Board and management offer you a clear plan for the continued success of the Company and further enhancement of shareholder value. Elliott offers no operational plan, flawed and misleading analysis, and an ineligible CEO candidate on its own payroll. We believe the choice is clear. To protect the future of Arconic and the value of your investment we urge you to vote the WHITE proxy card TODAY. Thank you. The Independent Directors of Arconic Inc.:         Patricia F.

Forward–Looking Statements This communication contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “guidance,” “goal,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “projects,” “seeks,” “sees,” “should,” “targets,” “will,” “would,” or other words of similar meaning. All statements that reflect Arconic’s expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts relating to the growth of end markets and potential share gains; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; and statements about Arconic’s strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: (a) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (b) unfavorable changes in the markets served by Arconic; (c) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness and operations anticipated from restructuring programs and productivity improvement, cash sustainability, technology advancements, and other initiatives; (d) changes in discount rates or investment returns on pension assets; (e) Arconic’s inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (f) the impact of cyber attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (g) political, economic, and regulatory risks in the countries in which Arconic operates or sells products; (h) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory investigations, and environmental remediation; and (i) the other risk factors discussed in Arconic’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Arconic disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconic’s consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconic’s financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered “non-GAAP financial measures” under SEC rules. Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.       1   LME aluminum cash price dropped 62% between July 2008 and February 2009.

Brooke Sutherland GE lighting business’s reported potential sale price of about $500 million amounts to just 0.2% of it’s current market value. Photo: Bloomberg New York: It’s light (bulbs) out at General Electric Co. Almost 140 years after GE founder Thomas Edison developed the first practical incandescent light bulb, the industrial giant is considering parting with its consumer lighting business, according to the Wall Street Journal. Frankly, it’s been a long time coming and is more of a symbolic step than anything else: The unit’s reported potential sale price of about $500 million amounts to just 0.2% of GE’s current market value. But symbolism matters at a company like GE, whose long history has included a series of evolutions. It will be sad if GE gets rid of light bulbs. But the business just doesn’t fit anymore: it’s a commoditized industry with weak growth, fewer innovation opportunities and different distribution channels than those used to sell locomotives or parts for a Boeing Co. plane. The unit stood out all the more as GE separated the other consumer-facing parts of its empire including NBC Universal, appliances and the Synchrony Financial credit-card business. Home-bound light bulbs have also become more marginalized within GE’s broader lighting unit, which has shifted its focus to data-driven and energy efficient LED solutions for commercial entities and cities. The potential sale of a business so core to GE’s historical identity and yet so irrelevant to the modern day reality of what the company has become got me thinking: What other legacy consumer-facing businesses are industrial companies holding onto despite a push across the sector toward higher-margin, technologically advanced products? Could these operations also end up out the door? ALSO READ: GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt’s pay falls 35% to $21.3 million amid weak oil market Some companies have already been pruning. Illinois Tool Works Inc. sold its Space Bag brand—which makes vacuum-seal storage products akin to those featured on infomercials—to SC Johnson in 2012. GE’s rival across the sea, Siemens AG, spun off its Osram Licht AG lighting division years ago and that business itself just completed the sale of its lower-margin general lamps operations to a Chinese consortium including MLS Co. But there are plenty of holdouts. 3M Co. is the obvious one, with an entire consumer division dedicated to things like Scotch tape, Post-it notes, wall-hooks and soap dishes. Philips Lighting, spun off from Royal Philips NV last year, has vowed to stick with traditional and consumer light bulbs rather than follow in Osram’s divestiture footsteps. In addition to selling jet engines and turbochargers, Honeywell International Inc. has a home-products business that offers humidifiers, doorbells and thermostats. The company also makes Puddletons rain boots for women and children (who knew?) and Muck boots, which sort of kind of maybe fit with its portfolio of professional safety gear. United Technologies Corp. sells elevators to building operators, but it also sells smoke detectors to average Joes. Pentair Plc offers pool cleaners. Ingersoll-Rand Plc has a golf-cart business, which isn’t really a consumer product unless you’re Donald Trump but it’s random for a company that makes HVAC systems. Not all of these are so easily gotten rid of. 3M is highly unlikely to part with its consumer unit. The shorter life cycle of those kinds of products works to 3M’s benefit as a company that’s built a reputation for being an innovator, says Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Joel Levington. The division has had some struggles lately, but it’s generally been a steady, high-margin business and has overlaps with the company’s industrial abrasives and adhesives products. If anything, Philips Lighting’s commitment to light bulbs may actually make it a buyer of GE’s business, barring antitrust concerns. United Technologies’ residential air conditioners and security products aren’t clearly delineated from more-commercial products. Honeywell’s emphasis on home devices that can be controlled via smartphone fits with its new CEO’s software and connectivity push. But a potential sale of GE’s light bulb business raises the question of whether these companies should take a harder look at what all they put under their industrial umbrella. Like that rain boots business—what’s up with that?

The Pentagon will hold its first missile intercept test in nearly three years next month: the latest sign that the Trump administration is taking Kim Jong Un’s ongoing threats against Washington seriously, Bloomberg has reported. During the mission, the U.S. will work with targets that replicate the speed and trajectory of the missiles Kim has been using during tests fired from North Korea. The intercept test marks the first time the Department of Defense has tested the $36 billion ground-based missile defense system managed by Boeing Co. in nearly three years, Missile Defense Agency spokesman Christopher Johnson told Bloomberg in an email. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were scheduled to meet Thursday to discuss North Korea’s weapons program. Trump has called on China to step up and rein in Kim, while Beijing has urged the U.S. to reconsider its plan to put an Army missile system in South Korea aimed at intercepting short- and medium-range systems. China has called the defense shield a threat to its sovereignty because the system could be used to track its own nuclear program, North Korea has held ballistic missile tests multiple times so far this year and fired a projectile just this week that flew about 60 kilometers into the East Sea. U.S. defense officials told Congress last year that North Korea’s nuclear weapons would soon “likely be capable of reaching much of the continental United States,” and Air Force General John Hyten, who oversees the U.S. Strategic Command, told a Senate panel this week that while “North Korea is not an existential threat,” it’s “the most dangerous and unpredictable actor in the Pacific region.” “Pyongyang’s evolving ballistic missile and nuclear weapons program underscore the growing threat,” Hyten said. North Korea is “also pursuing development of Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) and Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles capabilities, and an improved Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile,” Hyten told senators. — Newsweek Share this: Print Email Tweet Related SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSyrian town hit by chem weapons struck again Next articleAxact executive pleads guilty in ‘diploma mill’ scam Webmaster RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Indian troops kill 8 youths in IOK Saleemi appointed IGP Sindh, AD Khowaja DG FIA Bombings at Egyptian Coptic churches kill 43 Digital Newspaper Cartoon My Tweets Management Founder: Zahid Malik Editor-in-Cheif: Faisal Zahid Malik Executive Editor: Gauhar Zahid Malik Editor Social Diary: Sadia Zahid Malik E-Mail : socialdiarymag@gmail.com magazinesocialdiary@hotmail.com Resident Editor Lahore: Khalid Butt E-Mail: obslhr@pakobserver.net Resident Editor Peshawar: Tariq Saeed E-Mail: obspwr@pakobserver.net Group Director : Khurram Jaffrani E-Mail: khurram_jaffrani@hotmail.com Director Marketing : Naveed Ahmad Khan Cell # 0300-5129008 Contact Us Online Edition : Q Malik / Ch Imran Zafar E-Mail: webmaster@pakobserver.net Islamabad: 051-2852027, 051-2852028 E-Mail : observer@pakobserver.net Karachi: 021-35308446-49 E-Mail : obskhi@pakobserver.net Lahore: 042-36306666, 36303333 E-Mail : obslhr@pakobserver.net Home e-Paper Social Diary Health Voice of People © Send to Email Address Your Name Your Email Address Cancel Post was not sent - check your email addresses!

But businesses are deeply split over whether to support the "centerpiece of the Republican tax overhaul effort," said Nicholas Confessore and Alan Rappeport at The New York Times. House Speaker Paul Ryan has proposed a "border adjustment tax" that would put a 20 percent tax on imports coming into the U.S. "In theory, this would buttress domestic manufacturing and make American products more competitive with foreign goods." The revenues generated by the tax — as much as $1 trillion over the next decade — would also make possible the Republican dream of lowering the corporate tax rate without adding to the federal budget deficit. Major U.S. manufacturers like Boeing and Caterpillar are behind the idea. But retailers like Target and Ikea, as well as other companies that import most of their goods, are lobbying furiously against it. So are several deep-pocketed conservative groups, including the political network backed by billionaire businessmen Charles and David Koch, who see it as anti–free trade. "Imposing a 20 percent tax on imports would have a chilling effect on job creation and the budgets of working families," said Judson Phillips at the Washington Examiner. Not only would it drive up costs for small retailers and manufacturers that rely on imports but also "the cost of big-ticket items like cars, electronics, and appliances would all rise." The National Retail Federation estimates that the average American family will pay $1,700 more per year in higher prices on goods. It's also never smart to anger retailers, said Dylan Matthews and Matthew Yglesias at Vox. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, whose state is home to Walmart headquarters, is a "vocal opponent" of the border tax and gearing up for a fight. Consider also that manufacturers typically have to entice only executives to buy their products, while retailers "are extremely good at selling stuff" directly to the public. "Which do you think is going to be better equipped to persuade voters to call their senators and representatives about the border-adjusted tax?" "Just saying 'no' to the border adjustment tax will not work," said Derek Scissors at The Hill. Everyone agrees that our corporate tax code needs "profound change." A border tax would allow us to meaningfully lower the corporate tax rate from the current 35 percent without blowing up the deficit, and encourage companies "to locate and hire in the U.S." It also puts the U.S. on more even footing with countries that impose value-added taxes on American goods. So opponents "need to do more than object; they should offer a replacement." We can debate the border tax all we like, but it's dead on arrival, said Peter Coy at Bloomberg. The opposition to it is just too powerful and united. And without the added revenue, Republicans are going to have to settle for much smaller tax cuts. So instead of the 15 percent corporate tax rate President Trump has promised, companies might face something more like 28 percent — "the same corporate rate that President Obama sought." Trump desperately wants a major legislative win after the health-care debacle. But it looks as if whatever he manages to get done on taxes "is likely to be small-bore."

China has become the world’s major business jet market, Brazilian manufacturer Embraer said at a preview of the Asian Business Aviation Conference and Exhibition today. Manufacturers, including Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier, will display 35 planes at the exhibition. Last year, Shanghai’s two airports handled 6,136 business jets, up 10 percent in 2015, according to the Shanghai Airport Authority. To meet rising demand, the airport authority will build a new hanger facility for business jets at Hongqiao airport by April 2018, the authority said today.

The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode. “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.” The Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smoldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the safety foundation’s release. On March 21, the U.S. notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the U.S. from 10 Middle Eastern airports — including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo — to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.” The U.K. followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said in a speech March 29 that the threat was real and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports. However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety, the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires. While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires. Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said. “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said. Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said. Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said.

Recently, SpaceX managed to relaunch one of the several Falcon 9 first stages – the most expensive part of the rocket – it has recovered. They also recovered the $6 million fairing, but if they can recover and reuse the first stage as well, the cost to get to orbit will drop to a tiny fraction of what it is now. Elon Musk SpaceX news conference. [Image by Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images] First Stage Recovery and Reuse As reported by TechCrunch, Elon Musk and SpaceX have now demonstrated that they can not only launch the Falcon 9 and recover the first stage by landing it exactly where they want, they have also now refurbished and reflown on of those recovered first stages. Just by doing this and recovering the fairing as well, the pioneering company is recouping as much as 70-80 percent of the cost of the Falcon 9. This kind of savings can be passed on to SpaceX customers – a prospect that makes the company’s competitor’s in the United States and Europe very nervous. Getting the Second Stage Too Elon Musk from the very beginning of his efforts to get into space – and ultimately to Mars – with reusable rockets wanted his system to be fully reusable, but decided to settle for the first stage because it would be quicker and easier to accomplish. But now that he and SpaceX have done that, he’s setting his sights of the whole thing. SpaceX Elon Musk Falcon 9 rocket launches. [Image by SpaceX] Getting the second stage back as well will mean that SpaceX will be able undercut the price of any space launch system in the world. Combined with a rapid turnaround time –Musk wants to get it to less than 24 hours – this will mean cheap and easy access to space for governments, corporations and private individuals around the world. For Musk’s competitors like ULA in the United States and Arianespace in Europe, this could be the end of the line unless they can quickly produce a similar capability themselves. But Boeing, Lockheed and others in the combined ULA organization spent the last 15 years telling the world Musk would fail, instead of researching the technology themselves. This means that they would essentially be starting from scratch in any effort to catch up with Elon Musk and SpaceX. It’s questionable whether they can stay afloat long enough to make that happen, as their current plans suggest. In the meantime, Musk will be further expanding the SpaceX fleet with the upcoming Falcon 9 rocket, the most powerful rocket since the Saturn 5.

DailyTimes | Serious tax reform will come to DC this year Toggle navigation    Home Pakistan World Business Sport Life & Style Opinion Blogs Features Today's Paper E-PAPER Archives Serious tax reform will come to DC this year By:   Grover G Norquist 10-Apr-17 114 Top News Match-fixing mars Spain’s lower football divisions 10-Apr-17 191 MADRID: The shocking testimony ... Pavlyuchenkova topples Kerber to lift fourth Monterrey crown 10-Apr-17 228 MONTERREY: Russia’s Anas ... Substantive tax reform will pass in 2017. Its outlines are clear and the details are congealing. Keep in mind that the tax-reform package will be passed through the reconciliation process, which requires that changes not increase the deficit in years eleven to fifty. Anything goes in the first ten years, but if the total package is not deficit neutral by year eleven, the legislation expires. This allows the House and Senate to pass fundamental tax reform with only Republican votes. No Democrats’ votes are required—and none is expected. How did we get here? Donald Trump released his tax-reform proposal during the primary campaign a year ago; his most eye-catching goal was to drive the corporate income tax rate to 15 percent. Obama had flirted with 28 percent. House Republicans were proposing 25 percent. The House Republican Blueprint quickly moved their target to 20 percent. Trump had not initially included full and immediate business expensing (to replace long depreciation schedules) in his plan. Every other Republican presidential candidate and the House Republicans led with expensing, which dramatically reduces the cost of capital. Trump adopted full expensing. Trump’s plan reduced individual tax-rate reductions, and his plan merged with the House Republican individual reform, to move the present seven tax rates to three rates: 12, 25 and 33 percent. Capital-gains taxes will be set at 50 percent of the individual rates, for a top rate of 16.5 percent. Corporate capital gains will be reduced from today’s 35 percent to 20 percent. The emerging Trump/House plan abolishes the death tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax. The death tax was first imposed to finance the Civil War, and the AMT was imposed to solve a “fairness problem” that was supposed to hit 115 millionaires, and now hits millions of Americans. The United States will move from its present “worldwide” tax system—where Uncle Sam insists on the ability to tax American companies and individuals, regardless of where they work or are located. This puts American firms and American companies at a severe disadvantage. French firms and French citizens earning income in the United States pay U.S. taxes but not French taxes. Americans working abroad pay both French and American taxes (U.S. law allows limited deductibility of taxes paid abroad). The bill would allow the estimated $2.5 trillion of American earnings overseas to be returned, after paying an 8 percent tax on cash and 3 percent on fixed assets. After that, all earnings overseas could be returned tax free, forever into the future. American companies are happy to pay a one-time smaller hit and win permanent territoriality. It is the higher business tax and the worldwide tax system that makes an American company that operates worldwide worth more if it is bought by a Canadian or Belgian company. Corporate inversions are driven, not by wicked foreigners, but by destructive American tax law. The Trump/House plan ends that incentive to invert or move headquarters overseas. To “pay for” some of these tax reductions, business will lose the deductibility of net interest payments and many smaller deductions. The most controversial changes is making the corporate income tax “border adjustable,” so that when Boeing exports a plane worth $100 million it deducts $100 million from its reported income, and reduces its tax liability by $20 million in taxes ($100 million × 20 percent). An importer bringing in a $100 product must add the $100 to its taxable base and pay $20, or $100 × 20 percent. This does raise the cost of imports and reduces the after-tax cost of exports. Manufacturers in the United States like this a lot—importers less so. The border-adjustable feature raises $1 trillion over a decade. Without the border-adjustable feature in the corporate income tax, the tax writers would have to find another $1 trillion in higher taxes somewhere else in the code, reducing spending by $1 trillion in the next decade. The Senate rules insist that the budget changes be deficit neutral (not tax revenue neutral) over years eleven through fifty. If the tax and budget changes in tax reform do not keep the expected deficits from increasing from today’s expectations, then the tax package expires at the end of ten years. This is what happened to the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. Both Trump and the House very much want the legislation to be permanent. This is why the fight over repealing Obamacare was, and is, important. The American Health Care Act (AHCA) would have repealed $1 trillion of Obamacare taxes and $1.2 trillion in Obamacare spending over the next decade. It also would have expanded Health Savings Accounts and block-granted Medicaid to the states.

The song has notched up 21 million views on YouTube and Facebook in a week. We caught up with the rapper recently. Ironically, the man who writes rhymes about partying 24x7, candidly admitted that he barely get time to party. Here, he talks about his latest track and about being in every other Bollywood song... Your biggest hits are set in clubs. But you have said in interviews that you were never a party animal. Making up for lost time, even if it’s for show? (Laughs) That’s true. It’s not like I don’t party, it’s just that I don’t get the time. I am always busy making music for others to party to. Now with my album and my other projects, I don’t think I’ll find any time in the near future, too. Which memory will stay with you — shooting on the roof of the O2 arena or on the wing of a Boeing? Actually, we shot Mercy in three locales. Two, you’ve mentioned, the third is a neon shop in London. All the venues will stay with me forever. O2 was unbelievable. After sorting out permissions, the team and I actually took our own gear to the roof, shot the scenes and got down, without help. You can imagine how enthusiastic we were. Shooting on the Boeing wing was another feeling altogether. The wing slants after a point, so I walked around for a while to get comfortable and then, I felt like I owned it. I love this particular shot of me being at the edge of the wing. The neon shop was cool, too. The owner had some really quirky things in the shop… 21 million hits in six days for a non-film track. Do these numbers matter? When I began this project, my label and I discussed this and we were sure that we will not judge the song by the numbers. Our strategy would be to drop the song and video together, spend days talking about it and promoting it. Our other strategy was to involve fans. I got the fan to reveal the album art, then the song. I am just happy that the song is doing well. 21 million or not, my fans love it, are sharing it, owning it. What more can I ask for? Bollywood-wise, you’re in every other film. Don’t you think that is a double-edged sword? You’re going to be envied for being that busy. And get taken for granted for being everywhere. It’s humbling to get so much work. Getting into the industry has been tough. When I released my first song, it was amazing for the reception I got. The only downside I see to this, is that I don’t get any time for myself. Also, am I really in every song? (Laughs) Bryan Durham TOP TOP   Comments   Also Read Entertainment National Awards Chairman Priyadarshan CLARIFIES if Akshay Kumar is in his next!

(KOIN) — On April 9, 1959, NASA presented its first seven astronauts: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, John Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard and Donald Slayton. They were instant American heroes whose fame and acclaim grew even louder as they went into space. Only Donald Slayton — Deke, as he was called — never flew. A medical issue grounded him, but he stayed with the space program and helped guide the efforts through Mission Control. “I believe in God, only I spell it Nature.” — Frank Lloyd Wright That same day in 1959, architect Frank Lloyd Wright died at age 91 in Phoenix. Though he’s best known for his iconic designs at Taliesin and the Guggenheim Museum, the trailblazing architect designed one home in Oregon, the Gordon House. Wright designed it in 1957, but it wasn’t built until 6 years later on farmland with views of both Mount Hood and the Willamette River. “I believe in God,” Frank Lloyd Wright once said. “Only I spell it Nature.” Other events from April 9 in history: In 1865, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his army to Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. In 1942, during World War II, some 75,000 Philippine and American defenders on Bataan surrendered to Japanese troops, who forced the prisoners to travel on foot more than 60 miles to a prison camp in what became known as the Bataan Death March. (Thousands died or were killed en route.) In 1967, the first test flight of Boeing’s new 737 took place as the jetliner took off from Boeing Field in Seattle on a 2½-hour trip to Paine Field in Everett, Washington.

It was the last leg of the new scheduled British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) jet passenger flight between London and Johannesburg. Some 36 hours later, with a new crew on board, the aircraft took off from Rome for the second stage of its return journey to South Africa. It began to climb to its cruising altitude. Shortly after passing Naples, over the island of Stromboli at the southern tip of Italy, the aircraft disintegrated. Seven crew and 14 passengers were killed. It was the second mid-air explosion of a Comet in three months. Advertisement This media cannot be played on your device.

View image of (Credit: Getty Images) “I still do not forgive those who restarted the services after the [first] crash,” says Duffey, now retired and living in Canada. “They gambled and lost; I was one of the chips.” The first Comet was rolled out of its hangar at the de Havilland factory in Hatfield, some 25 miles (40 kilometres)  north of central London, in July 1949 – only four years after the end of World War Two.  See more pictures of the de Havilland Comet in its flying days and the survivor being restored today Passenger aircraft of the time were low-flying and uncomfortable to ride. With unpressurised cabins and propellers powered by noisy piston engines, they had to fly through, rather than above, the weather. Many were converted from wartime bombers or freight transport aircraft and had quaint old-fashioned names such as Tudor, Lancastrian and Argonaut. The Comet, on the other hand, looked like an aircraft from the future, with a mirrored aluminium fuselage and swept back wings concealing four jet engines. Along each side were large rectangular picture windows to afford passengers unprecedented views of the Earth from a cruising altitude of up to 40,000ft (12 kilometres). It was the Concorde of its day – it flew higher, faster, smoother than any other airline of that time and made everything else obsolete – Alistair Hodgson, de Havilland Museum   “It still looks modern,” says Alistair Hodgson, curator of the de Havilland Aircraft Museum. “It was clean, it was aerodynamic and it looked like it would slip through the air perfectly – and of course, that’s what it did.” “There’s an old saying in the aviation industry that if an aeroplane looks right, it’ll fly right,” says Hodgson. “It was the Concorde of its day – it flew higher, faster, smoother than any other airline of that time and made everything else obsolete.” Inside there were seats for 36 passengers in two cabins. Those in first class were seated around tables – much like in a railway carriage. Apart from the cockpit, the rest of the fuselage was taken up by a large galley, luggage storage areas (there was no hold underneath) and separate toilets for ladies and gentlemen. “That’s what happens when you allow engineers to design aircraft, rather than accountants,” says Hodgson. “If you look at a modern no-frills airline, every inch of space is given over to fare-paying passengers but that’s not what air travel was like in the 1940s. “Air travel was just in its final days of being a thing for the rich only,” he says. “The primary way of travelling long distances was ocean liners.” In fact, many of the passengers of BOAC were civil servants off to run the British Empire. View image of (Credit: Getty Images) After almost two years of test flights, the Comet made its first scheduled flight on 2 May 1952, flying – via Rome, Beirut, Khartoum, Entebbe and Livingstone – to Johannesburg. The flight, taking just over 23 hours, was a triumph. Passengers reported a smooth journey, superb service and beautifully presented meals. With no other passenger jets yet in service, the Comet was the envy of the world. “The Comet fleet considered themselves the elite in BOAC,” says Hugh Dibley, a pilot with the airline in the 1960s. “It even had its own special call-sign: ‘Jet Speedbird’.” Within months, BOAC had added flights to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Karachi, Singapore and Tokyo. Meanwhile, de Havilland was notching up new orders for its remarkable aircraft from Canadian Pacific, Air France and the Royal Canadian Air Force. The first four aircraft had faulty seals - we used to carry hydraulic fluid to top up the system – Peter Duffey, Comet pilot   At speeds of up to 500mph (807km/h), passengers were experiencing the ride of their life. But for those sitting at the sharp end, there were few flights that were without incident. “All my time on the Comet 1, the aircraft was still under development,” says Duffey. “We had problem after problem.” The Comet was the first commercial airliner with hydraulic flying controls, which worked much like the brake pedal on a car. When the pilot moved the control column, it activated a pump which pushed fluid through a circuit of pipes to adjust the control surfaces on the wings. “The first four aircraft had faulty seals,” says Duffey. “We used to carry hydraulic fluid to top up the system.” Crews also reported a host of other problems. The electrics and navigation system tended to overheat. The cockpit’s windows would mist up. And the aircraft’s range was limited to four hours before it needed to be refuelled. But there was also a more fundamental problem with the design of the controls. View image of (Credit: Stephen Dowling) “No matter what speed you were doing, the feedback on the control column felt the same,” says Duffey. “It was a danger handling the aircraft, without a doubt I think that led to one of the accidents.” On 26 October 1952, Duffey was off-shift sipping red wine in Rome’s airport terminal after flying Comet G-ALYZ in from Beirut, Lebanon. Looking out of the window, he watched the plane begin its take-off for the flight to London. “We saw the aircraft run off the end of the runway,” he recalls. “So we dashed out, got a jeep and drove out to where it was and it was just sitting there hissing – it ripped the belly tank out and there was fuel everywhere.” As pilots we were becoming very concerned – Peter Duffey   Incredibly, there was no fire and none of the crew or 35 passengers were injured. “What [the captain] had done was raise the nose too much on take-off; it had too much drag on the wings and didn’t get fully airborne,” Duffey says. The pilot was blamed for the crash, but the incident also exposed an inherent flaw with the design. “The cause of the accident wasn’t only the wing but the lack of feedback on the controls that allowed you to pull-back as much as you wanted,” says Duffey. “It would never have happened if the test pilots had tested that aircraft properly.” A few months later, on 13 March 1953, a similar problem occurred on take-off from Karachi. This time a Comet on a training flight, smashed into a stone bridge and burst into flames. All 11 crew members and technicians on board were killed. And then, in June, another plane was damaged at Dakar, Senegal in a similar incident. “As pilots we were becoming very concerned,” says Duffey. “And we started to take a very active interest in what was going on.” View image of (Credit: Getty Images) On 2 May 1953, 43 people died when a Comet crashed shortly after leaving Delhi in India. An investigation revealed the plane had broken apart after flying into extreme turbulence. As a result of these incidents, new advisory take-off instructions were issued to pilots, adjustments were made to the wing design and future models of the plane would be fitted with weather radar. But worse was to come. “There were two fatal flaws with the aircraft,” says Hodgson. “First was the method of construction – the skin of the aircraft was made as thin as possible to save weight.” “The Comet flew very high, and it needed to be pressurised so the passengers inside can breathe,” says Hodgson. “If you do that, it’s like taking a toy balloon and blowing it up and deflating it constantly – eventually it’s going to tear.” Fishermen reported hearing multiple explosions before seeing burning debris plunge through the clouds   The second problem concerned the rectangular windows. “If you have a square opening in a sheet of metal, like the skin of an airliner, and you stress it, the place where the crack is going to start is at the corner,” Hodgson explains. On 10 January 1954, Comet G-ALYP took off from Rome and climbed into the clouds. During a radio call to report the weather, the transmission suddenly cut off. Below, fishermen reported hearing multiple explosions before seeing burning debris plunge through the clouds. All 29 passengers and six crew were killed. All BOAC and Air France Comets were immediately grounded while the wreckage was recovered and investigations got underway. More than 50 modifications were ordered on the aircraft but investigators could not identify a single cause of the disaster. View image of (Credit: Getty Images) “We had a series of meetings at Heathrow,” says BOAC pilot Duffey. “They said they were quite sure they’d covered what was going on.” The meeting was asked to vote. “By a majority of one, we decided to go back into service,” he says. “I voted against because I felt the modifications had not adequately discovered the reason for the explosion.” Unfortunately, he was proved right. When Comet G-ALYY later exploded in mid-air on 8 April, all Comets around the world were grounded again. “It must have been an earthquake through the industry, because everyone was looking to de Havilland and Britain as the pioneers of fast, high and comfortable air travel,” says Hodgson. “It was a huge mystery why these superb and futuristic aircraft were suddenly falling out of the sky.” “I felt so aggrieved that they put it back into service,” says Duffey, “that I joined [the pilot union] Balpa on a more or less full time basis, determined to make sure we knew what was going on with aircraft we were operating.” Over the equivalent of 9,000 flying hours, the water pressure in the aircraft fuselage was raised and lowered to simulate the conditions it would experience during flight   A team of experts was assembled at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough for an unprecedented investigation into the crashes. The process marked the birth of today’s global air accident investigation industry. “It was obvious from the wreckage that the aircraft had explosively disintegrated in some way,” Hodgson says. “But you can’t just test an aircraft by making it do that again, so they immersed the aircraft in a very large tank of water and then started the stress tests and pressure tests.” Over the equivalent of 9,000 flying hours, the water pressure in the aircraft fuselage was raised and lowered to simulate the conditions it would experience during flight. Then, after six weeks, the pressure suddenly dropped. The metal had cracked around one of the windows and the fuselage had blown open. View image of (Credit: Stephen Dowling) It was clear that the fuselage was too thin and the rectangular windows were a source of stress. The world’s first jet airliner had to be completely redesigned. With the Comet out of service, the rest of the airline industry suddenly had a chance to catch up. “All the time, your competitors are looking over your shoulder at what you do,” says Hodgson. “They were all learning the lessons and coming up with designs that didn’t have the inherent flaws of the original de Havilland design.” With the comet grounded, the aircraft that would transform the way we travel was taking shape in Seattle. Flown for the first time in July 1954, the Boeing 707 went into service in 1958. The company eventually built more than 1,000 of these iconic aircraft. Back in the UK, de Havilland developed the Comet 2 and 3, before releasing the Comet 4 to the airlines by the end of 1958. Longer – comfortably carrying 92 passengers – stronger, more powerful and with much safer oval-shaped windows, it had a range of 2,500 miles, making it ideal for medium-haul flights. It was beautiful to fly and land but it was too late – Peter Duffey   “The Comet 4 was powerful, strong and reliable,” says Hugh Dibley, who began his flying career on the aircraft. “It was a lovely aircraft to fly in.” Duffey agrees. “It was a super aircraft,” he says. “It was beautiful to fly and land but it was too late.” Although the 707 was winning most of the major airline orders, BOAC, flying Comet 4s, still managed to achieve the first commercial transatlantic crossing in a jet airliner - twice. On 4 October 1958, Comet 4s left New York and Heathrow. Although the US bound flight had to stop to refuel in Newfoundland, the London flight made the journey non-stop in six hours and 11 minutes. Comet 4s flew with BOAC until 1965 and with British airline Dan Air until 1980. The class was adapted into the hugely successful French Caravelle aircraft as well as the Nimrod reconnaissance plane, which continued to fly well into this century. The Comet 4 only finished its flying days in 1997. View image of (Credit: Getty Images) Duffey, who had narrowly escaped two fatal Comet crashes, went on to become one of British Airways’ first Concorde pilots. The British aircraft industry never fully recovered from the Comet’s dramatic failures. Today, the site of the de Havilland factory in Hatfield is an industrial park. The administrative offices are a police station, the entrance building a KFC, and the hangar where the Comet first flew from is a gym – the floor now covered in tennis courts. The only surviving original Comet 1 is being renovated at the de Havilland Museum – a small volunteer-run collection of buildings and hangars in the countryside north of London. When BBC Future meets team leader Peter Kay, he’s working to re-install the ladies’ toilet. It’s the only one in the world, and that’s why it’s so important to make sure it survives and people can see it – Peter Kay, Comet restoration team “We’ve had to start from scratch internally,” he explains. “In places the aluminium of the fuselage had corroded so you could see holes through it.” Over the past five years, the volunteers have lined the interior and have begun rebuilding the cabin and cockpit. “It’s the only one in the world, and that’s why it’s so important to make sure it survives and people can see it,” he says. “It’s amazing what they were doing 70 years ago, they were way ahead of their time.” Although ultimately, Boeing triumphed in the race to produce a mass-market passenger jet and subsequent generations of aircraft have made flying safer, cheaper and widely available, the legacy of this British pioneer lives on. “Today’s jet aircraft owe a huge amount to the Comet,” says Hodgson. “It taught the lessons that the other manufacturers learned and paved the way for modern safety and design.” View image of (Credit: Getty Images) The Comet still looks like an aircraft from the future. Sitting on one of comfy upholstered seats of the First Class apartment, it is easy to imagine what it must have been like to fly in one of these beautiful aircraft high above the weather, maybe reading a magazine or sipping an iced drink.

Alan Levin The Flight Safety Foundation urged the aviation industry to take steps not to introduce another ‘risk’ from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. Photo: Bloomberg Washington: The US order prohibiting passengers from carrying laptop computers and other electronics into the cabins of some overseas flights is raising concerns about a risk unrelated to terror: the potential for those devices’ lithium-based batteries to catch fire in the baggage hold. The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode. “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.” The US Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smoldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. ALSO READ: Etihad Airways offers free Wi-Fi, iPads to premium fliers on US flights “We coordinated closely with the FAA and provided an information bulletin to the air carriers regarding the appropriate handling of electronics, including lithium batteries,” department of homeland security spokeswoman Jenny Burke said in an emailed response to the safety group’s warning. On March 21, the US notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the US from 10 Middle Eastern airports—including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo—to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.” The UK followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said March 29 that the threat was real, and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports. However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety: the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. United Nations The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires. While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires. Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, before gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said. “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said. Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said. Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said.Bloomberg Alan Levin Topics: Laptop ban lithium batteries battery explosion US laptop ban electronics items More From Livemint READ MORE Opposition to meet Election Commission over EVM tampering allegations Android phones for the perfect shot Lok Sabha disrupted as opposition protests Tarun Vijay’s racial remarks First Published: Sun, Apr 09 2017. 05 41 PM IST Editor's Picks Uttar Pradesh’s farm loan waiver: Neither egalitarian nor productive Edelweiss ARC begins BILT Graphic loan recast, may infuse Rs400 crore Snapdeal’s co-founders hint firm’s fate not in their hands Latest News Indian nurses in Kuwait to be hired only via govt-run agencies Yogi Adityanath govt starts work on 6 AIIMS, 25 new medical colleges Ten Bollywood flicks remade from Bengali films Prasar Bharati to form internal committee to revamp DD Kisan Q4 earnings, macro data likely to give direction to markets this week Mint On Sunday All the world's a stage: Teaching autistic children through theatre When ant enslaves ant The beauty of a good detective story Letter from... a backpack Love in the age of terabytes Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

April 9, 2017 By University of Puget Sound Leave a Comment TACOMA, Wash. – University of Puget Sound is the best college in Washington state for getting a job after graduation, according to a new ranking based on U.S. Department of Education data. The study by career information website Zippia found that after 10 years, more than 92 percent of Puget Sound graduates were employed, putting the national liberal arts college alongside the top universities and colleges in the country, as measured by graduate employment. The prospects for a job is a factor that has become increasingly important to new graduates across the country over recent years, according to a 2015 survey by the Higher Education Research Institute of University of California, Los Angeles. In creating its ranking, Zippia used data from IPEDS, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, which includes data on employment levels of graduates from each U.S. institute of higher education. Puget Sound’s own survey of 2016 graduates, compiled by Career and Employment Services, asked new grads what they were doing seven months after they earned their degrees in May 2016. The survey found that 63 percent were employed; 22 percent were pursuing graduate studies or other continuing education at places including Johns Hopkins University, Tufts University, and London School of Economics; 8 percent were doing public service for groups such as AmeriCorps, Teach for America, and the Peace Corps; 6 percent were looking for work; and 1 percent were traveling or pursuing other interests. Employers of Puget Sound graduates include Allen Institute for Brain Science, Amazon, Apple, Boeing, Centers for Disease Control, Intel, Microsoft, National Institutes of Health, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Nike, National Public Radio, Seattle Magazine, and the U.S. House of Representatives. Students at Puget Sound are encouraged to take part in experiential education, which gives them individualized opportunities to develop hands-on skills and to work with employers and community groups. Importantly, such programs also give students time for reflection on how these experiences align with their academic studies so they are better prepared for careers and a lifetime of learning. Examples of such “high-impact learning” include the Summer Immersion Internship Programs; summer research grants; digital humanities work; courses in science, business, and education involving off-campus partners; study abroad programs, internships, program assistant jobs, undergraduate conferences, civic research, and community volunteerism.
