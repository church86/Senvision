Developed by Boeing and the Defense Information Systems Agency, the Boeing Black phone is designed for secure communication between governmental agencies and their contractors. The handset can even self destruct if it is tampered with, destroying all the data on it, and is so secure that Boeing will only sell it to 'approved' purchasers. Scroll down for video  The Black Phone from Boeing, which can 'self destruct' if compromised SPYPHONE SPECS: WHAT WE KNOW The dual-sim phone supports GSM, WCDMA and LTE for high speed data.  It has a 4.3inch screen   The handset also comes with USB , Wifi and Bluetooth. It will run a secure version of Google's Android software. One of those approved to use the device is NSA head and Cyber Command chief Adm. Michael Rogers, said Department of Defense Information Networks head Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn, who revealed toDefence One Rogers is one of a select few to have the device. 'The Boeing Black is the device we're currently working with,' Lynn said. 'We're just now in the test phase.'  Blackberry confirmed the existence of the project last year - but refused to reveal any more information. 'We're pleased to announce that Boeing is collaborating with BlackBerry to provide a secure mobile solution for Android devices utilizing our BES 12 platform,' BlackBerry's ex-CEO John Chen said on a conference call held to discuss its quarterly results in 2015. 'That, by the way, is all they allow me to say.'  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Have a stressed out spaniel or a twitchy terrier? FDA...

Share this article Share 49 shares Blackberry confirmed the existence of the project last year - but refused to reveal any more information. The Boeing Black device encrypts calls and is aimed at government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure.  It uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks and can be configured to connect with biometric sensors and satellites.  Lynn confirmed the Boeing Black works with 'a large amount of encryption.' However, he said it was its ability to keep data on servers rather than on the handset that made it attractive. The FCC filing reveal very little about the phone - other than its shape and the fact it will take two sim cards 'There's nothing that lives on the devices,' he explained. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network.  The phone itself just send keyboard, mouse and other signals to the 'real' server. said Lynn: 'We're not too worried about losing data,' at least not off the phone,' aid Lynn. He also admitted he thought his boss liked that handset.  'I think he does,' he told Defence One. 'Haven't heard any complaints.' 'The phone will be sold primarily to government agencies and companies  engaged in contractual activities with those agencies that are related to defense and homeland security,' Boeing says. It plans to limit the sale of the device to 'approved' buyers. 'The device will be marketed and sold in a manner such that low level technical and operational information about the product will not be provided to the general public.' Even if approved, buyers will have to sign an agreement agreeing to keep their details of the phone secret. 'Specifically designates and protects as 'proprietary information' the components, hardware, Product Software, applications, functionalities, or internal structure or workings of the Product provided by Seller, including without limitation those that can be obtained by disassembling or opening the Product or its software or components.' BlackBerry CEO John Chen revealed the handset on a conference call held to discuss its quarterly results It also reveals that the handset will be completely sealed, and any attempt to open it will destroy the phone and delete all the data on it. 'There are no serviceable parts on Boeing's Black phone and any attempted servicing or replacing of parts would destroy the product. 'The Boeing Black phone is manufactured as a sealed device both with epoxy around the casing and with screws, the heads of which are covered with tamper proof covering to identify attempted disassembly. 'Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.'

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. SEATTLE (CNNMoney) Boeing and Airbus are holding a paper airplane contest. A very expensive one. And the winner may get the chance to build the world's longest jet. The U.S. and European aerospace giants are vying for a coveted spot in the fleet of Singapore Airlines. By the end of the year, the airline is expected to back one of the company's designs, according to three people familiar with the campaign. There's a "pretty fierce campaign for this" order from Singapore, said one of the people. At the moment, the Boeing and Airbus planes exist largely as PowerPoint presentations that are being evaluated by engineers at Singapore Airlines. Both planes would be the longest twin-aisle jets ever built and the biggest with just two engines. Nose to tail, they'll be nearly the length of a football field. Airbus' A350-2000 would be nearly 258 feet long and seat 400 passengers. Boeing's 777-10X would be 263 feet and hold 450, in standard arrangements. That's about 30 and 50 passengers more, respectively, than the current largest A350 and 777X jets. While both jets may earn the title of world's longest, they won't carry the most passengers. The four-engine Airbus A380 has the distinction of being able to hold more passengers than any other airliner, carrying about 550 people on two decks. Boeing's new design would put it within striking distance of the A380 and even its own iconic 747 jumbo jet. Both have suffered from slow sales and declining production. And the new 777X would also have the advantage of being able to fit into airports that can't accommodate the A380 and its gargantuan wingspan, while carrying nearly as many passengers. The 777X wingtips will fold upwards after landing, so the plane will fit into the same gates and use the same taxiways as today's 777s. The wingspan on the A350 is slightly smaller than the 777X. The first model in Boeing's 777X lineup begins flying passengers in 2020. The A350 entered service in 2015. Additionally, both designs would stretch the fuselages to make room in the cabin for more seats, and move galleys used for food preparation to under the passenger cabin floor. The current versions of these Airbus and Boeing planes are priced at $355 million and $400 million, respectively, and the new, bigger jets will undoubtedly be more expensive. However, airlines get steep discounts from those published prices. Singapore is weighing all the attributes of each jet as it decides on which to back. The tricky part for designers at both manufacturers is to make sure that the jets don't get so long that they require more runway to takeoff and land, which would limit where they can fly and how much they can carry. The longer a jet gets, the more engineers have to account for the increased weight and length. Without more thrust from the engines or added lift from the wings, pilots will require more runway as they accelerate for takeoff. It might be harder for Airbus to provide enough thrust from its Rolls-Royce engines to accommodate the longer and heavier jet, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis for the Teal Group consultancy. Airbus and Rolls have already revised the A350's engine once, and the Boeing 777X may already hold an inherent design advantage with the new General Electric engines and larger wingspan, he said. "We are always working in partnership with Airbus to ensure that the A350...continues to address all airline requirements," a Rolls-Royce spokesman said in a statement. However, Aboulafia said Airbus does not have big new development plans for after 2017 and could bring the A350-2000 to market sooner than Boeing, which has its lineup planned through 2021. Singapore's decision to back one plane or the other doesn't guarantee that either the Boeing or Airbus design will be developed. But an endorsement from Singapore will give the model the credibility a new product needs to help win deals with other airlines. Boeing and Airbus must demonstrate to their boards of directors that they have enough buyer interest before they can begin manufacturing. "We discuss fleet requirements with manufacturers on a regular basis, and any such discussions are confidential," said Nicholas Ionides, Singapore Airlines vice president of public affairs. A Boeing spokesman said, "we will continue to study 777X derivatives and seek customer input to develop products that provide the most value for customers," but stressed that no decisions have yet been made. An Airbus spokesman declined to discuss any ongoing sales campaigns. Both plane makers have been rolling out the red carpet for Singapore. A year ago, Airbus launched an ultra-long range version of the A350 for Singapore for non-stop flights to New York, and in October, Singapore got Airbus's 10,000th delivery. The airline already has ordered more than 65 A350s. Boeing is set to hand over its even-larger 787-10 Dreamliner first to the carrier in 2018.

No, stay hereYes, go to AWIN China’s Nanshan Aluminum To Supply Boeing With Plate Nov 8, 2016 Bradley Perrett | Aerospace Daily & Defense Report EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement ZHUHAI, China—Chinese company Nanshan Aluminum will supply aerospace-grade aluminum plate to Boeing, taking a key step in accessing the global market.                                                                        Nanshan will use the contract as a foundation for expanding its plate business and growing into aluminum extrusions and aluminum and titanium forgings, Chairman Cheng Rence says. Chinese manufacturers are small players in the global aerospace metals market, in which companies such as Boeing and Airbus demand material properties that are not easy for inexperienced firms to achieve. Airbus contracted China’s Southwest Aluminum in 2011 to supply aluminum plate. The Chinese plant of U.S. company Aleris will also supply aluminum to Airbus under a long-term contract signed in July. Despite the challenges of working with new suppliers, cultivating them is in the interest of aircraft makers, since they intensify competition. “Developing local suppliers and incorporating them into the global aerospace supply chain is a key focus of our industrial cooperation with Chinese industry,” said Ian Chang, who manages suppliers in the country for Boeing’s commercial business. “This new collaboration will capitalize on Nanshan’s vertical integration, new equipment and ability to offer firm fixed pricing to build an aviation aluminum supply base in China that can be globally competitive.” Boeing has been working with Nanshan to qualify its aerospace materials operation. Nanshan is based in Shandong, a province in eastern China. The agreement between Boeing and Nanshan was announced at Airshow China, held here Nov. 1–6.   Print Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

The 10 Greatest Emergency Landings facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print By Stephan Wilkinson 11/8/2016 • Aviation History Magazine ‘Ever since the beginning of flight, pilots have been taught to keep in some small corner of their aviator’s toolbox the thought that maybe, just maybe, something will someday require them to land in a way and at a place not of their choosing’ US Airways Captain Chesley Sullenberger’s remarkable ditching of his Airbus A320 in the Hudson River is undoubtedly the most famous forced landing of all time. But ever since the beginning of flight, pilots have been taught to constantly keep in some small com­partment of their aviator’s toolbox the thought that maybe, just maybe, something will someday require them to land in a way and at a place not of their choosing. Fixed-wing pilots even practice it, though unless an actual runway is available it’s a kind of emergency interruptus exercise, never carried to its conclusion. (Helicopter pilots practice autorotations to the ground, an adrenaline-pumping maneuver.) Here are Aviation History’s nominations for the best-ever airplane emergency landings, big and small, heroic and embarrassing, skillful and just plain lucky. Navajo Save On a late afternoon in June 1993, air taxi pilot Edward Wyer, a 45-year-old ex-RAF Tornado pilot, took off from Birmingham, England, on a flight to Norwich, about 130 miles due east. Aboard were seven passengers—a load that, in his eight-seat Piper Navajo, made even a low-rent charter airliner seem spacious. The two back-row fares sat with their knees in their faces, and Wyer had a traveler next to him in what normally would have been the copilot’s seat. Some 40 miles west of Norwich, as Wyer slowly reduced power to begin his descent, there was a huge bang, the airplane shook like a soggy Labrador and both engines went silent. The right engine, in fact, went away—tore itself from its mounts and fell off. It had shed one of its three prop blades, and the huge rotating imbalance ripped the engine loose. Nor was that the only damage done by the big aluminum blade. Flung with incredible force through the Navajo’s nose, it flew out the other side and into the left engine’s prop, killing that engine. Meanwhile, the sudden asymmetry had snapped the Piper into a tight spin to the right, which Wyer managed to correct after only two turns—nice work even if you’re fully prepared for a practice spin in an intact airplane. Wyer tried his best to reach a satisfactory glide angle, but at anything less than a steep descent at 130 knots, the airplane began to roll uncontrollably. Coming down fast, Wyer spotted an open field to his left and without hesitation turned toward it, even though the approach path was complicated by powerlines. It took two hands on the yoke and all his strength to manage the airplane, so there was no way Wyer could hand-pump the flaps and landing gear down with the emergency handle, but he managed to get over the wires and put the Navajo down on its belly so gently that the sole injury was to a passenger who later claimed whiplash. Accident investigators were able to verify the exact place where the Navajo’s tail had first brushed a tall stand of crops, and the neatly cut swath showed that the airplane had sunk inch by inch over a 2,300-foot flare and slid a smooth 460 feet after ground contact. Snapped Wing Spar While practicing for the 1970 world aerobatic flyoff, British champion Neil Williams felt the wing spar of his Zlin 526 suddenly fail during a pullout from a vertical dive. As he instinctively closed the throttle and tried to level off, Williams realized that the left wing was folded at nearly a 45-degree angle to the fuselage, severed at the root but still somehow held in place. Sure that he was about to die, Williams flashed back to a Bulgarian Zlin pilot who’d snapped an upper wing bolt while flying inverted. When that airplane flick-rolled upright in reaction to the suddenly askew spar, the wing flopped back into position under positive Gs and held until the stunned pilot landed. Williams figured that if he’d had the opposite failure upright, maybe he could invert the Zlin and hold the wing in place with negative Gs long enough to at worst crash-land inverted, perhaps into trees to cushion the impact. With the airplane on its back and the broken wing indeed maintaining a tenuous connection, Williams now had another problem: The Zlin’s engine died. He’d inadvertently jostled the fuel cock closed during the confusion, but he got the engine restarted, remembering to select the correct tank for inverted flight. The airfield from which he’d departed, RAF Hullavington, was now nearby, and his ground crew had already summoned crash trucks, so Williams decided to land there. He flew the pattern and final approach inverted and at the last possible moment rolled the Zlin upright and flopped onto the ground just as the left wing totally failed. At the last possible moment? Consider this: The Zlin’s left wingtip briefly furrowed the airstrip grass for six yards while the airplane rolled from inverted to level, yet never broke the plastic cover of the wingtip nav light. The Gimli Glider When the pilots of Air Canada Flight 143 heard a deep “BONG” in the cockpit on July 23, 1983, it was a warning bell they’d never heard before, even during simulated training emergencies. No wonder: The sound signified that both engines were out of fuel, an inconceivable situation for a state-of-the-art Boeing 767-200 placidly en route from Montreal to Edmonton, Canada. The chain of events that led to this stunning situation included an inoperative fuel-quantity indicating system and a top-off in Montreal done in metric units of jet fuel that the crew assumed were gallons. That was the bad news. The good news was that Captain Robert Pear­son was a sailplane pilot, and he quickly came up with what he figured was the 767’s best glide speed for maximum distance and turned toward Winnipeg, which seemed within range. Even more fortuitous was that 1st Officer Maurice Quintal had been stationed at a base called Gimli when he was in the Royal Canadian Air Force, and Gimli was even closer than Winnipeg. Quintal proposed Gimli as an option. He wasn’t aware, however, that Gimli RCAFB had become Gimli Industrial Park Airport, a casual general aviation field that had converted one of its two runways into a dragstrip. Air Canada Flight 143's collapsed nose wheel at Gimli airfield redefined "drag-race"—in a good way. (Wayne Glowacki / Winnipeg Free Press) Without power except from a ram-air turbine (RAT) emergency hydraulic unit, the 767’s glass-cockpit instrument panel was totally dark, with only a few small backup gauges to provide basic speed, altitude and heading information. And as the airplane slowed to approach speed, the RAT put out less power and the hydraulically operated controls became harder to move. With Pearson flying, Quintal put the landing-gear handle down on approach to Gimli’s east/west runway. It turned out to be the deactivated one, that day hosting an autocross and covered with sports cars, RVs, campers, drivers and spectators. With no power, the main wheels free-fell into place, but the nose-gear strut never locked down. Pearson realized that he was too high and kicked the big Boeing into a substantial, cross-controlled sideslip to lose altitude. It was a technique to which he was accustomed in gliders but a sporty maneuver in a 95-ton sweptwing jet. The 767 touched down hard and then experienced the final fortunate circumstance of the day: While racers scattered in every direction and Pearson braked like a Corvette driver staring at a hairpin turn, the nose-gear strut collapsed, and the 767’s nose ground the airplane to a halt just short of the carnage it might have created while rolling. The only injuries among the 61 passengers were a few minor ones suffered during the inflatable slide evacuation. Piggyback Ansons The Avro Anson, roughly the size of a Twin Beech, was a ubiquitous British Commonwealth twin-engine trainer during World War II, but it was hardly so common that two identical Ansons might collide in the vast, cloudless sky over New South Wales, Australia, on September 29, 1940. Yet not only did they collide, they did so gently enough, while flying in exactly the same direction at the same altitude, that they created a large, four-engine biplane—forever to be known in Oz as the “Piggy­back Ansons.” Royal Australian Air Force Leading Aircraftman Leonard Fuller was slowly descending to cruise at a lower altitude in his Anson Mk. I when he pancaked onto the Mk. I of LAC Jack Hew­son, who had been flying level, unseen directly below him. The mating was facilitated by the fact that Ansons had clumsy, hand-cranked retractable landing gear that took a numbing 140 turns to raise and another 140 to extend for landing. So if they weren’t in a hurry, Anson pilots like Fuller often simply left the gear down and accepted the 30-mph speed penalty. This meant that Fuller’s airplane essentially straddled Hewson’s, its wheels sitting atop Hewson’s wings. Hewson, stunned but survival-minded, firewalled his two throttles, locked the yoke for level flight with his seatbelt, crawled out of the shattered cockpit side window and parachuted free. Fuller, meanwhile, found that he could actually fly the tandem, since all his flight controls were untouched and operable, and the two roaring, overboosted engines Hewson had left behind—plus Fuller’s still-running right engine—were adequate to keep the pair in the air. Leonard Fuller's skill and quick thinking saved one of two conjoined Avro Ansons to fly another day. (Australian War Memorial) While the Ansons descended through 500 feet to what Fuller hoped would be a controlled crash, the bottom airplane’s engines seized, one after the other, from the stress of a power setting meant to be maintained for only a few minutes during takeoff. The Anson duo sank rapidly, but as he approached a farm field, Fuller two-blocked his own right throttle and flared in ground effect, touching down so lightly—yes, Hewson had also left his landing gear down for the flight—that the only damage to the airplanes was from the midair. Hewson’s airplane was a write-off, but Fuller’s was easily repaired and flew on with the RAAF for another seven years. The Show Must Go On RAF Flight Lt. William Reid was the lone pilot of an Avro Lancaster on the way to Dusseldorf with a load of bombs on the night of November 3, 1943. Barely halfway to the target and just past the Dutch coast, Reid took a burst through his windscreen from a Messerschmitt Me-110G night fighter and was hit in the shoulders and hands, his head raked by splinters of sharp Perspex. The attack had also damaged the elevator trim and left the Lanc without compasses. A lesser man would have done a 180 and headed home, but Reid soldiered on. (Unlike U.S. heavy bombers, Lancasters were single-pilot airplanes without dual controls. The flight engineer sat where a copilot normally would, on a seat that folded to provide access to the bombardier’s compartment.) A Focke Wulf Fw-190 “Wilde Sau” night fighter found them soon thereafter and did worse damage, killing the navigator, mortally wounding the radio operator and disabling the airplane’s oxygen system. Reid was hit again, but the flight engineer, despite a bullet through one arm, was able to bring him a portable O2 bottle. They were still nearly an hour from the target, but Reid managed to dead-reckon to Dusseldorf so precisely that the automatic strike camera later showed their bombs dead on target. Only the engineer was aware of how grievously wounded the pilot was; Reid had said nothing on the intercom. Weak from spilled blood, Reid set a course for home by the North Star and the moon. The oxygen bottle was empty, and the shattered windscreen bathed him in a 215-mph blast of bitter November air. Somehow the flight engineer helped to keep the semi-controllable Lanc on course, through the inevitable flak barrages along the Dutch coast and across the North Sea to the flatlands of Norfolk. With the USAAF base at Shipdham in sight, a tenacious Reid, blood from his freshly opened head wounds obscuring his vision, was roused to make the night landing between two rows of runway lights barely glimmering through ground fog. The Avro settled to earth heavily but safely even though the damaged legs of the one main gear gave way. For his airmanship, courage and devotion to duty, Bill Reid was awarded the Victoria Cross. Into the Rain Forest There are times when pilots will become heroes, if only briefly, for safely extracting themselves and their passengers from bad situations of their own making, and so it was for the crew of Brazilian airline Varig’s Flight 254 on September 3, 1989. It had been a long day for the crew of the Boeing 737. The airplane had taken off from São Paulo in the morning and flown north most of the length of Brazil, with half a dozen stops en route, when they reached Maraba, about 200 miles south of their final destination, Belém. At 5:30 p.m., they prepared to again take off. Captain César Garcez glanced at the printed flight plan and saw that the course to Belém was “0270.” That meant a heading of 027.0 degrees—north-northeast. Yet Garcez incomprehensibly read it as 270 degrees—due west, straight into one of the least-inhabited parts of Brazil, the jungles of the northern Mato Grosso. It was an act akin to a pilot bound from San Francisco to Seattle instead pointing his airplane at Hawaii. By the time the two crewmen realized their error—Garcez’s copilot, Nilson de Souza Zille, unquestioningly accepted the captain’s course—they were too low on fuel to save themselves. At 8:40, more than two hours after they were due in Belém, Garcez radioed air traffic control that he would be landing in the rain forest, though he still had no idea where. Garcez flew on until he’d emptied the Boeing’s fuel tanks, since there was no way to dump fuel and he wanted to land with the least possible risk of fire. When the engines finally sighed to a stop, Garcez was unable to extend more than a minimal amount of flaps, with hy­draulic power fast fading, and could barely make out the horizon from the light of faraway fires. He had no cockpit lights and few working instruments, yet he managed to flare the 737 into the tops of rain forest trees as high as an 18-story building. As the Boeing found the ground, its wings tore off and it quickly slid to a stop. Thirteen people died, but 41 survived. The crewmen were briefly lauded for their skill…until it became obvious why they’d needed it. When Throttles Are Your Only Flight Control It’s widely agreed among air transport pilots that the safe touchdown of a near-uncontrollable Airbus A300 at Baghdad International Air­port on November 22, 2003—after it was hit by a shoulder-fired missile—qualifies as one of the most remarkable emergency landings of all time. The A300, a DHL cargo flight, had totally lost all three of its hydraulic systems within a minute of the missile strike at 8,000 feet on climb out, which meant that its ailerons, spoilers, elevators, rudder and flaps were immovable. It was also rapidly leaking fuel and on fire, a blaze that, it has been estimated, would have burned through the left wing’s main spar had the flight lasted just eight minutes longer. After their Airbus A300 was hit by a missile near Baghdad, a DHL crew landed by using thrust vectoring. (Department of Defense) Not long before the incident, Captain Eric Gennotte had attended a flight safety seminar where he heard a presentation by retired United pilot Al Haynes, who had suffered a similar total hydraulic failure in a DC-10 near Sioux City, Iowa. Haynes and his crew had figured out how to “thrust vector” to steer the airplane—power increased on one wing engine or the other for yaw control, power forward or back evenly on both to climb or descend—and it was a lesson that Gennotte filed away for future reference. Flight Engineer Mario Rofail played a huge part in the save as well, as did 1st Officer Steeve Michielsen. Fuel had flooded out of the big left outboard wing tank, and the left inboard tank was leaking rapidly. Rofail had to quickly and correctly crossfeed fuel from the right wing in a manner that wouldn’t add to the leakage but would feed the left engine; had that engine stopped even briefly, the sudden asymmetric thrust would have doomed the airplane. As soon as the flight controls failed, the ’Bus began porpoising and rolling as much as 30 degrees left and right. Rofail immediately dropped the landing gear, which helped slow and stabilize the airplane. It took only 10 minutes or so for the pilots to work out their thrust-vectoring skills, and they initiated an approach back to Baghdad. In fact they had become good enough at controlling the airplane that when the approach went bad, they were able to climb away and line up with a different runway. This time they touched down successfully, though the airplane rolled off the runway into the dirt bordering it. When the A300 had stopped and the crew evacuated the cockpit, they began to run from the scene, but crash crews stopped them. They were in the middle of an uncleared minefield. On One Wing and a Prayer On May 1, 1983, over the Negev Desert, Israeli Air Force pilot Zivi Nedivi was practicing air combat maneuvering with his big twin-engine F-15D Eagle, dogfighting a tricky A-4 Skyhawk that was playing the aggressor role. Unfortunately, the Skyhawk went inverted as Nedivi was descending through its altitude, and neither pilot could see the other. The ensuing collision tore off the F-15’s entire right wing—not just a piece of it but the complete wing from the root outward. (The A-4 was a fireball, but its pilot ejected successfully.) The F-15 immediately went nose-down and spun, and Nedivi told his back-seat instructor to prepare to eject. Fortunately, Nedivi instinctively did the one thing that might save the airplane: He pushed the power levers through the afterburner gate, and the speed stabilized the half-an-airplane enough that he could actually control it. The instructor urged ejection anyway, but Nedivi, who outranked him, refused; he thought he could land the airplane. “I probably would have ejected if I knew what actually had happened,” he later admitted, but a huge spray of fuel pouring out of the right wing root totally obscured where the wing would have been, and neither Nedivi nor his wingman could see that it was no longer there. Nedivi flew the F-15 for some 10 minutes, back to the nearest IAF desert base, and there found that he needed to keep the approach speed at nearly 260 knots—fully twice the airplane’s normal landing speed—to forestall an uncontrollable roll. The F-15 touched down wings-level—make that wing-level—but was traveling so fast that when its emergency tailhook snagged a snubbing cable a third of a way down the runway, the hook simply tore off the fighter. Nedivi braked to a stop about 20 feet from the end of the 11,000-foot runway and turned in his seat to shake the instructor’s hand. It was the first time he could see that the right wing was gone. (Click here to see a video about the landing on YouTube.) Nedivi reportedly was demoted for disobeying his instructor’s order to eject and immediately thereafter promoted for saving his airplane—which two months later was repaired and flying again. Zivi Nedivi landed his F-15D after a midair collision without realizing that his right wing was completely gone. (IAF) “Fill Her Up” On an early spring Saturday in 1975, professional aerobatic and movie pilot J.W. “Corkey” Fornof was flying a Bede BD-5J, a tiny, single-seat microjet, to a NASA gathering of space shuttle subcontractors in Washington, D.C., where the airplane was to be displayed. Level at 11,500 feet over North Carolina, Fornof suddenly lost all oil pressure on the watermelon-size French TRS-18 turbojet that powered the airplane. He shut down the engine and glided toward the solid cloud layer below him—a spunky move, since he couldn’t be sure what was below it. Fortunately, Fornof broke out of the undercast about 800 feet above a thick pine forest, saw Interstate 95 several miles to the west and was able to line up with the highway for a landing. He skimmed over a Mayflower moving van and briefly considered landing atop it, since traffic was heavy, “but I had a Road Runner cartoon vision of coming to an overpass and figured that wasn’t a good idea,” he recalled. Fornof still had plenty of speed, and he remembers gliding past a Cadillac—“they waved at me”—and coming up behind a pickup towing a boat. “I came up abeam the driver and motioned that I wanted to slide in ahead of them, and the guy simply slowed down and motioned me past. I don’t know what he was smokin’, but he was cool as could be.” Fornof touched down gently, crested a hill and rolled down the other side to an off-ramp. At the bottom of the exit was a mini-mall and a Sunoco gas station, so Fornof used the last of the Bede’s momentum to roll up to the pump island, activating the little rubber ding-ding hose in the process. The station attendant was leaning against the doorway, and, said Fornof, “We stared at each other a good 15 seconds, and he spit out his chaw and said, ‘Is this Candid Camera?’” Corkey flew a BD-5J in the James Bond film Octopussy, in which his most spectacular stunt was flying the microjet through a hangar—in one door and out the other end—but the highway landing experience was also worked into the plot: Bond (Roger Moore) runs out of fuel in the Bede, lands on a rural two-lane and rolls into a gas station, where he tells the slack-jawed attendant to “Fill her up, please.” Wing-Walkers Canadian 2nd Lt. Alan McLeod was just 18 years old when he was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I for a heroic crash-landing that he performed while standing on the wing of his Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 single-engine bomber. Licked by flames from its burning gas tank, wounded five times by attacking Fokker Dr.I triplanes, he maneuvered the F.K.8 so the fire streamed clear of his also-wounded rear gunner. He managed to crash-land the airplane near enough to British lines that he was able to crawl to safety, dragging his gunner along with him. McLeod had tried to join the military when he was 14 and was finally accepted at 17. He soloed in five days and earned his wings in less than two months. During his brief time in combat, he shot down one German observation balloon and had several dogfights with German fighters—quite an accomplishment in a bomber/recon­naissance plane. On March 27, 1918, McLeod and his observer, Lieutenant A.W. Hammond, were about to bomb a German artillery battery when they were attacked by a Fokker Dr.I that Hammond, with the help of McLeod’s maneuvering, subsequently shot down, only to be attacked by seven more triplanes. Hammond downed two more before a bullet pierced his fuel tank, setting the big plane ablaze. McLeod’s VC citation claims that he “climbed out onto the left bottom [wing], and by sideslipping steeply kept the flames to one side, thus enabling the observer to continue firing until the ground was reached.” And so the legend has come down to us, though pilots who hear it realize that a sideslip is impossible without the use of the rudder controls, which McLeod couldn’t have reached from his position on the wing. Perhaps McLeod cross-controlled the bomber into a slip while he was still in the cockpit. Then, when he climbed onto the wing, the stiff, primitive controls might have held the right-rudder deflection. Whatever the case, the young Canadian flew the airplane from outside the cockpit so competently that both he and Hammond survived the controlled crash. Nor is this the only case of a perambulating World War I pilot. During a wild dogfight on September 5, 1918, New Zealander Keith Caldwell found himself with a barely controllable S.E.5a after a midair collision with one of his RAF squadron mates. As he neared the ground, Caldwell climbed out of the cockpit onto the left wing, held a cabane strut with his left hand and worked the control column with his right, hoping to jump off just before the airplane crashed. Skimming over the British trenches, he leapt clear, made a few somersaults on the ground and ended up in a trench, where he politely asked to use the telephone. Caldwell survived the conflict and indeed remained with the RNZAF through World War II. Frequent contributor Stephan Wilkinson’s sole “emergency” landing in 3,000-plus hours in the pilot’s seat was soon after a night takeoff from Westchester County en route to Kennedy Airport in a Cessna 310 twin. Noting oil streaming from one of the nacelles (the result of an improperly secured oil cap), he requested a straight-in approach at JFK, only to be told, “Ah, wouldn’t it be better to go back to White Plains, which I show just four miles behind you?” “Duh,” comments Wilkinson, “I was about to fly across Long Island Sound with a failing engine.” The return and landing were uneventful, but he notes, “I know well that I would be a terrible pilot in an emergency. I tend to get tunnel-vision and go to a state of immediate stupidity.” Related Stories Dragon Lady Down The Legendary Lockheed Constellation Commemorative Air Force Kingcobras Semper Fi in the Sky Letter from Aviation History: The Truth is Out There Build a Hawaiian Air Depot B-17E Also featuring facebook twitter linkedin pinterest print SUBSCRIPTIONS American History America's Civil War Aviation History Civil War Times Military History MHQ Vietnam Wild West World War II SECTIONS Today in History Daily Quiz Interviews Personalities Reviews Ask Mr. History Videos Galleries TOPICS Civil War Black History Women's History Vietnam War American History Vietnam John F.

The new routes heighten YVR’s status as a hub airport while increasing traffic and making it easier for the Vancouver Airport Authority (VAA) to reach its goal of serving 25 million passengers by 2020. New non-stop Air Canada flights to Brisbane, Australia, and to Delhi, India, from Vancouver, for example, would not have been viable without Dreamliner aircraft, Air Canada’s president of passenger airlines, Ben Smith, told Business in Vancouver. “[Dreamliner aircraft] are the right size for this market, the right fuel efficiency, and you can see we’ve got the right seat configuration for this market,” Smith said. “We’ve never had that before at our disposal.” Not only do Dreamliner aircraft have more efficient engines that burn less fuel, they are also able to fly faster and higher than previous Boeing planes, such as the Boeing 777. Air Canada still uses 777s to fly long-haul routes between Vancouver and Sydney, Australia – a route that has sufficient demand for the larger plane. Dreamliner aircraft also cost less to maintain and have sturdier frames. That combination enables the airline to pressurize cabins to allow more humidity, thereby adding value by helping passengers avoid jet lag. Air Canada owns two kinds of Dreamliner aircraft. Its 29 Dreamliner 787-900 planes each seat 298 people, including 30 in business class and 21 in premium economy class – a configuration deemed ideal for Delhi flights.  Its eight Dreamliner 787-800 planes are smaller and seat 251 people, including 20 passengers in business class and 21 in premium economy class – a configuration ideal for Brisbane flights, said Smith. Air Canada is considering launching other routes out of Vancouver to “Asia and the South Pacific” that are newly deemed to be viable because of Dreamliner aircraft, Smith added. He would not be more specific because he said he did not want to tip off the airline’s competitors. Chinese airlines, which compete with Air Canada, have launched routes between Vancouver and medium-sized Chinese cities that may not have been deemed viable were it not for Dreamliner aircraft. Xiamen Airlines, for example, launched non-stop flights on Dreamliner aircraft to Vancouver from the secondary city of Xiamen, China, which has a population of just over two million people, in July. No one from Xiamen Airlines was available to comment on whether those flights would have gone ahead were it not for the Dreamliner planes. VAA CEO Craig Richmond suggested that a future Air Canada route out of YVR on Dreamliner aircraft could be to Mumbai, which is India’s financial centre. That route could be in the cards given that the airline already plans to launch non-stop flights between Toronto and Mumbai, on Dreamliner planes, starting in July 2017. “Mumbai is a logical route for us,” Richmond said. “We’re actually starting to see some cities that so far have not been on our list [of potential new routes] become viable, like Barcelona. That’s a real opportunity.” Smith stressed that any new long-haul route out of Vancouver would require demand from business travellers. That rules out new non-stop flights to faraway vacation destinations, such as Bali, Indonesia. “Bali is very far for a predominantly leisure route,” he said. “These types of routes, because you’re carrying the fuel so much further, if there’s no business component, it’s pretty hard to make the route viable.” Business-class travellers tend to pay at least several times the price of the average economy fare and are more likely to see the value of a non-stop flight to a destination than would a family of four going on a vacation and sitting in the economy section, explained Smith. Families, he explained, are more likely to see the value of knocking a couple of hundred dollars, or more, off the price of each economy ticket by flying on a one-stop route. The only announced future route on a Dreamliner aircraft out of YVR is Air Canada’s plan to launch daily non-stop flights between Vancouver and Taipei in June 2017, pending government approval. Eva Air and China Airlines already offer daily non-stop flights between Vancouver and Taipei but do not use Dreamliner aircraft.      Most Popular Viewed 1 Two Hong Kong localists down, and two more at risk after Beijing ruling 2 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 3 He famously called two US presidential elections, but Nate Silver blew it with Trump 4 Hong Kong will move on controversial security law, CY Leung says, as Beijing bars independence activists from Legco 5 China’s top body lays down law on Hong Kong oath-taking Shared 1 ‘There’s nothing to be ashamed of’: why Chinese Americans are taking to the streets to back Trump 2 Hong Kong will move on controversial security law, CY Leung says, as Beijing bars independence activists from Legco 3 Two Hong Kong localists down, and two more at risk after Beijing ruling 4 He famously called two US presidential elections, but Nate Silver blew it with Trump 5 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election Commented 1 Two Hong Kong localists down, and two more at risk after Beijing ruling 2 Hong Kong localist lawmakers remain defiant over Beijing Basic Law ruling 3 China’s top body lays down law on Hong Kong oath-taking 4 Hong Kong Chief Executive revisits controversial security law in wake of Beijing interpretation 5 2,000 Hong Kong police ready round the clock as protests over Beijing’s ruling on Basic Law loom Promotions Register for a free copy of XXIV 2017 now Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like China China's arms industry showcases latest weapons at Zhuhai air show Nov 6th 2016, 8:04pm Out on the town: experiencing Macau is far from a gamble In partnership with Macao Government Tourism Office China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Forging a better future: By the people, for the people Presented by: Credit Suisse Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 8 Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 19 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Nov 5th 2016, 12:54pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 7 Nov 2016 - 7:11pm 3 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Share & Embed Air Force Electronic Warfare Upgrade to F-15 Designed to Help Fighter Stay in Front of Chinese J-10 Kris Osborn 11/07/2016 / Originally published onWarrior The US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The Air Force is reving up electronic warfare upgrades for its F-15 fighter as a way to better protect against enemy fire and electronic attacks, service officials said. Boeing has secured a $478 million deal to continue work on a new technology called with a system called the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS.  “This allows the aircraft to identify a threat and actively prosecute that threat through avoidance, deception or jamming techniques,” Mike Gibbons, Vice President of the Boeing F-15 program, told Scout Warrior in an interview a few months ago.   These updated EW capabilities replace the Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been used since the 1980s, not long after the F-15 first deployed. The service plans to operate the fleet until the mid-2040’s, so an overhaul of the Eagle’s electronic systems helps maintain U.S. air supremacy, the contract announcement said.  Boeing won the initial contract for the EPAWSS project last year  and hired BAE Systems as the primary subcontractor.  Overall, the US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The multi-pronged effort not only includes the current addition of electronic warfare technology but also extends to super-fast high-speed computers, infrared search and track enemy targeting systems, increased networking ability and upgraded weapons-firing capability, Air Force and Boeing officials said. “The Air Force plans to keep the F-15 fleet in service until the mid-2040’s.  Many of the F-15 systems date back to the 1970’s and must be upgraded if the aircraft is to remain operationally effective. Various upgrades will be complete as early as 2021 for the F-15C AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar and as late as 2032 for the various EW (electronic warfare) upgrades,” Air Force spokesman Maj. Rob Leese told Scout Warrior a few months ago.  The Air Force currently operates roughly 400 F-15C, D and E variants. A key impetus for the upgrade was well articulate in a Congressional report on the US and China in 2014. (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission --www.uscc.gov). Among other things, the report cited rapid Chinese technological progress and explained that the US margin of superiority has massively decreased since the 1980s. As an example, the report said that in the 1980s, the US F-15 was vastly superior to the Chinese equivalent – the J-10. However, Chinese technical advances in recent years have considerably narrowed that gap to the point where the Chinese J-10 is now roughly comparable to the US F-15, the report explained. Air Force and Boeing developers maintain that ongoing upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that this equivalence is not the case and that, instead, they will ensure the superiority of the F-15. Among the upgrades is an ongoing effort to equip the F-15 with the fastest jet-computer processer in the world, called the Advanced Display Core Processor, or ADCPII. “It is capable of processing 87 billion instructions per second of computing throughput, translating into faster and more reliable mission processing capability for an aircrew,” Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told Scout Warrior. High tech targeting and tracking technology is also being integrated onto the F-15, Gibbons added. This includes the addition of a passive long-range sensor called Infrared Search and Track, or IRST. The technology is also being engineered into the Navy F-18 Super Hornet. The technology can detect the heat signature, often called infrared emissions, of enemy aircraft. “The system can simultaneously track multiple targets and provide a highly effective air-to-air targeting capability, even when encountering advanced threats equipped with radar-jamming technology,” Navy officials said. IRST also provides an alternate air-to-air targeting system in a high threat electronic attack environment, Navy, Air Force and industry developers said. The F-15 is also being engineered for additional speed and range, along with weapons-firing ability. The weapons-carrying ability is being increased from 8 up to 16 weapons; this includes an ability to fire an AIM-9x or AIM-120 missile. In addition, upgrades to the aircraft include adding an increased ability to integrate or accommodate new emerging weapons systems as they become available. This is being done through both hardware and software-oriented “open standards” IP protocol and architecture. The aircraft is also getting a “fly-by-wire” automated flight control system. “Fly by wire means when the pilot provides the input - straight to a computer than then determines how to have the aircraft perform the way it wants - provides electrical signals for the more quickly and more safely move from point to point as opposed to using a mechanical controls stick,” Gibbons explained. Along with these weapons upgrades and other modifications, the F-15 is also getting upgrades to the pilot’s digital helmet and some radar signature reducing, or stealthy characteristics. However, at the same time, the F-15 is not a stealthy aircraft and is expected to be used in combat environments in what is called “less contested” environments where the Air Force already has a margin of air superiority over advanced enemy air defenses.  For this reason, the F-15 will also be increasing networked so as to better support existing 5th-generation platforms such as the F-22 and F-35, Air Force officials said. The intent of these F-15 upgrades is to effectively perform the missions assigned to the F-15 fleet, which are to support the F-22 in providing air superiority and the F-35 in providing precision attack capabilities, Leese said. “While these upgrades will not make these aircraft equivalent to 5th generation fighters, they will allow the F-15 to support 5th generation fighters in performing their missions, and will also allow F-15s to assume missions in more permissive environments where capabilities of 5th generation fighters are not required,” Leese added. Gibbons added that the upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that the fighter aircraft remains superior to its Chinese equivalent.    “The F-15 as a vital platform that still has a capability that cannot be matched in terms of ability to fly high, fly fast, go very far carry a lot. It is an air dominance machine,” Gibbons explained.   Kris Osborn can be reached at Kris.Osborn@Scout.com.

Lufthansa and International Airlines Group both plan to cut back on new aircraft purchases in the coming years. But Boeing and Airbus will be just fine. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Nov 7, 2016 at 4:40PM Last week, two of the largest European airline companies -- British Airways parent International Airlines Group (IAG) and Deutsche Lufthansa (NASDAQOTH:DLAKY) -- announced plans to reduce their aircraft spending. Under pressure due to high labor costs, the strong dollar, and vicious competition from budget carriers, both companies want to save money by keeping older planes in service while bringing in some used aircraft. Obviously, this isn't good news for Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (NASDAQOTH:EADSY). Both aircraft manufacturers certainly preferred the order frenzy of a few years ago. Nevertheless, these moves by airlines to reduce capital spending aren't quite as disastrous for Boeing and Airbus as they may appear to be on the surface. Order deferrals by Lufthansa and IAG won't hurt Boeing and Airbus too much. Image source: Boeing. What the airlines are doing Last Wednesday, in conjunction with Lufthansa's Q3 earnings report, CEO Carsten Spohr stated that the company was looking to buy more used aircraft in the coming years. This would allow it to reduce its capital expenditures after 2017. Spohr explained that the combination of low fuel prices, new programs to extend the useful lives of existing aircraft, and good availability on the used aircraft market makes it a great time to pivot away from buying new aircraft. He said that Lufthansa was particularly interested in buying used aircraft for short-haul routes. Meanwhile, at an investor meeting on Friday, IAG announced plans to reduce capital spending over the next five years by 1 billion euros. It will do so by extending the lives of the British Airways Boeing 747 and Boeing 777 fleets, squeezing in 52 more seats on some 777s that will be used for leisure routes from Gatwick Airport and buying more used aircraft -- for both short-haul and long-haul routes. Narrowbody backlogs are huge Efforts by Lufthansa and IAG to reduce spending on narrowbody aircraft won't hurt Boeing at all -- both companies use Airbus A320-family planes for short-haul routes. However, Airbus doesn't have much to worry about, either. It has a backlog of roughly 5,500 firm orders for A320-family aircraft. That represents more than 10 years of output at today's production rate. Airbus plans to increase A320-family output over the next few years, but even at the peak production rate of 60 per month, it would take eight years to build that many planes. Airbus has a massive order backlog for the A320neo family. Image source: Airbus. Thus, if a few dozen orders are deferred, it won't impact Airbus' production plans. If anything, it could be helpful by opening up scarce A320neo slots over the next several years. Furthermore, the austerity moves at Lufthansa and IAG are largely a response to expansion by European budget carriers like Ryanair, EasyJet, and Norwegian Air Shuttle. Boeing and Airbus are happy to sell lots of new 737s and A320s to those up-and-coming carriers, even if it means selling fewer to established airlines. Widebodies will be replaced eventually In the widebody market, order backlogs tend to be shorter. Thus, deferrals are more likely to negatively impact production. However, Lufthansa is making most of its adjustments on the narrowbody side of its fleet. With a large number of aging four-engine A340s and 747s in its fleet, Lufthansa probably wants to take delivery of the Airbus A350 and Boeing 777X aircraft it has ordered to replace them. Lufthansa still wants to retire its aging 747-400s relatively soon. Image source: The Motley Fool. IAG subsidiary British Airways seems more interested in keeping older widebodies in service and buying used widebodies. As a result, it is reviewing its orders for Boeing 787s and A350s between now and 2020. Fortunately, those models have longer backlogs than the A330 and 777 families, which haven't been selling as well recently. Boeing is nearly sold out on the 787 until 2020, while Airbus' A350 backlog stretches even longer. Additionally, while British Airways is extending the lives of its 747 and 777 fleets, those planes will need to be replaced eventually. All of its 747s were built in 1999 and earlier, which means the last ones will probably leave its fleet around 2025. Meanwhile, most of British Airways' 777s were built between 1995 and 2001 and will become ripe for retirement in the mid-2020s. Thus, while British Airways might defer some 787 or A350 orders by a few years, over the next decade it will need more widebodies than what it has already ordered. Even if it goes with used aircraft, that's not the end of the world for Airbus and Boeing. By taking up used planes from Middle Eastern and Asian carriers, British Airways would help make room for new widebodies in those airlines' fleets. Order backlogs are a big insurance policy When the last big aircraft order cycle peaked in 1999, the order backlogs at Boeing and Airbus were a fraction of their current size. That made both companies vulnerable to a temporary downturn in demand. Even today, aircraft types with shorter backlogs like the 747, current-generation 777, A380, and A330 have proven vulnerable to demand fluctuations. By contrast, order backlogs for the 737, 787, A320, and A350 aircraft families are quite long. This serves as an insurance policy against short-term demand fluctuations for Boeing and Airbus. The shifting fleet plans at British Airways and Lufthansa will mainly impact orders for the A320 and to a lesser extent the 787 and A350. Both manufacturers are well positioned to absorb some order deferrals over the next few years while waiting for a new replacement cycle to take hold in the mid-2020s.

The government carrier so far had to fly its aircraft empty in and out of the MRO here. Now, in a bid to recover fuel charges, Air India will fly passengers whenever a plane comes down to Nagpur for maintenance and flies back. These will be unscheduled flights available 2-3 times a month with tickets offered at a competitive rate. The Nagpur MRO at Mihan-SEZ was taken over by Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL) a year go. There are six MROs under AIESL, but as Nagpur is not a busy airport, planes have to specially flown here. On November 10, the Boeing 777 which had come down for maintenance will fly back to Mumbai. Air India is offering tickets starting at Rs2731 onwards (for first 10 seats) for the flight taking off at 4pm. Already, 50 tickets of the aircraft with a capacity of 340 have been booked, a source said. An Airbus which came in for basic maintenance on November 2 flew to Delhi with 60 passengers on November 5. Such rates of tickets can prove to be a steal for passengers, especially in the festive season, such as now. On Monday night, the next lowest fare after Air India's special flight on November 10 was Rs 5,299 while tickets for November 9 were as costly as Rs 9,500. The MRO here has carried out a maintenance of 10 Boeing 777s so far, which otherwise are not deployed by any airlines on the Nagpur route. The Nagpur airport only gets A319 and A320 planes. The MRO has a capacity of taking in one Boeing 777 a month but, with a recent approval to maintain Airbus 319, 320 and 321 aircraft, there are chances to have more such special flights. On the basis of feedback on the maintenance schedule by the MRO, the commercial section will book slots for the flights and offer tickets at competitive rates. The details will be uploaded on the Air India website, the source said. The flight dates will depend on the completion of the maintenance work. "So far, the planes were coming without passengers, which led to a major drain on the fuel cost. The other MROs are linked to busy airports so the planes are checked in after a regular flight and also fly back as per schedule when the maintenance is over. But it was not possible for Nagpur. Air India chairman has decided to operate these flights as commercial unscheduled flights," the source said. (in a nutshell) The Air India MRO began operations a year ago Nagpur is not a busy airport so planes have to be specially diverted here for maintenance So far 10 Boeing 777s were serviced which flew in and out empty To recover expenses Air India will operate commercial but unscheduled flights from the MRO Boeing 777s are not deployed in Nagpur in normal course The new arrangement will give a chance to flyers to travel in a Boeing 777 from Nagpur Generally the flights will be to Delhi and Mumbai Schedule will be decided on the basis of maintenance work Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

(Bruce Smith / Associated Press) MONDAY, NOV. 7, 2016, 11:18 A.M. Boeing’s retiring boomers underscore U.S. manufacturing plight By Julie Johnsson Bloomberg Twitter Facebook Email Reddit John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing. He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today’s sleek 787 Dreamliner. The date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery’s calendar for more than a year. It was the last time that Boeing would bump up pension pay for Seattle-area factory workers before it froze the plan at month’s end, provisions dictated by a deeply unpopular 2014 contract extension. For Rothery, it was the final straw. “I’ll be 64 in November. After 37 years, that’s enough,” said Rothery, a tool-and-die maker. “I was working just to build a pension. As of Oct. 31, there’s no pension. Why stay?” The benefit change could hasten a generational shift as Boeing’s baby boomers retire, a trend that’s also looming for other U.S. manufacturers. The planemaker’s most experienced workers are packing up their tools during critical upgrades of its two largest profit-drivers: the 737 and 777 jetliners. About 10,000 mechanics are eligible to retire from the company’s Puget Sound manufacturing base alone, and no one knows how many are poised to leave. “It’s a conversation that anyone who is close to retirement is having,” said Becky Beasley, 75, a grandmother and body-structures mechanic who helps rivet together hulking aluminum panels to form the 777’s hull. Boeing is well aware of the risks: Shortages of skilled workers from a smaller, mid-1990s exodus contributed to a factory meltdown that halted production of its cash cow, the 737. So earlier this year, the manufacturer carefully structured a voluntary layoff aimed at retirement-age workers, staggering the departures of 1,057 machinists to avoid massive disruptions. “We had that very much in mind,” said Joelle Denney, vice president for human resources at Boeing’s commercial airplane division, of the 1995 tumult. As the date approached when pension benefits would stop accruing, workers had been leaving in a steady stream. “We’re not expecting a big bubble or wave,” Denney said. While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argue over the impact of international trade on factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers are grappling with a looming shortage of skilled workers. Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing’s fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The dilemma could be especially acute for Boeing, where about 35 percent of the 29,645 machinists in the company’s Seattle industrial hub are 55 or older. By contrast, only 23 percent of the 15.3 million Americans working in manufacturing are in that age group, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the long haul, the planemaker is investing in education — from vocational training to programs at middle schools — to try to make manufacturing “cool” to a generation that has never known shop class, Denney said. In the short term, Boeing is stepping up training and mentoring programs within its factories, she said. Some question whether the company is doing enough. “I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce,” said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. “There’s not enough in the pipeline to replace them.” Memories are still vivid of the cascading production issues two decades ago after Boeing offered a one-time retirement incentive with few restrictions. More than 3,700 mechanics, engineers and technical workers cashed out in June and July 1995 alone, creating immediate shortages in some positions. Many later were rehired as contractors as Boeing’s factories struggled to keep pace with a sales spurt. The shortfall contributed to production meltdowns in 1997 that forced the manufacturer to temporarily halt its 747 and 737 assembly lines to catch up. The cost to Boeing: a $1.6 billion pretax accounting loss. This year, Boeing closely managed who participated in the voluntary layoff offer, methodically planning for their replacement and charting when they left the company, Denney said. The measure targeted employees and managers on the cusp of retirement by offering as many as 26 weeks of pay and accelerated retirement benefits. Boeing is trying to make its operations more efficient as it trims spending and automates more production amid cut-throat competition for slowing aircraft sales. The company has eliminated 4,853 jobs in the state of Washington since the end of January, a 6.2 percent reduction. But while Boeing can control who leaves through the voluntary layoff, anyone can retire. That raises a risk of critical shortages of skilled tradesman with an intuitive feel for fabricating and assembling airplanes — among the most complicated machines on the planet. “The tricky aspect for the executives is not to lose too many skilled positions too quickly,” said Leon Grunberg, a sociologist and co-author of “Emerging from Turbulence: Boeing and the American Workplace Today.” “Can Boeing minimize the risk of losing the tribal knowledge?” Those leaving now will receive monthly pension payments of $95 for each year of employment. That amounts to about $34,200 annually for a 30-year Boeing veteran. While that covers basic necessities, retirees will also need savings to maintain their lifestyles, another factor that makes it difficult to predict near-term attrition. Beasley, the body-structures mechanic, doesn’t have a sufficiently large nest egg after 18 years at Boeing. She’s also putting a grandson through law school. “I’m a little concerned about my financial stability when I leave,” she said. “Social Security would barely cover the house payments.” Rothery, the newly retired tool-and-die maker, is looking forward to golf, soccer and road trips in a motor home after wrapping up his career at Boeing’s Frederickson, Washington, plant. His future is secure: 401(k) plan accounts of $750,000 or more aren’t unusual for career workers who saved carefully, Rothery said. He takes satisfaction from training his successor to step in seamlessly, but frets that his transition may be the exception. “It’s the vast amount of experience that’s leaving,” Rothery said. “They will work around it. They’ll still accomplish the task at hand. At what expense, it’s hard to say.” Published: Nov. 7, 2016, 11:18 a.m.  Tags: 787 Dreamliner, Boeing, business, commercial jet, economy, editors' picks, manufacturing, military, retirement, Seattle Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Fuller Boeing is now the proud owner of a tiltrotor aircraft patent and convertible compounded rotorcraft patent. In its Oct. 25 issue, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Official Gazette listed Boeing as a 17-time patent recipient. These newly issued patents include chromium-free conversion coating, new systems for paneling and a new fixed-wing steering method for taxiing, among others. Patent applications generally take a few years to become officially issued — Boeing’s taxiing method lists a 2010 file date. But among the patents for aircraft aspects, Boeing's two patents for rotorcraft designs were filed in 2014. Boeing’s tiltrotor design differs from existing tiltrotors by virtue of a low-wing configuration. As outlined in the patent, high-wing configurations add weight and complexity, as well as inconveniences in fueling and maintenance. A low-wing design would eradicate the need for structural reinforcements that prevent the wings from crushing the fuselage during a crash. The lack of structural reinforcements means more space on the aircraft, be it for mid-cabin exit doors without the need for escape slides and easier refueling. Boeing’s patent also covers the use of more than two engines. This way, the engines can be smaller, but still meet functional needs. Some existing tiltrotor designs have the engines attached to the tiltrotor. Boeing’s engines, in some embodiments, could be fixed to the wings. There are many different configurations outlined in the patent, leaving room for designs with different engine configurations. Boeing’s compound aircraft patent outlines a couple different embodiments. One configuration could be a fixed-wing aircraft with a removable rotor. Another configuration could be a fixed-wing aircraft that is small enough to be paired with, and carried by, a rotorcraft. The outlined docking mechanisms would also have the ability to release the aircraft. Furthering the idea of two separate aircraft flying together, the patent outlines a configuration in which a fixed-wing aircraft could be attached to a rotorcraft, with the capability to un-attach, to augment speed and lift.  The patents do not have any mentions of goals or timelines, but they outline various configurations and embodiments of Boeing’s methods and designs leaving many possibilities. A future Boeing tiltrotor could carry at least 100 passengers as a commercial transport vehicle, the patent says, while it could also have military applications. The compound aircraft patent is accompanied by a range of illustrations, displaying different configurations including docking, cargo transport and unmanned aircraft system support.

Boeing's retiring boomers underscore U.S. manufacturing plight By Julie Johnsson • Bloomberg Nov 7, 2016 (…) David Ryder The Boeing Co. facility in Everett, Washington, on June 1, 2015.  Bloomberg photo by David Ryder. John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing. He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today's sleek 787 Dreamliner. The date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery's calendar for more than a year. It was the last time that Boeing would bump up pension pay for Seattle-area factory workers before it froze the plan at month's end, provisions dictated by a deeply unpopular 2014 contract extension. For Rothery, it was the final straw. "I'll be 64 in November. After 37 years, that's enough," said Rothery, a tool-and-die maker. "I was working just to build a pension. As of Oct. 31, there's no pension. Why stay?" The benefit change could hasten a generational shift as Boeing's baby boomers retire, a trend that's also looming for other U.S. manufacturers. The planemaker's most experienced workers are packing up their tools during critical upgrades of its two largest profit-drivers: the 737 and 777 jetliners. About 10,000 mechanics are eligible to retire from the company's Puget Sound manufacturing base alone, and no one knows how many are poised to leave. "It's a conversation that anyone who is close to retirement is having," said Becky Beasley, 75, a grandmother and body-structures mechanic who helps rivet together hulking aluminum panels to form the 777's hull. Boeing is well aware of the risks: Shortages of skilled workers from a smaller, mid-1990s exodus contributed to a factory meltdown that halted production of its cash cow, the 737. So earlier this year, the manufacturer carefully structured a voluntary layoff aimed at retirement-age workers, staggering the departures of 1,057 machinists to avoid massive disruptions. "We had that very much in mind," said Joelle Denney, vice president for human resources at Boeing's commercial airplane division, of the 1995 tumult. As the date approached when pension benefits would stop accruing, workers had been leaving in a steady stream. "We're not expecting a big bubble or wave," Denney said. While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argue over the impact of international trade on factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers are grappling with a looming shortage of skilled workers. Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing's fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The dilemma could be especially acute for Boeing, where about 35 percent of the 29,645 machinists in the company's Seattle industrial hub are 55 or older. By contrast, only 23 percent of the 15.3 million Americans working in manufacturing are in that age group, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the long haul, the planemaker is investing in education — from vocational training to programs at middle schools — to try to make manufacturing "cool" to a generation that has never known shop class, Denney said. In the short term, Boeing is stepping up training and mentoring programs within its factories, she said. Some question whether the company is doing enough. "I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce," said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. "There's not enough in the pipeline to replace them." Memories are still vivid of the cascading production issues two decades ago after Boeing offered a one-time retirement incentive with few restrictions. More than 3,700 mechanics, engineers and technical workers cashed out in June and July 1995 alone, creating immediate shortages in some positions. Many later were rehired as contractors as Boeing's factories struggled to keep pace with a sales spurt. The shortfall contributed to production meltdowns in 1997 that forced the manufacturer to temporarily halt its 747 and 737 assembly lines to catch up. The cost to Boeing: a $1.6 billion pretax accounting loss. This year, Boeing closely managed who participated in the voluntary layoff offer, methodically planning for their replacement and charting when they left the company, Denney said. The measure targeted employees and managers on the cusp of retirement by offering as many as 26 weeks of pay and accelerated retirement benefits. What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Boeing is trying to make its operations more efficient as it trims spending and automates more production amid cut-throat competition for slowing aircraft sales. The company has eliminated 4,853 jobs in the state of Washington since the end of January, a 6.2 percent reduction. But while Boeing can control who leaves through the voluntary layoff, anyone can retire. That raises a risk of critical shortages of skilled tradesman with an intuitive feel for fabricating and assembling airplanes — among the most complicated machines on the planet. "The tricky aspect for the executives is not to lose too many skilled positions too quickly," said Leon Grunberg, a sociologist and co-author of "Emerging from Turbulence: Boeing and the American Workplace Today." "Can Boeing minimize the risk of losing the tribal knowledge?" Those leaving now will receive monthly pension payments of $95 for each year of employment. That amounts to about $34,200 annually for a 30-year Boeing veteran. While that covers basic necessities, retirees will also need savings to maintain their lifestyles, another factor that makes it difficult to predict near-term attrition. Beasley, the body-structures mechanic, doesn't have a sufficiently large nest egg after 18 years at Boeing. She's also putting a grandson through law school. "I'm a little concerned about my financial stability when I leave," she said. "Social Security would barely cover the house payments." Rothery, the newly retired tool-and-die maker, is looking forward to golf, soccer and road trips in a motor home after wrapping up his career at Boeing's Frederickson, Wash., plant. His future is secure: 401(k) plan accounts of $750,000 or more aren't unusual for career workers who saved carefully, Rothery said. He takes satisfaction from training his successor to step in seamlessly, but frets that his transition may be the exception. "It's the vast amount of experience that's leaving," Rothery said. "They will work around it. They'll still accomplish the task at hand. At what expense, it's hard to say." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

With these latest wins, LMI now has more than $135,000 of new content on this platform, and we continue to pursue other 777X opportunities. “We remain on track to close our Wichita sheet-metal operation by the end of the year. Additionally, we retired $10 million of higher-interest notes during the quarter as we work to strengthen the balance sheet and reduce interest expense. These actions support ongoing efforts to improve bottom line results and drive higher shareholder returns, even as we continue preparing for production ramp-ups with our latest investments to expand machining capacity in Fredonia.” Segment Results   Q3   Q3   Q3 YTD   Q3 YTD ($ millions) 2016   2015   2016   2015                 Net sales:               Aerostructures $ 80.4     $ 85.1     $ 232.9     $ 249.7   Engineering Services 9.5     10.8     29.2     36.8   Eliminations (0.2 )   (0.3 )   (1.1 )   (0.8 ) Total net sales $ 89.7     $ 95.6     $ 261.0     $ 285.7                   Income (loss) from operations:               Aerostructures $ 5.7     $ 8.9     $ 13.2     $ 20.0   Engineering Services (1) 0.1     (2.8 )   (28.6 )   (3.8 ) Eliminations (0.1 )   —     (0.3 )   —   Total income (loss) from operations (1) $ 5.7     $ 6.1     $ (15.7 )   $ 16.2   (1) The nine months ended September 30, 2016, include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $28.4 million in the Engineering Services segment. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, the Engineering Services segment recorded a loss from operations of $0.2 million and the total company recorded income from operations of $12.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Aerostructures Segment     Q3         Q3     Net Sales ($ in millions)   2016   % of Total     2015   % of Total                                 Large commercial aircraft   $ 47.2     58.7 %     $ 45.1     53.0 % Corporate and regional aircraft   18.9     23.5 %     23.6     27.7 % Military   8.8     10.9 %     8.9     10.5 % Other   5.5     6.9 %     7.5     8.8 % Total   $ 80.4     100.0 %     $ 85.1     100.0 %                                 Aerostructures revenue decreased 5.5 percent to $80.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $85.1 million in the third quarter of 2015. In the large commercial aircraft market, higher production rates on the Bombardier C-Series and Boeing 787 programs increased sales by $2.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a decrease in sales on the Boeing 747 program of $1.2 million. These trends are expected to continue through 2016. The decline in sales in the corporate and regional jet market was primarily attributable to lower tooling demand of $3.1 million on the Gulfstream G500/600 program and lower overall demand of $2.5 million on the Gulfstream G450/550 program. Military sales on the Sikorsky Blackhawk program decreased $0.7 million and were partially offset by an increase in sales on the Boeing Apache program of $0.5 million. The Aerostructures segment generated gross profit of $14.7 million, or 18.3 percent of net sales, in the third quarter of 2016 versus $16.6 million, or 19.5 percent of net sales, in the third quarter of 2015.  The reduction in gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to lower sales and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense of $0.6 million and benefits realized from restructuring activities completed during 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $9.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 versus $7.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. The change in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a net gain of $3.3 million recorded in the third quarter of 2015 related to the settlement of a lawsuit. In addition, incentive compensation costs and salaries and related fringes were lower in the third quarter of 2016 by $0.9 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of the lawsuit settlement gain, selling general and administrative expenses decreased $2.0 million in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Engineering Services Segment     Q3         Q3     Net Sales ($ in millions)   2016   % of Total     2015   % of Total       Large commercial aircraft   $ 3.0     31.6 %     $ 6.4     59.3 % Corporate and regional aircraft   2.8     29.5 %     0.8     7.4 % Military   2.9     30.5 %     2.9     26.9 % Other   0.8     8.4 %     0.7     6.4 % Total   $ 9.5     100.0 %     $ 10.8     100.0 %                                 Engineering Services revenue decreased 12.0 percent to $9.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 from $10.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decline in net sales in the large commercial aircraft market was primarily attributable to lower sales on the Bombardier C-series program and lower maintenance and repair revenues of $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively. The change in sales to the corporate and regional aircraft market was primarily related to an unfavorable cumulative catchup adjustment of $1.9 million on the Mitsubishi Regional Jet program in the third quarter of 2015. Gross profit for the segment was $1.2 million, or 12.6 percent of net sales, for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $0.04 million, or 0.4 percent of net sales, for the prior year quarter.  The change in gross profit was primarily attributable to the previously mentioned cumulative catchup adjustment in 2015. In addition, the reduction in revenue in the third quarter of 2016 unfavorably impacted gross profit but was partially offset by a decline in wages and related expenses resulting from cost reduction activities completed in 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the segment were $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to restructuring expenses of $1.2 million incurred in the third quarter of 2015. In addition, intangible asset amortization and salary and wage expenses were lower in the third quarter of 2016 by $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Non-Segment Interest expense decreased $0.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.  The reduction in interest expense was attributable to lower average borrowings and was partially offset by a non-recurring $0.2 million write-off of deferred financing cost related to the retirement of senior secured notes during the third quarter of 2016. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to an income tax expense of $0.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. The Company’s operating cash flow was $2.2 million lower in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the prior-year period. The Company’s operations provided cash of $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2016 and funded net capital expenditures of $3.7 million, resulting in negative free cash flow of $1.0 million. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company’s operations provided cash of $4.8 million and funded net capital expenditures of $3.6 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.3 million.

We feel this measure provides additional transparency to investors that augments but does not replace the GAAP reporting of net income and provides a good comparative measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined by GAAP and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure of net income. (2)  In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net gain of $3.3 million related to a legal settlement. The gain realized from the settlement offsets expenses of $1.9 million that were recorded as a favorable adjustment to EBITDA when incurred in prior quarters.  For consistency, the above table reflects only $1.9 million of the net gain as an unfavorable EBITDA adjustment. (3)  The Company believes Free Cash Flow is a measure of the operating cash flow of the Company that is useful to investors. Free Cash Flow is a measure of cash generated by the Company for such purposes as repaying debt or funding acquisitions. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance defined by GAAP and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure of cash provided by operating activities. Contact:

REUTERS/Felix Acevedo/U.S. Army/Handout via ReutersMore SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has agreed to buy new military helicopters from Airbus <AIR.PA> and Boeing Co <BA.N> to replace its aging fleet of Super Pumas and Chinooks, the city-state's defense ministry said on Monday. Singapore has the largest defense budget in Southeast Asia at a time when China's increasingly assertive actions in the disputed South China Sea spur regional nations to step up defense spending. The defense ministry would buy H225M medium-lift helicopters from Airbus and CH-47F heavy-lift helicopters from Boeing, it said. Its current fleet is more than 20 years old. "The H225M and CH-47F possess better lift and reach capabilities and will enable the RSAF (Republic of Singapore Air Force) to meet the Singapore Armed Forces's lift requirements more efficiently with fewer helicopters and less manpower," the ministry said. The statement did not give financial details or say how many helicopters were involved. Earlier this year, sources familiar with the matter had valued a potential deal at $1 billion. The decision on helicopters was initially delayed after the crash in April of a civilian Airbus Super Puma.

Andrew Quinn Email 20:42 21:50 Tuesday 08 November 2016 0 Have your say Hundreds of people originally from Derry will cast their vote in the US Presidential Election on Tuesday. This election has been described as one of the most gripping of modern times and although they might be relatively small in numbers, Derry people will have their say. We spoke to several people originally from Derry but who are now living in the USA. All of the people interviewed told us who they are voting for and why. PAULINE CURRAN, SAN FRANCISCO “I grew up in the Bogside and I am from a big family of eight. “My mum was widow at a young age and raised eight children on her own. I left home when I was 19 to get away from the Troubles and came to America while I was back packing around the world. “While I was in America they had a lottery for Irish for green cards,I applied and was lucky enough to have been chosen in the lottery - that was 27 years ago. “I live in San Francisco and I own my own business called ‘Shear Irish Hair Salon’. I married a guy from here and I love it here but wish I didn’t live so far away from family and Ireland. “I’m voting for Hillary Clinton because at least with Hillary we know what we are getting. Donald Trump seems to be a bully and treats women awful - also he keeps saying he is going to make America great again but doesn’t back it up with any plans on how he will do that. Trump scares me as he seems like a time bomb, also he seems like he doesn’t like emigrants which is what America is founded on. Pauline Curran pictured with her husband. “I talk to a lot of people in my shop on a daily business and most people I talked to are unhappy we don’t have better candidates to chose from. “Most people I talk to think it is a joke Donald Trump has made it this far, which make it scary for sane people.” STEPHEN BARBER, ARIZONA “I moved to the USA from the Waterside in Derry more than 20 years ago - I came here for the work. Barbara Hughes and her son Michael. “I have worked in construction all of my life and I have seen, first hand, how illegal immigration can impact on people who are here legally. “A lot of the Mexican workers who come over the border manage to get work because they are prepared to do the job for much less pay. “I have nothing against Mexicans - I just want to see someone get tough on illegal immigration and that’s why I will be voting for Donald Trump on Tuesday.” BARBARA HUGHES, SEATTLE “I grew up on Lawrence Hill in Derry - I left Derry in 1989 for England. “I arrived in Seattle in November 2004, the day before George W. Bush got elected for the second time, or didn’t get elected, depending on your view of events. Laura Leath. “My husband accepted a job with Boeing, and with our one year-old son we moved from Italy to the USA. We intended to stay for a year and 12 years later, we are still here. We received green cards in 2006, and when they were up for renewal this year, we decided it was time to apply for citizenship. “My inspiration for applying was sparked by a local issue - my inability to vote on a recent school bond. Our neighbourhood school was overcrowded and in disrepair, and my community proposed a tax levy to build a new facility. Frustratingly, nearly 18% of parents with children in our school district could not vote for the initiative because, like our family, they are here on H1B visas to work at Boeing, Google or Microsoft. We live here, pay taxes here, our kids are educated here and we rely on the health service and social infrastructure here. My husband and I decided that our family needs to have a voice in the decisions being made. “The fact that this is a presidential election year made applying for citizenship an even easier choice. “I am a Democrat. I have always been slightly left of centre, I believe in social and economic equality for all. I do not believe religion has a place in politics and as Whitney put it, I believe children are our future. Great education and health care are the foundation to a successful society. I believe we need to have more rigorous gun control in this country and that Global Warming needs to be addressed. I believe that we need Immigration reform and Tax loopholes need to be closed, so that huge corporations pay their share. “When I heard the news that Trump was the Republican nominee, I was incredulous. It must be some kind of reality show, a joke – to somehow make a point? This caricature of a man, with his childish outbursts, fake tan and confusing hair? Really? He is inexperienced, inarticulate, sexist, racist, short-tempered, a tax-evading inciter of violence and hatred. The image of him mocking the journalist with the congenital hand defect? That, alone, should have disqualified him from the running. The audio of him bragging about grabbing and kissing women? His repeated insults to women, immigrants, Mexicans, veterans... the list is endless. It seemed for a while there, that every morning I would wake up, read about his latest appalling act or speech, and the country’s level of acceptance would sink even lower. “I watched two of the debates at home with my sons. At 13 and nine, my boys are held to a higher expectation of behaviour than Trump was. His constant interruptions, his “nasty women” interjection, the inability to formulate a coherent sentence. It was horrifying. I work hard to instil strong values in my children. I have brought them up to be honest, I expect them to be respectful and compassionate. Watching the debates with them, I was struck that here was a candidate, vying to be President of America, potential leader of the Free World, demonstrating all the qualities I abhor in society today. Dishonesty, disrespect, a racist bully. What message was this giving my children? That this behaviour is acceptable? To be applauded? “Hillary is a Progressive. She has over thirty years’ experience, working in Public Service. She has a proven track record. She has been Secretary of State, a US Senator and the First Lady. She is a lifelong advocate for women and families. She is an advocate for Planned Parenthood, she is for Marriage Equality and she believes in Climate Change and has plans to address it. She will take on the Gun Lobby and fight for common sense reforms such as comprehensive background checks and closing loopholes. She will address the tax laws that allow huge corporations to pay less tax than the middle class taxpayers. She is passionate about education and will address the crippling student debt issues that face graduates. “Hillary has held her head high throughout the campaign and has never sunk to Trump’s level. She is inspirational and unstoppable. She is a force to be reckoned with. She is a wife, mother and grandmother. She is invested in the future of this country and this planet. She has faced everything that has been thrown at her, with patience, resilience and grace. She is more than qualified to be President. This quote sums up her philosophy - ‘because we should do all the good we can, for all the people we can, for as long as we can.’ “I could end by saying I am #withher as a feminist, or because I want my sons to see that women can do whatever they put their mind to, or because she is so much better than the other option. But in all honesty I am #withher because she is an inspiration, she is immensely qualified to lead this country and to vote for any other option would be a disservice to the country and to the democracy that we are privileged to enjoy. She is not the better choice, she is the only choice.” LAURA LEATH, CALIFORNIA “I grew up in Kilfennan and went to Oakgrove Primary and Secondary. I live and work in Bakersfield, California, about 100 miles north of L.A. I am a Public Defender, which means I represent people who are charged with crimes and who can’t afford to retain an attorney. “I work with some of the most vulnerable people in society – people who are homeless, people who have mental health problems, people who have issues with addiction - and I see the effect that national and local political decisions have on their lives and on the lives of their children. I will be proudly voting for Hillary on Tuesday. “Donald Trump is not just the worst presidential candidate of the 2016 election, he is the worst presidential candidate of my lifetime. He insults women, people with disabilities, LGBT people, immigrants, Muslims, basically anyone who isn’t a straight white male. He’s an immoral bully. He talks openly about his admiration for dictators, boasts about short changing small businesses, encourages espionage against opponents, incites public violence and is still talking about building that stupid wall. “I’m not just voting for Hillary because I’m scared of the horror show that would be a Trump Presidency. I’m voting for her because as Barack Obama correctly stated: there has never been a man or a woman more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America. “I want a president who’s spent her life in public service, who does her homework, who’s been battling for everyone’s right to health care since I was in primary school, who isn’t afraid to support women’s autonomy over their own bodies, and who supports equality – race, gender and sexuality. I want a president who has read, understands and respects the constitution. “Hillary is committed to public service and committed to making life better for all American citizens. Her policies will make America a better place – for me and the people I represent.” MARTIN NELIS, SAN FRANCISCO “My family used to live in Westland Avenue in the Bogside and all of them are still living in Derry or surrounding area, except me, of course. My mother is Mary Nelis who is quite well known in Derry. I’ve been in the San Francisco Bay Area region of California for the most part since 1990 when I married an American. I have three children aged 22, 19 and 17 (Aidan, Fiona and Deirdre respectively). “I live and work in a city called Pleasant Hill, population 34,000, which is a suburb in the East Bay of San Francisco. I am the Public Information Officer for the City of Pleasant Hill. “The election - where do you start? I have already voted for Hillary Clinton as an absentee (mail in) voter, as many people do here. In the primary elections, I was a strong supporter of Bernie Sanders whose views and policies I most closely identify with. “There is a clear choice in this election. Trump represents the politics of hate, fear and division. His actions and statements are that of a fascist, albeit a dumbed down one, and there many other adjectives you could use to describe him. “While I have strong reservations about Clinton’s foreign policies, specifically her pandering to Israel and propensity to support the bloated military budget, there is no other real choice in this election. US voters need to reject Trump loudly and clearly and Clinton needs a mandate of sorts in order to fend off anticipated republican obstructionism should she be elected. “The US Supreme Court wields enormous power and its decisions affect the daily lives of millions of Americans. If, for no other reason than to have the right nominations to this body, the choice for President is critical. It doesn’t bear thinking about the consequences of a Trump victory - many of us are literally petrified of the thought of it. “The sad part of this election is that it has revealed the ignorance and racism of a large section of the American public, the vast majority of whom will be voting for Trump. The US Republican party has created a monster and it’s out of control. I have no idea what is going to happen after this election but hopefully sane heads will prevail. We shall see.” Martin Nelis.

Partnership deals in limbo November 8, 2016 Mayibongwe Madlela Business Oliver Kazunga, Senior Business Reporter NEGOTIATIONS with three of the 12 potential partners that the Government had identified to revive Air Zimbabwe have not yielded the desired results, a Cabinet Minister has said. The ailing national airline has a huge debt overhang amounting to about $300 million, which the Government pledged to takeover once a strategic partner had been identified. Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo told Business Chronicle on the sidelines of the just ended Parliamentary 2017 pre-national budget seminar in Bulawayo that the Government was still searching for a potential partner to get the best deal. “We have made an announcement that the Government is looking for a strategic partner for Air Zimbabwe. The process is going on and we have not found one. And when looking for a partner, you do not just pick somebody because they are beautiful. But you have to consider what am I partnering, what is it that they will offer me and what is it that I am going to offer,” he said. Dr Gumbo said the Government through his ministry has approached airlines in Singapore, Malaysia and Ethiopia. Asked why the process to secure a strategic partner was seemingly taking too long, he said: “Because we are not agreeing on terms. We are negotiating with whoever, you cannot just go and say I want a partner. Somebody will say for example, I want to look at your books, routes and the equipment that you have got and so forth. “So, we are still negotiating and there is no timetable in concluding the discussions. And if there was no hope for securing a partner, I would not be discussing and I must continue until I am exhausted.” He said a number of airlines on the continent and internationally were not performing well. Among the 12 partners that the Government has identified as potential suitors for Air Zimbabwe are Angolan Airlines, Boeing, Emirates and Airbus. Airbus is a division of France-based multinational Airbus Group SE that manufactures civil aircraft while Boeing is an American corporation that designs, manufactures and sells aeroplanes, rotorcraft and rockets across the globe. It also provides leasing and product support services. Meanwhile, Air Zimbabwe needs about $1.7 million to pay for the servicing of its two A320 airbuses that were taken to South Africa for maintenance in 2014. The two airbuses were taken to South Africa for C-Checks, a comprehensive overhaul done on an aircraft after a certain amount of time or usage. One of the two airbuses that was paid for is plying the Harare – Dar es Salaam route, which the flag carrier launched in June this year. Dr Gumbo said at the moment the Government was financially hamstrung to pay for airbus’ C-checks. The struggling airline’s current fleet includes Boeing 737-200 (Advanced), Boeing 767-200 ER and Airbus A320-200. “At the moment, we are failing to pay for the C-Checks that were done on that airbus. We do not have the money to pay for it,” he said in an interview. Speaking by telephone from Harare yesterday, the chairman of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructural Development, Mr Dexter Nduna, who is also Chegutu West legislator, said servicing of the airbus in South Africa had been completed. “Servicing of Air Zimbabwe’s airbus that is still in South Africa has been done. For as long as we do not pay for the servicing, the airbus will remain grounded there (South Africa),” he said. Air Zimbabwe is faced with operational challenges from a number of factors that include high operational costs, low load factors and a huge debt overhang. According to the Portfolio Committee’s report presented in Parliament recently, Air Zimbabwe was losing $3 million a month and is technically insolvent. The report indicates that the airline was generating an estimated revenue of $2,65 million a month against an operational expenditure of $5,94 million. The Government has also announced plans to takeover Air Zimbabwe’s debt once a strategic partner is found. @okazunga Tweet Pin It Related Posts Blanket Mine Q3 gold output up 23pc...

The partnership story has taken 3-4years and surely we are still hoping for a partner. I think a message has been sent by the investors. The solutions should come from within.

The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Aerospace about helping to finance the purchase. "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. ATR had no immediate comment. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on nuclear activities. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving U.S. export licenses because of the number of U.S. components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has U.S. licenses for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic's 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalize the U.S. company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the U.S. government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further U.S. approval. EYES ON ELECTIONS The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticized the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalize contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. Rouhani, who is seen in Iran as a pragmatist, has been harshly criticized by hardline rivals over the deals aimed at renewing Iran's aging air fleet. "Rouhani wants to secure his second-term election ... Planes are not top of the list of what the country needs," said a hardline lawmaker, who asked not to be identified. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving U.S. approvals, meaning the Airbus order - if completed - would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.

Iran says it expects to finalize the much-awaited plane purchase deals with global aviation giants Boeing and Airbus in the near future. Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi told the domestic media that the representatives of the two companies are making frequent visits to Tehran to put the last touches on the texts of the deals. “Iran is trying to secure the maximum the transfer of technical expertise in the texts of the deals and this in the aviation industry concerns a certain percentage of maintenance operations or even the production of certain parts,” Akhoundi was quoted by IRNA as telling the reporters. He added that Iran specifically would try to include the required mechanisms in the contracts to provide maintenance services for plane engines.  Meanwhile, Reuters quoted informed sources as saying that Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from the French aviation enterprise Airbus.    The news agency said the lessor involved could be the UAE’s Dubai Aerospace by referring to earlier statements made to the same effect by Iranian officials.    "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating.

But lower oil prices are actually starting to hurt Boeing By Ian Bezek, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Feb 2, 2016, 6:59 am EST     View All   Popular Posts: What Tesla Motors Inc’s (TSLA) Grohmann Purchase Tells Us The 5 Biggest Risks to Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA) Stock Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons Recent Posts: 3 Mexican Stocks to Buy, 1 to Sell in Trump’s World Should You Buy Twilio Inc (TWLO) Stock? 3 Pros, 3 Cons What Tesla Motors Inc’s (TSLA) Grohmann Purchase Tells Us View All Posts Boeing Co (BA), along with Airbus, continues to control the international passenger jet market. Duopolies make for great businesses, and Boeing is no exception. It has a fantastic brand, excellent new fuel-saving designs, and is riding a long wave of emerging market demand for its product as international passenger travel soars. And a Happy Birthday is in order, Boeing turns 100 this year. But the past year has been difficult for BA stock. The strong US dollar has more and more airline customers turning to comparatively cheaper Airbus planes. Following earnings last week, the BA stock price got clipped, falling to new 52-week lows. Is it time to buy or sell Boeing shares? Here’s three pros and three cons. BA Stock Pros International Air Travel Continues To Boom: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that air travel will double between now and 2034. This amounts to a 3.8% compound annual growth rate, well above international GDP growth or international population growth. There are currently around 3.5 billion air travelers per year, this should reach 7 billion over the next 15-18 years. That’s good news for Boeing stock over the long-term. The fastest growth will come in areas that are less well-serviced by air transportation now. Namely, Africa, parts of Asia such as India, and South America. This should offer substantial opportunities for Boeing to find new markets. Boeing Has A Strong Defense Arm: BA is more than just a commercial company. It also has a large defense arm making a diverse range of products for the US and other militaries. Among them, the Apache helicopter, the B-52 bomber, the Chinook helicopter, the F-18 Super Hornet, and various weapons. It also just secured a new contract for the renewing of the Air Force One presidential aircraft unit. While this isn’t a big dollar contract, it’s hard to imagine a more prestigious contract win than the President’s mobile office. Also of note, the potential election of a Republican in 2016 could free up more money for the Defense Department. All positives for the BA stock price. High Dividend Yield: There’s more to a company than just making great products. Potential shareholders have to ask if the company is treating them well. In Boeing’s case, the answer is a clear yes. BA stock currently pays a 3.6% yield, which is very high among Dow Jones index companies. The company has quadrupled the dividend over the past 11 years, and just gave BA stock holders another 20% raise in 2015. With trailing earnings of $7.44/share, they can still cover the $4.36/share dividend with plenty of room to spare.

Close share panel Image copyright BA British Airways plans to add extra seats into each economy class row on some aircraft. The plan could increase the number of seats on its Boeing 777 aircraft by almost 20%, from 280 to 332. Each row would have 10 seats rather than the current nine. BA said: "We are flying more customers than ever before... To meet this demand, we are updating our (Boeing) 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors." It said it would also be upgrading its in-flight entertainment systems with bigger screens. There are also reports that BA intends to add a dozen extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 aircraft, based at Heathrow. The latest figures from BA's parent, IAG, showed operating profits in the July to September quarter fell 4% to €1.2bn. It said the weak pound had cost it €162m (£145m) in the third quarter of the year. The airline said it expects operating profits for the full year to be up by about 7%, a lower rate than the one it forecast in July. Its lower profits guidance followed similar moves from rivals Easyjet and Ryanair.

(David Ryder/Bloomberg) Published November 07. 2016 11:51AM  Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg John Rothery said his goodbyes, handed in his badge and walked away from Boeing. He had worked on almost every commercial jet model over four decades, from a 707 bristling with military radar in the late 1970s to today's sleek 787 Dreamliner. The date, Oct. 3, had been circled on Rothery's calendar for more than a year. It was the last time that Boeing would bump up pension pay for Seattle-area factory workers before it froze the plan at month's end, provisions dictated by a deeply unpopular 2014 contract extension. For Rothery, it was the final straw. "I'll be 64 in November. After 37 years, that's enough," said Rothery, a tool-and-die maker. "I was working just to build a pension. As of Oct. 31, there's no pension. Why stay?" The benefit change could hasten a generational shift as Boeing's baby boomers retire, a trend that's also looming for other U.S. manufacturers. The planemaker's most experienced workers are packing up their tools during critical upgrades of its two largest profit-drivers: the 737 and 777 jetliners. About 10,000 mechanics are eligible to retire from the company's Puget Sound manufacturing base alone, and no one knows how many are poised to leave. "It's a conversation that anyone who is close to retirement is having," said Becky Beasley, 75, a grandmother and body-structures mechanic who helps rivet together hulking aluminum panels to form the 777's hull. Boeing is well aware of the risks: Shortages of skilled workers from a smaller, mid-1990s exodus contributed to a factory meltdown that halted production of its cash cow, the 737. So earlier this year, the manufacturer carefully structured a voluntary layoff aimed at retirement-age workers, staggering the departures of 1,057 machinists to avoid massive disruptions. "We had that very much in mind," said Joelle Denney, vice president for human resources at Boeing's commercial airplane division, of the 1995 tumult. As the date approached when pension benefits would stop accruing, workers had been leaving in a steady stream. "We're not expecting a big bubble or wave," Denney said. While Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton argue over the impact of international trade on factory jobs, U.S. manufacturers are grappling with a looming shortage of skilled workers. Almost 3.5 million manufacturing positions will need to be filled over the next decade as baby boomers retire, and 2 million of those jobs could remain vacant because of manufacturing's fading appeal to millennials, according to a 2015 study by Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute. The dilemma could be especially acute for Boeing, where about 35 percent of the 29,645 machinists in the company's Seattle industrial hub are 55 or older. By contrast, only 23 percent of the 15.3 million Americans working in manufacturing are in that age group, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For the long haul, the planemaker is investing in education -- from vocational training to programs at middle schools -- to try to make manufacturing "cool" to a generation that has never known shop class, Denney said. In the short term, Boeing is stepping up training and mentoring programs within its factories, she said. Some question whether the company is doing enough. "I do think that if people decide to leave en masse, that they cannot replace that workforce," said Jon Holden, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, District 751. "There's not enough in the pipeline to replace them." Memories are still vivid of the cascading production issues two decades ago after Boeing offered a one-time retirement incentive with few restrictions. More than 3,700 mechanics, engineers and technical workers cashed out in June and July 1995 alone, creating immediate shortages in some positions. Many later were rehired as contractors as Boeing's factories struggled to keep pace with a sales spurt. The shortfall contributed to production meltdowns in 1997 that forced the manufacturer to temporarily halt its 747 and 737 assembly lines to catch up. The cost to Boeing: a $1.6 billion pretax accounting loss. This year, Boeing closely managed who participated in the voluntary layoff offer, methodically planning for their replacement and charting when they left the company, Denney said. The measure targeted employees and managers on the cusp of retirement by offering as many as 26 weeks of pay and accelerated retirement benefits. Boeing is trying to make its operations more efficient as it trims spending and automates more production amid cut-throat competition for slowing aircraft sales. The company has eliminated 4,853 jobs in the state of Washington since the end of January, a 6.2 percent reduction. But while Boeing can control who leaves through the voluntary layoff, anyone can retire. That raises a risk of critical shortages of skilled tradesman with an intuitive feel for fabricating and assembling airplanes -- among the most complicated machines on the planet. "The tricky aspect for the executives is not to lose too many skilled positions too quickly," said Leon Grunberg, a sociologist and co-author of "Emerging from Turbulence: Boeing and the American Workplace Today." "Can Boeing minimize the risk of losing the tribal knowledge?" Those leaving now will receive monthly pension payments of $95 for each year of employment. That amounts to about $34,200 annually for a 30-year Boeing veteran. While that covers basic necessities, retirees will also need savings to maintain their lifestyles, another factor that makes it difficult to predict near-term attrition. Beasley, the body-structures mechanic, doesn't have a sufficiently large nest egg after 18 years at Boeing. She's also putting a grandson through law school. "I'm a little concerned about my financial stability when I leave," she said. "Social Security would barely cover the house payments." Rothery, the newly retired tool-and-die maker, is looking forward to golf, soccer and road trips in a motor home after wrapping up his career at Boeing's Frederickson, Washington, plant. His future is secure: 401(k) plan accounts of $750,000 or more aren't unusual for career workers who saved carefully, Rothery said. He takes satisfaction from training his successor to step in seamlessly, but frets that his transition may be the exception. "It's the vast amount of experience that's leaving," Rothery said. "They will work around it. They'll still accomplish the task at hand. At what expense, it's hard to say."     Next Article Loading comment count... Commenting is closed.

November 16, 2016 1215 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:171705 Publish Date: Mon, 07 Nov 2016 18:49:31 GMT Service: Iran Iran's Airbus jet purchase gets boost from lease finance deal Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus, breaking a logjam in efforts to import aircraft following the lifting of sanctions, people familiar with the move said. The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles, Reuters reported. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Aerospace on helping to finance the purchase. "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for modification on nuclear program. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving US export licenses because of the number of US components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has US licenses for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalize the US company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: A transaction that could also involve third parties. A Boeing Middle East spokesman Fakher Daghestani said it had been allowed by the US government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would require further US approval. The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of sanctions. However, negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalize contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving US approvals, meaning the Airbus order — if completed — would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.     KeyWords Airbus IranDaily finance   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Iran confiscates 2 tonnes of explosives from Daesh terrorists Iran, China must boost cooperation in fight on terrorism: Rouhani Syria holds pacesetter Iran in wetland Everton joins race for Iran’s Azmoun Iran defeated by Kazakhstan in Asian water polo championship Iran, absent from kabaddi World Cup final Iranian teams capture Asian youth, junior weightlifting titles French MP: Iran’s role in fight against terrorism crucial Iran: Killing of Muslims in Nigeria worrisome Rouhani: Iran, China must boost anti-terror fight Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton Trump looking at 'quick ways' to ditch Paris climate accord: Report www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/0699 sec

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech COLUMBIA, Md. — An ongoing investigation into a thruster problem on NASA's Juno spacecraft orbiting Jupiter is looking into a possible connection with a malfunction of a similar thruster on a recently launched Intelsat satellite. Speaking Nov. 1 at the Lunar Exploration Analysis Group (LEAG) meeting here, James Green, head of NASA's planetary science division, said spacecraft engineers are taking a "very slow" approach into studying the problem before rescheduling a maneuver to lower the spacecraft into its final science orbit. That maneuver was scheduled for Oct. 19, when the spacecraft made its latest close approach to Jupiter in its current 53-day elliptical orbit. However, five days earlier NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced it was postponing the maneuver after a pair of helium valves on the spacecraft opened more slowly than expected. Green said one part of the investigation is studying any connection to a similar malfunctioning thruster. "It was made known to us that the rocket we currently have on Juno, the retrorocket that gets us into orbit, is in the same family as one that has been malfunctioning on the Intelsats," he said. [Photos: NASA's Juno Mission to Jupiter] He was referring to Intelsat 33e, a Boeing 702MP satellite launched in August. On Sept. 9, Intelsat announced that the spacecraft's entry into service in geostationary orbit would be delayed from fourth quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017 because of a thruster malfunction. That model of satellite uses a Leros engine, manufactured by Moog, to raise its orbit after deployment. While Juno uses a different version of the Leros engine than the one on Intelsat 33e, and launched five years earlier, Green said engineers were investigating whether there may be any links between the two. "Whenever that happens, we step back and take a good look at what we have, how it's implemented, look at the failure modes for these similar things," he said, "and then do an analysis on what we're going to do next and what the probability is of what we have on our spacecraft failing." Green didn't give a schedule for performing that review, but indicated NASA was not in a hurry. "We're going very slow in that process," he said. "We're going to take another cycle around Jupiter and really study what's happening before we make a decision on what to do next." Neither Intelsat nor Boeing has disclosed details about the thruster malfunction that Intelsat 33e suffered. Boeing spokeswoman Joanna Climer said Nov. 1 that the company had no additional details to share about the thruster problem. Likewise, JPL has released no additional details about the problem noticed with Juno's engine in October, when valves that should have opened in seconds instead took several minutes. "We need to better understand this issue before moving forward with a burn of the main engine," Juno project manager Rick Nybakken said in an Oct. 14 statement that said the maneuver would delayed at least one orbit, to Dec. 11. JPL spokesman D.C. Agle said Nov. 2 there were no updates on the Juno thruster investigation. He added, though, that the Dec. 11 close approach will be a "science pass," with no plans to fire the engine. NASA attempted to collect science data during the Oct. 19 flyby as well. However, an unrelated problem put the spacecraft into a protective safe mode more than 13 hours before closest approach. The spacecraft resumed normal operations Oct. 24. Green noted that Juno can still carry out its mission in its current orbit, since the bulk of the data it collects is during the close approaches to the planet. The maneuver, though, would reduce the spacecraft's period from 53 to 14 days, giving it more flybys and opportunities to gather more data in a given period of time. "We want to really take a good look at it and get it down into its lower orbit if at all possible," he said, "if we feel like that's a risk we can take with the system that we have onboard."

British Airways proposes extra seat in economy class rows Evening Standard 07/11/2016 Mark Chandler British Airways is proposing to add an extra seat into each economy class row on some of its aircraft. The plan could increase the number of seats on its London Gatwick-based Boeing 777 aircraft by almost a fifth, from 280 to 332. Each row would have 10 seats rather than the current configuration of nine. A BA spokeswoman said: "We are flying more customers than ever before to our expanding network of destinations. "To meet this demand, we are updating our (Boeing) 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors and allow us to offer even more low fares. "As part of the update, we will also be fitting new entertainment systems with bigger screens." © Provided by Evening Standard Limited According to The Independent, Willie Walsh, the chief executive of BA's parent company, IAG, told investors that the airline was "responding to a market opportunity".

News Transport British Airways proposes extra seat in economy class rows Mark Chandler Monday 7 November 2016 13:18 BST British Airways: An extra seat could be added to each row in economy class Steve Parsons/PA Wire British Airways is proposing to add an extra seat into each economy class row on some of its aircraft. The plan could increase the number of seats on its London Gatwick-based Boeing 777 aircraft by almost a fifth, from 280 to 332. Each row would have 10 seats rather than the current configuration of nine. A BA spokeswoman said: "We are flying more customers than ever before to our expanding network of destinations. "To meet this demand, we are updating our (Boeing) 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors and allow us to offer even more low fares.

The online newspaper reported that BA also intends to add a dozen extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 aircraft based at Heathrow, matching easyJet's fleet.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 8:10 PM, November 7, 2016 SINGAPORE/ANKARA - Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus <AIR.PA>, breaking a logjam in efforts to import aircraft following the lifting of sanctions, people familiar with the move said. The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Aerospace about helping to finance the purchase. "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. ATR had no immediate comment. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on nuclear activities. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving U.S. export licenses because of the number of U.S. components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has U.S. licenses for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic's 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing <BA.N> to finalize the U.S. company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the U.S. government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further U.S. approval. EYES ON ELECTIONS The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticized the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalize contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. Rouhani, who is seen in Iran as a pragmatist, has been harshly criticized by hardline rivals over the deals aimed at renewing Iran's aging air fleet. "Rouhani wants to secure his second-term election ... Planes are not top of the list of what the country needs," said a hardline lawmaker, who asked not to be identified. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving U.S. approvals, meaning the Airbus order - if completed - would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.

Because of its new, more fuel-efficient LEAP-1B engines, the BBJ MAX 7 has reduced fuel burn and emissions and requires less cargo volume be reserved for auxiliary fuel tanks, regardless of mission length. “We are thrilled to introduce the BBJ MAX 7 to the market,” said David Longridge, president, Boeing Business Jets. “We know customers are going to love this airplane. In terms of range, cabin space, cargo volume and operating economics, the BBJ MAX 7 cannot be beat.” The BBJ MAX 7 inherits all of the features of the already launched BBJ MAX 8 and BBJ MAX 9, including an updated flight deck, improved aerodynamics, reduced noise profile, and fly-by-wire spoilers.  Despite being larger and more capable than the current BBJ, the new MAX 7 has the lowest operating costs of any Boeing Business Jets aircraft. “We are in active discussions with more than ten customers for the BBJ MAX 7 and we are just getting started,” said Longridge. “We are very confident that the BBJ MAX 7 will be a very successful business jet and we are excited to introduce the airplane to our customers.” See other recent news regarding: BBJ, Boeing, Jets.

The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the United Arab Emirates' Dubai Aerospace about helping to finance the purchase. "We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft," a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran's order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country's flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. ATR had no immediate comment. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on nuclear activities. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving U.S. export licences because of the number of U.S. components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has U.S. licences for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The U.S. financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic's 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalise the U.S. company's deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the U.S. government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further U.S. approval. EYES ON ELECTIONS The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for Western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many Western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday's U.S. presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticised the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalise contracts before the end of Iran's fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran's own presidential elections in May. "We have deadlines to meet," the Iranian official said. Rouhani, who is seen in Iran as a pragmatist, has been harshly criticised by hardline rivals over the deals aimed at renewing Iran's ageing air fleet. "Rouhani wants to secure his second-term election ... Planes are not top of the list of what the country needs," said a hardline lawmaker, who asked not to be identified. A second senior Iranian government official said at least 20 Western airplanes would be added to Iran's fleet by March 2017, followed by another 25 over the following four months. "Our main priority is our nation's safety," the official said in reference to Iran's old fleet and patchy safety record. "That's why the government is purchasing new planes." Iran agreed in January to buy 118 Airbus jets, including 12 A380s, the world's largest jetliner. The A380 part of the deal has already been thrown into doubt after Tehran conservatives objected that most Iranians would not benefit from the long-distance jet. The A380s are only options, one Iranian official said. Around six smaller jets that were originally meant to be delivered this year have also been discarded due to the delays in receiving U.S. approvals, meaning the Airbus order - if completed - would involve no more than 100 jets, the sources said.

The airline giant is reportedly trying bring its services "into line" with competitors at Gatwick from 2018. It also plans to “densify” aircraft at Heathrow after that, it is said. Currently passengers will find nine economy seats in each row in the 777s. A British Airways Boeing 777 takes off from Gatwick Airport in West Sussex Credit: Gareth Fuller/PA Wire But from 2018, there will reportedly be 10 seats fitted within the same space. The move would increase the population on board flights by up to a fifth and stretch current facilities further. The number of toilets is currently 11, allowing for one for every 25 passengers. The latest move will bring that up to one for every 30 passengers, The Independent claimed. However, BA says the economy cabin will be fitted with new entertainment systems with bigger screens.

He said the move would allow BA to “lower the average cost per seat, charge a lower price and stimulate demand”. A British Airways spokesman said: "We are flying more customers than ever before to our expanding network of destinations. "To meet this demand, we are updating our 777 cabins to bring us into line with many of our competitors and allow us to offer even more low fares. BA announces at IAG Capital Markets Day it is to introduce business class on U.K. domestic routes & increase seat density in World Traveller pic.twitter.com/slcyvC0ITH— LondonAirTravel (@LondonAirTravel) November 4, 2016 "As part of the update, we will also be fitting new entertainment systems with bigger screens. "British Airways continues to offer customers a generous hand baggage allowance and complimentary food and drink on all our long-haul services." Among the other airlines with a 10-abreast configuration are Air New Zealand, Emirates and Air France. British Airways will also reportedly add 12 extra seats on its short-haul Airbus A320 from Heathrow -which will increase the planes seating density to match easyJet's. The move come after BA increased its seat width from 16.8ins to 17.3 ins on its new Dreamliner fleet last year. The move followed complaints from travellers, with at least one claiming they did not have enough room to open the cutlery pack with their meal. However, the firm still hasn't caught up with some of its rivals. EasyJet’s A320 airbus and Thomson’s Boeing 767-300ER also offer 18-inch wide seats and even no-frills Ryanair gives wriggle space of 17 inches on its 737-800 aircraft.

Hot Topics: City Council Opening Justice Sought for Dead Child Kirk Cameron Event Premature Babies Disc Golf Course Mannheim Steamroller CSU Football RH Line Police Calls Corporate citizenship in Colorado means giving back By Anna Zawisza Guest Columnist Posted:   11/06/2016 10:57:02 PM MST In 2015, Denver led Forbes' List of The Best Places for Business and Careers. The Front Range is appealing for its diverse economy, highly educated workforce, amazing scenery and outdoor recreational opportunities. Companies like Panasonic Enterprise Solutions, a new technology and solar energy division of Panasonic North America, Google, and many others are increasingly selecting Denver and the Front Range as locations for their operations and workforce. These trends are expected to continue. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper's January State of the State Address focused on Colorado being perfectly positioned as a national leader in attracting new innovative businesses, a state with impressive public and private economic and natural resource assets. Colorado's tourism economy is among the nation's strongest, with visitors annually spending billions of dollars in our state. And, the governor's new Outdoor Recreation Industry Office will help communities across the state grow their recreation businesses, benefiting residents and tourists alike. Doing business in Colorado comes with significant advantages. Top among these is the high quality of life for workers and their families with Colorado's world-class outdoor recreation amenities located right in our backyard. Part of doing business in our state ought to include ensuring that this quality of life remains sustainable into the future. Advertisement That's where the statewide nonprofit Volunteers for Outdoor Colorado (VOC) plays a vital role. VOC offers individuals and businesses an opportunity to work — hands on — in caring for Colorado's outdoor recreational resources and wild places, enabling our valuable cultural and natural heritage to be preserved. Since 1984, VOC has engaged more than 105,000 people of all ages and backgrounds in caring for Colorado. VOC volunteers have built and maintained hundreds of miles of our state's most popular trails, improved plant and wildlife habitats, planted trees and gardens in parks and open spaces, and restored fire- and flood-damaged lands across the state. Yet individual volunteers are only part of VOC's story. VOC offers businesses tangible and impactful ways to channel charitable community investments and engage their employees in work that benefits our state - especially in outdoor places where they recreate. Boeing — celebrating its 100th anniversary this year — is a perfect example of a company doing business in Colorado that also believes in giving back where its employees live. Boeing employs nearly 2,000 people in Colorado with another 2,500 who have retired here. Beyond its own direct operations, the company spends nearly $500 million, contracting with Colorado-based vendors who supply everything from Boeing's aircraft circuits to International Space Station batteries. For nearly two decades Boeing has partnered with VOC, providing financial support and a commitment of its employees' time on direct outdoor stewardship. This year, for example, Boeing Employees helped to build a portion of the Front Range Trail in Douglas County, contributing 200 hours of donated labor, equating to over $4,600. As the company commemorates its centennial and looks ahead to its next successful century, its experience in Colorado is setting the bar for others to follow, serving as a leader in underscoring the importance of environmental responsibility within its own operations and in the outdoor places where its employees live, work and play. There's no dispute. The future of Colorado depends on a strong business and recreational economy. And, our state's stellar outdoor recreational resources will need all of us to ensure their long-term stewardship and care. It should go without saying that doing business in Colorado means giving back to ensure our hiking and running trails, our urban and mountain parks and picnic areas, and our prairies and open spaces, remain viable places for Colorado workers and their families to recreate and enjoy. Doing business in Colorado? A new resident to Colorado? Take a lesson from Boeing and its partnership with VOC and consider ways in which you and your company can give back to our state to ensure it remains as naturally beautiful tomorrow as you see and experience it today. Welcome to Colorado - now let's all get to work!

THE DEAN TEAM Dean Enterprises is a septic and portable restroom business operating out of a 3 1/2-acre facility in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. The company is owned by Richard and Peggy Dean, and managed by their four sons — general manager Tony, heavy equipment operator Tom, mechanic Brad and personnel manager Mike. It’s split up into three divisions — septic, route work and events. The AirVenture project was managed by their event division, Pit-Stop Event Services, but other than route drivers everyone in the company was involved, including five event technicians to handle portable restrooms, four septic drivers to pump holding tanks, office workers Bethany Warner and Alex Bloch to schedule RV pumping, and six part-timers to clean and stock restroom and shower trailers. Peggy served as lead for the project. They also appealed to family and friends. “We call in any favors we can get,” Tony Dean says. His grandfather Frank Hope helped. “And two of our farmer buddies took off for a week and worked.” Related: Riding Shotgun with Gretchen Menard - Episode 1 COMPANY HISTORY The company began as a septic business in 1995 when Richard bought out the contractor he had been working for. When a customer encouraged him to add portable restrooms, he bought six to give it a try. He slowly increased his inventory as further requests came in and by 1998 portable restrooms became a substantial part of the business when he picked up 600 units in an acquisition. After two more acquisitions and steady organic growth, the company’s inventory now stands at 6,000-plus units, 75 percent PolyJohn Enterprises PJN3s, the remainder Satellite Industries Tufways. They also have 18 Ameri‑Can restroom trailers (16-foot to 40-foot) and 15 Ameri‑Can shower trailers (six-stall to 22-stall). Their service territory covers a 90-mile radius. MAKING CONNECTIONS 2016 was the second year the company handled the AirVenture event, although they had helped the previous contractor on parts of it for a couple years. Changes at the previous contractor led to the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) putting the project out to bid in 2015. There were a lot of bidders, Dean says, but he believes they won it because of their familiarity with it and because they were one of a very few companies who had the resources to handle all the liquid waste for the event. Related: Riding Shotgun with Gretchen Menard - Episode 2 THE MAIN EVENT Mass arrivals of aircraft began on July 23, 2016, for the 64th annual EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, an annual week-long recreational aviation event that brought in over 500,000 visitors from 80 countries, 10,000 aircraft of every vintage, 860 exhibitors, 950 media personnel and 4,000 volunteers. The Wittman Regional Airport control tower boasts a sign declaring it the busiest tower in the world during that week. The airport and surrounding area became something of a small town, complete with stores, shuttle service, a daily newspaper, and “neighborhoods” where each aircraft type had their own area. Aviators typically camped next to their planes, while other visitors stayed in on-site campgrounds and hotels. Events included day and night air shows, over 1,000 educational programs and workshops, a KidVenture zone, and concerts. Highlights in 2016 featured Desert Storm 25th and Pearl Harbor 75th commemorations, the Canadian Snowbirds, a World War I aviation celebration and Boeing’s 100th anniversary. Actor Harrison Ford flew a plane carrying the 2 millionth member of Young Eagles, a children’s education program. BY THE NUMBERS To supplement on-site facilities the company brought in 1,000 PolyJohn PJN3s (dark gray with bright lime-green corners and vents) and 75 Satellite wheelchair-accessible units, all with hand sanitizer. They ordered all-new units for this event, with shipments coming in throughout May and June. Four groups of 20 units were placed in high-traffic areas, the rest in small groups of four or less throughout the facility, mostly in the campgrounds. “We placed a restroom every 75 to 100 yards,” Dean says. “If you could throw a stone you could probably hit one.” Related: Riding Shotgun with Gretchen Menard - Episode 3 The company also provided 16 restroom trailers for vendor hospitality tents and high-traffic areas, 15 shower trailers in seven camper locations and 35 325-gallon Kentucky Tank holding tanks for numerous food courts and cooking facilities. LET’S ROLL At the end of May the company dropped off 100 units for volunteers. Then, using vacuum trucks and 20-unit transport trailers built by Emerich Manufacturing, they made a couple deliveries a week — usually on Wednesdays, their slowest day — with a big final push at the beginning of June. Then it took about a month to set everything in place. Holding tanks were brought in a few days before the event, as were shower and restroom trailers, which were transported using two 2012 Ford F‑450 duallys and a 2005 International Eagle semi tractor.

The crew gathered there in the morning to pick up daily job assignments and later cycled back to eat lunch and dinner catered by a local company. Communications to the team were done using BayComm two-way radios. With a massive effort at the end, everything was removed in four days. KEEPIN’ IT CLEAN Service was done with eight 2007-2014 Ford F-550s with 800-gallon waste/300-gallon freshwater tanks, one (aluminum) built out by Progress Tank, the others (stainless steel) by Best Industries; a 2005 Ford F‑750 with a 1,850-gallon waste/300-gallon freshwater steel tank; a 2006 Ford F‑750 with a 2,000-gallon waste/500-gallon freshwater stainless steel tank built out by Best; and their four 6,000-gallon septic trucks (1998 and 1999 Macks, a 2003 Volvo and a 2009 Peterbilt). Waste was off-loaded to the larger vehicles for daily disposal at the Oshkosh water treatment plant. Subscribe: Save the trees for beavers, sign up for our E-Newsletter! Working two to a truck, all units were cleaned twice a day — 4:30 to 11:30 a.m. and again at 1 p.m. When they finished, the team headed off to pump RVs, working from schedules prepared by Warner and Bloch, who manned a booth where RV owners could sign up for service. Typical workdays were 16 to 18 hours, Dean says. Shower and restroom attendants, using four 2010 Club Car golf carts and two side-by-side utility vehicles (a 2014 Kawasaki Mule and a 2014 Polaris Ranger), worked from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m stocking and cleaning. Paper supplies and deodorant products (Satellite’s Safe‑T‑Fresh) were stored in a 2005 53-foot drop-deck semi trailer. Meanwhile, the septic guys, working one to a truck, spent the days — and again late at night — pumping company-provided holding tanks, the on-site underground tanks (ranging in size from 2,000 to 15,000 gallons) and shower trailers. Despite the crowds, Dean says navigating was not a problem. “As far as big events go it’s pretty good because it’s such a large area and there’s tons of roads and multiple ways of getting around.” Helping them out was a ban on spectator vehicle traffic. MAPPING IT OUT An event of this magnitude takes lots of planning — “all year long,” Dean says. “We get a PDF map with all locations, we do an aerial view, we do several meetings with them.” They created a spreadsheet containing locations, units and equipment serial numbers. Areas were split up and drivers assigned specific zones. The week before the event the team did an on-site dry run to go over routes and make sure everybody knew who was doing what. But it’s a team effort, Dean says. “If somebody finishes early, they hop on to the nearest guy and help him out.” It’s that teamwork that makes doing an event like this enjoyable, Dean says, despite the grueling schedule. “This is probably one of the best teams you could ever be a part of. All the big events we do are fun. It’s why we keep doing it.” Related Stories Expo: Come See It All Are Your Restroom Trucks Specially Outfitted For Events?

The elevation of Rao, Airbus’s 52-year-old executive vice president for strategy and future programs, has been disclosed to top management, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is still private. A public announcement will come within the next month, they said. Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath declined to comment. The appointment comes less than a month after Boeing announced that Ihssane Mounir would replace John Wojick as its head of sales early next year. Leahy, 66, has outlasted more than a half-dozen Boeing counterparts since being named Airbus’s chief commercial officer in 1994. In his career at the planemaker, Leahy has won aircraft commitments valued at more than $1 trillion. Airbus announced a plan in September to combine all divisions into a single company, as Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders seeks to cut costs, streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Rao also held the title of executive vice president for sales and marketing. Rao was born in India and studied aeronautical engineering. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Computing Mobile Internet Gaming Electronics Extreme Deep Dives Deals About ExtremeTech ET Forums Contact ExtremeTech Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ziff Davis Home Extreme The Air Force’s X-37B space plane could become an astronaut ambulance The Air Force’s X-37B space plane could become an astronaut ambulance By Ryan Whitwam on November 8, 2016 at 4:03 pm Comment In the event of an emergency aboard the International Space Station (ISS), astronauts take refuge inside a Russian Soyuz capsule that remains docked at the station. These vessels have been the only means of getting to and from the ISS since the Space Shuttle was discontinued several years ago. While other vehicles are in development, none of them could effectively serve as a “space ambulance.” The best archetype for that design might be the mysterious Air Force X-37B space plane. The Soyuz program is a reliable way of reaching the ISS and returning home, but it’s a little lacking in finesse. Reentering the Earth’s atmosphere in a Soyuz exposes passengers to at least 4.5G of force, and the parachute-aided landings are surprisingly violent. A study of Soyuz “hard landings” showed that minor injuries are sustained by astronauts approximately 40% of the time. Now, imagine if an astronaut were injured on the ISS. Sending them down in a Soyuz could make the situation much worse. Even the vehicles being developed by companies like SpaceX and Boeing use similar capsule designs that land with parachutes (though SpaceX is also toying with propulsive landing). They might be gentler, but the best way to transport an injured astronaut would be with a space plane. Ideally, transporting an injured crew member back to Earth should include minimal G-loads and take no longer than three hours. The Air Force’s semi-secret space plane is currently not suitable as an astronaut ambulance, but a private firm called Sierra Nevada is using the design as inspiration for its Dream Chaser space plane. The X-37B launches attached to a rocket and glides in for a landing, just like the Space Shuttle used to. This vehicle is currently in the middle of its fourth mission, which began in May 2015. This vehicle has logged millions of miles in space, proving that it’s an effective design. One notable difference is that Dream Chaser would be a piloted craft, whereas the X-37B is entirely remote. It’s smaller than you think. At the same time, former astronaut Stephen Robinson is promoting the idea that the Air Force could repurpose the X-37B design as an orbital rescue craft. Like the Dream Chaser, it would need to be a manned vehicle with a pilot as a backup for automated systems. There would be room for two passengers in addition; one patient and a medical officer. Robinson suggests that the revamped X-37B could launch to the ISS carrying cargo, then remain docked for use in the event of an emergency. Both the reimagined X37B and the Dream Chaser are just hypotheticals right now, with no firm plans to begin construction. However, as human spaceflight accelerates, we will eventually need a space plane vehicle capable of softer landings.

The laser weapon will be housed in a pod attached to a fighter-sized aircraft.  Scroll down for video  The technology, known as 'directed energy systems' will be fitted to future craft to allow them to protect themselves. The laser weapon will be housed in a pod attached to a fighter-sized aircraft. LASER WEAPONS 'COMING SON'  Air Force bosses have boasted combat lasers will be fitted to fighters planes 'very soon' and have revealed a full scale prototype is being built. 'I believe we'll have a directed energy pod we can put on a fighter plane very soon,' Air Force General Hawk Carlisle has claimed at the Air Force Association Air & Space conference in a presentation on what he called Fifth-Generation Warfare, according to Ars Technica. 'That day is a lot closer than I think a lot of people think it is.'  The system will be tested on a tactical aircraft flying at speeds up to supersonic.  AFRL expects to begin flight testing the integrated system by 2019. 'Northrop Grumman will help the U.S. Air Force mature its plans to use directed energy systems for self-protection on current and future aircraft under a contract awarded by the Air Force Research Laboratory,' the military contractor confirmed. The contract calls for Northrop Grumman to develop and produce the beam control portion of an airborne laser weapon demonstration system that AFRL is developing under its Self-Protect High Energy Laser Demonstrator (SHiELD) Advanced Technology Demonstration (ATD) program. 'Our Northrop Grumman-led team is integrating an innovative beam director with proven beam control technologies to help the Air Force define and successfully demonstrate a laser weapon capability for current and next generation aircraft,' said W. Mark Skinner, vice president, directed energy, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next The end of jet lag? Discovery of gene that is key to setting...

Share this article Share 38 shares The beam control system characterizes the flight environment for atmospheric disturbances that could distort the laser beam, acquires and tracks incoming targets, determines an aim point for the laser, then 'shapes' and focuses the outgoing beam on the target, added Skinner.  Northrop Grumman has previously revealed a tantalising image of a new stealth 'superjet' capable of the firing laser weapons. The so called 'sixth generation fighter' is rumoured to fly at supersonic speeds, although Northrop Grumman, who are developing it, say the specifications are still secret. The stealth craft is expected to use advanced cooling systems to help disguise its laser systems.   Chris Hernandez, Northrop's vice president for research, technology and advanced design, told BreakingDefence the sixth-gem fighter will be long range because it won't have many bases to operate from overseas; it must 'carry a lot of weapons;' survivability will be key. What do those requirements and physics lead you to?  ADAM LASER DISABLES BOATS Several firms have working laser weapons, and Lockheed Martin recently showed off its laser weapon. The 30-kilowatt fibre laser called Athena burnt through the manifold in seconds, despite being fired by a team from Lockheed Martin positioned more than a mile away. The security firm said the test signifies the next step to fitting lightweight laser weapons on military aircraft, helicopters, ships and trucks. The laser, known as Athena, was built by Maryland-based security firm Lockheed Martin. During the test, the 30-kilowattfibre laser burnt through the truck’s engine (pictured) and disabled it from more a mile away Athena is based on the firm’s Area Defense Anti-Munitions (ADAM) laser weapon system. In tests off the California coast in May, Adam was used to successfully disable two boats at a range of approximately one mile (1.6km).  The high-energy laser burnt through multiple compartments of the rubber hull of the military-grade small boats in less than 30 seconds. Lockheed Martin previously demonstrated the system’s capabilities on airborne targets in flight, including small-calibre rocket targets and an unmanned aerial system target. The system can precisely track moving targets at a range of more than 3.1 miles (5km).  'This looks a lot like a baby B-2 and this is really getting into our sweet spot,' Hernandez said. Northrop Grumman has two design teams working on the new aircraft.  However, the firm would not discuss the plane's speed, saying that would have to wait for clearer direction from the Pentagon in the future. It is expected to use laser weapons - and this has caused major problems around heat.   Boeing (pictured) and Northrop Grumman are both developing concepts. As Northrop president for aerospace Tom Vice said, managing heat will be key.  'Add in all the aircraft's power and thrust systems, and you have an enormous heat challenge,' said Hernandez.  The craft is expected to be used in 2030. In April 2012, the Navy issued a formal request for information for the F/A-XX.  It calls for an air superiority fighter with multi-role capabilities to replace the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and EA-18G Growler aircraft in the 2030s, Boeing and Northrop Grumman are both developing concepts.  Lockheed Martin has been working on next-generation air dominance-related activities with the U.S. Armed Services and most recently the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to determine the best way to maintain air dominance in the post-2035 world. In October of 2012, Frank Kendall, Undersecretary of Defense, tasked DARPA to explore concepts for the next generation of air dominance.  In an attempt to break the battle space into smaller pieces, DARPA defined separate focus areas that span capabilities across the air dominance battle space. 'This decomposition may not be perfect and will most certainly be fine-tuned over time, but it does provide a logical construct for looking at the future battle space,' said Mark Jefferson, director of Next Generation Air Dominance programs at the Skunk Works. Previous reports say the superjet might even not have a pilot. According to the Pentagon, it may partially fall in the hands of artificial intelligence (AI). Reports say that both the US Navy and Air Force are planning next-generation fighters that don't have just a human pilot. Future fighter jets may have an AI co-pilot on board that can help with sensory data in addition to autonomously landing the plane on an aircraft carrier.  According to the US Naval Institute (USNI), artificial intelligence will feature prominently on the successors to the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The US Navy is working on the F/A-XX and the Air Force on the F-X, with both designed to replace their predecessors by 2030 at the earliest. 'AI is going to be huge,' a US Navy official told the USNI. While the exact purpose of AI in aircraft isn't known yet, it could have a number of uses from acting as a co-pilot to carrying out autonomous landings. According to Popular Science the robotic co-pilots would be especially helpful for aircraft carriers, which are difficult to land on. Recently the Navy's X-47B experimental drone landed autonomously on an aircraft, demonstrating the usefulness of AI in such a situation. AI could also help with something known as advanced sensor fusion. This involves combining data from various sensors to get a more accurate reading of a situation or location. The Navy and Air Force are also hoping to get help from industry experts in Silicon Valley to aid them in the design of such sixth-generation fighters.    Read more: Northrop Unveils Sixth Gen Fighter Concept « Breaking Defense - Defense industry news, analysis and commentary Share or comment on this article e-mail 38 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Ivanka Trump gives glimpse of her father's $100m penthouse Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Killer wife and lover speak out over fatal love triangle Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Protestor at an anti-Trump rally at Ohio State gets slammed Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing 'Reality has a way of asserting itself!'

There are sailplanes, wooden planes, jet aircrafts and space aircrafts. The fastest plane in history is the M-21, which was made in 1960. Its speed can reach up to 2,200 miles per hour,” said a source. The source also said only two models of the M-21 were made. “The plane can fly up to 80,000 feet high surpassing rockets in speed and height. The museum also has old military aircrafts and the kind of battles and wars the aircrafts were used in. There was also a section on astronauts and the kind of training they go through and equipment they use in their missions,” said the source. The source added the most contributing aircrafts manufacturing company to the museum is the Boeing Company. “The Saudi Arabian Airlines will be receiving 10 B777-300ER airplanes manufactured by Boeing Company. The company contributed small and large aircrafts to the museum along with the story behind each aircraft. The company also made the airplane that was led by Paul Tibbets, the American pilot who flew the aircraft that dropped the first atomic bomb in Hiroshima in 1945,” said the source. The source added the company contributed more than 150 historical aircrafts to the museum. “Seattle is located in Washington State in the United States. It is the biggest city northwest of the US. The city overlooks the Pacific Ocean and has a lot of trade relations with Asian countries. The city is known for its greenery and for having giant companies and known universities such as Washington University,” said the source. The source also said the city has giant companies such as Microsoft, The Boeing Aircrafts Manufacturing Company, Amazon and Starbucks. The city was named after a Native American chief who’s name was pronounced “see-ahlsh” but it was difficult for English settlers who came to the area in 1851 to pronounce it, so they Anglicized it to Seattle. Seattle is only 113 miles away from the Canadian border.

Airlines (UAL) today reported October 2016 operational results. UAL's October 2016 consolidated traffic (revenue passenger miles) increased 0.6 percent and consolidated capacity (available seat miles) increased 1.8 percent versus October 2015. UAL's October 2016 consolidated load factor decreased 1.0 point compared to October 2015. The company continues to expect fourth-quarter 2016 consolidated passenger unit revenue to decline 4.0 to 6.0 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. The year-over-year performance is driven primarily by yield weakness and the timing of certain holidays.

Check out Donald Trump's $100 million personal Boeing airliner Benjamin Zhang Nov. 8, 2016, 9:38 AM 2,527,095 facebook linkedin twitter email print AP As Donald Trump's improbable campaign for the White House winds down, the controversial billionaire will jet to New York on Tuesday where he will await the results of this historic election. Unlike most presidential candidates, "The Donald" actually owns the Boeing 757-200 airliner-turned-private-jet that has deputized as his campaign plane. "Trump Force One" — as some have dubbed the jet — has been one of the most visible symbols of his run for the Oval Office. Trump likes to call it the "T-Bird," according to a Discovery Channel documentary featuring the plane. According the documentary, Trump's Boeing 757 cost a whopping $100 million. Admittedly, that number seems a bit exaggerated when compared to market prices. The Republican presidential candidate has owned the Boeing airliner — registration N757FA — since 2011 and has customized the aircraft to his liking. Have a closer look at Donald Trump's personal Boeing 757-200 jet: View As: One Page Slides While Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, ... AP ... Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Kaine, and AP ... Republican vice-presidential candidate Mike Pence were flying around in rented campaign planes... AP ... "The Donald" was jet setting around America in his private Boeing 757-200. AP Although Trump may be the jet's current owner, he wasn't its first. AP Trump's Boeing 757-2J4ER first flew in May 1991. The new airliner was delivered to Sterling Airlines, a now defunct Danish low-cost carrier. A couple of years later, it found its way into the fleet of Mexico's TAESA, also a now defunct airline. Flickr/Aero Icarus Sources: Federal Aviation Administration, Airfleets.net In 1995, the jet was bought by Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen. For the next 15 years, the Boeing served as a corporate runabout for the billionaire's various interests. Getty Images Sources: Airfleets.net, FlightAware In 2011, Trump took delivery of the then 20-year-old jet and added his personal touches — at great expense. AP Source: Airfleets.net The current 757 took the place of Trump's former plane, a Boeing 727 built in 1969. Flickr/IowaPolitics.com The Boeing 757 is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce RB211 turbofan engines. YouTube/Trump Source: FAA The Rolls-Royce engines are a feature Trump was very keen to have on his plane. AP Source: YouTube Although it's not the most fuel-efficient engine in the world, it is incredibly powerful. In fact, it's earned the 757 a reputation among pilots for being a bit of a hot rod. YouTube/Trump Up front, the Boeing is outfitted with a modern "glass cockpit." YouTube/Trump In airline operations, the Boeing 757-200 can carry as many as 239 passengers, but Trump's plane is configured for only 43. YouTube/Trump It has all of the features you'd expect Donald Trump to enjoy, such as ... YouTube/Trump ... a silk-lined master bedroom equipped with ... YouTube/Trump ... a big-screen entertainment system ... YouTube/Trump ... a master bath with 24-karat-gold fixtures and ... YouTube/Trump ... a shower! In total, the plane is equipped with two bedrooms. YouTube/Trump In fact, virtually every fixture in the plane is 24-karat-gold plated — even the seat belts! YouTube/Trump The plane's headrests and pillows are embroidered with the Trump family crest. YouTube/Trump Trump's guests also travel in style. YouTube/Trump There's a dining room.

(Nov. 7) AP Someone call Samuel L. Jackson. A snake created a scare for passengers on a flight in Mexico on Sunday, leading to the inevitable association with the "Snakes on a Plane" movie that gained fame with Jackson as a starring actor. Passengers on Aeromexico Flight 231 got the real-life "Snake on a Plane" treatment Sunday. The unwelcome surprise came on a flight to Mexico City from Torreon in Mexico’s north. Aeromexico typically flies that flight on an Embraer E190 aircraft, according to its website. A passenger captured video of the reptile squirming from one of the aircraft’s overhead storage bins, with the snake appearing to be fall down into the cabin toward the end of the short video. A second video from the plane (via YouTube) showed passengers moving away from the snake as it dangled from the bin area. BOOKMARK: Bookmark Today in the Sky homepage for your daily fix of aviation news USA TODAY March #avgeek gallery: 30 cool aviation photos It was difficult to tell the exact size of the snake from the video, though a report in the Houston Chronicle put it at 5 feet. UPI reports that the snake – thought to be a venomous green viper, according to the wire service – eventually fell into a seating area while the plane was still in flight. What happened next? The Star-Telegram of Fort Worth says "flight attendants notified the pilot, who organized an emergency landing at the plane’s destination." Aeromexico released a statement to The Associated Press acknowledging the plane was given priority landing in Mexico City, where workers then "secured the reptile." Here's our official position regarding the incident aboard flight AM-231.#Quetzalcoatlhttps://t.co/eq1ckgcA9L— Aeromexico (@AeromexicoUSA) November 8, 2016 “The procedures carried out for this flight are currently being evaluated to determine how the animal entered the cabin and measures have been taken to avoid such incidents in the future,” Aeromexico added in a statement to CNN. Indalecio Medina, the passenger who posted the video to Twitter, is quoted by UPI as saying he captured the snake in a blanket and "gave it some magazines to read." It was a "unique experience," Medina added. USA TODAY World's strangest-looking airplane?

(Nov. 7) AP Someone call Samuel L. Jackson. A snake created a scare for passengers on a flight in Mexico on Sunday, leading to the inevitable association with the "Snakes on a Plane" movie that gained fame with Jackson as a starring actor. Passengers on Aeromexico Flight 231 got the real-life "Snake on a Plane" treatment Sunday. The unwelcome surprise came on a flight to Mexico City from Torreon in Mexico’s north. Aeromexico typically flies that flight on an Embraer E190 aircraft, according to its website. A passenger captured video of the reptile squirming from one of the aircraft’s overhead storage bins, with the snake appearing to be fall down into the cabin toward the end of the short video. A second video from the plane (via YouTube) showed passengers moving away from the snake as it dangled from the bin area.

UPI reports that the snake – thought to be a venomous green viper, according to the wire service – eventually fell into a seating area while the plane was still in flight. What happened next? The Star-Telegram of Fort Worth says "flight attendants notified the pilot, who organized an emergency landing at the plane’s destination." Aeromexico released a statement to The Associated Press acknowledging the plane was given priority landing in Mexico City, where workers then "secured the reptile." Here's our official position regarding the incident aboard flight AM-231.#Quetzalcoatlhttps://t.co/eq1ckgcA9L— Aeromexico (@AeromexicoUSA) November 8, 2016 “The procedures carried out for this flight are currently being evaluated to determine how the animal entered the cabin and measures have been taken to avoid such incidents in the future,” Aeromexico added in a statement to CNN. Indalecio Medina, the passenger who posted the video to Twitter, is quoted by UPI as saying he captured the snake in a blanket and "gave it some magazines to read." It was a "unique experience," Medina added. USA TODAY World's strangest-looking airplane?

Americans weigh in Striking moments from the Clinton, Trump campaign rallies TPP trade deal 'a continuing rape of our country,' Trump says at Ohio rally Boeing trimming jobs in race to stay competitive with Airbus Hillary Clinton gives support to workers in Trump hotel labour dispute A Washington-based union representative says that while he supports Hillary Clinton in the U.S. presidential election race, Republican candidate Donald Trump's comments about labour have resonated with Americans, in particular his complaints about the outsourcing of U.S. jobs. Everett, Washington is home to the state's largest employer, Boeing. The aerospace factory, which manufactures commercial airplanes, employs around 80,000 people. But in recent years, the company has shed jobs. Nearly 4,000 jobs were cut earlier this year. Boeing reportedly cutting up to 10% of workforce Larry Brown is the legislative and policy director of one of the biggest unions in the plant — the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. He told On the Coast's Stephen Quinn the job cuts have made workers at the plant nervous. "Wings for the 787 (airliner) are built in Japan. Many significant parts of the tail section for 787 are built in Italy." Brown said. "There are parts made all over the world that previously had been built in America ... They count on that work for their jobs, for their paycheques, their families." He said he appreciated Trump for raising the issue of outsourcing of jobs and focusing on the U.S. economy. Among other things, the Republican candidate has vowed to renegotiate North American Free Trade Agreement and withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Americans head to the polls tomorrow to choose between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. (Associated Press) "Donald Trump has a real issue that he's raising there," he said. However, Brown also pointed to the fact that Trump has embroiled himself in numerous labour disputes with his own workers. "This guy is somebody that believes that workers make too much money in America," he said. "He's a guy that doesn't pay his workers, his contractors. "This guy is somebody that does not have the entire interest of the community when he is doing his business." Brown said his union is backing Clinton, and believed she would be a "fine president". However, he said many of his union members have values that align with traditional Republican philosophies. He said many of them are advocates of the right to bear arms, the military and tough-on crime legislation — issues he called traditional Republican issues. "Why is it that having a union worker earning enough money to spend money on Main Street is not a Republican issue? I don't understand that."

At the Forum on American Aeronautics late last month, officials from top aeronautics agencies including NASA, the Air Force, and Lockheed Martin, said we are now ‘on the brink of a new era in air transportation.’ According to the experts, however, bringing this technology to practical use over land will require significant reductions in the sonic booms caused by the craft, and numerous firms are now working to tackle this challenge. It’s said that hypersonic flight, which achieves at least five times the speed of sound, could go anywhere in the world in just four hours. Scroll down for video  At the Forum on American Aeronautics, officials from top aeronautics agencies including NASA, the Air Force, and Lockheed Martin, said we are now ‘on the brink of a new era in air transportation.’ An artist’s impression of the Lapcat A2 craft flying at Mach 5 is pictured SPANWISE ADAPTIVE WINGS Nasa engineers are working with Boeing and Area-I to develop a prototype of its folding wing concept. Folding wings have been used for decades as a means of reducing the space aircraft take up on aircraft carriers and in hangers. The approach was also incorporated into a US nuclear bomber in the 1960s, the XB-70 Valkyrie, but only the tips folded during flight. Engineers hope that their spanwise adaptive wing (SAW) concept will bring folding wings into the 21st century with new technology and materials. They believe that by tweaking the shape of the wing by a few degrees in flight, pilots could find the optimal position to cut through the air with less drag and generate more lift - which could prove key to stability in hypersonic flight. Five panellists spoke at the Forum on American Aeronautics at the Mohave Air and Space Port in California to discuss the breakthroughs and challenges in supersonic and hypersonic flight. The experts say research in the field is now booming after a long lull, bringing these advanced capabilities closer to reality. ‘What’s exciting about aerospace today is that we are in a point here where suddenly, things are happening all across the board in areas that just haven’t been happening for quite a while,’ former US Air Force Maj. Gen. Curtis M. Bedke, said at panel on Oct 27, Space.com reports. ‘There was a period where engine technology had just sort of stagnated – a point where all materials technology was going along at about the same pace. ‘There wasn’t much happening.  'But suddenly, in all sorts of areas that apply to aerospace, things are happening.’ NASA’s aeronautical program is set to focus on a new line of experimental aircraft, led by House Committee on Science member Steve Knight. According to Knight, the US has not gone hypersonic in a plane since 1967 – and despite two unpiloted hypersonic programs, X-51 and X-43, the work was not continued, Space.com reports. But, Knight hopes to see the data from these research programs used to push today’s developments. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Southern Hemisphere recovered TWICE as fast as the North...

Share this article Share 81 shares This past February, NASA granted a contract to Lockheed Martin for the design of an experimental plane to test technologies that would reduce the sonic booms. While supersonic flights are currently banned over land, such an achievement could change this. The agency also recently revealed it is working with blended wings and other technologies to improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impacts of aircraft. Nasa engineers are working to develop a prototype folding wing concept. By tweaking the shape of the wing a few degrees in flight, pilots could find the optimal position - which could prove key to stability in hypersonic flight. Pictured is prototype for testing the concept Challenges Congress and the president have faced in passing budgets has affected researchers' abilities to carry out consistent work, Space.com reports. And, the experts say there’s no time to waste. ‘It is inevitable that hypersonic technologies are going to happen,’ Bedke said. ‘It is not inevitable that we are going to be the country to do it first. But we can be the country to do it first, but we’re going to have to put our minds to it, and we’re going to have to stop the history of fits and starts, of throwing money at a big program, achieving a wild success, and then having no follow-up. ‘Or throwing a lot of money at too big a program, taking too giant a bite, failing miserably and then deciding hypersonics isn’t going anywhere. Neither of those must be allowed to happen in the coming years.’ NASA'S SHAPE-SHIFTING WINGS  Last year Nasa revealed a number of test flights had taken place for craft using a shape-shifting wing technology called Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE). The project is a collaboration between Nasa, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) and FlexSys from Ann Arbor Michigan. The wing is able to ‘bend’ through angles from -2 degrees up to 30 degrees. Test pilots have described it as being ‘very smooth’, while it can also deal with hard banking manoeuvres and extreme temperatures. For all the flights so far, the wing has flown in a fixed position on a Gulfstream III jet between these two extremes, to ensure risk is minimal. At the time, engineers said that future flights would enable the wings to change angles while in the air. The breakthrough could also increase fuel efficiency up to 12 per cent, and reduce noise at take-off and landing up to 40 per cent. Just months ago, it was revealed that plans for a revolutionary hypersonic propulsion system have taken a big step toward the construction of a ground demonstrator – but at roughly a quarter the size of the original vision. Reaction Engines Ltd has scaled back its design for the Sabre engine to bring about a demonstrator that is more affordable and better suited to early applications, including a potential X-plane. The Oxfordshire-based firm has been developing a turbine that combines both jet and rocket technologies to achieve rates five times the speed of sound, to fly anywhere in the world in just four hours.  Rather than aiming for a demonstrator that can achieve more than 150,000 lb thrust, the firm will instead now target an engine size capable of roughly 44,000 lb thrust, according to Aviation Week Network. Oxfordshire-based Reaction Engines has been developing a turbine that combines both jet and rocket technologies to achieve rates five times the speed of sound, to fly anywhere in the world in just four hours In the new plans for the Sabre demonstrator, researchers will target a smaller engine similar in size to the F135 engine for the F-35 joint Strike Fighter (pictured) In the new plans for the Sabre demonstrator, researchers will target a smaller engine similar in size to the F135 engine for the F-35 joint Strike Fighter (JSF). Such a system, scaled back due to the slowness of funding, could be used in multistage vehicles or hypersonic craft the size of an X-plane. ‘It is now more affordable, more rapid to execute and will potentially find its first application quicker,’ Reaction CEO Mark Thomas told Aviation Week Network. ‘It’s a quarter of Sabre, effectively. In an application for something like Skylon, the engine would have four combustion chambers connecting to the single nozzle, a bypass system and the same turbomachinery, intake and heat exchanger. FUTURE OF FLIGHT? HOW THE SABRE JET ENGINE WORKS A model of the revolutionary Sabre engine is pictured   The revolutionary Sabre engine could allow aircraft to take off from a runway and accelerate to five times the speed of sound, before switching to a rocket mode, propelling it into orbit. The Sabre engine works by burning atmospheric air in combustion chambers.  It then uses the heat to turbo-charge the engine. At the moment, rockets have to carry liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to power them and the cost of carrying this heavy fuel is expensive.  The new engine creates its own liquid oxygen by cooling air entering the engine from 1,000°C to minus 150°C in a hundredth of a second – six times faster than the blink of an eye – without creating ice blockages. The revolutionary Sabre engine could allow aircraft to take off from a runway and accelerate to five times the speed of sound, before switching to a rocket mode, propelling it into orbit. A computer generated image of the ground demonstrator is pictured  This new class of aerospace engine is designed to enable aircraft to operate from standstill on the runway to speeds of over five times the speed of sound in the atmosphere.  It can then transition to a rocket mode of operation, allowing spaceflight at speeds up to orbital velocity, equivalent to 25 times the speed of sound. ‘There is a view that you could modularize the engine to a far higher degree, so that you could have four compressors and still have a large heat exchanger. From this point onward you could go completely modular, so if you could demonstrate one element, then it is all about integration.’ Along with a JSF-sized engine for the ground demonstrator, the firm plans to solve the power gap between air-breathing and rocket engines. While the engine is still in the design phase, the firm plans to see three main test phases stretching into the 2020s. It’s hoped that the first test will take place within the next 12-15 months, the CEO tells AWN, with a focus on the heat exchanger and the core. Here, a concept of the Skylon spaceplane using the engine is shown. But now, Reaction Engines Ltd has scaled back its design for the Sabre engine to bring about a demonstrator that is more affordable and better suited to early applications, including a potential X-plane Then, the team will move on to the integrated engine tests in 2020-2021. The system will undergo sea-level testing, and researchers will simulate high velocity air by heating the air flow. And, they will run wind tunnel tests to assess flow conditions. In the third phase, the firm is looking toward concepts of an X-plane or flight demonstration aircraft to put it to the test. The core will eventually be tested in the UK, meaning Reaction will need to build a test facility with a hydrogen/air breathing preburner.      Read more: Reaction Engines Refines Hypersonic Engine Demonstrator Plan | Technology content from Aviation Week Hypersonic Flight Is Coming: Will the US Lead the Way?

They are set to replace the Republic of Singapore Air Force's (RSAF's) ageing Super Pumas and older Chinooks, which have been in service since 1983 and 1994 respectively, and are facing obsolescence. "The H225M and CH-47F possess better lift and reach capabilities, and will enable the RSAF to meet the Singapore Armed Forces' lift requirements more efficiently with fewer helicopters and less manpower," the Singapore Ministry of Defence said in a 7 November statement.

Published: 16:17 November 7, 2016 Reuters   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE SINGAPORE/ANKARA: Iran has reached a deal with a foreign leasing company to finance the first 17 jets it plans to buy from Airbus, breaking a logjam in efforts to import aircraft following the lifting of sanctions, people familiar with the move said. The deal removes a significant hurdle to securing the first tranche of jets, following uncertainty over financing and political opposition in the United States and Iran, though the sources caution months of talking have thrown up new potential hurdles. Iranian officials declined to name the lessor involved, but industry sources said in September that Iran was in advanced talks with the UAE’ Dubai Aerospace about helping to finance the purchase. “We have a deal to finance the first 17 aircraft,” a senior Iranian official told Reuters, without elaborating. Dubai Aerospace and Airbus both declined to comment. Under the deal, the leasing company would take over part of Iran’s order for dozens of new jetliners and then lease them to the country’s flag carrier. A similar mechanism could be used to finance a provisional order for 20 turboprops from ATR, which is half-owned by Airbus, one of the people said. ATR had no immediate comment. Tehran provisionally ordered more than 100 jets each from Airbus and Boeing this year after a deal with major powers to lift most sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on nuclear activities. Completing the rest of the Airbus deal depends on receiving US export licences because of the number of US components in the aircraft. So far Airbus has US licences for 17 jets. Airbus will unusually be paid in euros, avoiding dollars typically used by the aircraft industry. The US financial system remains closed to Iran under core sanctions dating back to the Islamic Republic’s 1979 revolution. Talks are expected to resume soon between Iran and Boeing to finalise the U.S. company’s deal to sell or lease more than 100 jets: a transaction that could also involve third parties. A Middle East spokesman for Boeing, Fakher Daghestani, said it had been allowed by the US government to talk to approved Iranian airlines and that any final agreements would need further US approval. The airplane deals represent a big economic prize for western companies and also help the Iranian supporters of a more open relationship with the West after years of near isolation. But negotiations have been held up by the reluctance of many western banks to provide finance, fearing a regulatory backlash if there is a new setback in relations. In particular they are concerned that the outcome of Tuesday’s US presidential election could lead to a new set of sanctions. Republican candidate Donald Trump and conservatives in Congress have heavily criticised the nuclear deal. Sources say the government of President Hassan Rouhani is keen to finalise contracts before the end of Iran’s fiscal year in March, boosting chances of securing the first high-profile delivery in time for Iran’s own presidential elections in May. “We have deadlines to meet,” the Iranian official said.   More from Aviation EasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines Etihad starts hiring additional crew Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac Passenger traffic at DWC up 161% Etihad Airways Engineering and Airbus sign MoU Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Air Arabia third quarter net profit rises 26% tags from this storyUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGNIran follow this tag on MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsUnited Arab Emirates follow this tag on MGN+ MGNUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNIran follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDonald Trump follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationEasyJet profit falls as currency woes take toll Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Etihad starts hiring additional crew 02Berkshire bet on the biggest US airlines 03Emirates retires last Airbus A330, A340 04Etihad Airways Engineering and Airbus sign MoU 05Shaikh Mohammad Bin Zayed restructures Adac 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Affordable housing under review in Dubai Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Emiratis in US warned of rising harrasment Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns New Rs500, Rs2,000 notes not in UAE Close Recommended For You Abdullah opens Abu Dhabi Art 2016PUBLISHED ON Nov 16, 2016 Cultivating tolerance to overcome turmoilPUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 UAE: 'We don't want to see any discrimination'PUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

From 2018, the UK carrier’s long-haul Boeing 777 fleet operating out of London Gatwick Airport will feature 10 seats per row instead of the current nine. This will increase the passenger capacity by 52 seats for each of the aircraft. Critics of the plan at The BA Source claim adding that many seats will mean doing away with three of the 11 cabin toilets but the airline says this is simply not true. As well as its principal long haul aircraft, BA plans to reconfigure its short-haul Airbus A320s so that they are similar to those of low-cost rivals like easyJet. After the remake, these aircraft will boast an extra 12 seats apiece. BA is a subsidiary of International Airlines Group and CEO Willie Walsh says the airline is responding to current market demands by increasing the number of seats for flights. He carried on by saying BA would be able to cut its median seat overheads and passengers would reap the benefits with reduced ticket prices. A spokesperson echoed the CEO’s sentiments and said the new cabin configurations would better enable BA to compete with other carriers. The spokesperson did not draw a parallel with easyJet but noted that Air France and Emirates were among other airlines operating 10 seats per row aircraft. BA has previously operated Boeing 777s with 10-seat rows in economy. They were utilised for Caribbean and southern US routes in the latter half of the 1990s, but refurbished to comply with BA standards in 2002.

The shares rose. Profit after tax increased to €912 million in the three months through September from €843 million a year earlier, Dublin-based Ryanair said today. Analysts predicted earnings of €897 million, based on the average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company stuck to its full-year earnings forecast and raised its long-term passenger target by more than 10 per cent. “Ryanair is doing very well in tough times as people trade down to lower fares,” chief executive Michael O’Leary said in a Bloomberg Television interview. If profitability goes up, the airline will most likely continue buybacks, he said. The shares rose as much as 6.3 per cent, the most in more than three months, to €13.54 and were trading at €13.41 at 8.36am in Dublin, shaving the year’s loss to 13 per cent. The discount airline is attracting passengers by cutting fares, increasing seats and adding larger airports to its schedule as it battles against expansion by competitors, which the carrier predicts will depress prices by as much as 15 per cent in the winter. Cheaper tickets boosted Ryanair’s passenger tally by 12 per cent in the first half, to 64.8 million passengers. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Macau sets US$25b gaming target for 2017 below estimates Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Ryanair sets sights on becoming ‘the Amazon of air travel’ with new platform Ryanair to pull investment from UK if leaves EU, CEO says Morocco detains ‘radicalised’ Frenchman after finding knives, gas bottle in luggage Five European airlines launch new alliance Ryanair flies over 10m passengers in record month Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The aircraft is a development of the YAK/AEM-130, a joint programme with Yakolev Design Bureau and Sokol Manufacturing Plant of Russia. In July 2000, Alenia Aermacchi announced that it would cancel the joint project and develop the aircraft alone, as the M-346. The M-346 provides combat pilot training for front line fighters with high angle-of-attack capability. The aerodynamic design of the M-346 uses vortex lift to provide manoeuvrability and controllability at very high angle-of-attack using a fly-by-wire control system. The YAK/AEM-130 has flown in prototype form since 1996. As the Yak-130, the aircraft was selected in March 2002 as the Russian AF's next-generation combat trainer. M-346 Master fighter trainer development The M-346 prototype completed its first flight in July 2004. The second prototype made its maiden flight in May 2005. The first low-rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft made its maiden flight in July 2008. The M-346 equipped with advanced helmet-mounted display systems completed its maiden flight in May 2010. The Italian Air Force (ITAF), the launch customer, received the first batch of 15 M-346 Master aircraft. Alenia Aermacchi signed a €220m ($330m) contract with ITAF in June 2009 to supply six M-346 jets. The first two of the six M-346 aircraft were unveiled in December 2010. ITAF designated the M-346 as T-346A which made its maiden flight in March 2011. The General Directorate for Aeronautical Armaments of the Ministry of Defence issued the military certification for the M-346 jet on 22 June 2011. The first T-346A aircraft was accepted by ITAF in November 2011. The second aircraft was delivered in February 2012. The contract also involves a five-year maintenance and logistics support. The M-346 was successful in its first air-to-air refuelling tests and several techniques performed by ITAF and the company pilots.

See all suppliers M-346 Master training aircraft orders and deliveries "The M-346 is an advanced and lead-in fighter trainer being developed by Aermacchi SpA of Italy." In April 2009, Alenia Aermacchi received the design organisation military approval (DOMA) certificate for the M-346 Master allowing autonomous and direct management of the homologation process, including continuation of its airworthiness. DOMA also enables Alenia Aermacchi to streamline M-346 interface with the DGAA (Direzione Generale Armamenti Aeronauticiefficient) and improve internal design and development processes of the aircraft. In January 2005, the Greek Ministry of Defence signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to become a partner in the programme and, in January 2006, Alenia Aermacchi signed an industrial cooperation agreement with Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI) under which HAI is responsible for production and assembly of certain parts, including the rear fuselage. In May 2006, Alenia Aermacchi announced an agreement with Boeing to jointly market the M-346. In July 2007, the M-346 flew to the UAE for hot weather tests and operational evaluation by the UAE Air Force. In February 2009, the UAE announced that it would acquire 48 M-346 advanced lead-in fighter trainer aircraft. Alenia Aermacchi will form a joint venture with Mubadala Development in UAE for establishing the M-346 final assembly line. ST Aerospace signed a €170m contract with Alenia Aermacchi on 24 June 2011 for providing logistics support to 12 M-346 trainers deployed by the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). The M-346 jets were ordered by the RSAF in September 2010 under the Fighter Wings Course programme. The first aircraft was rolled out in August 2012 and deliveries were completed by March 2014. Alenia Aermacchi also provides spare parts, repair and overhaul services, render engineering, and field support services. The M-346 trainer was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defence (MoD) in February 2012. Israeli MoD placed an order with Alenia Aermacchi for 30 M-346 aircraft in July 2012. Deliveries were concluded in July 2016. The Ministry of Defence of Poland placed an order with Alenia Aermacchi in February 2014 for the delivery of eight M-346 Master aircraft. In December 2014, the Italian National Armaments Directorate contracted Finmeccanica-Alenia Aermacchi for the delivery of three M-346 advanced trainer aircraft to the Italian Air Force. M-346 weapons Armaments are carried on nine external store stations, six of which are underwing, equipped with 1,000lb class ejector release units, and two wingtip stations for air-to-air missiles. The under-fuselage station carries avionics pods or a 300l conformal fuel tank. The system data presentation and control functions of the stores management system use any one of the multifunction displays in both cockpits. Hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls are used to select the weapons. Weapon aiming is controlled by the central main processor, aiming data being presented to the pilots through the head-up display (HUD) or the helmet-mounted display (HMD). "The weapons carried by the M-346 include MK82 500lb and MK83 1,000lb free-fall or retarded bombs." The weapons carried include: MK82 500lb and MK83 1,000lb free-fall or retarded bombs; rocket launchers; AIM-9 Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles; Raytheon AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles; MBDA (formerly Alenia) Marte MK-2A anti-ship missiles. The external hard points can also carry the Vinten VICON-601 reconnaissance pod, laser designator pod, radar warning receiver pod and Elettronica ELT-55 electronic countermeasures pod. For fighter trainer role, self-protection system functions and simulated tactical scenario threats are presented and monitored on the multifunction displays. For operational roles, the aircraft is fitted with a radar warning receiver, chaff and flares dispensers, and active electronic countermeasures. Cockpit The cockpit is representative of the latest-generation combat aircraft, and each crew position is equipped with raster / stroke type head-up display (HUD), full-colour liquid crystal multifunction displays (three in each cockpit), helmet-mounted display with threat simulation capability, night-vision goggle (NVG) compatible instrumentation and hands-on throttle and stick (HOTAS) controls. The cockpits can be fitted with MK16 ejection seats from Martin Baker of Uxbridge, UK. Avionics The avionics architecture is based on a dual-redundant MIL-STD-1553B digital data bus which has capacity for additional systems. The communication suite includes a VHF/UHF transceiver and an information friend of foe (IFF) transponder. The navigation suite includes a laser gyro inertial navigation system with an embedded GPS receiver, and tactical air navigation (TACAN) and VHF omnidirectional radio ranging (VOR/IIS/MB). "The M-346 provides combat pilot training for front-line fighters with high angle-of-attack capability." The flight control system (FCS) is a full authority digital fly-by-wire quadruple-redundant system, which includes four BAE Systems Italia flight control computers. The FCS provides the aircraft with controllability up to angles of attack (AoA) of 35° and higher, g-limitation, stall and spin prevention, and maximum AoA limitation. It can be adapted to various degrees of automation and autopilot modes with reversionary modes featuring automatic selection in case of damage or failures. Turbofan engines Povazke Strojarne L.M. was to be the supplier of the two DV-2S twin-shaft turbofan engines for the YAK/AEM-130. For the M-346, these are replaced with two Honeywell / ITEC F124-GA-200 turbofan engines, produced with Fiat Avio. There is also a closed-circuit self-contained aerobatics lubrication system and dual channel Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). Performance The M-346 can climb at the rate of 127m/s. The maximum and cruise speed of the aircraft are 1,092km/h and 1,059km/h respectively. Its stall speed is 166km/h. The range and service ceiling of the M-346 are 2,590km and 13,700m respectively. Its take-off run is 320m, while the landing run is 470m. The aircraft weighs around 4,610kg and its maximum take-off weight is 9,000kg.

The nuclear-powered super carrier fired at two drones using the ship’s aft RAM launcher and fired the CIWS as part of a pre-aim calibration firing evolution during Carrier Strike Group 1’s Composite Training Unit Exercise. Crew on board said the CIWS PAC fire served a dual purpose, allowing Carl Vinson Sailors to perform a maintenance check as well as readying the mounts for a rogue drone situation. A Canadian CH-148 Cyclone has conducted its first anti-submarine warfare testing with the HMCS Windsor off the coast of Nova Scotia. The Sikorsky-made naval helicopter was tested as part of its Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) carried out by the Helicopter Test and Evaluation Facility (HOTEF). Crews onboard the CH-148 employed Expendable Mobile ASW Training Targets (EMATTs) to simulate submarine movements and noise patterns, which allowed HOTEF crews to further develop those tactical procedures that will be used by operational crews following CH148 Release to Service. Boeing landed a $479 million USAF contract for engineering, manufacturing, and development of the Eagle Passive/Active Warning and Survivability System for the F-15 Eagle fighter jet. The system will provide advanced aircraft protection, significantly improved situational awareness and support for future F-15 mission requirements, replacing the jet’s Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite and keeping the aging aircraft in scheduled service through 2040. As 413 F-15Cs and F-15Es will be upgraded under the program, the expected costs may run to $7.6 billion. Middle East & North Africa Israeli news outlets have reported the presence of the Elbit Systems’ C-MUSIC anti-missile defense system on France’s Presidential Jet. Priced at $1 million per unit, the system consists of smart thermal cameras that identify an incoming missile and target the missile with a laser beam. The specialized beam interferes with the missile’s targeting system, deflecting it off its trajectory and allowing it to explode at a safe distance from the plane. A French official confirmed the reports. Europe MBDA has been awarded a $125 million Demonstration and Manufacture contract by the British MoD for the Sea Ceptor air defense system for the Type 26 (T26) Global Combat Ship (GCS). The company said the deal will last for 10 years and involves support to the T26 design as well as the manufacture of the electronics equipment required for the class of eight ships. News of the deal comes following the announcement by BAE Systems that the first steel for the frigate will be cut in Glasgow next summer. Patriot upgrades for Germany could be underway within a year if Berlin decides against selecting the rival Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) offered by Lockheed Martin and MBDA. Raytheon made the announcement as contract negotiations between the government and MBDA slow due to the cost of MEADS’ acquisition which was recently revealed to be higher than the $4.5 billion initially proposed. The company claims that upgrading their existing Patriot system would save Germany money in the short and long term, allowing them to continue to benefit from upgrades and reliability improvements funded by all 13 countries that operate the system. Asia Pacific India’s government is expected to approve the purchase of 12 US-2 amphibious aircraft from Japan today. The Defense Acquisitions Council, chaired by Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar, will green light the acquisition prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Japan later this week. It’s believed that Modi will sign a memorandum of understanding during the trip. Boeing is expecting a new request for information (RFI) to be released by India to build twin-engine fighters in the country. President of Boeing India Pratyush Kumar said the company had received an RFI for a single-engine fighter but could not offer any solutions to the requirement. In preparation for a twin-engine competition, however, Boeing is prepared to establish a state-of-the-art facility in order to build 200 F/A-18 Super Hornets in country.

Shane Kimbrough, the sole American astronaut aboard the International Space Station, cast his vote Monday via a digital version of the familiar federal absentee ballot. By Rowena Lindsay, Staff November 8, 2016 Save for later Saved US astronaut Shane Kimbrough, a member of the main crew to the International Space Station (ISS), talks to his relatives prior to the launch of the Soyuz MS-02 space ship, in Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, Oct. 19. Ivan Sekretarev/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Every four years, millions of American voters both abroad and at home US cast their ballot for president without going to the polls, mailing in absentee ballots to vote from afar. And a few ballots digitally make the 250-mile journey from the International Space Station to the Earth's surface.  This year, Shane Kimbrough, currently the only American in space, cast his ballot from the International Space Station (ISS) Monday. Kate Rubins also voted early, submitting her ballot before returning to Earth last week after a four-month stint on the ISS. For the purposes of voting, the astronauts’ address is listed as “low-Earth orbit.” The "voting process starts a year before launch, when astronauts are able to select which elections (local/state/federal) that they want to participate in while in space," NASA officials said recently in a blog post. "Then, six months before the election, astronauts are provided with a standard form: the 'Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot Request – Federal Post Card Application.' " Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz!

Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 The first American to vote in space was David Wolf in 1997, who voted from the Russian Mir Space Station. Since most astronauts lived near Houston, Texas passed a law allowing astronauts to vote while off planet in any local, state, or federal elections scheduled during their mission. "I think it's pretty amazing," Dr. Rubins said in an October interview for NASA's weekly "Space to Ground" ISS update. "It's very incredible that we're able to vote from up here, and I think it's incredibly important for us to vote in all of the elections." Their votes are particularly important because the two candidates have very different views on the future of America’s space program. Donald Trump has said he will encourage joint projects between NASA and private space companies, such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Blue Origin, but that public money is more needed in infrastructure here on Earth than on Mars. And while the Republican nominee has spoken highly of NASA, he has said that economic stability and military defense must come first. "If we are growing with all of our people employed and our military readiness back to acceptable levels, then we can take a look at the timeline for sending more people into space," Trump told Mic. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has said that she wanted to be an astronaut as a child and even wrote to NASA about what the requirements were only to be told that they were not currently accepting applications from women. In addition to promising to declassify government information on UFOs, Clinton has said that she supports private space companies but feels that the future of cosmological discoveries lies with NASA and its funding should reflect that.

Back To Top[*] New breed of investor seeking out Japan Inc’s potential corporate failures Nov. 09, 2016 - 06:17AM JST Cyberdyne, a Japanese robotics maker that over the years has become a media darling, this summer found itself on the receiving end of brutal language from companies questioning its public and financial statements. Well Investments Research was one of the first to question the company’s claims. “Cyberdyne’s current valuations on an earnings basis are potentially the highest we’ve seen since the Internet bubble burst in Japan in 2000. The valuations may make you think Cyberdyne is about to become the next big thing. The reality is, the company’s never made a profit. It is not present in the world’s biggest market for wearable robots and deliberately eschews the lucrative military sales on ethical grounds. Its products are not covered by insurance in the US, and in Japan coverage is extremely limited.” Next came Citron Research, which released a report in August that grabs attention with its headline, “Cyberdyne is the most ridiculously priced stock in the world.” The problem, for Well Investments and Citron, is that Cyberdyne has been all talk and no action. In fact, a June 2015 request for an interview with the company’s founder, Dr. Yoshiyuki Sankai by The Journal was turned down by Cyberdyne, which said its device, the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL)—the world’s first cyborg-type robot that allows a wearer’s bodily functions to be improved—“will launch it in [the] US market in the very near future.” A year later, an interview request was turned down in an almost identical fashion. And a US launch remains elusive. For its part, Cyberdyne believes the short-selling issue, which has seen the company’s stock plummet from ¥2,600 on May 31 to around ¥1,600 today, is based on a misunderstanding. Citron sees the stock eventually falling to ¥300. NEW ON THE BLOCK What has happened to Cyberdyne would perhaps have been unimaginable a few years ago. International companies are looking through financial reports for discrepancies, missed problems, and plain old gobbledygook that could fool investors and lead to inflated share prices. Some of their clients then use this knowledge to make bets on declines in stock prices, cashing in once the firms go public with their information. This is not “the Japanese way.” Toward the end of last year, Well Investments was first to make public a report that targeted Marubeni for misstating earnings. This was followed in spring by a report on the company Jigsaw, which accused it of being “a high-tech forgery,” which is little more than “a small server monitoring and maintenance company,” despite grandiose claims of tie-ups with some of the giants of the technology industry. According to Bloomberg, shares in the three companies had declined an average 35 percent by the middle of September. “In our three reports, first the companies attack us as an entity,” says Yuki Arai, the Hong Kong-based lawyer that founded Well Investments. Arai has other business interests unrelated to the companies he targets and is, to all intents and purposes, running a one-man operation. “What [the targeted companies] need to do is counter-argue and explain to investors why our claims are incorrect.” Cyberdyne chose to attack. “We have even received comment that this may be a scheme backed by clients such as short-selling funds or activists who have commissioned the analysis,” the company wrote in an email to The Journal just after the Well Investments report was released in July. “Their report has had no influence on Cyberdyne’s stock value today, and does not merit any comment. The report is based on a comparison with other robots that have completely different principles of motion and purpose of use, and suggests a lack of understanding of Cyberdyne’s technologies and potential.” Arai says his clients include short sellers. “We provide our reports to clients in advance of their release.” He also said Cyberdyne was cynical in calling out his “misunderstanding” of their technology. “Not all investors understand the technology in detail,” he countered. He said that he had conducted thorough research on the company using publicly available information, as most investors have to do before choosing where to place their cash. “If they feel I am not knowledgeable about the technology, then that is their fault.” Cyberdyne eventually granted The Journal an interview with Shinji Uga, its chief financial officer. He argued that the faint neurological signals that HAL picks up and uses—to move the device, which helps the brain’s “muscles” get stronger and patients recover from injuries faster—separates their technology from that of competitors, which creates movement with the primary aim of increasing mobility. “HAL is a device for treatment, not transport,” Uga insisted. “Our business is not focused on selling devices, but on collecting data throughout society to help advance healthcare,” he said. “We are heading into a field that is new, and does not have a lot of regulations.” That, he says, has led to delays in getting technology to the market, as healthcare regulators have, in many countries, proved unable to keep up with innovations that could change lives. “The HAL device that we have, and others that we have made public, probably constitute about 10 percent of the technologies we are developing,” Uga said. “We are eventually expecting a valuation of around ¥4 trillion.” In October, the company was valued at ¥221 billion. Uga said that most investors in the company were institutional, and in it for the long haul. Whether those investors choose to stay, put pressure on the company, or pull out is likely to define Cyberdyne’s future. SPEAK NO EVIL The problem for Cyberdyne is one that is shared by many companies in Japan. Communications departments tend to be weak. Akira Kiyota, CEO of the Japan Exchange Group, which runs the Tokyo Stock Exchange, earlier this year called short sellers “ethically questionable.” Many see things differently. “There is not a lot of pressure from shareholders on management to explain what they are doing,” stated Rupert Sutton, a consultant and director working in the fast-moving consumer goods sector with companies such as Weben Asia Ltd. and Exigo Marketing Pte. Ltd. He pointed to incidents such as Calbee’s recent foray into China, which saw the company’s venture there achieve 3 percent of its sales target before being sold on after three years. “The coverage was minimal in the press and probably at the shareholder meetings nobody will ask questions,” Sutton said. Dentsu is another case in point. This year, it has been implicated in scandals involving suspicious payments made in the buildup to Tokyo’s winning bid for the Olympic Games, and overcharging a multitude of companies for online promotion. It has also been accused of working a member of staff to death. For Sutton, these scandals are part of a larger problem for Japan. Shareholders are quiet, but so are the media. “If the Dentsu overcharging scandal hadn’t been published overseas (Australia-based AdNews got the scoop) I don’t think anybody would have been any wiser,” he said. “Publishing that [in Japan] would have been rocking the boat, and [Japanese media] do not like to have the boat rocked.” Major incidents have attracted serious attention. Over the past few years, Takata airbags have exploded, Toyota brakes have failed, Tepco nuclear reactors have melted down, and GS Yuasa batteries have burned in Boeing Dreamliners. But there are also minor incidents, and bookkeeping issues that have, in part, led to the rise of the short sellers. A major issue is the reluctance of Japanese companies to meet international standards and become more intertwined with the global economy, Sutton said. Effectively, “the Japanese way” is leading to more sympathetic treatment of management and less competitiveness. “If there was greater openness from management, more international staff, more joint ventures, and more willingness to transfer knowledge, we might see progress,” he added. “But we are talking about generational change here. Companies are top-heavy, delegation is not encouraged, and autonomy is not given, so business becomes very slow.” ABE’S ANGLE The criticisms are not unknown to Japan’s elites. Traditionally, the issues have been shrugged off, and discussion of them has been considered taboo. But that changed when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe came to power, promising to get the economy back on a growth track. His government saw corporate governance as a way of helping companies improve their behaviors and make Japan a more international place for doing business. By September, nearly all listed companies had brought outside directors on board and a new stewardship code had been adopted by more than 200 institutional investors. “I have stressed many times that corporate governance reform is at the top of my agenda,” Abe said in New York last year. “It is too early to make a decisive evaluation, but so far, from an investor’s perspective, the stewardship code is far from sufficient,” Arai of Well Investments told The Journal. “Institutional investors need to be more aggressive, and we need to see people such as Daniel Loeb [founder of hedge fund Third Point LLC] become more engaged in the Japanese market. I expect there will be more lawsuits, so management will begin to feel more concerned about what it is doing.” Short sellers are seen, by people such as Japan Exchange Group’s Kiyota, as cynics looking to make a fast buck by exploiting weaknesses in companies that could be internally resolved. Critics say that all the employees of these companies are put at risk by short-sellers’ reports in favor of allowing the wealthiest in society to make easy money. But to their advocates, short sellers play an important role in the economy, weeding out the negligent, inefficient and untruthful. This makes for a more efficient economy, increases accountability and, in the end, is a social good. At base, short sellers see themselves as mopping up the problems that corporate governance may miss. In that way, Abe has helped make the case for the short seller to come to Japan. Arai says Abe’s economic plans helped him decide to launch Well Investments. “If there had been no Abenomics,” he said, “I may not have started Well Investments. But in general, favorable winds are blowing, so . . .” As for governance and stewardship, last year The Journal spoke with Nicholas Benes, representative director of the Board Director Training Institute of Japan, who said the Government Pension Investment Fund needed to take the lead in stewardship for reforms to really take hold. A year on, the fund has revealed its individual investments. Based on the most recent figures, it held 59,300 shares in Cyberdyne.

Independent Political Report Covering third parties and independent candidates since 2008 Menu Skip to content Home About IPR Traffic Court Advertising At IPR DMCA Removal RSS Search Social Networks Subscribe To IPR Liberation News: “Bill Clinton Inc.” exposed Leave a reply Joe Delaplaine at the PSL’s Liberation News: “Hillary Clinton is a walking conflict of interest”, said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, the Executive Director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund on a recent interview on Radio Sputnik’s “Loud and Clear”. “In 2009, as the newly appointed Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton had to sign an oath –part of U.S. ethics laws, actually– confirming she had no financial conflicts with the Clinton Foundation. However, emails from Douglas Band, President of Teneo Holdings, now show Ms. Clinton violated this law and in fact continued to maintain financial ties to the Clinton Foundation after becoming Secretary of State.” In almost any other country, such revelations would be front page news, especially during a Presidential election. However in the United States, many corporate media outlets have downplayed this issue from the moment, last month, when these leaked emails were made public by Wikileaks. An article in this week’s Washington Post, “Inside Bill Clinton Inc.”, exposed influence peddling within the Clinton family’s “Clinton Foundation”, detailing conflicts of interest such as Bill Clinton being a paid adviser to and client of Teneo Holdings, while his wife served in the State Department. Another example includes, Huma Abedin, being a paid, senior adviser to Teneo Holdings while she was Mrs. Clinton’s Deputy Chief of Staff. Likewise, Declan Kelly, was a paid consultant for the Clinton family’s “Clinton Foundation” while serving as CEO and founder of Teneo Holdings. In fact, Teneo clients donated so much money to the Clintons, that Bill Clinton once boasted, “I couldn’t have accomplished half of what I have in my post-presidency without Doug Band.” These emails demonstrate many examples of ways the Clintons have long benefited from money they’ve received from lobbyists for foreign governments. Most noteworthy among them involving foreign mining company, Uranium One, which sought to own 1/5 of all uranium mining rights inside the United States. Uranium One’s deal was stalled, however, the U.S. government considered it a “national security issue” to have so much of its own uranium controlled by a “foreign” agent –in this case, Russia. The sale first had to be approved by the State Department, which at the time was headed by, Hillary Clinton. The State Department signed off on the sale. As a result, the former President, Bill Clinton, was paid half a million dollars to speak in Moscow on behalf of Russian mining corporation, “Uranium One”. The New York Times reported Uranium One’s chairman contributed $2.35 million to Bill and Hillary’s Clinton Foundation, noting, however, “those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.” Whats more, while serving as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, sold the Saudi government eighty F-15 fighter jets made by Boeing. Boeing itself donated $900 thousand to the Clinton Foundation. The resulting weapons sales by the U.S. to the Saudi government was $29.4 billion, in spite of the fact that Clinton’s own emails disclosed she was fully aware at the time that the Saudis were arming and financing Al Qaeda, ISIS and other groups branded by the U.S. government as “terrorist” organizations.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 8, 2016 at 12:05PM Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD) welcomed a new chief financial officer on Monday -- and boy, does he ever have work to do. In a few years, Aerojet Rocketdyne will have a new rocket ready for American spaceflight. In the short term, it needs to get ready to face disappointed investors. Image source: Aerojet Rocketdyne. Last month, Aerojet confirmed that it has hired away Paul R. Lundstrom from his old job as vice president of investor relations at United Technology (NYSE:UTX) to become Aerojet's new CFO. Incidentally, United Tech used to own Aerojet's Rocketdyne division during Lundstrom's tenure there, so he should be very familiar with the company already. That knowledge should come in handy, because one of the first tasks Lundstrom will be asked to achieve (by investors, at least) is to ensure Aerojet Rocketdyne hits the earnings target that Wall Street has told them to expect. The number you need to know $0.83 per share. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, that's what Wall Street analysts expect Aerojet Rocketdyne to earn this year. But with three quarters down and just one more to go, getting there is going to be a heap of work. You see, just last week, before Lundstrom even arrived on the job, Aerojet Rocketdyne announced its earnings for fiscal Q3 2016, and updated its numbers for the year to date. As far as revenue goes, the news wasn't bad: Aerojet reported modest year-over-year sales growth of 5% -- $463.8 million for the quarter. But despite growing sales, Aerojet reported no GAAP earnings in Q3, but rather a $0.17 per share net loss for its business. Thanks to this result, all the profit that Aerojet had recorded earlier in the year has now been wiped out, and Aerojet's earnings for this year have been reset to $0.00 per share. Essentially, Aerojet is back at square one. All the earnings that Wall Street expects it to earn this year, Aerojet must now earn in the fourth quarter. Can it be done? Maybe. But I don't envy Lundstrom's job trying to get the company there. Scrolling through S&P Global's copious data archives, I've found only two instances in which Aerojet Rocketdyne earned $0.83 or more in a single quarter over the past 15 years. Sure, given sufficient tax credits and other one-time items, it's theoretically possible that Aerojet Rocketdyne could pull a rabbit out of the hat and somehow report $0.83 a share. But I wouldn't bet on it. Checking in on the rocket Enough about the earnings game. The other thing investors want to know about Aerojet Rocketdyne is how its AR1 rocket engine is coming along -- the one that Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) are considering for use aboard their new Vulcan space rocket. According to management, progress is being made, and $135 million of a budgeted $804 million has already been invested in development of the AR1. Aerojet has borne roughly half the cost of this development to date, with the rest of the money coming from the U.S. government, and Boeing and Lockheed as partners in the development via ULA. Despite the progress, however, Aerojet still lags privately funded Blue Origin. Aerojet says it hopes to complete development of AR1 "no later than December 31, 2019." That may be too late to win it a place on ULA's Vulcan, however. ULA has already expressed a preference for Blue Origin's BE-4 rocket, which is expected to be ready to fly as early as 2017.  Rich Smith does not own shares of, nor is he short, any company named above.

Shane Kimbrough, the sole American astronaut aboard the International Space Station, cast his vote Monday via a digital version of the familiar federal absentee ballot.

Ivan Sekretarev/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Every four years, millions of American voters both abroad and at home US cast their ballot for president without going to the polls, mailing in absentee ballots to vote from afar. And a few ballots digitally make the 250-mile journey from the International Space Station to the Earth's surface.  This year, Shane Kimbrough, currently the only American in space, cast his ballot from the International Space Station (ISS) Monday. Kate Rubins also voted early, submitting her ballot before returning to Earth last week after a four-month stint on the ISS. For the purposes of voting, the astronauts’ address is listed as “low-Earth orbit.” The "voting process starts a year before launch, when astronauts are able to select which elections (local/state/federal) that they want to participate in while in space," NASA officials said recently in a blog post. "Then, six months before the election, astronauts are provided with a standard form: the 'Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot Request – Federal Post Card Application.' " Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Johnson Space Center sends a digital version of the classic absentee ballot to the ISS and when crewmembers have filled them out the ballots are sent directly to voting authorities, according to Johnson Space Center officials.

Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 The first American to vote in space was David Wolf in 1997, who voted from the Russian Mir Space Station. Since most astronauts lived near Houston, Texas passed a law allowing astronauts to vote while off planet in any local, state, or federal elections scheduled during their mission. "I think it's pretty amazing," Dr. Rubins said in an October interview for NASA's weekly "Space to Ground" ISS update. "It's very incredible that we're able to vote from up here, and I think it's incredibly important for us to vote in all of the elections." Their votes are particularly important because the two candidates have very different views on the future of America’s space program. Donald Trump has said he will encourage joint projects between NASA and private space companies, such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Blue Origin, but that public money is more needed in infrastructure here on Earth than on Mars. And while the Republican nominee has spoken highly of NASA, he has said that economic stability and military defense must come first. "If we are growing with all of our people employed and our military readiness back to acceptable levels, then we can take a look at the timeline for sending more people into space," Trump told Mic. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has said that she wanted to be an astronaut as a child and even wrote to NASA about what the requirements were only to be told that they were not currently accepting applications from women. In addition to promising to declassify government information on UFOs, Clinton has said that she supports private space companies but feels that the future of cosmological discoveries lies with NASA and its funding should reflect that.

Xinhua China now has one of the two most powerful rockets in the world. STRINGER/AFP/Getty Images This photo shows the blast trail of China's heavy-lift rocket Long March-5. China's space program hit a huge milestone last week with the launch of its Long March-5 rocket from the new Wenchang Space Launch Center, the nation's fourth launch site. This new heavy-lift booster gives China a rocket that is equaled in power only by the US Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle: about 25 metric tons to low-Earth orbit (LEO). China deserves credit for creating a space development plan in 1992, called Project 921, and then following through with it. Initially the Chinese space program was derided as highly derivative of Russia's launch program, but, with the new family of Long March rockets that use modern design and propellants such as refined RP-1 kerosene and liquid hydrogen, China must now be regarded as a world-class space power. At present only two nations can put humans safely into space: Russia and China. Additionally, only two nations can put medium-sized payloads into space, the United States and China. Only one nation can do both. Payload and crewed launch capabilities will allow China to build a modular space station during the next decade that will invite visitors from Europe and elsewhere and will almost certainly outlast NASA's International Space Station. While China has focused on a space station and has not yet set a definitive timeline for going into deep space, it must be noted that the country now has the capacity to mount a human mission to the Moon, if it so chooses. The Long March-5 rocket is powerful enough to stage an Earth orbit for landings on the Moon and to push a payload of about eight metric tons into a Lunar transfer orbit (LTO). "By launching and rendezvousing four of those in low Earth orbit, it would be possible for the Chinese to construct a manned lunar mission with no more than that rocket and no more than Apollo technology," former NASA Administrator Mike Griffin told the House Science, Space, and Technology committee in September, 2011. "And I've—I have in fact, in the past, written up how that mission would work from an engineering perspective. So with the Long March-5, the Chinese inherently possessed the capability to return to the Moon should they wish to do so." Enlarge / Mike Griffin, NASA's administrator under George W. Bush, wanted to remain in that position for Obama. But the president rejected Griffin's Constellation plan—and Griffin himself. If a Republican wins the 2016 election, Griffin could return to NASA or elsewhere to shape policy. NASA Five years after Griffin made those comments, the Long March-5 rocket has now flown, proving China's capability to design a large rocket around its new YF-100 engines. China has now set its sights on development of the Long March-9, a super-heavy lift rocket in the class of the Apollo program’s Saturn V rocket. This powerful rocket likely remains about 15 years from its debut and is projected to have a payload-to-LEO capacity of at least 130 metric tons and a payload-to-LTO capacity of at least 50 metric tons. American uncertainty Chinese strides in space come amidst uncertainty about America's launch efforts. While the US should regain the capability to launch US astronauts in late 2018 or 2019 thanks to NASA's decision to fund SpaceX and Boeing, it's not clear where the space agency will go after that. NASA is deep into building its own super-heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System, which has about three times the lift capacity as the Long March-5 and should fly late in this decade. But there is no clear plan in place for its use—and even if NASA had announced specific plans, those plans likely will be scrambled by the next president of the United States. This uncertainty comes as the United States finds itself in a messy transition from a state-run space program to a—potentially—more commercial one. The rise of China's space program offers an interesting contrast between socialism and capitalism in space. From the beginnings of NASA through the early 2000s, America had a largely socialistic approach to space exploration. Ironically, it was the centralized, top-down Apollo program that helped to show the world that the democratic and capitalistic United States was superior to the Soviet Union in outer space, while the Soviet Union's own space race was largely run by independent, competing design bureaus. But with the rise of SpaceX, Blue Origin, and other US-based rocket companies, the United States now has an opportunity to embrace a much more fully capitalistic approach to spaceflight. Both companies are also developing super-heavy lift rockets, the Falcon Heavy and New Glenn respectively, that will have lift capacity roughly on par with NASA's Space Launch System. Some officials, such as former NASA Deputy Administrator Lori Garver, have noted the incoherence of a centralized, big government rocket program trying to compete with private companies. For now, though, Congress seems content to stick with the Apollo model of a centralized government program. Even as lawmakers do so, it is worth considering that the United States could go back to the Moon within the next decade, too, even without waiting for SpaceX or Blue Origin. Just as the Long March-5 is powerful enough to land humans on the Moon, so too is the privately developed Delta IV Heavy rocket, manufactured by United Launch Alliance in Alabama. It remains unclear whether the United States will retain its centralized approach to space exploration, or even if the vast savings promised by privately developed rocket companies will eventually convince skeptical lawmakers in Congress to abandon a big-government approach to rocket building. While Washington sorts that out, we can rest assured that China will continue to make progress toward its own spaceflight goals.

 Exclusive: FedEx grounds one plane over GE engine part concern Reuters Nov. 7, 2016, 9:12 PM 584 facebook linkedin twitter email print General Electric employee Ron Carlson inspects a CF6-80C engine at the GE Aviation Peebles Test Operations Facility in Peebles, Ohio Thomson Reuters By Jeffrey Dastin (Reuters) - FedEx Corp is grounding one of its planes temporarily that has an engine General Electric Co flagged after a passenger jet erupted in flames last month, a spokesman for the cargo airline told Reuters on Monday. Engine-maker GE on Friday alerted airlines about a small number of parts under investigation following American Airlines Flight 383, which caught fire on Oct. 28. The parts were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk used by American, which GE subsequently discovered had a "material anomaly." While U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for the non-fatal incident, they have found what appeared to be fatigue cracking where the disk had an anomaly. Experts have said the disk's corrupted material may indicate a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker. In a statement, FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said the company was notified that an engine in one MD11 aircraft was affected. "The aircraft associated with the affected engine is temporarily not in service until the engine is replaced. Safety is our top priority,” he said. GE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service. The American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an "uncontained" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. GE has stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines, which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s.

Kantipur The Kathmandu Post saptahik Nepal Nari Radio Kantipur Kantipur TV 0Shares Share on facebookShare on twitter Money Y12e slated for test flight to Lukla - Post Report, Kathmandu Nov 8, 2016- Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) is scheduled to conduct a test flight of its Chinese-made Y12e to Lukla airport on November 23, two years after it was inducted into its fleet.  The 17-seater Y12e arrived in Kathmandu in 2014 and was intended to serve remote mountain airfields like Lukla, Jomsom, Manang, Simikot, Rara, Jumla and Dolpa. But its regulatory limit meant that it could only fly to airports with a maximum grade of up to 2 percent or about 1.2 degrees of slope. As a result, the Y12e was only operated on the Pokhara and Simara sectors, pending the issuance of a certificate by the manufacturer clearing it to serve airports with a slope of more than 2 degrees. The runway at Lukla’s Tenzing-Hillary Airport has an 11-degree slope. Most of the short take-off and landing (STOL) airfields in Nepal including Lukla in Khumbu are above the regulatory limit. According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (Caan), the aircraft manufacturer has to issue a gradient certificate after the test flight. “The manufacturer will then develop a procedural design of the aircraft on the respective airfield. Caan will then accept the technical design permitting the aircraft of such type to fly,” said a Caan official.  Although the Harbin Yunshuji Y-12-II had made thousands of flights all over Nepal and has been described as the best aircraft to serve STOL airfields, strict enforcement of new regulations by Caan to ensure safety has prevented the Y12e from flying to mountain airstrips. “After the test flight, we will decide whether to bring the three Y12e aircraft on order,” said NAC Managing Director Sugat Ratna Kansakar.  “As per the plan, we are weighing an option to bring two aircraft, one 56-seater MA60 and one Y12e by December. The other two Y12e will be inducted into the fleet after we are satisfied with its performance.” He added that except for a load restriction problem, there were no other issues with the MA60. The delivery process of the four aircraft on order, one MA60 and three Y12e, had been put on hold for the last two years after NAC reported many problems, including load restrictions, in the two that have joined its fleet. According to the performance analysis report of the Y12e aircraft submitted to the Tourism Ministry last year, it flies well in very cold weather, with performance falling with a rise in temperature and altitude. From Lukla to Kathmandu, the Y12e can carry 16 passengers in all-weather conditions; but from Kathmandu to Lukla, the passenger load has to be reduced to 13, according to the report. The Y12e is totally unsuitable for the Pokhara-Manang sector, according to the report. The allowable cabin load is seven passengers at 0 degrees, two passengers at 10 degrees, one passenger at 12 degrees and zero passengers at 14 degrees Celsius respectively. The aircraft can carry 12 passengers in all-weather conditions from Biratnagar to Taplejung. Likewise, on the Jomsom-Pokhara route, it can fly with 16 passengers in all-weather conditions; but on the return flight, the passenger load has to be reduced to 14, the report said.  According to Tourism Ministry officials, NAC has been directed to bring the remaining aircraft and fly them on selected routes where they can perform well. Last October, the Tourism Ministry had directed NAC to resume the process of taking delivery of the four planes considering pertinent issues that need to be addressed to reap the maximum benefit while flying these aircraft in Nepali skies.  The manufacturer completed assembling the three Y12e for Nepal in early 2015. The aircraft, bearing NAC livery and Nepali registration numbers, have been sitting in the factory hangar since then. China has provided one MA60 and one Y12e worth Rs2.94 billion as gifts. The other aircraft are being bought with a soft loan of Rs3.72 billion provided by China’s EXIM Bank. NAC to send off its Boeing 757 Karnali KATHMANDU: Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) has hired an appraiser from Switzerland to make a valuation of one of its two Boeing 757s it plans to phase out. According to NAC, the appraiser is scheduled to arrive in Nepal in two-three days. After getting the appraiser’s report, NAC will call for bids to sell the jet. The Karnali, bearing registration number 9N-ACA, will be retired first. It completed 29 years of service in August. The NAC board has already agreed in principle to allow the management to send off one of the two ageing 757s. The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and made its first flight on August 20. The jet flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was in production from 1981 to 2004.

The market rallied simply because it loves certainty. For months, many investors assumed Clinton would be the winner of the Presidential election. So, when the FBI said it was investigating more of Clinton's emails, stocks were sent into a tailspin as the race suddenly seemed more likely to go either way. Stocks surged again on Monday on certainty when the FBI cleared Clinton's use of a private email server. This left Cramer yearning for the market to focus on earnings, not the election. "I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election," the "Mad Money" host said. Carlos Barria | Reuters Hillary Clinton But if Clinton does declare victory, then Cramer expects the market to go back to normal the day after the election. That means Cramer's got his eye on the companies with the best earnings that can take investors through year end. The banks were the best winners of earnings season, as they generated bigger profits than anyone expected. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and KeyCorp all blew Cramer away. Of the soft financials, Cramer was most impressed with Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The second group that performed well was the social, mobile and cloud stocks like Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Accenture. Transports were also a puzzling winner, as most railroads and airlines didn't make the numbers, but will likely do much better next year. Cramer liked United Continental and Norfolk Southern as comeback options. Basic industrials were also a surprise, thanks to an increase in Chinese business, a turn in Europe and an improved airline cycle. Boeing was Cramer's top pick, followed by United Technologies and Honeywell. The biggest disappointment for Cramer was the restaurants. Besides the Cheesecake Factory and Domino's Pizza, most earnings were downright miserable. The home improvement space also took a step backward with weak numbers from Masco, Sherwin-Williams and PPG. The apparel segment was also hit hard, led by Nike and Under Armour. The health care group showed promise for Cramer, courtesy of a snap back after being severely oversold. Merck delivered a strong quarter, and Cramer said he is "still reeling from the lack of respect given to Celgene." "If you look at where the money wants to go, and you figure that this election will pass …. I think that the above description of the earnings season to date will hold up until year end," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Business Stocks surge on the last day before the presidential election Wall Street Mark Lennihan / Associated Press The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. The New York Stock Exchange on Wall Street. (Mark Lennihan / Associated Press) James F. PeltzContact Reporter Stocks rose sharply Monday to end a nine-day slide after the FBI said it found no new evidence to warrant charges against Hillary Clinton on the eve of the U.S. presidential election. The market’s major indexes, including the Standard & Poor’s 500, rose 2% or more — their best daily percentage gain in eight months — as the Clinton news removed one of the key elements of uncertainty that have weighed on Wall Street for more than a week. Stocks worldwide also rallied, as did crude oil prices and yields on U.S. Treasury securities. The U.S. dollar was mixed against other major currencies. The S&P 500 had dropped 3% over the last nine trading sessions, the longest consecutive losing streak for the benchmark indicator in 36 years, in large part after FBI Director James B. Comey said the agency was again reviewing Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of State. But Comey said Sunday that there was still no basis for criminal charges against the Democratic candidate, removing a major element of risk to the market’s outlook should she be elected over Republican candidate Donald Trump.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index climbed 2.4% to 5,166.17. Intel Corp., based in Santa Clara, Calif., surged 3.2% to lead the gainers in the Dow Jones industrials. Microsoft Corp. gained 2.9%. Shares of Irvine data storage firm Western Digital Corp. rose 4.8%. Financial stocks also climbed sharply, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. up more than 3%. LendingClub Corp. jumped 15.2% after the San Francisco online lender posted third-quarter results showing losses that were smaller than analysts expected and sales that were much larger.  Tuesday’s election continues to pose a huge unknown for the markets, especially with Trump vowing big changes in U.S. trade policies and complaining about Federal Reserve policies under Chairwoman Janet L. Yellen. Despite the market’s recent setback, both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrials are more than 4% above their levels at the start of the year. One explanation is that most business and financial indicators are betting on a continuation of the current path in government, with Clinton being elected and generally extending the Obama administration’s policies, kept in check by a GOP-controlled House. If Trump wins, analysts said, that might deliver a shock to the markets similar to the one in June caused by Britain’s vote to leave the European Union; at that time, stocks briefly suffered major losses. Crude oil for near-term delivery rose 82 cents to $44.89 a barrel. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes jumped to 1.83% from 1.78% on Friday.  Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump, nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

During an interview with CNBC, Musk said investigators had figured out why a Falcon 9 rocket burst into flames on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine, preflight test. The accident destroyed a $200 million Israeli communications satellite and grounded the Falcon 9 fleet for the second time in 14 months. Scroll down for video  On September 1, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket (pictured) exploded as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Musk now says this was caused by a fueling system issue that created solid oxygen in the supper stage tank SATELLITE FIRM CLAIMING DAMAGES FROM SPACEX   The Israeli owners of the destroyed AMOS-6 satellite have reportedly been hard hit by the loss. In a press conference last month, Spacecom said it could seek $50m from SpaceX following the explosion on the launch pad last week. AMOS-6 was supposed to provide home internet for Africa and the Middle East.  In addition, Facebook had signed a deal with Eutelsat to lease broadband capacity from the satellite as part of its efforts to increase internet connectivity across the African continent. The cause of the accident was a fueling system issue that inadvertently produced solid oxygen inside the rocket's upper stage tank. The oxygen then reacted with a carbon composite bottle containing liquid helium that sits inside the oxygen tank, triggering an explosion. 'I think we've gotten to the bottom of the problem,' said Musk, who is also chief executive of Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O). He added that the issue had never been encountered in the history of rocketry. Musk did not specify what mission would launch next, nor whether SpaceX would fly from a new launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, or from its West Coast site at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. SpaceX's primary launch pad, located just south of Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, was damaged in the Sept. 1 accident. SpaceX has declined to release details on the extent of damage. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Southern Hemisphere recovered TWICE as fast as the North...

Also on Friday, NASA and Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N) said Orbital's next cargo run to the International Space Station would use the heavier-lift Atlas 5 rocket, made by United Launch Alliance, rather than Orbital's Antares booster. The switch will allow NASA to fly an extra 660 pounds (300 kg) of cargo to the station while SpaceX returns to flight. SpaceX's primary launch pad, located just south of Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, was damaged in the Sept. 1 accident. The explosion destroyed the rocket and the satellite it was carrying (pictured) NASA hired Orbital and SpaceX to fly cargo to the station after the shuttles were retired in 2011. Terms of Orbital's contract with United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N), were not released. The launch is targeted for early 2017, NASA said. But, a proposal by SpaceX to fuel its rockets while astronauts are aboard poses safety risks, a group of space industry experts that advises NASA has told the U.S. space agency. 'This is a hazardous operation,' Space Station Advisory Committee Chairman Thomas Stafford, a former NASA astronaut and retired Air Force general, said during a conference call last Monday. SpaceX's founder and CEO, Elon Musk (pictured), called the failure 'the most difficult and complex' the company has ever had Elon Musk took to Twitter on September 9 seeking 'support and advice' as the investigation continues. SpaceX wrote a similar message on its Twitter account as well, which was retweeted by the billionaire SpaceX CEO Stafford said the group's concerns were heightened after an explosion of an unmanned SpaceX rocket while it was being fueled on Sept. 1. Members of the eight-member group, including veterans of NASA's Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs, noted that all previous rockets carrying people into space were fueled before astronauts got to the launch pad. 'Everybody there, and particularly the people who had experience over the years, said nobody is ever near the pad when they fuel a booster,' Stafford said, referring to an earlier briefing the group had about SpaceX's proposed fueling procedure. SpaceX is hoping for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now ELON MUSK'S 'INTERPLANETARY TRANSPORT SYSTEM'  Last month, Elon Musk unveiled his most ambitious project yet - an 'Interplanetary Transport System' to take mankind to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there. 'What I want to achieve is make Mars seem possible, to show that we can do it in our lifetimes, and you could go,' he said at the International Astronautical Congress in Mexico. However, he warned the trip was likely to be dangerous - and said candidates for the first missions 'must be prepared to die'.   The Interplanetary Transport System will use a giant rocket booster with a 39 foot (12m) diameter and 49 engines, and a special shuttle with a 56 foot (17m) diameter, making the entire rocket stack 400 feet (122m) high.  They will launch with empty fuel tanks and refuel in orbit. Once on Mars, they would make more methane fuel for the return journey.  SpaceX needs NASA approval of its launch system before it can put astronauts into space.     Last month, Elon Musk unveiled his most ambitious project yet - an 'Interplanetary Transport System' to take mankind to Mars in 80 days and build a sustainable human colony of a million people there.

The shares rose. Follow @Brexit for the latest news, and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin for a daily roundup. Profit after tax increased 8.2 percent to 912 million euros in the three months through September, Dublin-based Ryanair said on Monday. Analysts predicted earnings of 897 million euros, based on the average of four estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company stuck to its full-year earnings forecast and raised its long-term passenger target by more than 10 percent. “Ryanair is doing very well in tough times as people trade down to lower fares,” Chief Executive Michael O’Leary said in a Bloomberg Television interview. If profits continue to rise, the airline will most likely continue buybacks after the current one is completed by February, he said. Ryanair is attracting passengers by cutting fares, increasing the number of seats and adding larger airports to its schedule as it battles against expansion by competitors. While cheaper tickets boosted Ryanair’s passenger tally by 12 percent in the first half to a record 64.8 million, pricing pressure and economic uncertainty resulting from the U.K.’s decision to leave the European Union are clouding the outlook.  By putting a firm number behind its buyback plans, the company is “saying to investors ‘okay this is real,’ ” Gerald Khoo, analyst at Liberum Capital said by phone. “They’ve previously talked about it, but opportunistically. Now they’ve made an actual commitment.” The shares climbed as much as 6.3 percent, the most in more than three months, to 13.54 euros and were trading at 13.40 euros at 10:44 a.m. in Dublin, shaving the year’s loss to 13 percent. “Cautious” Outlook Ryanair is betting that economic uncertainty and falling fares could help it grow, as its low-cost base allows it to grab market share by undercutting rivals. The company raised its long-term passenger target, saying it will have more than 200 million customers by 2024, up from the previously forecast 180 million. Still, Ryanair said it’s “cautious” on its outlook for this fiscal year and warned that its short-term view may need to be cut again. Last month the company had finally bowed to Brexit by downgrading its full-year guidance, saying that the sterling’s depreciation was denting pricing more than anticipated. “Weaker airfares and Brexit uncertainty will be the dominant features of the second half,” the company said, predicting winter fare declines between 13 percent and 15 percent. Full-year guidance is “heavily dependent upon there being no unexpected adverse declines in fourth-quarter airfares.” For now, Ryanair stuck to its forecast that profit for the full year will grow to between 1.30 billion euros and 1.35 billion euros. To avoid some of the Brexit turmoil, Ryanair has started hedging its U.K. currency exposure and is shifting expansion away from the U.K. and to other European countries where it says incumbent carriers are retreating amid lower fares. “What worries me about Brexit is the U.K. government clearly has no idea what it’s doing,” O’Leary said. “Ryanair is in negotiations with airports across Europe,” where “frankly the costs are lower and at least you have political certainty.” Boeing Deal Ryanair, infamous for sending passengers to airports far outside the major cities they serve, will fly to more primary hubs by the end of the year, it said in the statement. Last week, the carrier said it would base two aircraft at Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s Frankfurt hub, reversing an earlier decision to never fly there. The company is also considering flying out of Paris’s Orly or Charles de Gaulle airport, O’Leary said. As it looks to increase its passenger count, Ryanair may decide to add airplanes by converting some of its 100 options to buy 737 MAX airplanes from Boeing Co. “in the next year or two,” O’Leary said. In addition, the carrier will hold onto some aircraft originally planned for sale and extend some leases. The airline is now forecasting a fleet of 585 aircraft by 2024 up from plans for about 546. At the same time, the carrier is continuing to rein in costs, now expected to fall by 3 percent in the full-year, instead of a more modest 1 percent decline. Ryanair will have lowered costs by about 5 percent since starting its Always Getting Better marketing strategy three years ago, O’Leary said. The campaign has focused on refining Ryanair’s image and website, offering a range of paid-for extras to entice more business passengers and targeting more primary airports.

Smith / November 6th, 2016 . . . the potential first female president represent[s] a purely cosmetic form of diversity that works against the structural changes that need to be made at every level of culture and politics to expose and depose a political class that has acted with impunity to promote policies that benefit wealthy donors and powerful multinational corporations. — Professor Catherine Liu Hillary Clinton is not responsible for the terrible policies of the Bush Administration, but she is responsible for following in lock-step with those policies during her tenure as Secretary of State under the Obama Administration. — Robin D., Tits and Sass That’s a wicked woman. — Minister Louis Farrakhan It is a staple observation of modern feminism that a woman has to be twice as capable as a man to go half as far in her career, which should mean that in the negative profession of U.S. politics a woman has to be four times as evil as a man in order to capture the presidency. With this in mind we can certainly agree that Hillary Clinton is “far more qualified” than Donald Trump to be president. The only question is how many more years the human race can be expected to survive such “qualified” leaders. Apparently suffering from a permanent case of what used to be called “the vapors,” liberals aghast at Donald Trump’s “racism” continually overlook the fact that Hillary backed Bill Clinton’s 1994 crime bill, which railroaded an entire generation of young blacks into prison on the pretext that they were “super-predators,” (Hillary’s term), a reformulation of the Jim Crow era’s “bestial black brutes,” always supposedly in need of a good lynching or (nowadays) a long prison term. No surprise that Hillary has close ties to the private prison industry, which grows fat on the crushed lives of the desperately poor, all too many of them black. Recall that Bill Clinton campaigned for the presidency lecturing blacks about “personal responsibility,” playing on racist stereotypes that they were hyper-actively and irresponsibly sexual, an amazing display of chutzpah given his own predilections. Furthermore, his deliberate distortion of Sister Souljah’s remarks about black lives not mattering (*Clinton claimed Souljah was calling for the murder of white people when, in fact, her point was that IF black gang members killed whites instead of each other a racist media would at least cover the story, which it does not do when blacks are doing all the dying) was a transparent attempt to put blacks at the back of the Clinton victory bus, which he clearly thought was their “place.” Such is the thinking of “New Democrats,” and Hillary is one of them. Hillary also strongly supported president Clinton’s 1996 “welfare reform,” which plunged another million American children into poverty (a disproportionate number of them black children) at a time when the U.S already had the highest rate of child poverty in the developed world. The Children’s Defense Fund (which Hillary worked for fresh out of law school) condemned the Clintons publicly for this, with founder Marian Wright Edelman opining that Bill Clinton’s “signature on this pernicious bill makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children.” By 2002 Hillary was so proud of welfare reform that she bragged, “These people are no longer deadbeats, they’re actually out there being productive” (italics added). Note her language – deadbeat – which is a synonym for sponger, and virtually identical to Adolf Hitler’s “useless eaters.” Note as well that the majority of welfare beneficiaries have always been children, prevented by child labor laws from being “productive.” In other words, her feminism is a fraud. She staunchly opposes welfare, a $15 an hour minimum wage, and Medicare for all, establishment stances that keep millions of women mired in dismal poverty. And she loves war, which always increases rape, and champions military interventions that strengthen ISIS, famous for practicing femicide and sex slavery as masculine ideals. During her husband’s terms in the presidency, Hillary crafted his “triangulation” strategy and helped advance Republican orthodoxy across the board: “social” spending for police, prisons, and war; NAFTA, which off-shored 682,000 American jobs; a racist drug war (penalties for crack cocaine favored by black users were far harsher than those for powder cocaine used by whites); an expansion of capital punishment; a massive assault on the First Amendment via the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, budget austerity; Star Wars; runaway prison construction; the dismissal of unions and unemployment as policy concerns; the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which exempted credit default swaps from regulation and helped usher in economic collapse. As Secretary of State she focused laser-like on the needs of corporate capital, which she confused with the national interest. According to the Wall Street Journal, she “redefined the job in ways that promoted the interests of U.S. business.” Among recent secretaries the Journal found her “one of the most aggressive global cheerleaders for American companies,” lobbying foreign governments to “sign deals and change policies to the advantage of corporate giants” like General Electric, Exxon Mobil, Boeing, and Microsoft.” According to an analysis by the paper, at least sixty companies that lobbied the State Department during Hillary’s tenure as Secretary of State also donated over $26 million to the Clinton Foundation “charity.” How did Hillary do as Secretary of State? A Stanford-NYU study soon after she left office concluded that from June 2004 through mid-September 2012 U.S. drone strikes killed thousands of people in Pakistan alone. Meanwhile, U.S.-brokered arms sales rose to an all-time high on her watch, to $66.3 billion in 2011, more than 75% of the global arms market, driven by major deals with autocratic Persian Gulf states. President Obama said that the arms deals would be good for jobs and the State Department said that in such an insecure region it would be good for security. But what kind of security? A 2009 cable published by WikiLeaks offers a hint. The document has Hillary admitting that Saudi Arabia, a major U.S. arms recipient, is “the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.” In short, “security” means sending more fuel to the arsonists who want to burn our house down. All of which makes it difficult to take seriously Hillary’s advocacy of “smart power,” which  simply means using every conceivable means to advance Washington’s world hegemony. “Human rights” is a favorite theme, even as Washington continually tramples on international law and the sovereignty of nations to achieve it. Most alarming is Clinton’s continual portrayal of Vladimir Putin as “Hitler,” thus dismissing any role for genuine diplomacy. When Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur crashed in Southeastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014, killing all 298 people on board, Hillary immediately blamed Putin and urged European countries to attack Russia, though there was no evidence to back up her claim. “There should be outrage in European capitals,” she said, adding the brain-dead Cold War adage that “the only language [Putin] understands” is toughness. She declared that Putin was “pushing the envelope as far as he thinks he can,” suggesting that the Russian president had deliberately shot down the plane in order to test Western resolve. To this day she maintains that Putin “must be punished,” a policy that obviously runs a high risk of nuclear war. By comparison, Donald Trump’s call for the U.S. and Russia to “get along” and solve problems through negotiation seems stunningly brilliant. In spite of her dismal record, Hillary shamelessly affects great concern for the fate of “women and girls” around the world, but as with all her other high-minded rhetoric, it rings hollow. Not quite a year before her “good friend” Madeleine Albright declared to Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes that killing 500,000 Iraqi children via economic blockade was “worth it” because of the perceived political gains involved, Hillary intoned that, “It is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are girls.” Note that the motive, not the killing, is what she finds reprehensible. If you kill girls not because they are girls, but simply for being Iraqi, that’s OK. And you can kill hundreds of thousands of them. No surprise, then, that Hillary believes the solution to the humanitarian crisis of Syrian refugees is to obliterate their country with bombs. The 2011 destruction of Libya was at Hillary’s initiative, as she convinced a reluctant Secretary Gates and President Obama to intervene, reducing a country that had had the highest standard of living in Africa to a chaotic ruin presided over by ISIS gangs, who now roam the beaches beheading people. At the same time as Hillary was arguing that U.S. military intervention was justified because the Libyan government was using violence against its political opponents, Washington’s head-chopping allies in Saudi Arabia were sending thousands of troops into Bahrain in support of a monarchy doing the same thing. Hillary told the Bahranian crown prince, “Violence is not and cannot be the answer. A political process is.” But not in Libya, which U.S. bombs devastated perhaps beyond repair. Former U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, one of the four U.S. diplomats killed in Benghazi, revealed what all the talk of Qaddafi being a “dictator” was really about. He said Qaddafi was getting tough with U.S. oil companies because he wanted to use more oil for Libyan purposes, like funding regional development to prevent terrorism, and to establish an independent African alternative to the United States African Command. In other words, Qaddafi wanted Libyan national resources to support Libyan purposes, which conflicted with the needs of foreign investors and the U.S. military, so he had to be overthrown and killed. Cables from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli confirm that the U.S. objected to the Libyan government’s belief that the United States African Command was a “vehicle for latter day colonialism.” The world is plastered with U.S. military bases and awash in U.S. sponsored bloodbaths, but we’re not colonialists, and we’ll kill anyone who says we are, unless they let us govern their country for them. By all accounts, Hillary is up to the job. Sources:1 Michael K.

The Malaysia-based is growing its Thai destinations. - + Malindo Air is strengthening its coverage in Thailand with the inauguration of regular flights from Kuala Lumpur to Phuket on Nov 10. The airline, 51% owned by the National Aerospace & Defence Industries Sdn Bhd of Malaysia and 49% by Indonesia's Lion Group, will operate four weekly flights on the new route, an airline insider in Bangkok told the Bangkok Post. The launch of the flights to Phuket comes on the heels of the airline's second route to Thailand, Kuala Lumpur-Chiang Mai, which took off on October 30 with a daily flight. Malindo Air's launch of flights to Phuket and Chiang Mai form part of its accelerated expansion into Thailand from its Malaysian base, complementing its initial sole route: Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok. Malindo commenced flying to Bangkok's Don Mueang airport in April 2014, offering as many as 17 flights a week. The airline will deploy a Boeing 737-800 narrow-body jet with 162 seats, including 12 in business class, on the Phuket flights, the same arrangement used on its flights to Bangkok and Chiang Mai. Malindo will compete head-to-head with Malaysia AirAsia and Malaysia Airlines, which are already operating on the Kuala Lumpur-Phuket route. The airline aims to fly mostly tourists from Malaysia and possibly Indonesia to the resort. Malindo has been ratcheting up its international expansion as it moves towards becoming a full-service airline with a closer association with the Lion Group.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:30 AM, November 8, 2016 Updated: 12:30 PM, November 8, 2016 FedEx Corp is grounding one of its planes temporarily that has an engine General Electric Co flagged after a passenger jet erupted in flames last month, a spokesman for the cargo airline told Reuters on Monday. Engine-maker GE on Friday alerted airlines about a small number of parts under investigation following American Airlines Flight 383, which caught fire on Oct. 28. The parts were made from the same lot of alloy as a turbine disk used by American, which GE subsequently discovered had a "material anomaly." While U.S. investigators have yet to assign blame for the non-fatal incident, they have found what appeared to be fatigue cracking where the disk had an anomaly. Experts have said the disk's corrupted material may indicate a manufacturing defect, either by the parts or metal maker. In a statement, FedEx spokesman Chris Allen said the company was notified that an engine in one MD11 aircraft was affected. "The aircraft associated with the affected engine is temporarily not in service until the engine is replaced. Safety is our top priority," he said. GE on Friday said all but one of the parts related to the anomalous disk were out of service. The component on the now-grounded FedEx plane had been the one in operation, GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said on Monday. "The part has been taken out of service, not because it was viewed as defective but because it was simply from the same lot of material," Kennedy said in a statement. The American Airlines flight from Chicago to Miami aborted takeoff following an "uncontained" engine failure, a rare event in which components spew from an engine and can tear through an aircraft cabin or rupture fuel tanks in the wings. The airline was flying a Boeing Co 767 aircraft with CF6-80C2 engines made by GE. In this instance, the failure caused a fuel leak that resulted in a fire, though no one aboard was seriously injured. GE has stressed the reliability of its CF6 engines, which it said had flown more than 400 million hours since the 1970s.

By Brianna Gurciullo 11/07/16 10:00 AM EST With help from Tanya Snyder and Lauren Gardner WHO'S LIABLE WHEN A SELF-DRIVING CAR CRASHES? As excitement grows for driverless cars, consensus is building around the idea that automakers, not drivers, will be held responsible for crashes in the future, as our Tanya Snyder reports for Pros. Knowing that they would face legal responsibility, manufacturers could hesitate to roll out self-driving vehicles or jack up their prices to recover projected costs, which would slow widespread use. Story Continued Below Drivers aren't off the hook yet: Still, Tanya points out that cars without steering wheels or pedals probably won’t become the norm on American roads for decades. In the meantime, human drivers could be found at fault for accidents for a number of reasons: They didn’t take over steering when the vehicle warned them to do so, they didn’t get a broken sensor replaced or they used the car in circumstances that the automaker warned it couldn’t handle. Lots to be determined: One of the main arguments for developing self-driving cars is that the technology will drastically reduce crashes across the country — the overwhelming majority of which are caused by human mistakes. But crashes involving driverless cars, though fewer, could be costlier and deadlier, Tanya reports. In theory, carmakers could shift some liability onto a third party that certifies a vehicle’s safety before it is available on the market. But the industry has already protested DOT’s suggestion that it may explore acquiring premarket approval power.

As our Lauren Gardner reports, reciprocal switching occurs “when one freight carrier moves goods to an interchange where another railroad takes over the cars for a fee.” “The proposal is intended to give shippers more leeway to ask STB to order reciprocal switching, a practice sanctioned by law today but that the board has never granted outside voluntary agreements between railroads,” Lauren reports. “Shippers say the bar has been set too high for them to successfully compel freights to switch despite complaints about competition, while freights say the lack of cases shows the current rules work.” Pros can check out the full story here. GERMAN INVESTIGATION OF VOLKSWAGEN EXPANDS: Prosecutors in Germany are now including Hans Dieter Poetsch, the chairman of VW’s supervisory board, in their investigation of possible market manipulation connected to the automaker’s emissions scandal, Reuters reports. Poetsch was the company’s CFO before he took the role of chairman last year. Prosecutors made their investigation public in June and said they would focus “on evidence that VW’s duty to disclose possible financial damage from the emissions test cheating may have arisen before Sept. 22, 2015, when it publicly admitted wrongdoing,” according to Reuters. And now … carbon emissions? Meanwhile, the California Air Resources Board found that some Audi vehicles had software that seemed to let them cheat testing for carbon dioxide emissions, the Wall Street Journal reports. VW’s year-long scandal has involved diesel engines and nitrogen oxides. What CARB found involves both diesel and gasoline engines and CO2. Bild am Sonntag, a German newspaper, first reported about CARB’s findings. RIDE-HAILING, CAR-SHARING DEALS FOR ELECTION DAY: MT gathered some special offers for getting to and from the polls Tuesday in the D.C area. (Note: This roundup is probably not exhaustive, and make sure to click the links for details!) Zipcar is letting users reserve a limited number of cars for free between 6 and 10 p.m. Because of the latest SafeTrack surge, car2go is temporarily lowering its hourly and daily rates and offering free registration. Uber and Google partnered to give app users a feature that helps them find their polling place and request a ride to it, but there’s no discount. Lyft users can get a 45 percent discount (in tribute to the soon-to-be-chosen 45th president of the United States) on a single ride from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., as The Verge reports. That means they can take a discounted ride to their polling location but not on the way back home. THIS WEEK: Wednesday — NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind gives a talk called “Highly Automated Vehicles: Challenges and Opportunities” at Volpe. Thursday — NHTSA holds a public meeting on its driverless car guidance. Transportation for America holds an expert panel discussion in Minneapolis on the election’s effects on transportation policy. FRA and NJ Transit hold an open house in New Jersey on the Hudson Tunnel Project. NJ TRANSIT HEAD SHARES RESULTS OF FRA PROBE: New Jersey Transit’s new executive director promised on Friday that the agency would address a slew of safety violations that FRA identified months before a deadly crash in Hoboken. At a state legislative hearing Friday, Steven Santoro said FRA had discovered that employees used their personal cellphones while working and sometimes failed to do brake testing. The federal agency also found that trains needed emergency equipment and workers didn’t always blow horns at crossings, POLITICO New Jersey's Katherine Landergan reports. Santoro said that, in response to the FRA investigation, his agency is doing more inspections and has toughened penalties for employees who break the rules. He said that NJ Transit is on track to implement PTC by the federal government’s deadline of December 2018. PTC at Hoboken? Santoro also said that NJ Transit would explore whether the Hoboken terminal should have PTC or some other safety technology, The Associated Press reports. The terminal received an exemption from PTC requirements six years ago. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, has now questioned whether terminals should be given such an exemption. ICYMI: Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly, former allies of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, were convicted on Friday in the trial over shutting down lanes to the George Washington Bridge three years ago. As Ryan Hutchins reports for POLITICO New Jersey, prosecutors claimed that the lanes were shut down to get back at the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, who didn’t endorse Christie for reelection at the time. Christie, in a statement, said he “had no knowledge prior to or during these lane realignments” and he “will set the record straight in the coming days regarding the lies that were told by the media and in the courtroom.” Reaction from Hillary Clinton’s campaign: Press secretary Brian Fallon (@brianefallon) tweeted Friday: “I know Trump does not do press conferences any more but he should be pressed on whether he is going to keep Christie as his Transition chair.” Running mate Mike Pence said Sunday that there aren’t any plans to make Christie step down, as POLITICO’s Jeremy Herb reported. POSSIBLE PRECLEARANCE EXPANSION MOVES FORWARD: DHS announced Friday the 11 airports that are its newest candidates for Preclearance. The airports are in nine countries, mostly in Latin America and Western Europe. Every year, over 10 million people take flights from the airports to the United States, according to DHS. The expansion depends on negotiations between the United States and the host countries, as our Lauren Gardner reports for Pros. It would be the first time that a South American country is included in the program. Roger Dow, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, lauded the announcement in a statement Friday. “Giving travelers an innovative, convenient and efficient entry process with Preclearance sends the message that they are welcome here — and those who feel welcomed are more likely to visit again,” Dow said. IG IDENTIFIES FLAWS IN FTA’S TRANSIT SYSTEM OVERSIGHT: FTA needs benchmarks for finishing up its policies on acquiring and then giving back safety oversight authority over rail transit systems, according to DOT’s inspector general. As your MT host reports for Pros, the transit industry is confused about when and how the federal agency would assume oversight of a system. The IG’s other findings: FTA lacks the staffing and resources it needs in its Office of Transit Safety and Oversight, the federal agency hasn’t developed an oversight program focused on data and risk, and its standards aren’t enforceable. In the case of its oversight of WMATA, FTA hasn’t finalized its policies for the undertaking, causing “significant frustration.” SHIFTING GEARS: Wednesday is Donelle Harder’s last day as communications director for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Harder is heading to Oklahoma City for a new job. Over at Boeing, Anne Marie Chotvacs has joined the company as senior director of international operations and policy. For eight years, she served as clerk and staff director of the the House Appropriations’ Foreign Operations Subcommittee, our friends at POLITICO Influence report. John Blazey also got a promotion — to vice president of global corporate citizenship in Chicago. Nicole Vernon is taking Blazey’s place as vice president of transportation and aviation. THE AUTOBAHN: — “A slow ride toward the future of public transportation.” The New York Times. — “Victims of Palm Springs bus crash may face years of uncertainty over compensation.” The Los Angeles Times. — “Report: Bus driver may've lost consciousness in other crash.” The Associated Press. — “'Tolls are coming’ to Germany’s autobahns.” POLITICO Europe. — “Gov. Wolf seeks end to transit strike, city calls for election-day suspension.” The Philadelphia Inquirer. — “Coast Guard orders unsafe ship to stay in Baltimore, stranding its crew.” The Baltimore Sun. — “Potential bidders for Takata may balk at GM bankruptcy precedent.” Reuters. THE COUNTDOWN: DOT appropriations run out in 32 days. The FAA reauthorization expires in 326 days. The 2016 presidential election is in 1 day! Highway and transit policy is up for renewal in 1,426 days. ** A message from the National Association of Manufacturers: Great nations build and invest in great infrastructure. When communities have greater access to economic opportunities and when manufacturers have efficient ways to move goods to market, the quality of life rises, productivity soars and societies thrive. Current U.S. infrastructure, however, is in an alarming state of disrepair and in urgent need of strong investments. Manufacturers want to #BeTheSolution. So as we call for healing and moving our country forward, we are calling for a major investment in renewing our transportation systems and advancing energy infrastructure. Americans are demanding a stronger, more inclusive economy. And that’s why infrastructure can be part of the answer. Historical data indicates that previous significant investments in infrastructure have aligned with high levels of growth and more aggressive economic activity. That starts with sending WRDA to the President’s desk this year. In 2017,the President-elect and Congress must act boldly.

About Armed With Science | Privacy Policy | Disclaimer Search for:   Skip to content Featured Technology Space Matters Cyber Security Robots Lasers Army Researchers Search for Technology Solutions to Defeat Sand Posted on November 7, 2016 by challer By David McNally ARL Public Affairs Armor is good protection against an enemy, but what if the enemy is so small that it takes aircraft down from the inside? Sand and dust can significantly damage a helicopter engine, which is why the Department of Defense is united in its hunt for a technology solution to protect aviators from this dangerous enemy. At the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, scientists and engineers experiment with coatings in high-temperature environments with the goal of creating something — anything — that will cause sand to slide off the inside of a turbine engine the way an egg slides off a nonstick skillet. “We are going through a very methodical process to understand the underpinning science and then use the science to predict the materials, what we call the engineered or tailored materials, that will lead to the right solution,” explained Dr. Anindya Ghoshal, chief scientist for the laboratory’s Vehicle Technology Directorate. Besides the danger of low-visibility, sand and dust wreak havoc inside aircraft engines. As molten sand accumulates inside gas turbine engines, air flow is restricted caused loss of power. Army scientists and engineers are working to discover sandphobic coatings to save lives. (Photo Credit: U.S. Army) Ghoshal leads the Army’s efforts to develop what he calls “sandphobic” coatings. “We are facing, especially in Southwest Asia, and other places, brown-out conditions,” he said. “We have a lot of dust particles that blow out, especially when you’re hovering. We get these sand particulates and other dust particulates that get ingested into the engine. “Our goal is to have the particles strike the blades or vanes [inside a gas turbine engine] and then flake off,” he said. “When we started looking into this problem, we found that in order to look at a very basic research level we want to understand the physical chemical behavior. Once we can do that, then our idea is to take that model and then predict the type of material that would enable us to develop this sandphobic coating.” Army scientist Dr. Michael Walock (left) explains the operation of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory’s hot particulate ingestion rig to ARL post-doctoral fellow Dr. Andy Nieto. (Photo Credit: David McNally) Helicopters have filtration systems that attempt to filter out larger particles, but Ghoshal said micron-sized particles go through the turbine’s combustor and adhere to the blades. This chokes the airflow and can lead to engine loss. “We have a unique rig here,” said Dr. Michael Walock, a physicist on the sandphobic coatings team. “The hot particulate ingestion rig allows us to shoot sand into the hot-gas flow at small level components and rapidly prototype new coating materials. With this system we’ve done a world-first. We used high-speed imaging to confirm the molten state of the sand particles impacting onto these thermal barrier coatings.” Computer simulations are also helping researchers arrive at a technology solution. A hot particulate ingestion rig replicates temperatures inside a gas turbine engine, allowing Army scientists and engineers to shoot sand into a hot gas flow and experiment with different coatings solutions. (Photo Credit: David McNally) “Computer modeling will play a big role in helping us to look at the interactions between particles and the surface,” said Dr. Muthuvel Murugan, acting team lead for the lab’s Turbomachinery Research Team. “The particles go through a phase change from solid to liquid and then they deposit onto the surface.” At the Army’s Vehicle Research Laboratory, the team shot high-speed videos, revealing molten sand particles splattering on turbine blade material targets and then vaporizing – a first in the scientific community. “Computer modeling of this multi-physics complex phenomena will allow us to understand the damage mechanisms,” he said. Murugan said they hope to use the power of supercomputers at the DOD High Performance Computing Center also located at APG. “We will use advanced computational fluid dynamics together with particle ingestion to better understand the interaction mechanisms of sand particles at gas turbine engine relevant high temperature,” he said. “When we simulate how particles go through the flow-field and impact and adhere to the surface, then we can understand the vulnerable parts of the turbine blade and engineer a sandphobic coatings solution.” Sandphobic coatings research is part of a larger strategic effort the Army lab officials call the Science for Maneuver Campaign. “With this campaign, we hope to discover, innovate and transition science and technology-enabled capabilities that will significantly increase the force effectiveness and global responsiveness of the Army,” said acting ARL Director Dr. Philip Perconti. “As we look to how we’re going to enable the Army of the future, we see a need to discover technology solutions that will result in improvements in aviation responsiveness and the minimization of vulnerabilities.” Earlier this year, Ghoshal’s team received DOD funding through the Laboratory University Collaboration Initiative, or LUCI, which means $600,000 over three years in collaboration with a National Security Science and Engineering Faculty fellow. Ghoshal is teaming with Dr. Jian Luo at the University of California San Diego. “There is a close collaboration going on within the community to solve this problem,” Ghoshal said. Ghoshal is also working closely with other universities, industry and government agencies, such as The Ohio State University; University of Connecticut; University of North Texas; Iowa State University; University of North Dakota; Boeing; the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center; the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory; the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command; and NASA. In 2015, the team presented initial findings, “Turbomachinery Blade Thermomechanical Interface Science and Sandphobic Coatings Research,” to the American Helicopter Society International 71st Annual Forum at Virginia Beach, Virginia. The paper received the “Best Paper Award in Propulsion Sessions at the conference, Ghoshal said. New research from the team will also be published in the January 2017 Advances in Aircraft and Spacecraft Sciences, an international journal. “I strongly believe that in the next three to five years we will have not only one, but several solutions,” Ghoshal said. “It will definitely save a lot of Soldiers’ lives in the long run. Our solutions will make our Soldiers’ lives safe and will make our Army stronger.” Follow the Department of Defense on Facebook and Twitter! ———- Disclaimer: The appearance of hyperlinks does not constitute endorsement by the Department of Defense of this website or the information, products or services contained therein.

Completion of the deal, which was agreed in July, depends on Meridiana meeting certain unspecified conditions, Qatar Airways Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker said in an e-mailed statement Sunday. “We are hoping to have our discussions concluded by the end of January,” he said. “During this period, Meridiana Fly also has to deliver certain conditions and achieve certain targets in its performance. We want Meridiana Fly to be a very strong national carrier with a robust international network, creating jobs.” Qatar Airways had previously said it expected to complete the acquisition of unprofitable Meridiana in early October. The Italian government spent months earlier this year trying to mediate between Meridiana and the company’s unions, which objected to job-cut plans. Italy’s second-biggest airline is owned by a holding company of the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development. Qatar Airways, which is London-based IAG SA’s biggest shareholder, has been seeking stakes in foreign companies. It said in July it would pay $613 million (Dh2.25 billion) for up to 10 per cent of Latam Airlines Group SA, South America’s biggest carrier. Meridiana is expected to get some of the 70 737 Max 8s that Qatar Airways ordered from Boeing Co. last month, Corriere della Sera reported, citing an interview with Al Baker. He said in October that the Max jetliners are intended for another carrier that the Gulf operator is buying.
