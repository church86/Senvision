Astronaut Jeff Williams is pictured below the docking port. Image: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now. Two spacewalkers attached a new docking port to the International Space Station Friday, clearing the way for U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to begin test flights to the lab complex next year. It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships. A second IDA is expected to be attached in 2018. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” radioed station commander Jeff Williams, who worked with astronaut Kate Rubins to attach and outfit the IDA. “Congratulations to the entire team.” Williams, making his fourth spacewalk, and Rubins, making her first, began the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT (GMT-4). After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting tools and foot restraints, they made their way to the front of the station where the shuttle port — pressurized mating adapter No. 2 — extends from the forward end of the Harmony module. The new docking mechanism was carried up to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. Overnight Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled it from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and positioned just in front of PMA-2 to await the spacewalkers.

Once in place on either side of the mating adapter, their feet locked in restraints on PMA-2 for stability, Williams and Rubins attached tethers to the IDA and cinched it in before connecting cables to provide power to sensors, heaters and motors needed to drive home 12 latches to lock the component to the old shuttle port. Other than a minor problem freeing up one balky cable connector, the astronauts had no trouble staying ahead of their timeline. After sensors indicated the IDA was properly aligned, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, working inside the station, sent commands to drive the hooks closed, firmly locking down the IDA. Williams and Rubins then reconfigured the power cables, removed a cover over the end of the docking adapter, covered up no-longer-needed reflectors used by approaching shuttles and installed new laser reflectors that will be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to help determine distance and relative velocity. NASA originally hoped to get the first IDA installed last year, but the initial unit was destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to space suffered a catastrophic failure. A replacement IDA is being built by Boeing and should be ready for installation in 2018. In the meantime, the IDA installed Friday will suffice for initial test flights starting next year. SpaceX is expected to launch an unpiloted Dragon test flight early next summer, followed by a crewed “demo” mission a few months later. Boeing expects to launch an unpiloted test flight late next year with the first crewed test mission in early 2018.

The new spacecraft will give NASA astronauts their first independent access to space since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. And because SpaceX’s Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 can carry four astronauts compared to three aboard the Russian Soyuz, NASA plans to add a seventh crew member to the space station to increase the amount of research that can be carried out. “It’s really a momentous day when I sit here and think about the fact that that docking adapter is just about perfect for us to come (to) next year,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager of the commercial crew program. “It’s a huge milestone in our program.” Even though the commercial crew ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz, at least one U.S.-sponsored astronaut will launch aboard each Soyuz and a Russian will fly aboard each NASA spacecraft through the life of the station program. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships — and its crew — to depart. The IDA installation work took about four hours to complete, giving the spacewalkers time to carry out lower-priority tasks. Rubins routed a cable that will be needed by the second IDA while Williams worked with an ethernet cable that will be needed by a future Russian module. “I see a beautiful sunrise, Tom,” Rubins radioed astronaut Tom Marshburn in mission control as the shuttle sailed high above the south Pacific Ocean. “You’ve got the best view, that’s great,” Marshburn replied. With their primary objectives complete, the astronauts agreed to carry out two final “get-ahead” tasks, but the work was called off when Williams ran into intermittent problems with his helmet’s audio feed. While he could still hear flight controllers with one ear, flight controllers decided to go ahead and end the spacewalk. After carrying their tools and tethers back to the airlock, Williams and Rubins floated back inside, shut the hatch and began repressurization at 2:02 p.m., closing out U.S. EVA-36. Duration was five hours and 58 minutes. It was the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998 and the third so far this year. Adding Rubins to the list of veteran station spacewalkers, 124 astronauts and cosmonauts have now logged 1,210 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station, or 50.4 days. Williams and Rubins plan to stage another spacewalk Sept. 1 to retract a cooling radiator, to install an HD camera and replace an external light.

(AP) — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday, Aug. 19, 2016. The docking port will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. (NASA via AP) "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html FILE - In this Friday, April 17, 2015 file photo, the Canadarm 2 reaches out to capture the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft for docking to the International Space Station.

Space News space history and artifacts articles Messages space history discussion forums Sightings worldwide astronaut appearances Resources selected space history documents Websites related space history websites                   advertisements New commercial spacecraft 'parking spot' added to space station A new International Docking Adapter (IDA) is seen installed on the outside of the International Space Station on Aug. 19. (NASA TV) August 19, 2016 — The International Space Station now has its first parking spot reserved for commercial vehicles. Two NASA astronauts on Friday (Aug. 19) performed a six hour spacewalk outside the orbiting laboratory to install the docking ring, where Boeing and SpaceX crewed capsules will connect to the space station in the near future. Another of the international docking adapters (IDA) is planned to be launched in late 2017. Expedition 48 commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins oversaw the installation of the IDA on Friday, connecting power and data cables after the Canadian-built mulit-armed robot "Dextre" was used to position the IDA to latch onto the pressurized mating adapter where the space shuttles previously docked. "This EVA [extravehicular activity] represents a significant milestone on the path to establishing a commercial crew capability on board the International Space Station, so we are very excited," said Kenny Todd, NASA's space station operations integration manager, at a press conference on Monday (Aug. 15). "We are very excited to put this piece of hardware on the front of the station and get it all integrated and get ready to go."

(NASA TV) The IDA was launched inside the unpressurized trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft that berthed to the space station on July 20. On Wednesday (Aug. 17), the Dextre special purpose dexterous manipulator, attached to the end of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, was used to extract the IDA from the Dragon and position it for installation on the forward end of pressurized mating adapter 2 (PMA-2). Williams and Rubins began their spacewalk Friday at 7:04 a.m. CDT (1204 GMT). Just over an hour later, after they had configured their work stations, the Dextre released its grapple on the IDA, marking the first hand-off between the robot and spacewalking astronauts since the manipulator was added to the space station in 2008. After the two astronauts cinched down the adapter using tethers, the 12 hooks used to hard mate the IDA to PMA-2 were driven closed at 9:40 a.m. CDT (1440 GMT), as was commanded by Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi using a control panel inside the space station's Harmony node. Williams and Rubins then set about connecting additional power and data cables, covering up an obsolete targeting reflector used by the space shuttle and installing two new reflectors on the adapter. The spacewalkers also removed a thermal cover from the front of the adapter, exposing the attachment point for in-bound commercial spacecraft. Astronaut Jeff Williams works alongside the newly-installed IDA-2 outside the International Space Station on Aug. 19. (NASA TV) The IDA, which has an outer diameter of about 8 feet (2.4 m), will be the port to which SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner commercial capsules will dock when bringing astronauts to the space station beginning in the next year or two. Built to a new international standard for docking systems, the IDA enables the different visiting vehicles to use the same port for automated berthings. Future U.S. commercial cargo spacecraft and international spacecraft still to be designed may also use the IDA. "It is amazing that now we have opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles," Williams radioed, "and, frankly, potential international vehicles that adopt the international standard that [the docking adapter] has been designed to." Assembled by Boeing using parts from companies in 25 states, the adapter's primary structure was provided by the Russian aerospace company RSC Energia. The adapter's targets, used to guide spacecraft in for docking, are more sophisticated than earlier systems and include lasers and sensors that allow the station and capsules to talk to each other digitally to share distance cues and enable automatic alignment and connection. Astronaut Kate Rubins configures a foot restraint early during her and Jeff Williams spacewalk to install the IDA. (NASA TV) Friday's spacewalk attached the IDA to PMA-2, one of the first two mating adapters launched to the space station in 1988 on STS-88, which was the first space shuttle mission to the infant orbital laboratory. Repositioned as the station grew in size, PMA-2 is connected to the forward end of the Harmony module. The adapter installed on PMA-2, IDA-2, was the second to be built. The first IDA was destroyed in June 2015 with the launch failure of a SpaceX Dragon. A third IDA, now under construction by Boeing, is expected to be launched in late 2017 and attached to PMA-3 after that mating adapter is moved from the Tranquilly node to Harmony's zenith port. Friday's EVA, which ended at 1:02 p.m. CDT (1802 GMT), five hours and 58 minutes after it began, marked the 194th spacewalk in support of the space station's assembly and maintenance. It was Williams' fourth career extravehicular activity and Rubins' first. The 60th woman to fly into space, Rubins is now the 11th U.S. woman to perform an EVA and the 12th worldwide — including Soviet-era cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who was the first woman to spacewalk in 1984. © 2016 collectSPACE.com All rights reserved.

While Boeing this month cited “softness” in the widebody-jet market and lowered expectations about near-term demand for the 787, ANA’s milestone allowed the jet maker to celebrate the success of the Dreamliner in passenger service. Hideki Kunugi, senior vice president of ANA Americas, said the airplane’s fuel efficiency — 20 percent better than the 767 it replaced — is today saving the airline about $98 million per year. “The 787 plays a vital role” in the airline’s plans to expand its international network, he said. The economics of the midsize, long-range jet have allowed ANA to open up long-haul routes not only to giant hubs such as New York and Los Angeles but also to mid-size cities. Hence its nonstop flights from Tokyo to D?sseldorf, Germany, and Brussels, as well as Seattle and San Jose, Calif. “Without the Dreamliner, Seattle and San Jose would not be possible,” Kunugi said. To get to this point, ANA suffered through a turbulent early ride. After working closely with Boeing on the design of the airplane, then giving the jet maker its launch order in 2004, ANA got its first delivery in September 2011 — three years and four months late. Just over a year after the jet entered service, a main battery started smoking aboard one of ANA’s planes in flight, and the airline endured with all other 787 operators the grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet for more than three months. But the battery problem was fixed, and Boeing has now delivered 447 Dreamliners to 39 airlines. As of July, more than 108 million passengers have flown on more than 569,000 Dreamliner flights. Opening new routes ANA now flies the 787 on 40 percent of its international routes, and it plans to open more routes to previously unserved destinations. In September, it will introduce the 787 between Tokyo and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Next February, it will fly the jet nonstop between Tokyo an Mexico City, which on the northbound leg takes more than 14 hours. Kunuga said the opening up of Mexico City “is only possible thanks to the 787, which can operate such long-haul routes with greater comfort and efficiency than any other aircraft.” The airline sees this route as “a first very important step” to expanding connections to Central and South America. At the delivery ceremony Wednesday, Boeing’s senior vice president of sales for northeast Asia, Ihssane Mounir, said that despite the general softness in demand, China remains a bright spot that offers hope of buoyant future sales. “China will continue to drive the demand,” he said. “I’m not seeing any signs of weakness whatsoever.” ANA has 33 more Dreamliners on order, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018.

Astronaut Jeff Williams is pictured below the docking port. Image: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now. Two spacewalkers attached a new docking port to the International Space Station Friday, clearing the way for U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to begin test flights to the lab complex next year. It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships. A second IDA is expected to be attached in 2018. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” radioed station commander Jeff Williams, who worked with astronaut Kate Rubins to attach and outfit the IDA. “Congratulations to the entire team.” Williams, making his fourth spacewalk, and Rubins, making her first, began the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT (GMT-4). After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting tools and foot restraints, they made their way to the front of the station where the shuttle port — pressurized mating adapter No. 2 — extends from the forward end of the Harmony module. The new docking mechanism was carried up to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. Overnight Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled it from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and positioned just in front of PMA-2 to await the spacewalkers. The International Docking Adapter, in position in front of PMA-2. Image: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now. Once in place on either side of the mating adapter, their feet locked in restraints on PMA-2 for stability, Williams and Rubins attached tethers to the IDA and cinched it in before connecting cables to provide power to sensors, heaters and motors needed to drive home 12 latches to lock the component to the old shuttle port. Other than a minor problem freeing up one balky cable connector, the astronauts had no trouble staying ahead of their timeline. After sensors indicated the IDA was properly aligned, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, working inside the station, sent commands to drive the hooks closed, firmly locking down the IDA. Williams and Rubins then reconfigured the power cables, removed a cover over the end of the docking adapter, covered up no-longer-needed reflectors used by approaching shuttles and installed new laser reflectors that will be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to help determine distance and relative velocity. NASA originally hoped to get the first IDA installed last year, but the initial unit was destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to space suffered a catastrophic failure. A replacement IDA is being built by Boeing and should be ready for installation in 2018. In the meantime, the IDA installed Friday will suffice for initial test flights starting next year. SpaceX is expected to launch an unpiloted Dragon test flight early next summer, followed by a crewed “demo” mission a few months later. Boeing expects to launch an unpiloted test flight late next year with the first crewed test mission in early 2018. Artist’s impression of the crewed SpaceX Dragon craft docking at the International Space Station using the newly installed docking adapter. Image: NASA. The new spacecraft will give NASA astronauts their first independent access to space since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. And because SpaceX’s Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 can carry four astronauts compared to three aboard the Russian Soyuz, NASA plans to add a seventh crew member to the space station to increase the amount of research that can be carried out. “It’s really a momentous day when I sit here and think about the fact that that docking adapter is just about perfect for us to come (to) next year,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager of the commercial crew program. “It’s a huge milestone in our program.” Even though the commercial crew ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz, at least one U.S.-sponsored astronaut will launch aboard each Soyuz and a Russian will fly aboard each NASA spacecraft through the life of the station program. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships — and its crew — to depart. The IDA installation work took about four hours to complete, giving the spacewalkers time to carry out lower-priority tasks. Rubins routed a cable that will be needed by the second IDA while Williams worked with an ethernet cable that will be needed by a future Russian module. “I see a beautiful sunrise, Tom,” Rubins radioed astronaut Tom Marshburn in mission control as the shuttle sailed high above the south Pacific Ocean. “You’ve got the best view, that’s great,” Marshburn replied. With their primary objectives complete, the astronauts agreed to carry out two final “get-ahead” tasks, but the work was called off when Williams ran into intermittent problems with his helmet’s audio feed. While he could still hear flight controllers with one ear, flight controllers decided to go ahead and end the spacewalk. After carrying their tools and tethers back to the airlock, Williams and Rubins floated back inside, shut the hatch and began repressurization at 2:02 p.m., closing out U.S. EVA-36. Duration was five hours and 58 minutes. It was the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998 and the third so far this year. Adding Rubins to the list of veteran station spacewalkers, 124 astronauts and cosmonauts have now logged 1,210 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station, or 50.4 days. Williams and Rubins plan to stage another spacewalk Sept. 1 to retract a cooling radiator, to install an HD camera and replace an external light.

Photo / AP Air crash investigators are planning to dump replica Boeing 777 wing flaps fitted with satellite trackers into the Indian Ocean in an effort to discover the wreckage of the missing MH370 jet. The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014 shortly after leaving Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. In July 2015, a section of the aircraft's wingtip, known as a flaperon, washed ashore on a beach in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island. Now experts want to "reverse" the flaperon's journey in an effort to determine the most likely crash site. So far, experts have searched approximately 46,000 square miles of the ocean floor during a two-year operation but have failed to find the missing jet. Greg Hood Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner, who last month took over responsibility for the search, is currently trying to identify new areas where the jet could be. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. Hood said: "If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity." Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year - 15 months after the plane went missing - will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Continued below. Related Content Missing plane MH370 dived from the air, new analysis shows Mangled 'MH370 debris' found off the coast of Mozambique suggests plane may have exploded Malaysia confirms MH370 pilot plotted flight over Indian Ocean on flight simulator Greg Hood is currently trying to identify new areas where the jet could be. Photo / AP Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modelling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year - the third anniversary of the disaster - and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analysed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modelling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or approximately 550km. Foley said: "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot." Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area - which includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales - made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. Experts have searched approximately 46,000 square miles of the ocean floor during a two-year operation but have failed to find the missing jet. Photo / Getty Images The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 40,000 feet after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimise debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 12,000 feet and 20,000 feet a minute before it crashed. A rate of 2000 feet a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. Foley said: "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap - if it's found that it is not deployed - will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking." Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20m swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 4000 square miles of seabed, which is outside the original 23,000-square-mile high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 1700 miles and 1200 miles from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. Hood said: "We are still hopeful and optimistic." Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370.

The successful installation of an international docking adapter on the International Space Station on Friday represents another step toward space tourism. By Lucy Schouten, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams (l.) and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Astronauts created a back door for the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, which will someday enable commercial space shuttles to dock. During a spacewalk on Friday , NASA's Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins installed the first of two docking adapters  where crews riding with Boeing and SpaceX will soon disembark. The newly named "international docking adapter's" installation marks another step forward in commercial space travel, where steadily advancing technology in the last two years has opened up real potential for life both here and in the skies. Recommended: Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel "It's really good we have an international standard now that anybody can build against and come dock to the station or to anything that has the same standard," David Clemen, Boeing's development director for the space station, said in a NASA press release. Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 The dock uses unprecedented open-source technology so anyone can build to it. This design strategy hints at how space travel will operate as it enters a new era of commercial development. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," NASA program manager Shaun Kelley said in an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us." The adapter precedes NASA's shift from transporting ISS-bound astronauts via Russian Soyuz rockets, as it has done since 2012, to a new model of using US commercial shuttles. Switching to US companies Boeing and SpaceX frees NASA from an expensive transportation plan with Russia that costs taxpayers $70 million per ride . Set for 2018, the plan suggests how soon commercial space travel could become a reality. "Never before in the history of human spaceflight has there been so much going on all at once," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager for space exploration at Boeing, during a 2015 briefing on NASA's commercial crew program. Space travel operations are already speeding up back on terra firma. One sign of the uptick is the packed 2016 schedule for  Cape Canaveral , where private companies, the military, ISS cargo loads, and NASA operations are jostling for time on the launch pad. Private space companies such as SpaceX and United Launch Alliance planned more than 30 launches from Florida alone in 2016, nearly double the 2015 schedule.  "The last time we saw 30-plus launches would have been back in the 1960s," Dale Ketcham of the Space Florida economic development agency told Reuters. The advance is not without complications. Some space observers on the international scene expressed dismay after Congress passed a bill  in late 2015 to regulate space mining, betting that travel and exploration will soon fall under the purview of US companies, not just governments. Some said the law violates the universalist spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and needs further discussion, wrote Jeff Foust for the Space Review.  "Asteroid mining is cool. Everyone thinks it's cool. But is it legal?" asked Jim Dunstan, founder of the Mobius Legal Group, during a May panel on the issue. "These are the tough scenarios that we’ve really got to work through as we talk about policy," he said, according to Space Review.  But technology's rapid advance will bring those "tough scenarios" to the forefront quickly in the coming years. For example, after many failed attempts, companies are learning to reuse rockets in a cost-effective manner, as the Christian Science Monitor's Pete Spotts previously reported: NASA's space shuttle program was an initial attempt at developing a fleet of reusable vehicles for human spaceflight, as well as for launching and servicing satellites. But over its 30-year history, it never delivered on its architects’ initial promises.      Initial estimates suggested that each flight would cost as little as $9 million and the cost of carrying cargo would be $118 per pound. By the end of the program, each flight cost about $1.5 billion, and cargo cost about $10,000 per pound. Now, privately-owned aerospace companies owned by wealthy visionaries are taking up the challenge, free of Wall Street demands for quick returns on investment or of the intense scrutiny of annual federal budget cycles. As technology makes space exploration appear more practical, some also see the economic potential that Star Trek's iconic "final frontier" could offer to our already-mapped planet. Moon Express, an entrant in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, expresses the commercial aim of many companies seeking to explore the moon's natural resources to facilitate deeper space travel.  "We believe it's critical for humanity  to become a multi-world species and that our sister world, the Moon, is an eighth continent holding vast resources than can help us enrich and secure our future," writes Moon Express on the prize website.

NASA TV Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Two spacewalkers attached a new docking port to the International Space Station Friday, clearing the way for U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to begin test flights to the lab complex next year. It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships. A second IDA is expected to be attached in 2018. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” radioed station commander Jeff Williams, who worked with astronaut Kate Rubins to attach and outfit the IDA. “Congratulations to the entire team.” Williams, making his fourth spacewalk, and Rubins, making her first, began the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT (GMT-4). After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting tools and foot restraints, they made their way to the front of the station where the shuttle port -- pressurized mating adapter No. 2 -- extends from the forward end of the Harmony module. The new docking mechanism was carried up to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. Overnight Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled it from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and positioned just in front of PMA-2 to await the spacewalkers. Once in place on either side of the mating adapter, their feet locked in restraints on PMA-2 for stability, Williams and Rubins attached tethers to the IDA and cinched it in before connecting cables to provide power to sensors, heaters and motors needed to drive home 12 latches to lock the component to the old shuttle port. Other than a minor problem freeing up one balky cable connector, the astronauts had no trouble staying ahead of their timeline. After sensors indicated the IDA was properly aligned, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, working inside the station, sent commands to drive the hooks closed, firmly locking down the IDA. Williams and Rubins then reconfigured the power cables, removed a cover over the end of the docking adapter, covered up no-longer-needed reflectors used by approaching shuttles and installed new laser reflectors that will be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to help determine distance and relative velocity. NASA originally hoped to get the first IDA installed last year, but the initial unit was destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to space suffered a catastrophic failure. A replacement IDA is being built by Boeing and should be ready for installation in 2018. In the meantime, the IDA installed Friday will suffice for initial test flights starting next year. SpaceX is expected to launch an unpiloted Dragon test flight early next summer, followed by a crewed “demo” mission a few months later. Boeing expects to launch an unpiloted test flight late next year with the first crewed test mission in early 2018. Williams, left, and Rubins make their way toward the front of the space station to attach a new docking mechanism to the lab’s no-longer-needed shuttle port. If all goes well, new commercial spacecraft being built by Boeing and SpaceX will dock there starting with test flights next year. NASA TV The new spacecraft will give NASA astronauts their first independent access to space since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. And because SpaceX’s Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 can carry four astronauts compared to three aboard the Russian Soyuz, NASA plans to add a seventh crew member to the space station to increase the amount of research that can be carried out. “It’s really a momentous day when I sit here and think about the fact that that docking adapter is just about perfect for us to come (to) next year,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager of the commercial crew program. “It’s a huge milestone in our program.” Even though the commercial crew ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz, at least one U.S.-sponsored astronaut will launch aboard each Soyuz and a Russian will fly aboard each NASA spacecraft through the life of the station program. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships -- and its crew -- to depart. The IDA installation work took about four hours to complete, giving the spacewalkers time to carry out lower-priority tasks. Rubins routed a cable that will be needed by the second IDA while Williams worked with an ethernet cable that will be needed by a future Russian module. “I see a beautiful sunrise, Tom,” Rubins radioed astronaut Tom Marshburn in mission control as the shuttle sailed high above the south Pacific Ocean. “You’ve got the best view, that’s great,” Marshburn replied. With their primary objectives complete, the astronauts agreed to carry out two final “get-ahead” tasks, but the work was called off when Williams ran into intermittent problems with his helmet’s audio feed. While he could still hear flight controllers with one ear, flight controllers decided to go ahead and end the spacewalk. After carrying their tools and tethers back to the airlock, Williams and Rubins floated back inside, shut the hatch and began repressurization at 2:02 p.m., closing out U.S. EVA-36. Duration was five hours and 58 minutes. It was the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998 and the third so far this year. Adding Rubins to the list of veteran station spacewalkers, 124 astronauts and cosmonauts have now logged 1,210 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station, or 50.4 days. Williams and Rubins plan to stage another spacewalk Sept. 1 to retract a cooling radiator, to install an HD camera and replace an external light. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 most likely drifted. Peter Foley, Australian Transport Safety Bureau director of Flight 370 search operations, beside a stack of replica wing flaps on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, at the bureau's headquarters in Canberra, Australia. AP Photo / Rod McGuirk Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood says experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives. ShareAdjustCommentPrint CANBERRA, Australia — Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres and 6,100 metres a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometre high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometres and 1,900 kilometres from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month, packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule.   NASA describes the gear as 'a metaphorical gateway to a future' that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft - the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 - to carry astronauts to the space station.  Scroll down for live video US astronaut Kate Rubins works on the docking port of the International Space Station.The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. AMERICA'S SPACE FLIGHTS Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011.  SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now.  Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. It is a crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year.  Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011.  SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two.  But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. 'We have a new port of call for the new U.S. commercial crew vehicles,' announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Bone-appetit!

Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides - at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be installed in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called Friday's installation a 'very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability.' HOW TO INSTALL AN ORBITING PARKING SPACE The docking adapter arrived to the space station July 20 on a SpaceX Dragon cargo resupply spacecraft.  On Wednesday, ground controllers used the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached 'Dextre' Special Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon and position it just 2 feet away from Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 located on the forward end of the Harmony module. Once the IDA is moved to a surface to surface contact with the PMA, Williams and Rubins will begin work to hook up tethers in advance of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi sending commands to close the hooks between the two docking ports.  Once the hooks are closed, Williams and Rubins will press ahead to mate power and data connectors for future use of the IDA. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station.  The docking adapter arrived to the space station July 20 on a SpaceX Dragon cargo resupply spacecraft. Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts. US astronaut Kate Rubins works on the docking port -- the first of two such additions to the International Space Station ©Lizabeth Menzies (NASA TV/AFP) US astronauts Kate Rubins (bottom) and Jeff Williams (top) make repairs to the International Space Station on August 19, 2016 ©Lizabeth Menzies (NASA TV/AFP) It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft.  Williams is making his fourth career spacewalk. He has accumulated 19 hours of spacewalk time in his life. The spacewalk is Rubins's first. But the work will be hardly brand new for her.  The spacewalk began at 8:04 (1204 GMT) when Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. Late Wednesday, the space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, placing it next to the station's Harmony module for installation. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. The last US spacewalk was on January 15, when a problem with American Tim Kopra's spacesuit allowed a small amount of water to build up inside his helmet by the end of the outing. It was the latest in a series of spacesuit issues, but was not as severe as an emergency in 2013 when Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet flooded, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, Todd said. NASA commentator Rob Navias said the US space agency has done a thorough review of the spacesuits being worn by Rubins and Williams, and they are in 'excellent shape' for Friday's spacewalk. The spacewalk is Rubins's first. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. NASA is planning another spacewalk on September 1 to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. 'We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time,' he added.

NASA awards contracts to build homes in space The Motley Fool 8/19/2016 Rich Smith Sometime in the next two decades, NASA plans to land humans on Mars. In the meantime, several companies are making efforts to put fresh footprints on the Moon. But here's the thing: If astronauts want to spend any significant amount of time exploring these heavenly bodies, they're going to need someplace to live. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 149.72 +0.20 +0.13% Lockheed Martin Corp LMT ▼ 264.12 -0.54 -0.20% Orbital ATK Inc OA ▲ 86.36 +0.60 +0.70% As spaceflight pioneer Elon Musk has explained, even SpaceX's rather roomy Dragon 2 space capsule only has about as much interior volume as a family SUV, while Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule isn't much bigger. The Orion crew module that Lockheed Martin is building for NASA is somewhat roomier -- but still probably not big enough to move its crew of four astronauts to Mars and back in comfort. Don't get me wrong. All three of these spaceships are probably comfortable enough for short hops. But for any mission of any real length on a foreign planet(oid) -- and especially for the 18-month round trip to Mars and back -- astronauts are going to need some better extended-stay housing options. So last week, NASA announced a new project to try to develop such options. Round up the usual space suspects On August 9, NASA expanded the parameters of its NextSTEP program (Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships) for development of new space technology by private industry. In NextStep part 2, the agency has invited six U.S. companies to try to come up with improved options for long-term deep-space living. These six companies include publicly traded space giants Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. In addition, up-and-comer Bigelow Aerospace, private aerospace specialist Sierra Nevada, and relative newcomer NanoRacks of Webster, Texas also won contracts. (Although actually, NanoRacks will partner with Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance joint venture. So in a sense, you could say that Boeing and Lockheed won this NextSTEP competition twice). Living off campus -- way off campus What will they be building for NASA? The range of potential space habitat ideas is pretty wide. We've already written at length about Bigelow's inflatable "BEAM" series of inflatable space habitats -- one of which is already undergoing testing as an add-on to the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, both Boeing and Orbital ATK are developing new purpose-built habitation modules for NASA. Lockheed and Sierra Nevada both envision habitats comprising repurposed cargo capsules (sent into orbit on ISS resupply missions, for example). The NanoRacks team will try to do something similar, refitting a launch rocket's second-stage fuel tank to see if it can be converted into living quarters (a la Skylab). What it means for investors NASA hasn't divulged the value of its initial six NextSTEP-2 contract awards, which is problematic for investors trying to gauge the investment opportunity here. On the other hand, neither has NASA stated that it will pick just one of the solutions proposed by its contractors for building future deep-space habitats. To the contrary, it might make more financial sense to build as much outer-space real estate as possible, utilizing all available resources -- spent fuel tanks, empty cargo containers, purpose-built modules, and inflatable structures as well. Potentially, all six of these companies could come out of the NextSTEP-2 competition looking like winners. For now, though, you can still only invest in three of them: Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital ATK.

Advertisement Boeing Defense, Space & Security (Boeing Co. IW500/9) has a new, $2.8-billion U.S. Air Force contract to start low-rate initial production for two “production lots” of the KC-46A tanker aircraft. The first lot involves seven aircraft, while the second covers 12 aircraft. Including future options, Boeing expects to build 179 of these refueling and strategic airlift aircraft for the USAF. This step follows a Defense Acquisition Board review and announcement that the KC-46 program completed “Milestone C” (a series of ground and flight tests) and is approved for initial production. Those tests included refueling flights with F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10, C-17, and A-10 aircraft and a cargo handling demo.

The KC-46A will be used to refuel all allied and coalition military aircraft compatible with international aerial refuelling procedures as well as transport passengers, cargo and patients. The award follows a Defense Acquisition Board review and announcement that the KC-46 programme has completed Milestone C and is approved for initial production. "The KC-46 tanker will provide the Air Force unprecedented refuelling capabilities, operational flexibility and combat readiness." Under the award, which includes the first two production lots, Boeing will build seven and 12 takers respectively. Upon exercising of future options by the USAF, Boeing will be required to build a total of 179 aircraft for the service. Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO Leanne Caret said: “The KC-46 tanker will provide the Air Force unprecedented refuelling capabilities, operational flexibility and combat readiness. “It’s an important day for the company and programme. "We’re excited about building low-rate initial production aircraft, and it’s only possible because of the hard work of the joint Boeing-Air Force team.” Work on assembling KC-46 aircraft will be carried out by Boeing at its Everett facility in Washington, US, with deliveries set to begin in 2017. Designed and developed based on Boeing 767 refuelling aircraft, the KC-46A Pegasus tanker will replace the USAF’s KC-135 fleet. Prior to receiving approval for initial production, the aircraft completed a set of required ground- and flight-test tests that included refuelling flights with F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10, C-17 and A-10 aircraft and a cargo handling demo. In 2011, Boeing was initially contracted to design and develop the USAF’s next-generation tanker aircraft, under which the company built four test aircraft, two configured as 767-2Cs and two as KC-46A tankers. So far, the test aircraft have completed more than 1,000 flight hours. Image: Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tanker. Photo: courtesy of Paul Weatherman, Boeing photo.

(AP) -- Astronauts ventured out on a spacewalk today to install a new door for visitors at the International Space Station. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, quickly began hooking up a docking port that will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. SpaceX is shooting for a launch of its supped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person test flight of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides -- at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers.

Vessey, who rose through the ranks in a 46-year military career to become chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under President Ronald Reagan, has died. He was 94. Vessey -- who enlisted as a private in the Minnesota National Guard in 1939, fought in World War II and Vietnam, and was the nation's top military officer when he retired to his home state of Minnesota in 1985 -- died Thursday evening, his daughter, Sarah Vessey told The Associated Press. He was surrounded by family and died of natural causes, she said. After being named chairman of the joint chiefs in 1982, Vessey helped oversee the military buildup that Reagan championed when he took office just over a year earlier. "It was probably the greatest peacetime modernization of the American military establishment that ever took place," Vessey recalled in a 2004 interview. "We improved every facet of the armed forces, from the recruiting and retention, the selection of individuals, to the way they lived, but most importantly to the way they fought." Germany rejects latest Greek call for WWII reparations BERLIN (AP) -- The German government is rebuffing the latest push by Greece to secure reparations for the brutal Nazi occupation of Greece during World War II. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said today that Berlin's "position is very clear" on the reparations issue and has been stated repeatedly. "The question of German reparations has been conclusively dealt with, legally and politically," Seibert said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras vowed Tuesday to exhaust diplomatic and, if necessary, legal means to win reparations. He urged Germany, the main European contributor to Greece's massive bailout program, to enter negotiations on the matter. A Greek parliamentary committee recently prepared a report on war reparations. Greek media reports say it set the total sum due at $340-$450 billion. 2,000 dead seahorses smuggled in packages to France PARIS (AP) -- French customs police have seized 2,000 dried seahorses smuggled into France in several postal packages en route from Guinea to Vietnam. The endangered creatures were discovered in plastic bags by customs officers in a Paris suburban post office. The national customs police said in a statement today that the seahorses were slated to be sent on a flight to Vietnam, where they could be used in traditional medicine or sold to tourists. Istanbul police detain dozens as part of coup probe ISTANBUL (AP) -- Turkey's state-run news agency says police have detained dozens at Turkey's banking regulatory agency and at one of Istanbul's largest universities as part of an investigation into the July 15 abortive coup which killed over 270 people. Anadolu Agency said 29 auditors at the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency were detained early Monday for allegedly conducting "irregular probes" in 2013 into businessmen and foundations that are close to the government. Meanwhile, detention orders were issued for 62 academics working at Istanbul University as part of the same investigation. Police detained 44 of them Monday morning. Turkey accuses U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen of masterminding the coup and has launched a massive crackdown on his movement, detaining more than 40,000 people and dismissing tens of thousands from government jobs. Mexico's rights agency says police executed 22 at ranch MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal police executed at least 22 people on a ranch last year, then moved bodies and planted guns to corroborate the official account that the deaths happened in a gunbattle, Mexico's human rights commission said Thursday. One police officer was killed in the confrontation in the western state of Michoacan on May 22, 2015. The government has said the dead were drug cartel suspects who were hiding out on the ranch in Tanhuato, near the border with Jalisco state. The National Human Rights Commission said there were also two cases of torture and four more deaths caused by excessive force. It said it could not establish satisfactorily the circumstances of 15 others who were shot to death. Experts use drift modeling to define new MH370 search zone CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 -- a wing flap -- most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 46,000 square miles turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. Greek coast guard rescues migrants stuck on islet ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's coast guard rescued dozens of migrants today whose boat ran aground on a deserted islet off the coast of southwestern Greece, hundreds of miles from the usual entry point of migrants into the European Union nation. The boat carrying about 70 people ran aground overnight on the tiny islet of Sapientza, off the southwestern tip of the Peloponnese, the coast guard said. The vast majority of migrants reach Greece's eastern Aegean islands a few miles from the Turkish coast. Coast guard vessels picked up the migrants this morning, ferrying them to the mainland where they were to be registered. It was not immediately clear what type of boat they had been on, where they had set sail from or where they had been sailing to. US appeals court upholds UN immunity from cholera suit PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A U.S. federal appeals court has upheld the United Nations' immunity from a damage claim filed on behalf of 5,000 cholera victims who blame the U.N. for an epidemic of the deadly disease in Haiti. In a decision issued late Thursday, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York affirmed a lower court's January 2015 dismissal of a lawsuit brought in the worst outbreak of cholera in recent history. "We have considered all of plaintiffs' arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit," the U.S. appellate judges said. The ruling came shortly after U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq referred to the United Nations' "own involvement" in the introduction of cholera to Haiti. It was a significant statement because the U.N. has for years kept silent about allegations its peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti. It has answered lawsuits on behalf of victims filed in U.S. courts by claiming immunity under a 1946 convention.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

Goodbye to the Jet That Ruled the World The Daily Beast 19/08/2016 Clive Irving © Getty Boeing Plans to End 747, The Plane That Changed the World As epoch-ending statements go, this one was stealthy and carefully modulated: “It is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.” And so it slipped out, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, first reported by Aviation Week, that Boeing foresees the moment when the single most consequential airplane it ever built will come to the end of its viable life—probably around 2020, which would give the 747 fifty years in production. Like millions of people across the globe, I long ago came to take the 747—the Jumbo Jet—waiting at an airport gate as a distinctive and welcome presence, an airplane that reassured you with its substance and solidity; never exactly sexy but with a personality that other airplanes never quite reached, something above being just an exquisite machine. In truth, though, for me the attachment is stronger and more personal. Some 23 years ago I published a book about the 747, which turned out to be a story about much more than a machine. It was about a singular group of engineers who brought the machine to life in a way that permanently marked their own life experience, always under stress, often tested to the limits of their skills but never, never daunted. I realized that I wasn’t just writing about a machine, but the biography of a machine and its creators, a process in which you get to know the subject so intimately that you can’t ever shake off the effect of the achievement. As a result of writing the book, every time I board a 747 it remains impossible not to think about its details, visible and invisible, without hearing the voices of those whose work it was, the scores of engineers I had interviewed, most of them at that point living out their retirement in and around Seattle. And of all those stories there is one that shows how daringly improvised the creation of the 747 sometimes was—in a real sense it describes the genesis of the whole concept.  Milt Heinemann was not a salesman at Boeing but there was a single quite scary moment in his career when he sold the biggest idea ever to come out of the company. It happened one morning in 1966. Heinemann had a meeting with the top managers of Pan Am in the airline’s eponymous building that rose above Grand Central station in New York. Deliberately, he arrived a little early, and was shown into the boardroom on the 52nd floor. From his briefcase he pulled out a length of hemp rope, 35 feet long. It was knotted at two points, at 20 feet and 29 feet. He played out the rope across the width of the boardroom, and it turned out to be just a tad wider than the 20 feet marker. Then he pulled out a chair from beside the boardroom table, stood on it, and with the 20 feet knot on the floor stretched up to the ceiling. The ceiling height was just beyond the 29 feet knot. Nobody had witnessed this strange behavior. Had they done so they might well have decided that Heinemann was nuts. He wound up the rope and put it back in his briefcase, pulled out a wad of documents and sat down at the table. A little later the managers filed in, led by Pan Am’s imperious creator and chairman, Juan Trippe. The business of the day was to hear out Heinemann on Boeing’s latest plans for a new airplane, the 747. Trippe wanted an airliner that was at least twice the size of the first Boeing passenger jet, the 707. Until that moment he believed that the 747 would simply be a 707 with two decks instead of one and otherwise follow conventional dimensions in each cabin. Heinemann had been sent from Seattle to tell Trippe that Boeing had a radical new concept for the 747. It would have only one deck for passengers—a very wide deck. Heinemann explained that, essentially, the cabin would virtually have the internal dimensions of the Pan Am boardroom: 19 feet wide and nine feet high. They were, he said, to all intents and purposes now sitting in that cabin. There was a silence while Trippe’s obedient managers awaited his response and Heinemann wished he could disappear. Finally Trippe said only that it was an interesting proposal and he wanted to know more —a lot more. It wasn’t the airplane he thought he was buying. In the history of companies handing off the delivery of potentially deal-breaking news to a relatively junior executive this one deserves a prime slot. Heinemann was a modestly ranked engineer at Boeing. His specialty was cabin interiors and in the Boeing hierarchy the engineers who designed the frame of a new airplane and its working parts—thousands of working parts—came first in responsibility and influence. To them, the cabin was décor. When Boeing made a pitch for a new airplane to an airline, Heinemann was always the last to speak. He liked to say that he was responsible for the only part of the airplane that made a profit: the seats. And yet what Heinemann had described to Trippe that day was momentous. For the first time an airplane cabin could break free from the confinement of a tube, the conventional form with a single-aisle and six-abreast seating. There were many other innovations in the 747 but what became known as the twin-aisle wide-body cabin was the most far-reaching. However, even though Trippe accepted the concept and Pan Am was the first airline to fly the 747 he never thought it would endure. His plan was for the wide-body, this capacious but bulbous machine, to be replaced by a supersonic jet, the SST, flying two and half times as fast, with a slender fuselage shaped for speed. The 747, Trippe believed, was just a useful stopgap and once the SST arrived it would revert to carrying cargo only—the reason why it had been designed with a cockpit in the hump above the main deck was so that cargo could be loaded through  a hinged door at the nose. That never happened. The U.S. government-sponsored SST program was abandoned. Its economics were awful and the environmental impact equally egregious—only one SST, the Anglo-French Concorde, gained an established place on airline routes and then only as an elitist convenience. Ironically, Trippe didn’t seem to appreciate that the 747 would enable aviation to initiate the age of widely affordable air travel. In the first phase of the Jet Age, beginning in the late 1950s, the passengers frequently looked as sexy and glamorous as the machines, but flying remained well beyond the means of the middle class. With the 747, Trippe had set Boeing the goal of achieving what would be a new price point for airline travel. The economics of an airplane are expressed in the seat/mile cost—given a nominal number of seats, the cost of flying one seat one mile. Trippe wanted that number to be 6.6 cents per mile, one third of the 707’s cost. By reaching that number, in one leap the 747 not only put flying within the reach of many more people, it did so on a global basis. In airports around the world the 747 became a mesmerizing and inimitable presence. Small countries where leaders had big egos and autocratic style bought 747s as prestige projects. In that way the 747 went beyond being just an airplane to being a ubiquitous advertisement of America’s attainments. More substantially, it was an instrument of social advancement, introducing a new math that enabled coach class seats to be sold at prices that brought international travel to many millions more people. The result, however, was often far from egalitarian. Because the 747’s size allowed a variety of cabin comfort standards, airlines began to see that they could make an airplane a microcosm of an increasingly affluent but still stratified society. For one thing, what could be a more specifically delineated society than the three-class cabin? Without altering the basic utility of the machine—everybody departs and arrives at the same time—the passengers are divided by carefully calculated levels of comfort. At the front end there was first class, replicating what in the early post-war years of international flights had been common throughout the cabin, well-spaced wide seats and restaurant-style meal service. In the middle came business class at first, relatively few seats). And then in the rear, with 10 seats in each row and tight space between each row, there was coach—or cattle class, as it was frequently described by those who liked the price but not the discomfort.  This stratification of the wide-body cabin has now become such a finely tuned work of airline business plans that there are now regularly four classes, not three, with the arrival of "premium economy" - something of a contradiction in terms in both concept and execution, but fine for those who want to escape the press of bodies in the back of the airplane but who don’t want to pay a whole lot more to do so. In this new world, the art of successfully filling seats of four different sizes on every flight has actually ended up dictating the size and shape of every new wide-body plane, whether built by Boeing or Airbus. And it is this calculation that, in the end, has been the nemesis of the 747. As the economics of the wide-body cabin were refined it became apparent that a four-engined airplane like the 747 was less competitive than one with two engines—and so in the 1990s Boeing created the first “big twin” the 777. The latest and final iteration of the 747, the 747-8, launched in 2010, has new and more efficient wings and a new generation of engines that are more efficient, cleaner and quieter. But orders for the 747-8 have slumped, with a backlog now of only 21 airplanes. The production rate has been cut to the lowest sustainable level: 0.5 per month. Without admitting as much, it is Boeing itself that has rendered the 747-8 obsolescent by launching a new generation of the 777, the 777X, planned to arrive in 2020. It will be capable of flying as many passengers as the original 747, more than 400, at a lower cost than the 747-8.  Already, airlines have ordered more than 300. It may well be that the only other supersized jet, the Airbus A380, will be the last of the big jets. Launched with high expectations in 2000, only 319 A380s have been sold, and 142 were bought by one airline, Emirates. Other airlines have canceled orders and, like Boeing, Airbus is undermining the logic of its jumbo with a big twin, the A350, that on many long-haul routes is more efficient. Perhaps this is another tough lesson that the future does not always turn out as imagined, a series of big technical advances bringing startling transformations. Commercial jets fly no faster today than the Boeing 707 that arrived in 1957. That was a quantum leap but it had its own terminating speed wall, 600 mph. Supersonic flight just doesn’t make economic sense for mass air travel. It seems equally likely that mega-sized jets will turn out to be a dead end. A combination of market forces and tough new environmental regulations, stressing efficiency, quietness, and low emissions favors the twins. In no way does that diminish the glory of the 747. By the end of its run Boeing will have produced 1,555 747s, way beyond what its creators imagined possible. But it’s not just about numbers. I’ve been flying on 747s since the year of its debut, 1970. As I take my seat and look around me it still seems so big that it’s amazing it can leave the ground. It is a magic machine that casts its own spell and that won’t be quickly snuffed out. Jumbo, The Making of the Boeing 747, by Clive Irving is available on Kindle from Amazon and also in paperback.

Russian Space Corporation, US Boeing Reach Deal on Dispute Over Sea Launch by Staff Writers Moscow (Sputnik) Aug 19, 2016 File image. Russia's S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation (RSC) Energia and the US aircraft manufacturing company Boeing reached an agreement to solve dispute over the Sea Launch project, Energia's General Director Vladimir Solntsev said Thursday. In 2015, US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion compensation from its former partners under the Sea Launch, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. "We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on 'Sea Launch,' in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute's] settlement," Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. He added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a program of long-term cooperation, which included projects of far space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator - the best possible location for launch - which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-percent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia.

Share & Embed Air Force Electronic Warfare Upgrade to F-15 Designed to Help Fighter Stay in Front of Chinese J-10 Kris Osborn 11/07/2016 / Originally published onWarrior The US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The Air Force is reving up electronic warfare upgrades for its F-15 fighter as a way to better protect against enemy fire and electronic attacks, service officials said. Boeing has secured a $478 million deal to continue work on a new technology called with a system called the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS.  “This allows the aircraft to identify a threat and actively prosecute that threat through avoidance, deception or jamming techniques,” Mike Gibbons, Vice President of the Boeing F-15 program, told Scout Warrior in an interview a few months ago.   These updated EW capabilities replace the Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been used since the 1980s, not long after the F-15 first deployed. The service plans to operate the fleet until the mid-2040’s, so an overhaul of the Eagle’s electronic systems helps maintain U.S. air supremacy, the contract announcement said.  Boeing won the initial contract for the EPAWSS project last year  and hired BAE Systems as the primary subcontractor.  Overall, the US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The multi-pronged effort not only includes the current addition of electronic warfare technology but also extends to super-fast high-speed computers, infrared search and track enemy targeting systems, increased networking ability and upgraded weapons-firing capability, Air Force and Boeing officials said. “The Air Force plans to keep the F-15 fleet in service until the mid-2040’s.  Many of the F-15 systems date back to the 1970’s and must be upgraded if the aircraft is to remain operationally effective. Various upgrades will be complete as early as 2021 for the F-15C AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar and as late as 2032 for the various EW (electronic warfare) upgrades,” Air Force spokesman Maj. Rob Leese told Scout Warrior a few months ago.  The Air Force currently operates roughly 400 F-15C, D and E variants. A key impetus for the upgrade was well articulate in a Congressional report on the US and China in 2014. (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission --www.uscc.gov). Among other things, the report cited rapid Chinese technological progress and explained that the US margin of superiority has massively decreased since the 1980s. As an example, the report said that in the 1980s, the US F-15 was vastly superior to the Chinese equivalent – the J-10. However, Chinese technical advances in recent years have considerably narrowed that gap to the point where the Chinese J-10 is now roughly comparable to the US F-15, the report explained. Air Force and Boeing developers maintain that ongoing upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that this equivalence is not the case and that, instead, they will ensure the superiority of the F-15. Among the upgrades is an ongoing effort to equip the F-15 with the fastest jet-computer processer in the world, called the Advanced Display Core Processor, or ADCPII. “It is capable of processing 87 billion instructions per second of computing throughput, translating into faster and more reliable mission processing capability for an aircrew,” Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told Scout Warrior. High tech targeting and tracking technology is also being integrated onto the F-15, Gibbons added. This includes the addition of a passive long-range sensor called Infrared Search and Track, or IRST. The technology is also being engineered into the Navy F-18 Super Hornet. The technology can detect the heat signature, often called infrared emissions, of enemy aircraft. “The system can simultaneously track multiple targets and provide a highly effective air-to-air targeting capability, even when encountering advanced threats equipped with radar-jamming technology,” Navy officials said. IRST also provides an alternate air-to-air targeting system in a high threat electronic attack environment, Navy, Air Force and industry developers said. The F-15 is also being engineered for additional speed and range, along with weapons-firing ability. The weapons-carrying ability is being increased from 8 up to 16 weapons; this includes an ability to fire an AIM-9x or AIM-120 missile. In addition, upgrades to the aircraft include adding an increased ability to integrate or accommodate new emerging weapons systems as they become available. This is being done through both hardware and software-oriented “open standards” IP protocol and architecture. The aircraft is also getting a “fly-by-wire” automated flight control system. “Fly by wire means when the pilot provides the input - straight to a computer than then determines how to have the aircraft perform the way it wants - provides electrical signals for the more quickly and more safely move from point to point as opposed to using a mechanical controls stick,” Gibbons explained. Along with these weapons upgrades and other modifications, the F-15 is also getting upgrades to the pilot’s digital helmet and some radar signature reducing, or stealthy characteristics. However, at the same time, the F-15 is not a stealthy aircraft and is expected to be used in combat environments in what is called “less contested” environments where the Air Force already has a margin of air superiority over advanced enemy air defenses.  For this reason, the F-15 will also be increasing networked so as to better support existing 5th-generation platforms such as the F-22 and F-35, Air Force officials said. The intent of these F-15 upgrades is to effectively perform the missions assigned to the F-15 fleet, which are to support the F-22 in providing air superiority and the F-35 in providing precision attack capabilities, Leese said. “While these upgrades will not make these aircraft equivalent to 5th generation fighters, they will allow the F-15 to support 5th generation fighters in performing their missions, and will also allow F-15s to assume missions in more permissive environments where capabilities of 5th generation fighters are not required,” Leese added. Gibbons added that the upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that the fighter aircraft remains superior to its Chinese equivalent.    “The F-15 as a vital platform that still has a capability that cannot be matched in terms of ability to fly high, fly fast, go very far carry a lot. It is an air dominance machine,” Gibbons explained.   Kris Osborn can be reached at Kris.Osborn@Scout.com.

Now experts want to 'reverse' the flaperon's journey in an effort to determine the most likely crash site.  Air crash investigators want to create several replicas of this piece of wreckage from MH370 and dump it in the ocean after being fitted with satellite trackers to determine drift rates  Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, pictured, said he remains optimistic that the missing Boeing 777 Malaysian Airlines jet will be found  Peter Foley, Australian Transport Safety Bureau director of Flight 370 search operations will track these replica 'flaperons' which will be dumped in the ocean next March and tracked So far, experts have searched approximately 46,000 square miles of the ocean floor during a two-year operation but have failed to find the missing jet.  Greg Hood Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner, who last month took over responsibility for the search, is currently trying to identify new areas where the jet could be. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Lochte's shame-faced sidekicks jet out of Rio: Conger and... 'You took something and got better every day': John Stewart... Share this article Share However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. Hood said: 'If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity.'  This Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 vanished on March 8, 2014, killing all 239 people A multi-national team has searched extensively for the missing jet without success This piece of wreckage was confirmed as belonging to the missing jet after it washed ashore on the island of Reunion, more than 15 months after the jet disappeared without a trace Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 15 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 340 miles. Foley said: 'Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot.'  Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 40,000 feet after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 12,000 feet and 20,000 feet a minute before it crashed. A rate of 2,000 feet a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. Foley said: 'The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it's found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide. 'If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking.' Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 65-foot swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 4,000 square miles of seabed, which is outside the original 23,000-square-mile high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 1,700 miles and 1,200 miles from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. Hood said: 'We are still hopeful and optimistic.' Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. Foley added: 'We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it.'

Miami, United States:  With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts are set to embark on a spacewalk on Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. Early Morning Start The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05 am (1205 GMT) with veteran NASA astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers -- also known as extravehicular (EV) crew -- are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM," she added. "In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." Second Spacewalk Planned NASA is planning a second spacewalk on September 1 for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. NASA has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment -- and it is not the same as what we do on the ground."

Credit: NASA Astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins plan to venture outside the lab complex Friday for a long-awaited spacewalk to attach a new docking mechanism, the first of two that will be used by U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to carry astronauts to and from the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The Boeing-built International Docking Adapter, or IDA, was delivered to the station in July aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. Williams and Rubins plan to help lock it to the station’s former shuttle docking port at the front of the Harmony module, connecting power and data cables put in place during earlier spacewalks. They also plan to route cables to Harmony’s upper port where a second IDA will be attached in 2018. Until then, Boeing’s CST-100 “Starliner” spacecraft and SpaceX’s piloted Dragon will both use the forward IDA, starting with unpiloted and piloted SpaceX test fights in 2017 followed by similar test flights by Boeing late next year and early 2018. Once the CST-100 and crewed Dragon begin operational flights, routinely carrying crews to and from the station, NASA will have independent access to the orbiting laboratory for the first time since the space shuttle’s last flight in 2011. “Having this capability is really going to help us in general,” said Kenny Todd, NASA space station operations manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It gives us redundancy in our launch services, being able to get crews to the space station, and certainly that’s a win for everybody in this partnership. “So we’re very excited to get that milestone checked and get to the point where we can have crews launch from different places around the Earth and servicing the station.” Along with giving NASA and partner astronauts independent access to the space station, the new commercial ferry ships will carry four crew members to the station per flight compared to the three-seat Soyuz. That will allow NASA to boost the station’s crew from six to seven, greatly expanding the time available for research. “If you look today at the way the increments play out, a lot of times we’ll be running a little short on crew time,” Todd said. “That tends to be our pinch point sometimes relative to some of the research we’re doing. So having an extra … crew member is going to be very important for us.” While the Boeing and SpaceX crew ferry ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz for crew transportation, at least one NASA-sponsored astronaut will continue to ride aloft aboard each station-bound Soyuz while a cosmonaut is expected to be on board when each U.S. spacecraft takes off. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships, and its crew, to depart. NASA managers initially hoped to get the first IDA attached last year. But the initial unit, which was to be attached to Harmony’s forward port, was lost in June 2015 when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic launch failure, destroying a station-bound Dragon cargo ship. Boeing is in the process of building a third IDA to replace the lost unit and if all goes well, IDA-3 will be launched and attached to the station in 2018. While a single IDA can handle the expected traffic in the near term, two ports are needed to fully support eventual crew rotations and additional cargo ships. Floating in the station’s Quest airlock module, Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and Rubins, a molecular biologist, plan to switch their spacesuits to battery power around 8:05 a.m. EDT (GMT-4) Friday to officially kick off a planned six-and-a-half-hour excursion. It will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams and the first for Rubins. They will be assisted by Japanese astronaut Takua Onishi, working inside the space station, and astronaut Tom Marshburn, a veteran spacewalker in mission control who will handle communications between the station and flight controllers in Houston. For identification, Williams, call sign EV-1, will be wearing a suit with red stripes and using helmet camera No. 17. Rubins, EV-2, will be using an unmarked suit with helmetcam No. 20. This will be the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the third so far this year and the second staged by NASA. During a NASA spacewalk in January, a small amount of water made its way into astronaut Tim Kopra’s helmet, prompting an early end to the excursion. It was the first significant water-related issue with a NASA spacesuit since a much more serious leak flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet in 2013. That leak was caused by contamination that clogged an internal filter in the suit’s cooling system. Kopra’s suit was returned to Earth for a detailed examination and while it operated normally in Earth’s gravity, engineers suspect the minor leakage seen in January may have been caused by subtle issues with the suit’s sublimator, which controls the processing of condensation. For Friday’s spacewalk, Todd said, Williams and Rubins will use different temperature settings to minimize condensate production early in the outing and engineers are confident the suits will work properly. After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting necessary tools and two foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will make their way to the front end of the station where the old shuttle port, pressurized mating adapter No. 2, or PMA-2, is attached to the Harmony module’s forward hatch. The station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon cargo ship’s unpressurized trunk section overnight Wednesday and moved it to within about two feet of PMA-2 to await the astronauts. Power and data cables needed by the IDA were routed out to the docking port during three spacewalks dating back to February 2015. Once in position, firmly anchored in foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will attach tethers to the IDA and connect cables providing power to internal heaters, sensors and the latching mechanism that will lock it to PMA-2. The spacewalkers then will help guide the IDA into place so Onishi, using a control panel inside the station, can command the latches to engage, locking the docking mechanism to the end of the PMA. The spacewalkers then will complete work with various jumpers and cables, cover up reflectors once used by approaching shuttle crews to help determine distance and relative velocity and install others designed for use by CST-100 and crew Dragon spacecraft. With the IDA in place, Williams will route ethernet cables needed by a future Russian module while Rubins routes a final set of cables to the top of Harmony where IDA-3 will eventually be attached. She then will assist Williams. If time is available, the spacewalkers will tie down the brake handle on an equipment cart attached to rails on the forward side of the station’s solar power truss and carry out a photo survey of a physics instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Assuming no major problems develop, the astronauts will venture back outside on Sept. 1 to retract an unneeded solar array cooling radiator that was extended in 2012 as part of troubleshooting to locate a coolant leak. They also plan to install an HD television camera on the station’s truss, replace a light and inspect struts associated with a large mechanism that allows outboard solar arrays to rotate. At least two more spacewalks had been planned before the end of the year to install a replacement set of solar array batteries. But launch of the batteries aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship, originally planned for Sept. 30, is on indefinite hold pending work to fix a leak in the vehicle’s propulsion system. Onishi and astronaut Shane Kimbrough, who is scheduled for launch to the station Sept. 23, originally planned to carry out the battery swap out in October. But that EVA almost certainly will be delayed past Oct. 30 when Onishi, Rubins and Soyuz commander Anatoly Ivanishin are scheduled to return to Earth. As of this writing, it’s not known when the HTV might be ready for launch or when the battery spacewalk might be carried out.

(AP Photo/Rod McGuirk)  (The Associated Press) Previous Next CANBERRA, Australia –  Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood said. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current vast expanse southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location. "If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity," Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 15 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether wind or currents determine how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers (340 miles). "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot," Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit to ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner flew far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters (12,000 feet) and 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 meters (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it's found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide," Foley said. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking, "he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take until December. Less than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of seabed which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometer (23,000-square-mile) high-priority search zone has yet to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ship are based. "We are still hopeful and optimistic," said Hood, who took over leadership of the Australian bureau in July. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. "We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it," Foley said.

Once the CST-100 and crewed Dragon begin operational flights, routinely carrying crews to and from the station, NASA will have independent access to the orbiting laboratory for the first time since the space shuttle’s last flight in 2011. “Having this capability is really going to help us in general,” said Kenny Todd, NASA space station operations manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It gives us redundancy in our launch services, being able to get crews to the space station, and certainly that’s a win for everybody in this partnership. “So we’re very excited to get that milestone checked and get to the point where we can have crews launch from different places around the Earth and servicing the station.” Along with giving NASA and partner astronauts independent access to the space station, the new commercial ferry ships will carry four crew members to the station per flight compared to the three-seat Soyuz. That will allow NASA to boost the station’s crew from six to seven, greatly expanding the time available for research. “If you look today at the way the increments play out, a lot of times we’ll be running a little short on crew time,” Todd said. “That tends to be our pinch point sometimes relative to some of the research we’re doing. So having an extra … crew member is going to be very important for us.” While the Boeing and SpaceX crew ferry ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz for crew transportation, at least one NASA-sponsored astronaut will continue to ride aloft aboard each station-bound Soyuz while a cosmonaut is expected to be on board when each U.S. spacecraft takes off. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships, and its crew, to depart. NASA managers initially hoped to get the first IDA attached last year. But the initial unit, which was to be attached to Harmony’s forward port, was lost in June 2015 when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic launch failure, destroying a station-bound Dragon cargo ship. Boeing is in the process of building a third IDA to replace the lost unit and if all goes well, IDA-3 will be launched and attached to the station in 2018. While a single IDA can handle the expected traffic in the near term, two ports are needed to fully support eventual crew rotations and additional cargo ships. Floating in the station’s Quest airlock module, Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and Rubins, a molecular biologist, plan to switch their spacesuits to battery power around 8:05 a.m. EDT (GMT-4) Friday to officially kick off a planned six-and-a-half-hour excursion. It will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams and the first for Rubins. They will be assisted by Japanese astronaut Takua Onishi, working inside the space station, and astronaut Tom Marshburn, a veteran spacewalker in mission control who will handle communications between the station and flight controllers in Houston. For identification, Williams, call sign EV-1, will be wearing a suit with red stripes and using helmet camera No. 17. Rubins, EV-2, will be using an unmarked suit with helmetcam No. 20. This will be the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the third so far this year and the second staged by NASA. During a NASA spacewalk in January, a small amount of water made its way into astronaut Tim Kopra’s helmet, prompting an early end to the excursion. It was the first significant water-related issue with a NASA spacesuit since a much more serious leak flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet in 2013. That leak was caused by contamination that clogged an internal filter in the suit’s cooling system. Kopra’s suit was returned to Earth for a detailed examination and while it operated normally in Earth’s gravity, engineers suspect the minor leakage seen in January may have been caused by subtle issues with the suit’s sublimator, which controls the processing of condensation. For Friday’s spacewalk, Todd said, Williams and Rubins will use different temperature settings to minimize condensate production early in the outing and engineers are confident the suits will work properly. After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting necessary tools and two foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will make their way to the front end of the station where the old shuttle port, pressurized mating adapter No. 2, or PMA-2, is attached to the Harmony module’s forward hatch. The station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon cargo ship’s unpressurized trunk section overnight Wednesday and moved it to within about two feet of PMA-2 to await the astronauts. Power and data cables needed by the IDA were routed out to the docking port during three spacewalks dating back to February 2015. Once in position, firmly anchored in foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will attach tethers to the IDA and connect cables providing power to internal heaters, sensors and the latching mechanism that will lock it to PMA-2. The spacewalkers then will help guide the IDA into place so Onishi, using a control panel inside the station, can command the latches to engage, locking the docking mechanism to the end of the PMA. The spacewalkers then will complete work with various jumpers and cables, cover up reflectors once used by approaching shuttle crews to help determine distance and relative velocity and install others designed for use by CST-100 and crew Dragon spacecraft. With the IDA in place, Williams will route ethernet cables needed by a future Russian module while Rubins routes a final set of cables to the top of Harmony where IDA-3 will eventually be attached. She then will assist Williams. If time is available, the spacewalkers will tie down the brake handle on an equipment cart attached to rails on the forward side of the station’s solar power truss and carry out a photo survey of a physics instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Assuming no major problems develop, the astronauts will venture back outside on Sept. 1 to retract an unneeded solar array cooling radiator that was extended in 2012 as part of troubleshooting to locate a coolant leak. They also plan to install an HD television camera on the station’s truss, replace a light and inspect struts associated with a large mechanism that allows outboard solar arrays to rotate. At least two more spacewalks had been planned before the end of the year to install a replacement set of solar array batteries. But launch of the batteries aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship, originally planned for Sept. 30, is on indefinite hold pending work to fix a leak in the vehicle’s propulsion system. Onishi and astronaut Shane Kimbrough, who is scheduled for launch to the station Sept. 23, originally planned to carry out the battery swap out in October. But that EVA almost certainly will be delayed past Oct. 30 when Onishi, Rubins and Soyuz commander Anatoly Ivanishin are scheduled to return to Earth. As of this writing, it’s not known when the HTV might be ready for launch or when the battery spacewalk might be carried out.

Delta Flight 2845 left Minneapolis/St. Paul with 130 customers Thursday evening and touched down at the Ellsworth Air Force Base instead of its intended destination at the nearby Rapid City Regional Airport. The Associated Press notes “Ellsworth is about 10 miles due north of Rapid City Regional Airport. The two airports have runways that are oriented nearly identically to the compass, from northwest to southeast.” USA TODAY Wrong-airport landings rare, but not unheard of Delta confirmed the incident in a statement, saying “the flight re-departed for Rapid City Thursday night after coordinating with officials.” Delta added in its statement that “the crew has been taken off-duty while an investigation commences by the National Transportation Safety Board. Delta will fully cooperate with that investigation and has already begun an internal review of its own. Safety is always Delta’s top priority.” The carrier said it has contacted Flight 2845 passengers "and offered a gesture of apology for the inconvenience."

While rare, U.S. flights have occasionally landed at the wrong airports before. In fact, a similar incident involving the same airports also occurred in 2004 when a Northwest Airlines A319 also mistakenly landed at Ellsworth. More recently, a Southwest Airlines flight bound for Branson, Mo., mistakenly landed at a much smaller municipal field nearby in January 2014. The Southwest 737 involved in that incident had to brake hard and come to an abrupt stop ahead of a steep drop at the end of that airport's shorter runway.

Kennedy Airport on June 11, 2015.  (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USAT) Is JetBlue ready to return to Atlanta? That seems to be the case, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The newspaper reports JetBlue has sent the Atlanta airport “a letter of interest … saying it plans to renew service to Atlanta in September 2017.” JetBlue said it would add up to 16 flights a day if it were able to secure two gates at the world’s busiest airport. FULL REPORT: JetBlue plans Atlanta flights in ‘17 (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) “We believe that the Atlanta air market is currently overpriced and suffering from insufficient competition,” Dave Clark, JetBlue’s VP of network planning, is quoted by the Journal-Constitution as writing in the airline’s letter to the airport. JetBlue previously flew to Atlanta in 2003, when it launched nonstop service to its focus city in Long Beach, Calif. The airline soon added a second California route (Oakland), but its stay in Atlanta would be short-lived. The carrier withdrew from Atlanta after just six months, exiting amid a turf war that erupted between Delta and now-defunct AirTran and caught JetBlue in the crossfire. FROM THE ARCHIVES: JetBlue gains on its competition (August 2003) USATODAY USATODAY.com - JetBlue calls it quits in Atlanta Then-upstart AirTran was building its hub in Atlanta, but its expansion provoked a strong response from Atlanta-based Delta when it added nonstop flights between Atlanta and L.A. Delta beefed up its own Atlanta-L.A. schedule to fend off AirTran, going to 13 daily round-trip flights from eight, according to media reports at the time. Fares plummeted amid the intensifying Delta-AirTran turf war. It also put pressure on JetBlue to cut fares on its Atlanta-California, ultimately prompting the airline to pull out. "We just thought it was a little crazy," then-JetBlue CEO David Neeleman said in 2003 about the decision to leave Atlanta amid the intensifying battle between Delta and AirTran. As for a potential return to Atlanta, JetBlue's interest apparently hinges on its ability to gain access to gates that meet its needs. In its letter to the airport, JetBlue says the "common use" gates in Terminal D are “are not satisfactory," according to the Journal-Constitution. Instead, JetBlue says it's seeking "two preferential gates that are suitable for both JetBlue and the airport."

The airline also rolled out a new premium economy cabin – called “Premium.” The seats will fly on the Virgin Australia's long-haul Boeing 777-300ER that fly daily between the United States and the Australian cities of Sydney and Brisbane. The new business class cabin was designed by the London-based tangerine agency and includes 37 seats (up from 34). The seats are laid out in a 1-2-1 reverse-herringbone configuration (instead of the previous 2-3-2 layout), which gives every passenger direct aisle access. “We won’t have anybody climbing over customers and falling on top of them during turbulence trying to get out of their seat,” said Virgin Australia Group CEO John Borghetti. The new business-class seats will be installed on all five of the carrier's Boeing 777s by September 2016 (three are already done). They feature multiple work, dining and personal storage spaces and 18-inch high definition touch-screens for in-flight entertainment. Dividers between the two center seats can be raised or lowered for privacy. For sleeping, the 21-inch wide business-class seats convert into fully lie-flat beds that are 28 inches wide and 80 inches long. A touch-screen with specially-designed icons makes it easy for passengers to move and adjust the seats. An attended bar and an associated lounge area between the business-class and premium economy cabins presents what Borghetti called a “wow factor” for all passengers entering the aircraft and a comfortable socializing space for business cabin passengers during the flight. The side console is still accessible during meal service in business class on Virgin Australia's reconfigured Boeing 777-300ER.  (Photo: Harriet Baskas, Special for USA TODAY) “Virgin Australia was really ambitious,” said tangerine’s Chief Creative Officer Matt Round. “They wanted something with a lot of spirit and precise technical-ness to it and we were able to capture some of what they wanted by being creative with the bar space and with the materials and textures on the seats and by playing with light and form.” In addition to the business cabin, Virgin Australia updated the premium economy cabin (“Premium”) on its 777-300ER aircraft. There are now 24 seats, each 19.5 inches wide, with an increased pitch of 41 inches and nine inches of recline. In-flight premium service includes plated meals and a self-serve pantry. Upgrades in the business-class cabin – especially eliminating the middle seats – are important, said Borghetti, because now “the consumer expects it” and airlines that don’t stay current end up having to discount their ticket prices. Virgin Australia, said Borghetti, will likely raise its business class fares a bit in the fall when the retrofitting of all five 777s is completed. Increased interest in travel between the United States and Australia (visitors to Australia from the U.S. were up 10% last year, according to Tourism Australia) has also sparked an uptick in the number of flights offered between the U.S. and Australia, including offerings form Qantas, American and United Airlines, and increased competition for passengers. In addition to introducing its new business class and premium cabins for trans-Pacific routes, Virgin Australia announced on Wednesday that the airline will start adding in-flight Wi-Fi to its Boeing 737-800, Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 aircraft starting next year. Virgin Australia operates 14 flights a week between Australia and Los Angeles. On Wednesday, Virgin Australia alliance partner Delta Air Lines and Los Angeles International Airport announced the approval of an agreement for Delta to relocate from Terminals 5 and 6 to Terminals 2 and 3 sometime between January 2017 and December 2018. As part of Delta’s $1.9 billion upgrade of the two terminals, Virgin Australia will be relocate from Terminal 3 to Terminal 2, possibly by next summer.

Share story By Tony Capaccio Bloomberg News The Air Force won permission from Pentagon officials to sign two production contracts with Boeing for the first 19 KC-46 tankers, deals valued at a combined $2.8 billion. The approval came after a meeting of the Pentagon’s Defense Acquisition Board headed by Frank Kendall, the Defense Department’s top weapons buyer. The decision was announced by the Air Force in an emailed statement. “I commend the team for diligently working through some difficult technical challenges,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in the statement. “The KC-46 program has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernization needed in our strategic tanker fleet.” The decision on initial, low-rate production had slipped from August 2015 and then from April of this year to resolve technical issues with the tanker’s refueling system. The final hurdle was cleared last month with the successful refueling of an A-10 Warthog that verified Boeing fixed flaws in the boom used for in-air refueling.

Boeing is in line to produce as many as 179 tankers under the $52 billion program. A decision to approve full production — the most lucrative phase — has slipped to March 2018 from September 2017, the Air Force disclosed in March, as a result of cumulative delays in aircraft development from technical issues, such as wiring and the refueling system. The KC-46, built on the air frame of Boeing’s 767 commercial jet, is the first new U.S. tanker since the 1980s. Boeing said in July that it would report a $2.1 billion after-tax accounting charge for the second quarter, primarily because of setbacks involving passenger planes but also due to a $393 million loss stemming from delays on the KC-46.

NASA Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins plan to venture outside the lab complex Friday for a long-awaited spacewalk to attach a new docking mechanism, the first of two that will be used by U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to carry astronauts to and from the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. The Boeing-built International Docking Adapter, or IDA, was delivered to the station in July aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. Williams and Rubins plan to help lock it to the station’s former shuttle docking port at the front of the Harmony module, connecting power and data cables put in place during earlier spacewalks. They also plan to route cables to Harmony’s upper port where a second IDA will be attached in 2018. Until then, Boeing’s CST-100 “Starliner” spacecraft and SpaceX’s piloted Dragon will both use the forward IDA, starting with unpiloted and piloted SpaceX test fights in 2017 followed by similar test flights by Boeing late next year and early 2018. Once the CST-100 and crewed Dragon begin operational flights, routinely carrying crews to and from the station, NASA will have independent access to the orbiting laboratory for the first time since the space shuttle’s last flight in 2011. “Having this capability is really going to help us in general,” said Kenny Todd, NASA space station operations manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. “It gives us redundancy in our launch services, being able to get crews to the space station, and certainly that’s a win for everybody in this partnership. “So we’re very excited to get that milestone checked and get to the point where we can have crews launch from different places around the Earth and servicing the station.” Along with giving NASA and partner astronauts independent access to the space station, the new commercial ferry ships will carry four crew members to the station per flight compared to the three-seat Soyuz. That will allow NASA to boost the station’s crew from six to seven, greatly expanding the time available for research. “If you look today at the way the increments play out, a lot of times we’ll be running a little short on crew time,” Todd said. “That tends to be our pinch point sometimes relative to some of the research we’re doing. So having an extra ... crew member is going to be very important for us.” While the Boeing and SpaceX crew ferry ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz for crew transportation, at least one NASA-sponsored astronaut will continue to ride aloft aboard each station-bound Soyuz while a cosmonaut is expected to be on board when each U.S. spacecraft takes off. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships, and its crew, to depart. This graphic shows how the International Docking Adapter (shown in yellow) fits on the front of the space station’s old shuttle docking port, along with the myriad cables that will route power and data to and from the module. NASA NASA managers initially hoped to get the first IDA attached last year. But the initial unit, which was to be attached to Harmony’s forward port, was lost in June 2015 when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket suffered a catastrophic launch failure, destroying a station-bound Dragon cargo ship. Boeing is in the process of building a third IDA to replace the lost unit and if all goes well, IDA-3 will be launched and attached to the station in 2018. While a single IDA can handle the expected traffic in the near term, two ports are needed to fully support eventual crew rotations and additional cargo ships. Floating in the station’s Quest airlock module, Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and Rubins, a molecular biologist, plan to switch their spacesuits to battery power around 8:05 a.m. EDT (GMT-4) Friday to officially kick off a planned six-and-a-half-hour excursion. It will be the fourth spacewalk for Williams and the first for Rubins. They will be assisted by Japanese astronaut Takua Onishi, working inside the space station, and astronaut Tom Marshburn, a veteran spacewalker in mission control who will handle communications between the station and flight controllers in Houston. For identification, Williams, call sign EV-1, will be wearing a suit with red stripes and using helmet camera No. 17. Rubins, EV-2, will be using an unmarked suit with helmetcam No. 20. This will be the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998, the third so far this year and the second staged by NASA. During a NASA spacewalk in January, a small amount of water made its way into astronaut Tim Kopra’s helmet, prompting an early end to the excursion. It was the first significant water-related issue with a NASA spacesuit since a much more serious leak flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet in 2013. That leak was caused by contamination that clogged an internal filter in the suit’s cooling system. Kopra’s suit was returned to Earth for a detailed examination and while it operated normally in Earth’s gravity, engineers suspect the minor leakage seen in January may have been caused by subtle issues with the suit’s sublimator, which controls the processing of condensation. For Friday’s spacewalk, Todd said, Williams and Rubins will use different temperature settings to minimize condensate production early in the outing and engineers are confident the suits will work properly. After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting necessary tools and two foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will make their way to the front end of the station where the old shuttle port, pressurized mating adapter No. 2, or PMA-2, is attached to the Harmony module’s forward hatch. The International Docking Adapter during final preparations before launch in July. NASA The station’s robot arm pulled the IDA from the Dragon cargo ship’s unpressurized trunk section overnight Wednesday and moved it to within about two feet of PMA-2 to await the astronauts. Power and data cables needed by the IDA were routed out to the docking port during three spacewalks dating back to February 2015. Once in position, firmly anchored in foot restraints, Williams and Rubins will attach tethers to the IDA and connect cables providing power to internal heaters, sensors and the latching mechanism that will lock it to PMA-2. The spacewalkers then will help guide the IDA into place so Onishi, using a control panel inside the station, can command the latches to engage, locking the docking mechanism to the end of the PMA. The spacewalkers then will complete work with various jumpers and cables, cover up reflectors once used by approaching shuttle crews to help determine distance and relative velocity and install others designed for use by CST-100 and crew Dragon spacecraft. With the IDA in place, Williams will route ethernet cables needed by a future Russian module while Rubins routes a final set of cables to the top of Harmony where IDA-3 will eventually be attached. She then will assist Williams. If time is available, the spacewalkers will tie down the brake handle on an equipment cart attached to rails on the forward side of the station’s solar power truss and carry out a photo survey of a physics instrument known as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. Assuming no major problems develop, the astronauts will venture back outside on Sept. 1 to retract an unneeded solar array cooling radiator that was extended in 2012 as part of troubleshooting to locate a coolant leak. They also plan to install an HD television camera on the station’s truss, replace a light and inspect struts associated with a large mechanism that allows outboard solar arrays to rotate. At least two more spacewalks had been planned before the end of the year to install a replacement set of solar array batteries. But launch of the batteries aboard a Japanese HTV cargo ship, originally planned for Sept. 30, is on indefinite hold pending work to fix a leak in the vehicle’s propulsion system. Onishi and astronaut Shane Kimbrough, who is scheduled for launch to the station Sept. 23, originally planned to carry out the battery swap out in October. But that EVA almost certainly will be delayed past Oct. 30 when Onishi, Rubins and Soyuz commander Anatoly Ivanishin are scheduled to return to Earth. As of this writing, it’s not known when the HTV might be ready for launch or when the battery spacewalk might be carried out. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Clint Boulton (CIO (US)) 03 August, 2016 00:00 - - - - print email Comments Boeing's decision to run its aviation analytics applications on the Azure cloud computing software is a big win for Microsoft, which is chasing Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the high-stakes race to sell computing, storage and other infrastructure software over the internet. The aerospace giant based its choice largely on Microsoft’s willingness to help it develop applications to serve its 300 airline customers, which are starved for ways to optimize fuel efficiency and better manage fleets. "The combination of technical acumen and depth, as well as where they're investing and how they're addressing the business customer, really matched up with our objectives," says Andrew Gendreau, director of advanced information solutions at Boeing's digital aviation unit. He tells CIO.com that Microsoft also impressed with its commitment to advancing its Cortana analytics and internet of things suites as well as augmented reality, which could play a big factor modeling aviation modeling. [ Related: Google Glass takes flight at Boeing ] That even a division within a large enterprise would standardize on Azure shows just how far the platform has come in a few years. AWS grabbed an early lead in corporate cloud infrastructure a decade ago as developers began consuming its elastic storage and compute services. With AWS proving reliable and cost-effective, developers sung AWS' praises, boasting that the capability to spin up and shut down servers at will made application development more nimble. AWS soon began attracting larger corporate customers, notably Netflix, Capital One, Pfizer and the CIA. Boeing deal shows Microsoft no longer 'bumbling around' Azure has come on strong under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, whose mobile first, cloud first strategy is resonating with CIOs. Pattonair CIO Brian Long recently told CIO.com that CIOs have noticed how Microsoft has "gotten its act together," entering the mobile and cloud frays after a few years of "bumbling around." Boeing's digital aviation unit chose Azure after using AWS, CenturyLink and other vendors. Gendreau acknowledges that while there are "players that accelerate your business" most cloud providers offer point solutions, which can introduce complexity in Boeing customer's aircraft systems. Conversely, Microsoft is willing to work closely with organizations to understand their business objectives and provide more comprehensive software suites. [ Related: First look: Microsoft Azure Stack hits the ground running ] Greg Jones, Microsoft’s global industry director for travel. Gendreau says Microsoft will help Boeing generate analytics that enable predictive aircraft maintenance, optimize fuel efficiency and fleet management in an industry where margins are razor thin. While airlines globally generate about $700 billion in revenue, they spend about $700 billion in operating costs, Gendreau says. Ensuring access to real-time machine information will assist pilots, mechanics, dispatchers and flight attendants in making flying more efficient. Ideally, this will help airlines sustain profitable growth. "The aircraft are becoming smarter and smarter and the operators are all looking to gain more operational insights into what's happening on the aircraft," says Greg Jones, Microsoft’s global industry director for travel. "This is a true opportunity to look at what transformation can occur within the aviation space." Several smaller organizations, from native cloud companies such as Box to the nearly 200-year-old publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt are using Azure. Yet if Microsoft is going to challenge AWS it needs more marquee enterprise customers like Boeing and General Electric, which earlier this month said that its Predix IoT platform would run on Azure. In AWS, Microsoft faces stiff test Ed Anderson, a Gartner analyst who tracks the cloud computing market, says Microsoft’s recent enterprise wins underscores how traditional businesses such as GE and Boeing are adopting progressive computing approaches, including cloud, IoT and machine intelligence. “The fact that Boeing announced this with Microsoft rather than with AWS shows some traction that Microsoft is gaining,” says Anderson. “It’s very important for Microsoft to win deals like this.” AWS played a major role in driving Amazon.com's profitable second quarter Thursday, reporting revenue of $2.87 billion, up 58 percent from the same period in 2015 and the most it ever delivered in one quarter. If AWS keeps up the pace, it will easily exceed the $10 billion run rate CEO Jeff Bezos foreshadowed for 2016. And there's no signs of slippage: Salesforce.com selected AWS as its preferred public cloud infrastructure provider and Kellogg’s, Brooks Brothers, Ferrara Candy Company are all running critical SAP business applications on AWS. Microsoft’s cloud business is on a bit of a tear itself. The company said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue from Azure grew 102 percent, while Azure compute usage doubled year-over-year. Its Intelligent Cloud, which includes server Windows Server and Azure, grew 7 percent to $6.7 billion. More broadly, Microsoft’s commercial cloud business, which includes Azure, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics CRM, achieved a $12 billion run rate, up from $10 billion in its previous quarter. However, Microsoft’s accounting practices – it declines to disclose revenues for Azure alone -- make apples-to-apples comparisons between Azure and AWS impossible. Anderson says that while Microsoft’s enterprise reach goes deep, particularly with businesses that use .NET applications and that have inked enterprise agreements, AWS enjoys the pole position in the public cloud market. As such,Anderson says, Microsoft “must go the extra mile to attract some of these big deals.” Brand Post ​Seizing control of ERP costs to drive innovation More from Rimini Street Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

The milestone marks yet another record for ANA as it becomes the world’s first airline to operate 50 787 Dreamliners. “The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet,” said Osamu Shinobe, president and CEO, ANA. “As the launch customer of the 787 Dreamliner family, we are proud to welcome the 50th 787 Dreamliner into our fleet, where it will continue to serve our passengers with the most innovative and memorable flying experience.” As part of efforts to expand its global network, ANA also announced plans to launch new routes from Tokyo, Narita to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in September this year and Mexico City, Mexico in February next year using 787 Dreamliners. ANA became the launch customer of the 787 when it purchased 50 in 2004, and was the first to bring the airplane into service in 2011. The airline operates more than 11 percent of all 787s around the world today and has flown an estimated 125,000 flights with the Dreamliner. “As the launch customer of the 787 and our largest 787 customer, we are honored to celebrate this important milestone with ANA,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “ANA is a valued Boeing customer and has been a vital partner on this program. Today’s event demonstrates the strength of our enduring relationship and we look forward to introducing the 787-10 to ANA in the coming years to complete the entire family of 787 Dreamliners in their fleet.” Already the world’s largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s on order, including the longest and newest member of the family, the 787-10. The airline also has 20 777-9 airplanes on order. ANA recently showcased its 50th 787 Dreamliner at the Farnborough International Airshow, performing high-performance demonstration flights for thousands in attendance and wowing millions of fans around the world on the internet. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an all-new, super-efficient family of airplanes that brings the speed and range of big jets to the middle of the market.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation (RSC) Energia and the US aircraft manufacturing company Boeing reached an agreement to solve dispute over the Sea Launch project, Energia's General Director Vladimir Solntsev said Thursday. MOSCOW (Sputnik) — In 2015, US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion compensation from its former partners under the Sea Launch, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. "We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on 'Sea Launch,' in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute's] settlement," Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. © Photo: Roscosmos Russian Scientists Developing 3D Bioprinter for Space UseHe added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a program of long-term cooperation, which included projects of far space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-percent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. ...

BUSINESS Say hello to underwater drones: The Pentagon is looking to extend its robot fighting forces Boeing Echo Voyager Boeing The 51-foot Boeing Echo Voyager is an unmanned undersea vehicle intended to roam the ocean for weeks or months. The 51-foot Boeing Echo Voyager is an unmanned undersea vehicle intended to roam the ocean for weeks or months. (Boeing) Samantha Masunaga This fall, an unusual vessel will begin sea trials off the coast of California. The 51-foot-long Boeing Echo Voyager will have no crew. It will glide underwater for days or weeks, quietly collecting data from the ocean floor to send back to crews on ships or on land. Ever since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military has relied more and more on flying drones to take on dangerous air missions. But increasingly, drones are taking to the sea as well. The U.S. Navy has proposed about $319 million for the development and purchase of underwater drones in the president’s budget for the coming fiscal year. It envisions them stealthily gathering intelligence on opponents, detecting and neutralizing mines, hunting submarines and charting the ocean floor. Last year, the Navy created the first deputy assistant secretary position focused on managing the development of unmanned systems, including underwater, surface and aerial efforts. Recent advances in autonomy, data transmission and miniaturizing computing power coincide with the military’s increased interest in finding ways to integrate unmanned systems into its war planning. Liquid Robotics shows its Wave Glider In this video produced by Liquid Robotics, the company shows how its Wave Glider unmanned surface vehicle works. In this video produced by Liquid Robotics, the company shows how its Wave Glider unmanned surface vehicle works. See more videos It’s part of a much broader strategy to leverage artificial intelligence and stay one step ahead of rivals, as the Pentagon did with guided weapons in the 1990s. “As tensions continue to grow with China and Russia, two militaries that have sophisticated and very large navies, there is a growing interest in making use of unmanned technology in the maritime sphere,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “They are scalable, they are dependable, they can operate with a fairly high degree of autonomy,” he said. “All these things would have been useful 30 years ago, but the technology wasn’t quite there.” The potential for naval drones to operate free of human operators was shown earlier this year when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, unveiled its Sea Hunter, a largely autonomous, unmanned anti-submarine vessel. The prototype, 132-foot-long Sea Hunter is designed to sail on its own for up to three months, find a submarine using sonar and other sensors, and trail it while sending location data back to human operators. The vessel completed its first performance trials off San Diego in late July, according to its builder, Reston, Va.-based Leidos. Underwater drones face different challenges than their aerial counterparts. For one, communication is more difficult, making it hard for an autonomous vehicle to report information it might pick up underwater. That hurdle is being worked on by Liquid Robotics, a Sunnyvale firm that makes the Wave Glider. The unmanned vehicle floats on the surface and uses wave and solar power to propel itself and its sensors for up to a year. The surfboard-shaped drone functions as a kind of gateway between underwater acoustic communications and air-based radio transmissions. The vehicle’s sensor computer connects a surface radio modem and antenna with an underwater acoustic modem, allowing information to be transmitted quickly back and forth. How a $2.7 billion blimp system became a 'zombie' programOpen link The same connection can be established with ships, though that can be expensive, or with buoys, which don’t allow for much movement. Other underwater vehicles have towed long antennas, but that is a much slower method of transmitting data, said Graham Hine, senior vice president of global partner development at Liquid Robotics. “We’re thinking it would be the router of the ocean,” he said. “Once you start to network things and then have ubiquitous communications and positioning, things start to get interesting.” The Wave Glider can carry a range of acoustic sensors that listen for vessels on the sea or piece together a picture of the ocean floor. Originally developed by company co-founders Roger Hine and Joseph Rizzi to listen to whale songs, the Wave Glider caught the interest of the Navy, which has worked with the company since 2008, Graham Hine said. Two years ago, the company struck a partnership with Boeing Co. to develop a military version, the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft, or SHARC, that combines the Wave Glider platform with Boeing’s sensor technology. Boeing sees the platform as a potential communication conduit between underwater vehicles and aircraft, ships or satellites. It is working with the Navy’s research lab to develop additional capabilities for SHARC. “Ultimately, it is a more efficient and effective way to do maritime surveillance, we think, in large ocean areas,” said Egan Greenstein, senior director of autonomous maritime systems at Boeing.

But to do a thorough job of surveillance and undersea data collection, drones need to stay submerged for weeks or even months without external help or power.  Boeing experienced this challenge first-hand when it used its Echo Ranger unmanned underwater vehicle for oil and gas surveying. The drone charged up and reported its status at a host ship, but when storms blew in all operations had to stop. Eventually, Boeing stopped using the Ranger for that kind of commercial work. “It was profitable while we were out doing the survey missions,” said Dan Tubbs, deputy director of Sea & Land at Boeing Phantom Works in Huntington Beach. “It was not profitable when it was in port all the time.” In March, Boeing unveiled the 50-ton Echo Voyager, which is designed to carry out months-long surveillance and reconnaissance missions for defense, commercial and scientific customers. Powered by a hybrid electric-battery/marine diesel system, the drone periodically surfaces to snorkel depth to recharge its batteries by raising a mast and running the diesel engines. That’s when the drone also can connect to satellite operations to transmit data to operators. It can send limited communications while submerged, but only to a nearby ship. To bolster its endurance, the Echo Voyager has backup systems. To give it a degree of autonomy, the navigation system incorporates motion and rotation sensors, as well as sonar to avoid obstacles. Autonomous systems have the potential to cut personnel costs, but developing them has proved to be complex and costly. In February, the Navy canceled further production of a remote mine-hunting system developed by Lockheed Martin Corp., cutting down the expected order from 54 to 10 that had already been delivered. The system was to be used in the Navy’s new littoral combat ships, but the autonomous vehicles that towed mine-hunting sensors were unreliable. “The autonomy side of the equation, the research is happening at a very quick pace,” said Holland Michel of Bard College. “But as you see time and time again, it’s very challenging to make unmanned systems that can make intelligent and dependable decisions on their own.” The biggest challenge to the industry’s growth could be its lack of versatility. There are simply more applications for unmanned aerial vehicles than underwater drones, especially in the commercial market, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan.  “I think the market will grow steadily, but it won’t be explosive like the unmanned aerial vehicle market,” he said. Eventually, though, the two drone worlds will merge. In May, AeroVironment Inc. of Monrovia announced it had a contract to sell to the Navy its small, Blackwing unmanned aircraft, a single-use drone that shoots out of a tube from submarines or autonomous undersea vehicles. It sends back data, then drops into the water once it’s done. A company spokesman said he could not comment on the size of the contract.  samantha.masunaga@latimes.com For more business news, follow me @smasunaga ALSO Video games in the Olympics?

Turkmenistan received three Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2013 and two Boeing 777-200 LR aircraft in 2014. In April 2015, Turkmenistan decided to purchase three more Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  In addition, Turkmenistan is considering the further acquisition of 50- and 100-seat aircraft for domestic flights. Currently, the Turkmenistan Airlines, in addition to domestic flights, carries out regular flights to dozens of countries. The area of the flights is constantly expanding. Thus, an intergovernmental agreement on flights was initialed between Turkmenistan and Luxembourg. In June 2015, Europe’s largest carrier, Cargolux Airlines International, started cargo flights from Luxembourg to Turkmen city of Turkmenbashi. Cargolux has been also flying to Ashgabat since June 2016. Turkmenistan also had negotiations with Turkey’s Pegasus Airlines on cooperation prospects and opening a Pegasus office in the country. Pegasus will in the near future start flights from Istanbul to Turkmenbashi. Turkmenistan is also constructing a new international airport in Ashgabat, which is designed to become a major transit hub for continental and intercontinental flights. Another international airport is being built in the city of Turkmenabat.

The plane is seen here on the runway outside Boeing's Everett Delivery Center. (Tim Stake photo)KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 19 (Bernama) -- Boeing delivered All Nippon Airways' (ANA) 50th 787 Dreamliner at a ceremony held at Boeing's Everett Delivery Center on Thursday. The milestone marked yet another record for ANA to become the world's first airline to operate 50 787 Dreamliners. "The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet. "As the launch customer of the 787 Dreamliner family, we are proud to welcome the 50th 787 Dreamliner into our fleet, where it will continue to serve our passengers with the most innovative and memorable flying experience," ANA President/Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Osamu Shinobe said in a statement. As part of efforts to expand its global network, ANA also announced plans to launch new routes from Tokyo in Narita to Phnom Penh in Cambodia in September and to Mexico City, Mexico, in February 2017, using 787 Dreamliners. ANA became the launch customer of the 787 when it purchased 50 aircraft in 2004 and was the first to bring the airplane into service in 2011. The airline currently operates more than 11 per cent of all 787s around the world and has flown an estimated 125,000 flights with the Dreamliner. "As the launch customer of the 787 and our largest 787 customer, we are honoured to celebrate this important milestone with ANA. "ANA is a valued Boeing customer and has been a vital partner on this programme. "This demonstrates the strength of our enduring relationship and we look forward to introducing the 787-10 to ANA in the coming years to complete the entire family of 787 Dreamliners in their fleet," Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner said. Already the world's largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s in Boeing's order book, including the longest and newest member of the family, the 787-10. The airline also has 20 777-9 airplanes on order. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an all-new, super-efficient family of airplanes that brings the speed and range of big jets to the middle of the market. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Petronas Benefits From Blue Ocean Strategy Ahmad Zahid Urges UMNO Members To Close Ranks With Those Outside Party PM Wants Ministries To Prepare Detailed Plans For Budget 2017 Allocations Other News Headlines UGA 2016: Main Focus Is Sosio-economy Of Rakyat, Not Politics- politic Petronas Able To Reduce Costs With Blue Ocean Strategy, Says Chairman- business Malaysian Top Men's Doubles Pairs Advance To Second Round Of Hong Kong Open- sports EPF Ensures Better Retirment Benefits- features Nikki Haley Leads Trump's Pick For US Ambassador To UN: Report- world Most Read News Petronas Benefits From Blue Ocean Strategy Ahmad Zahid Urges UMNO Members To Close Ranks With Those Outside Party Malaysian 'Drug Mule' Serving Sentence Outside Peruvian Prison - Wisma Putra Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

Crew Access Arm Installed for Starliner Missions by Steven Siceloff for KSC News Kennedy Space Center FL (SPX) Aug 18, 2016 The 50-foot-long, 90,000-pound Crew Access Arm is hoisted off the ground to be installed on the Crew Access Tower at SLC-41. Image courtesy NASA and Kim Shiflett. Watch a video on the technology here. For a larger version of this image please go here. The Crew Access Arm for a new generation of spacecraft was lifted into place the morning of Aug. 15 at Space Launch Complex-41 where workers are modifying the launch pad to give astronauts access to Boeing's CST-100 Starliner on launch day. The 50-foot-long, 90,000-pound arm will form a bridge between the newly built Crew Access Tower and the hatch of the spacecraft. Astronauts will walk across the arm to climb inside the Starliner for flight. Poised to begin a mission, the Starliner will sit on top of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The arm also holds the White Room, an enclosed area big enough for astronauts to make final adjustments to their suits before climbing aboard the spacecraft. Work began around 7:30 a.m. with crews attaching cables to the arm before a crane slowly hoisted itoff the launch pad surface. Another crew of workers was waiting in the tower about 160 feet above the surface as the crane maneuvered one end of the arm into a notch on the tower. They bolted and welded the apparatus to the tower to complete the process. The addition of the arm is the latest in a rapid string of accomplishments for NASA's Commercial Crew Program and its partners. Working independently on separate contracts with NASA's program, Boeing and SpaceX are developing spacecraft and launch systems to take astronauts to the International Space Station. The additional launch capability will allow the resident crew of the station to grow by one, effectively doubling the time astronauts have in orbit to conduct science vital to spaceflight research, as well as investigations into benefits for those on Earth. "You have to stop and celebrate these moments in the craziness of all the things we do," said Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. "It's going to be so cool when our astronauts are walking out across this access arm to get on the spacecraft and go to the space station." The arm and tower have been constructed between Atlas V launches at SLC-41. The arm was built at a construction yard near NASA's Kennedy Space Center and trucked to the launch pad on Aug. 11. The tower was built in segments close to the launch pad and stacked together to form the nearly 200-foot-tall structure. It is the first new crew access structure at the Florida spaceport since the space shuttle's Fixed Service Structures were put in place before Columbia's first flight in 1981. It also is the first new crew access tower at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station since the Apollo Program. "You think about when we started building this 18 months ago and now it's one of the most visible changes to the Cape's horizon since the 1960s," said Chris Ferguson, a former shuttle commander who is now Boeing's deputy program manager for the company's Commercial Crew Program. "It's a fantastic day." The advances reminded some of the early days of human spaceflight when the first generation Atlas rockets put astronauts into orbit. "John Glenn was the first to fly on an Atlas, now our next leap into the future will be to have astronauts launch from here on Atlas V," said Barb Egan, program manager for Commercial Crew for ULA. Earth is not the only place work is underway to prepare for Commercial Crew missions. Astronauts on the International Space Station will perform a spacewalk Friday to install an International Docking Adapter to a station port that will allow visiting spacecraft including those on commercial crew missions to dock with the orbiting laboratory. Carried into orbit during the most recent cargo resupply mission, the IDA will become a doorway for astronauts as they cross from their spacecraft into the station. The adapters are outfitted with a network of sensors and fixtures that work with automated systems to dock the spacecraft to the port.

ISLAMABAD: The Boeing Company has shown interest in the conversion of Pakistan International Airlines' (PIA's) existing 777-300 ERs into the new 787 Dreamliner - an airplane with the right size, unique capabilities, and unmatched passenger experience. The interest was shown in a letter written by Boeing's Commercial Airlines Vice Chairman, President and CEO Ray Conner to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, according to statement issued by the PM's Office on Wednesday. According to reports, driven by the recent race in Pakistan's aviation market particularly after the launch of the Premier Service on Independence Day, the Boeing has shown keen interest in transforming the PIA's operations in order to help restore its profits. The Boeing has had a long relationship with PIA, dating back to the 1960s that continues today with the Boeing 777. The Boeing Company president expressed the views that they see a viable opportunity to convert the PIA's existing 777-300 ERs into the new 787 Dreamliner, which will help PIA expanding its Premium Service into Europe and the heart of Asia The Boeing president urged the prime minister to work with the company to complete the substitution process, enabling PIA to operate the most technologically advanced aircraft in the world. The Boeing is vested in the success of the PIA and assures its fullest support in this regard, Ray Conner reiterated. The prime minister has directed the quarters concerned to consider the proposal within the legal framework in vogue. He said the steps taken by the government for uplifting the national flag carrier have started yielding benefits as well as immense opportunities for reviving the glory of PIA that used to be one of the best airlines in the world. The offer from the leading companies like the Boeing, that has a historical track record, is a testimony to our endeavors in making PIA one of the best airlines in the world, the prime minister said.  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus E-Paper Aaj Kal Sunday Magazine sunday magazine aaj kal Business Plus TGIF Zaiqa TV Company Financials Contact us Privacy Policy TERMS AND CONDITIONS © 2016 Dailytimes - ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Powered By opustech.co

Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Less than five years after Japan’s All Nippon Airways (ANA) took delivery of the first 787 Dreamliner, the airline on Wednesday accepted its 50th. While Boeing last week cited “softness” in the widebody-jet market and lowered expectations about near-term demand for the 787, ANA’s milestone allowed the jet maker to celebrate the success of the Dreamliner in passenger service. Hideki Kunugi, senior vice president of ANA Americas, said the airplane’s fuel efficiency — 20 percent better than the 767 it replaced — is today saving the airline about $98 million per year. “The 787 plays a vital role” in the airline’s plans to expand its international network, he said.

The economics of the midsize, long-range jet have allowed ANA to open up long-haul routes not only to giant hubs like New York and Los Angeles but also to mid-size cities. Hence its nonstop flights from Tokyo to Düsseldorf, Germany, and Brussels, as well as Seattle and San Jose, Calif. “Without the Dreamliner, Seattle and San Jose would not be possible,” Kunugi said. To get to this point, ANA suffered through a turbulent early ride. After working closely with Boeing on the design of the airplane, then giving the jet maker its launch order in 2004, ANA got its first delivery in September 2011 — three years and four months late. Just over a year after the jet entered service, a main battery started smoking aboard one of ANA’s planes in flight, and the airline endured with all other 787 operators the grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet for more than three months. But the battery problem was fixed, and Boeing has now delivered 447 Dreamliners to 39 airlines. As of July, more than 108 million passengers have flown on more than 569,000 Dreamliner flights. Opening new routes ANA now flies the 787 on 40 percent of its international routes, and it plans to open more routes to previously unserved destinations. In September, it will introduce the 787 between Tokyo and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Next February, it will fly the jet nonstop between Tokyo an Mexico City, which on the northbound leg takes more than 14 hours. Kunugi said the opening up of Mexico City “is only possible thanks to the 787, which can operate such long-haul routes with greater comfort and efficiency than any other aircraft.” The airline sees this route as “a first very important step” to expanding connections to Central and South America. Last week, Boeing Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith — citing the marked lack of orders in the widebody-jet market recently — for the first time publicly admitted that Boeing may not increase the 787 production rate from its current 12 jets per month to the planned 14 per month toward the end of the decade. At the delivery ceremony Wednesday, Boeing’s senior vice president of sales for northeast Asia, Ihssane Mounir, said that despite the general softness in demand, China remains a bright spot that offers hope of buoyant future sales. “China will continue to drive the demand,” he said. “I’m not seeing any signs of weakness whatsoever.” ANA has 33 more Dreamliners on order, including three of the largest model, the 787-10, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018. It anticipates 40 percent growth in revenue from its international routes during the next four years, in an expansion leading up to and preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. The plane delivered to ANA on Wednesday is the 787-9 that Boeing test pilots flew last month in the daily aerial displays at the Farnborough Air Show in England.

But their crew capsules cannot dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle set-up and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles,” announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. (Mikhail Metzel/AP) SpaceX is aiming for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides – at a hefty price for US taxpayers. Nasa started using private US companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. (Dmitri Lovetsky/AP) Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. This commercial hand-off is freeing up Nasa to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually Nasa’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. Nasa ultimately wants two of these ports at the lab. Another one – cobbled together from spare parts – should fly up in about a year. (Nasa) Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position – the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19 2011 to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a range of hooks and cables. Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250 mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians.   0 Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 19 August 2016, 19:40 BST Advertisement Latest news videos Advertisement Most Popular Most read Most shared 1 What causes dark circles under your eyes? 2 Autumn Statement: What will be announced? 3 How to fix your Windows 10 Start menu 4 Mortgage mistake thousands are making 5 Strictly star speaks out after street attack Advertisement   Please note: Comments must be on topic and relevant to the article or subject.

The spacewalk took place to install the new docking mechanism, the first of two International Docking Adapters (IDA) onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2. The mission was of 6 hours. These ports will work as parking places for the private space crafts that are expected on ISS soon. The two astronauts are Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins. This was the fourth walk for Jeff outside the station, of his career, whereas flight engineer Rubins walked for the first time after practicing. The port is delicate as it has the automatic parking system instead of grapple and berthing which is carried out by astronauts. It has all the necessary power and data connections The adapter is developed by Boeing which is circular in shape, with the height of 42 inches and width of 63 inches. It will work along with Boeing’s CST 100 Starliner and SpaceX’s crew dragon. The equipment is installed on SpaceX Dragon Cargo spacecraft which arrived on 20th July 2016 on the station. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a “very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability.” The only work of the astronauts after they set foot off the station is to tether the adaptor. Most of the work would have been completed by “Dextre” Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), which is Canadarm2 robotic arm by pushing the adaptor closer to the installation point. SPDM is a very sophisticated device, it can’t be used on Earth as it can’t support its own weight. However, in space due to lack of external forces and gravity it works, but has to be handled carefully. The second addition of the docking adaptor will be worked upon by 2018.

By Marcia DunnThe Associated Press CAPE CANAVERAL — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again."

Privacy Policy Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013.

Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed.

Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again." For more space exploration news 'like' the Sentinel on Space on Facebook.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins on Friday floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $US70 million ($A91 million) per person. During Friday's spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle's docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $US100 billion ($A130 billion) research laboratory that flies about 400 km above Earth. "It's a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port's installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams' spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on September 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station's exterior frame. © RAW 2016 Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

The company has successfully delivered supplies to the International Space Station, landed several first stage boosters and is currently fighting Boeing to win NASA‘s astronaut contract. But we’re just a few months away from another significant milestone in the company’s lifespan, as it readies a beast of a rocket, dubbed the Falcon Heavy. The most powerful rocket in operation The rocket is set to carry a bigger payload to orbit than the Space Shuttle. That’s 54.4 tonnes as opposed to the Shuttle’s 24 tonnes. Only the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets were capable of lofting heavier cargo, with a maximum payload of 140 tonnes. Then again, the Saturn V is no longer used, leaving the Falcon Heavy on top. Related: 12 important space missions, events to look forward to in 2017 Still not convinced? SpaceX’s website has a better way of conveying the new rocket’s power… “Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner–complete with passengers, luggage and fuel — to orbit.” SpaceX took the Kerbal route The Falcon Heavy is essentially a Falcon 9 with two extra Falcon 9 rocket boosters attached to it – an approach akin to Kerbal Space Program, really. Even the second stage of the rocket is mostly identical to the standard Falcon 9 second stage. The result is that SpaceX is able to drive down costs by using this existing technology. In fact, the company claims to out-lift the current US heavy-lift king (the Delta IV Heavy) for “one-third the cost”. Landing three boosters at once? SpaceX envisions the new rocket to be very reusable – at least as reusable as the Falcon 9. SpaceX: ‘Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner–complete with passengers, luggage and fuel — to orbit’ We all saw those impressive first stage rocket landings, but SpaceX will try to land all three Falcon Heavy boosters in the same fashion. At least if the aforementioned SpaceX video is to be believed… Will this be done on the first test flight though? SpaceX has applied for two more landing pads to be constructed at the Kennedy Space Centre.. First flight in December 2016 The Falcon Heavy is set to undergo its first proper test flight in December, but details beyond this aren’t clear just yet. SpaceX seems to be against carrying client payloads, but a report from Space Flight Now suggests that the company might reconsider its plans. It will be capable of missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond The new rocket has also been designed for missions beyond Low Earth Orbit and the International Space Station. “Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars,” the company explained on its website. It will also be capable of carrying cargo to other worlds — SpaceX claims the ability to carry 13.6 tonnes to Mars and 2.9 tonnes to Pluto.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon CANBERRA, Australia — Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. Related Pilot of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 plotted a simulated route to the middle of the Indian Ocean MH370: Debris discovered off south Australian coast means missing plane’s wreckage could span 10,000 km Severe Asia-Pacific pilot shortage poses significant opportunity for trainers “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres and 6,100 metres a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometre high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometres and 1,900 kilometres from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person. During Friday's spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle's docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. "It's a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port's installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams' spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on Sept. 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station's exterior frame.

The space agency is seeking a commercial owner to take over the space station sometime in the mid-2020s as it continues to plan for a manned Mars mission, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator Bill Hill told Digital Trends. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit. Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PG6JmKUpTsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The space station is already living on borrowed time. It was scheduled to be deorbited this year, but the Obama administration extended federal funding for the ISS through to 2024 so it could help conduct research for a manned Mars mission. So far, NASA hasn’t announced a buyer for the most expensive real estate in history, but the obvious choices would be SpaceX or Boeing, both of which are scheduled to start sending astronauts into orbit starting next year. Their presence at the ISS is why NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are going space walking this week to finish installing a new docking adapter. Since NASA decommissioned the space shuttle program in 2011, the agency has been paying Russia millions to take its astronauts into orbit. SpaceX has been running resupply missions to the ISS since 2012, and starting next year, the space travel company will join Boeing in breaking Russia’s monopoly on space taxis. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhGydridbEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The influx of commercial operators in space is what allows NASA to back away from the ISS as it continues to plan for a manned mission to Mars. SpaceX has already completed nine resupply mission to the ISS, but CEO Elon Musk seems more intent on colonizing Mars than building more space stations. Boeing, on the other hand, has made no plans to reach Mars so they could be a strong possibility as a buyer. There’s also a chance the space station could be acquired by Deep Space Industries, an asteroid mining company that plans to launch their first spacecraft by 2020. The company plans on using water found on asteroids in the form of ice as fuel. It hopes to sell the fuel to other space travel companies operating in orbit, but to do so, it will first need a location to set up its gas station. Other contenders for the most coveted real estate available to mankind are Orbital ATK and Sierra Nevada, both of which have booked space taxi contracts with NASA to ferry supplies to the space station for the next eight years. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UGjZahSG-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The two space travel companies have also won contracts to design and build deep space habitats for NASA astronauts on long haul missions. The commercial space taxi contracts open space that was previously used for cargo, so NASA plans to add a seventh astronaut to the crew of the International Space Station to increase research opportunities in low-earth orbit. Meanwhile, Russia’s Roscosmos space agency is backing away from its role in the space station; the agency just announced it’s considering reducing its crew from three to two, according to RT. “If you look at the original plan, it envisioned the launch of Multipurpose Laboratory Module to the ISS, and only then a crew increase. But MLM launch was postponed several times, while the crew nevertheless was increased.” Russia also has some stake in the real estate on the ISS, and it’s not clear what that would mean for a space station sale. What do you think of NASA’s plan to sell off the International Space Station to a commercial investor?

Article Continued Below SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial hand-off is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 ½-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” Read more about: Spacex The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over the bureau’s leadership last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the US$160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area, which includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales, made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters and 6,100 meters a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 meters a minute would be typical of a controlled descent.

SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again."

Americans Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments SpaceX delivered the new gateway last month, packed in a Dragon cargo capsule. Americans have not rocketed into orbit from their home turf since Nasa's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in another year or two. But their crew capsules cannot dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle set-up and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles," announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. SpaceX is aiming for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides - at a hefty price for US taxpayers. Nasa started using private US companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. This commercial hand-off is freeing up Nasa to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually Nasa's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. Nasa ultimately wants two of these ports at the lab. Another one - cobbled together from spare parts - should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position - the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19 2011 to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Mr Williams and Ms Rubins took over, connecting a range of hooks and cables. Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250 mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Mr Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a few weeks. Mr Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Ms Rubins on September 1 to retract a radiator. Mr Williams, a veteran spacewalker, was the first one through the hatch on Friday morning. "Come on out," he urged Ms Rubins. "The view is phenomenal," Ms Rubins said before getting straight to work. Ms Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launchpad at Kennedy Space Centre and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American south west, possibly New Mexico. These test flights - intended to go all the way to the space station and dock - will last about two weeks. Nasa will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots.

Australians leading the hunt say it will stop unless they get more funding A two-year search for MH370 is approaching its conclusion Experts will track replica flaperons by satellite to determine drift rates $160 million hunt will be suspended once current search exhausted Critics say captain glided further away from the current search area By Max Margan For Daily Mail Australia and Ap Published: 10:05 EST, 19 August 2016 | Updated: 10:09 EST, 19 August 2016 e-mail 1 View comments Australian experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner MH370 will need more funding if they are to continue the search. Officials are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 - a wing flap - most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives. The next phase of the deep-sea sonar search is being planned in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers turns up nothing. But a new search would require a new funding commitment. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted. Divers have been searching over 120,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean off Western Australia, but the search is expected to end without more funding French gendarmes and police stand near a large piece of plane debris which was found on the beach in Saint-Andre, on the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion in July last year 'If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,' Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood said. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. WASHED UP DEBRIS: THE SEARCH FOR MISSING MH370  The first piece of debris believed to have come from MH370 was discovered last July on a beach on Reuinion island in the Indian Ocean. Experts believed that the debris was one of the plane's flaperon and that other debris that washed up on the shore was suitcase items from China and Indonesia. Later that year in December a grey piece of debris was found in southern Mozambique thought to belong to the aircraft. Two months later an object with the words 'no step' then washed up off the coast of the African country. Then in March this year, an engine part was found in South Africa while in Apirl the segment of a flap track fairing and part of a horizontal stabiliser were found off Mozambique. Officials say it was almost certainly from MH370. Meanwhile on Monday, investigators in Australia on said they were examining a wing flap found last month on an East African island The 'large piece of aircraft debris' arrived at the Australian Transport Safety Bureau headquarters in the capital, Canberra, for examination. Replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's oceanography department in Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available.  If more money becomes available the Australian bureau plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from.  The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers. 'Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,' Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours.  Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood in is Canberra office  Police officers inspect metallic debris found on a beach in Saint-Denis on the French Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean in August last year The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.  What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel.  Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters after both engines lost power.

Share this article Share But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible.  Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau's analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters after both engines lost power French police officers carry a piece of debris, the first trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island Less than 10,000 square kilometers of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometer high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone.  These are between 2,700 kilometers and 1,900 kilometers from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. 'We are still hopeful and optimistic,' said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. 'We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,' Foley said.  Photo taken on Jul.29, 2015, shows a piece of debris on Reunion Island Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area (stock image) Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters and 6,100 meters a minute before it crashed.  A rate of 600 meters a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. 'The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it's found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,' Foley said. 'If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking,' he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter swells could take them until December to finish scanning.

 US astronauts begin spacewalk to install new docking port Kerry Sheridan, AFP Aug. 19, 2016, 9:31 AM 28 facebook linkedin twitter email print US astronaut Kate Rubins works on the docking port of the International Space Station on August 19, 2016 © NASA TV/AFP Lizabeth Menzies Miami (AFP) - With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. The spacewalk began at 8:04 (1204 GMT) when Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power.  Shortly afterward, they made their way outside the orbiting laboratory to begin the work of attaching an international docking adaptor, launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the gear as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be installed in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called Friday's installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. - Rubins's first spacewalk - Williams is making his fourth career spacewalk. He has accumulated 19 hours of spacewalk time in his life. The spacewalk is Rubins's first. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. Late Wednesday, the space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, placing it next to the station's Harmony module for installation. The last US spacewalk was on January 15, when a problem with American Tim Kopra's spacesuit allowed a small amount of water to build up inside his helmet by the end of the outing. It was the latest in a series of spacesuit issues, but was not as severe as an emergency in 2013 when Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet flooded, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, Todd said. NASA commentator Rob Navias said the US space agency has done a thorough review of the spacesuits being worn by Rubins and Williams, and they are in "excellent shape" for Friday's spacewalk. NASA is planning another spacewalk on September 1 to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time," he added.

Experts use drift modeling to define new MH370 search zone World by Rod McGuirk, The Associated Press Posted Aug 19, 2016 6:48 am MST Last Updated Aug 19, 2016 at 8:00 am MST Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood in his office on Thursday, Aug.18, 2016, in Canberra, Australia. He says experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 ‚Äî a wing flap ‚Äî most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives. (AP Photo/Rod McGuirk) CANBERRA, Australia – Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres (340 miles). “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres (12,000 feet) and 6,100 metres (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometres (4,000 square miles) of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometre (23,000-square-mile) high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometres (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

Americans Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments SpaceX delivered the new gateway last month, packed in a Dragon cargo capsule. Americans have not rocketed into orbit from their home turf since Nasa's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in another year or two. But their crew capsules cannot dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle set-up and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles," announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. SpaceX is aiming for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides - at a hefty price for US taxpayers. Nasa started using private US companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. This commercial hand-off is freeing up Nasa to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually Nasa's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. Nasa ultimately wants two of these ports at the lab. Another one - cobbled together from spare parts - should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position - the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19 2011 to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Mr Williams and Ms Rubins took over, connecting a range of hooks and cables. Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250 mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Mr Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a few weeks. Mr Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Ms Rubins on September 1 to retract a radiator. Mr Williams, a veteran spacewalker, was the first one through the hatch on Friday morning. "Come on out," he urged Ms Rubins. "The view is phenomenal," Ms Rubins said before getting straight to work. Ms Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launchpad at Kennedy Space Centre and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American south west, possibly New Mexico. These test flights - intended to go all the way to the space station and dock - will last about two weeks. Nasa will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots.

The docking port will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. (NASA via AP) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised the crew. Advertisement Continue reading Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance.

This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year.

An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean.

One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Technology Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

US astronauts prepare spacewalk to install new docking port Technology Friday 19 August 2016 - 11:33am File: NASA describes the equipment as 'a metaphorical gateway to a future' that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft to park automatically. Photo: REUTERS / NASA / Handout MIAMI - With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts are  to embark on a spacewalk on Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. The docking adapter was robotically moved from @SpaceX Dragon last night to get ready for tomorrow's #spacewalk.https://t.co/e7fFUlyeDi — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 18, 2016 NASA describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle programme ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. Set your alarm! 2 astronauts will perform a #spacewalk tomorrow. Watch starting at 6:30am ET https://t.co/AbGYg6kenq pic.twitter.com/SC7oTKTZeP — NASA (@NASA) August 19, 2016 The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability". Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures about a metre high and about 1.6 metres wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05 am (1205 GMT) with veteran NASA astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will hardly be brand new for her. She has already practised the necessary manoeuvres, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it centimetres from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers -- also known as extravehicular (EV) crew -- are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM. "In space, it has a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." NASA is planning a second spacewalk on 1 September for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. Watch to see how we’re working to send astronauts to deep space destinations: https://t.co/Um9MW4Dpd0 #NASAMarsDay https://t.co/tZBnz5QfIk — NASA (@NASA) August 18, 2016 The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. NASA has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment -- and it is not the same as what we do on the ground." AFP Comment Now!

Elroy Hilbert 1924 - 2016 Obituary Condolences Gallery Elroy Edward Hilbert Born: November 16, 1924; in Chicago, IL Died: Aug 3, 2016; in Union, IL Elroy Edward "Buck" Hilbert, 91, of Union, IL died on Wednesday, Aug 3, 2016 at his home. Buck was born November 16, 1924 in Chicago, IL, the oldest of three children, to Elroy Lawrence and Florence (Nuber) Hilbert. His parents and his two siblings (Dianne Buckles and Frank Hilbert) preceded him in death. Buck was bitten by the aviation "bug" early in life. At age 12 he became a line boy at Elmhurst Airport and made his first solo flight in 1941 at the Wood Dale Airport. Immediately upon graduation from Lane Tech High School, Buck joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and trained as an aircraft maintenance specialist. He graduated as a flight officer in 1944 and was sent to B-17 training. He was discharged in 1946, but was recalled to active duty in 1950, and flew as an Army Aviator Liaison Pilot in the Korean War. Various jobs followed including crop spraying, flight instruction, Wisconsin Bell, Wisconsin Power & Light, and rural mail carrier. He was able to relate to most people, always making friends from any background or position. Buck was hired to fly for United Airlines in 1952, where he worked for the next 32 years. Buck often remarked that he had, "the greatest job in the world." He had a front seat in the evolution of commercial aviation flying DC-3s, Convairs, Viscounts, DC-6s, DC-7s, Boeing 707s, Boeing 727s, and finishing his career flying DC-8s. In 1951, Buck married Elizabeth "Betty" A. Briegel. She died in 1960. He married again in 1961 to Dorothy E. (Bortkvitch) Steffenhagen. In 1971 they moved to Union, IL, and turned an old hog farm into an aviator haven known as "Hilbert's Funny Farm". Although he earned his living as a commercial pilot, his love for history and the preservation of early flying machines led him to seek out, restore, and fly numerous antique and classic aircraft. In 1976, he participated in the restoration of a Swallow biplane and subsequent public relations tour in celebration of United Airlines 50th anniversary, flying the original airmail route of the plane all over the U.S. As a promoter of general aviation, Buck was a member of numerous associations, chapters and clubs. He was a founding member of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) and the first president of EAA's Antique & Classic Division. He and Dorothy volunteered annually for the EAA Convention (AirVenture) in Oshkosh, WI and for the Sun 'n Fun Fly-In, Lakeland, FL. He was recognized for his many contributions to the aviation world throughout his life, and holds a place in both the Illinois Aviation and EAA Hall of Fame. He was also honored as an Elder Statesman for the National Aeronautical Association. Buck was a Certified Flight Instructor and an Airframe & Powerplant mechanic. He authored many articles for EAA publications, including a monthly column called "Pass it to Buck" for Vintage magazine, and was frequently asked to speak at flying clubs' events and other aviation organizations. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. In addition to his love for aviation, Buck was a regular contributor to the McHenry County Historical Society, The Illinois Railway Museum, and other organizations that work to preserve and share local history. Dorothy Hilbert died in Union, IL, in December of 2006. Buck is survived by his six children, Bob (Diane), Christine, Alice (Tom) Taylor, Elroy E. (Laurie), Lee (Corinn), and Leslie; eight grandchildren, Heidi, Robert, Matthew, Sierra, Tim, Luke, Whitman, and Benjamin; two great grandchildren, Kyle and Nicholas; numerous cousins, nieces, nephews, one cat; as well as countless friends and honorary children. Donations/Memorials may be made to Northern Illinois Hospice or the EAA Young Eagles Program. A Memorial is planned for October 1, 2016, at The Wings and Wheels Museum in Poplar Grove, IL.

Justin Bachman justinbachman August 19, 2016 — 6:00 AM EDT Updated on August 19, 2016 — 3:35 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Illustration: Stephanie Davidson Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp After 15 years as a pure research lab, the International Space Station might be ready for business. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an e-mail. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an e-mail. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a testbed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” NASA Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020.  During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body—from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure—as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science ... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and nonprofit organizations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

The Defense Department said Thursday Boeing will perform the testing part of the contract on tasks meant to help the military branch evaluate the outcomes of flying the FTA7 (F-15C) and the FTE10 (F-15E) aircraft beyond their original service life. Boeing will also conduct repairs on test articles in the process of testing or after the post-cycling inspection as well as limited teardown and failure analysis on selected parts that sustain cracking during tests. The contract contains a one-year base period of performance and four one-year ordering periods and work will occur in St. Louis, Missouri, through Aug. 31, 2021. The Air Force released the solicitation for the contract in July last year and obligated $11.1 million at the time of award from its fiscal 2016 operations and maintenance funds.

Photo: Bullit Marquez / AP) CANBERRA, Australia — Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Get Khaosod English by email. Binge-read when you want. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers (340 miles). “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters (12,000 feet) and 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 meters (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometer (23,000-square-mile) high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.   Story: Rod McGuirk TAGS MH370 SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleOil Rig Worker Freed But Still Faces Charges Next articleActivist on Hunger Strike Denied Release by Military Associated Press RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR International New MH370 Analysis Suggests No One at Controls During Crash International Underwater Drone to Investigate Sonar Contacts in MH370 Hunt International Debris Found on Mauritius Confirmed to be From MH370 International MH370 Wreckage Hunter Determined to Solve Mystery International Relatives of MH370 Victims Want More Possible Debris Studied ASEAN Malaysia Confirms MH370 Course Was on Pilot’s Simulator Follow us 79,547FansLike 1,228FollowersFollow 14,480FollowersFollow 114SubscribersSubscribe Latest news ‘Back Door’ in CCA Not Trojan Horse for Single Gateway, Drafters...

Jeff Williams takes on his fourth walk while Kate Rubins embarks on her first. (Credit: ABC licensed)  With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk to install a special parking spot for them. Key points: Two astronauts will install an adaptor for commercial spacecraft Adaptor will allow automatic parking and sharing of power and data Spacewalk will be first time astronauts have taken equipment from a robot arm on ISS Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins stepped outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA has described the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft — the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 — to carry astronauts to the space station. "Commercial crew flights from Florida's Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America's human spaceflight launch capability and increase the time US crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars," NASA said in a statement. Photo: The International Docking Adaptor, also known as IDA-2, undergoing testing in NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. (NASA) The docking adaptor is the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. Photo: The space walk is expected to take more than six hours. (NASA: AFP Photo) A delicate operation over more than six hours The space agency is streaming live coverage on August 19 from 8:30pm (AEST). This is the fourth career spacewalk for veteran NASA astronaut Williams, who is about to mark 500 days in space over four missions, and the 194th for the space station. It is also the first spacewalk for Flight Engineer Rubins, who has practiced the necessary manoeuvres, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. The two astronauts have ventured outside the space station's Quest airlock in what is expected to be a six-and-a-half-hour task. A series of spacewalks last year helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers — also known as extravehicular (EV) crew — are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM. In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." NASA says that a problem that allowed water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved by the discovery of an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's healing and cooling loops.

Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modelling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 340 miles (550km). "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot," Mr Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group which defined the current search area - that includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales - made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no-one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 40,000ft (12,200m) after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the aircraft beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimise debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Mr Foley said his bureau's analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 12,000ft (3,700m) and 20,000ft (6,100m) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 2,000ft (600m) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap - if it's found that it is not deployed - will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide," Mr Foley said. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking," he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 65ft (20m) waves could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 4,000 square miles (10,000 sq km) of seabed, which is outside the original 23,000 square mile (60,000 sq km) high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 1,700 miles (2,700km) and 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. "We are still hopeful and optimistic," said Mr Hood. Mr Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened on board Flight 370. "We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it," he said.

Even for frequent flyers, the phenomenon of how a plane weighing around 300 metric tonnes can leave the ground and fly from one side of the world to another can seem miraculous. In contrast, however, to leading aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus, airlines are often no more technologically advanced than your average retailer or bank. So, how can airlines provide a digital experience that is more worthy of the wonderment that flying still gives to people? Evolving flight experience As India aims to become the third-largest aviation market by 2020 and #1 by 2030, technology is permeating the experience of air travel from start to finish. The days of walking into a high street travel agent to research, price up and book a holiday are long gone. Websites such as Expedia and Lastminute.com enable holidaymakers to plan, book and pay for holidays on the move via mobile apps – whether it’s a two week beach getaway or an impulsive weekend city break. As well as designing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces, these companies use insights gained from big data analytics to provide a personalised experience based on a user’s interests, behaviours and buying patterns. For example, Expedia has enough data to fill 6.7 billion books (based on an average of 200 pages). The availability of internet connectivity at airports and on aircraft is also increasing to match the evolving needs of business travellers. While stepping onto a plane used to mean you’d spend a few hours offline, the skies are unlikely to remain a worldwide blackspot for long. Wi-Fi is available as a free service on a limited or unlimited basis at almost all of Europe’s biggest airports. While in-flight Wi-Fi is yet to take-off due to issues with reliability, connected in-flight experiences are approaching fast on the horizon. Premium airlines such as Emirates and Virgin Atlantic traditionally excel at in-flight entertainment, with an extensive range of movies, TV and audio shows and games. However, smartphones, tablets and pro-audio headphones allow travellers to plan their own in-flight entertainment schedule. Soon, the expectation will be to HD stream hours of uninterrupted Netflix from 30,000ft or use virtual reality simulations to explore your destination before you’ve even touched down. The connected airport One part of the digital experience that is still not without its margin for error is the process in between walking into an airport and boarding your flight. Travellers are often subject to long queues to check-in to flights, or even to simply drop off their luggage. Furthermore, if delays occur customers sometimes need to work hard to find information on estimated departure times, which can lead to frustrated passengers. Given the technologies that bring passengers to the airport, the onus is on airlines to ensure that they are providing a personalised and seamless travel experience. Airlines are investing heavily in digital transformation projects, overhauling their IT systems and providing a user-centric connected experience from booking to landing. The majority of leading operators are now able to provide mobile boarding passes using digital QR codes and scanners, with many also investing in intuitive apps that allow passengers to manage their bookings and update their travel details and itineraries on the move. Air France-KLM is an example of an airline group using mobile to improve the airport experience. It is the first airline to integrate Facebook into its check-in process, giving customers the option of receiving their flight documentation via Messenger. By equipping passengers with mobile boarding passes as well as installing self-service machines for check-in and to print baggage labels, the queuing time before passengers drop-off their bags and have their passports checked is reduced. To provide a paperless, queue-free and stress-free airport experience that customers will remember and build loyalty with, airlines must consider two key questions. Firstly, are our internal systems and connectivity infrastructure up to the challenge or will they fall over at times of peak demand? In an industry that is highly seasonal and experiences extreme peaks and troughs, airlines must be prepared to scale their infrastructure up and down quickly to provide a consistent experience at all times. This is one of the main reasons why airlines and airports are adopting flexible and scalable cloud computing platforms. Secondly, can we provide a consistent experience across all of the territories we cover? For example, if I have a great airport experience at London Heathrow when flying to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, I want that experience to be replicated when I arrive and on my return journey. The emerging markets are increasing exponentially in their importance to the air travel industry. Eight out of ten of the fastest growing airline markets are located in Africa; 1.3 billion passengers will travel through China in 2034; and India is set to see an additional 260 million passengers. Therefore, delivering an experience that is truly global is tantamount to customer satisfaction and retention. Those players ahead of the game have already begun investing in digital transformation and overhauling their IT infrastructure. Returning to the example of Air France-KLM – in order to support a seamless, personalised travel experience, it has partnered with Tata Communications to add next-generation connectivity to 170 sites in its growth markets. The new superfast network will power the airline’s mission-critical systems across the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Travellers’ tech According to Crisil Ltd., India is one of the five fastest-growing aviation markets globally with 275 million new passengers in 2015.  The airlines operating in India have been projected to report a collective operating profit of Rs. 8,100 crore (US$ 1.29 billion) in FY 2016. Competition within the aviation industry for the preference of holidaymakers and business travellers alike is also growing. While factors such as fare price and flight convenience are fundamental decisions when booking flights, IATA statistics show that 9% of people cited ‘previous good experience’ as their main reason for choosing a particular airline. Validating good user experience as an imperative while booking air travel, SITA and Air Transport World conducted a global passenger survey, reiterating the fact that airline passengers across the globe are more comfortable with technology than humans when looking for a better user experience. The survey also revealed that even if the passengers are not satisfied with one type of self-service technology, they tend to try another rather than revert to human contact. Therefore, as customer expectations are driven by intuitive, personalised technologies for travellers such as price-comparison apps, smart devices and ubiquitous connectivity, the digital travel experience is set to become a means for airlines to differentiate themselves from the competition. While building a strategy that places user experience at the heart of every stage of a customer’s journey through innovative mobile, video and social apps – and even virtual reality technologies –  airlines must invest in a connectivity infrastructure that will power all these innovations, and enable them to provide a seamless, brilliant passenger experience the world over.

Timothy McAlevey looks out of a window while searching for debris from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, over the Indian Ocean off the coast of western Australia. (AP / Greg Wood, Pool, File) The Associated Press Published Thursday, August 18, 2016 11:03PM EDT Last Updated Thursday, August 18, 2016 11:41PM EDT CANBERRA, Australia -- Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 -- a wing flap -- most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood said. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current vast expanse southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location. "If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity," Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year --15 months after the plane went missing -- will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether wind or currents determine how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year -- the third anniversary of the disaster -- and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres (340 miles). "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot," Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area -- which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales -- made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit to ocean after flying more than five hours.

Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres (12,000 feet) and 6,100 metres (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap -- if it's found that it is not deployed -- will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide," Foley said. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking, "he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take until December.

These are between 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometres (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ship are based. "We are still hopeful and optimistic," said Hood, who took over leadership of the Australian bureau in July. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. "We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it," Foley said.

For the Commercial Crew Program, SpaceX is already building a Dragon cargo capsule, also known as the Crew Dragon. Boeing on the other hand is building a new crew capsule by the name of CST-100 Starliner. The spacecraft will carry astronauts to the ISS by 2017, and once there will dock at the IDA. "We started building this 18 months ago, and now it's one of the most visible changes to the Cape's horizon since the 1960s," stated Chris Ferguson, former shuttle commander and Boeing's deputy program manager for the company's Commercial Crew Program. The IDA installation was originally scheduled last summer. Yet, the adapter said to be used was destroyed when Falcon 9's rocket disintegrated during the launch. As for the current installation scheduled this Friday, it is a major milestone for NASA. The agency is confident that the flight will push through by 2018. "The first crew flight is scheduled for February 2018. I am confident," explained Ferguson, adding, "And we have a lot of qualification to get through between now and then. But barring any large unforeseen issues we can make it." Advertisement As for the Commercial Crew Program, the space agency plans to reduce costs in sending astronauts to and from space. In addition, NASA hopes to increase the number of astronauts on the ISS. According to NASA officials, an additional member on the roster would greatly enhance the research conducted at the station.

PHOto courtesy ofJohn Meiman Ramsey resident Joseph Meiman,90, waves before takeoff in a Stearman Trainer. Resident Joseph Meiman, 90, agreed to find out. On Aug. 3 he took off in an open-cockpit two-seater Stearman (Boeing) Primary Trainer like the one he flew during 1945 exercises at Bunker Hill Naval Station in Peru, Ind. "They used the cheapest open cockpit planes for training," Meiman said. "There were no radios. If you wanted to talk to the other person, you used hand signals or spoke down a speaking tube." A tube? "It worked." Minimal instruments Meiman enlisted in the Navy in January 1944 as an apprentice seaman from his hometown of New Orleans, and received the munificent sum of $75 a month. "The regular pay was $50, we got $75 for hazardous duty," he explained. Meiman spent a semester in flight training classes at Tulane University before more advanced training in Maryland and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "We studied aerology, navigation, how to identify planes and ships," Meiman said. He then began flight training at Bunker Hill. "I think Ted Williams and Otto Graham [Cleveland Browns quarterback] also went through that school," Meiman said. "They were looking for men with good eye-hand coordination and there were a lot of athletes. I also think the first President Bush went through training a year and half ahead of me." There were no guns or bombs in the beginner training planes. Meiman said there were "minimum instruments" as they learned how to control the plane, evasive maneuvers, formation flying, flying after dark, and loops or barrel rolls. "There were two kinds of rolls, a slow roll and a snap roll," Meiman said. "If you were doing a list of maneuvers, the dirt on the floor would fly in your face when you went upside down." His six months of flight training came to a premature end with the surrender of the Japanese in August 1945. He never flew in combat, and his flying dream was over. "I went to the local airport where my parents lived in Chicago, but the lessons were $5 an hour and I was earning 40 cents an hour," Meiman said. Instead, he made his career in bookbinding. Mixed emotions The flight was arranged by son John Meiman, who described himself as "child number three" of Joseph’s seven children who moved with their parents to Ramsey in 1962. "I was the one who made the arrangements," said John, now of Ortley Beach. "My dad has always loved planes and flying. As a kid, his heroes were Charles Lindbergh and Wiley Post, and he’d tell us about them when we took turns as kids sitting in the front seat of the car with him when he was driving. It was a tragedy for someone who loved flying that much to go into the service and then never get to fly." John said he had been searching for a Stearman for his father to fly since seeing the biplanes in western Illinois air shows, and finally "stumbled across" one at the Andover Flight Academy. "I called the owner, and he agreed to take my dad up, but said we needed to wait until summer, he would not want to fly in an open cockpit in the winter," John said. Not every member of the Meiman family was equally enthusiastic. "Beforehand I had a few reservations," said son Tom, now of Pittsburgh. who witnessed the flight with his wife Carol Ann. "He’s a remarkable person, but 90 years old is 90 years old. He was going to be flying in an open cockpit. But he knew what to expect and was completely for it." Damian DelGaizo, president of Andover Flight Academy and a Vietnam era pilot, personally set up the flight, arranging additional steps leading onto the wing and into the cockpit to ease his entry. "We got him into the cockpit and as we were belting him in, he said the last time he was in the plane he fit in while wearing a parachute," DelGaizo recalled. "I said I hope you won’t need one today!" Nor was Meiman worried. "I trusted the pilot," Meiman said. Daughter Madeline Rapp, still living in Ramsey, was present as her father "folded that lanky body" into the front seat of the plane wearing his World War II bomber jacket, which "still fit." "The sky was a brilliant blue," Madeline said. "Everything cooperated." Son John said he was particularly touched when his father "reached up without looking" for the handles on the wings that pilots gripped to help manipulate themselves into the tight seating area. "As they were about to take off, Damian yelled to my father that as soon as they got up in the air he would turn over operation of the plane to him," John said. "My sister-in-law let out an audible gasp and the plane took off." Up and away Meiman spent a half hour in the air, reacquainting himself with the stick controls at first before doing a couple turns, the more advanced maneuvers, barrel rolls, and eventually a low-altitude pass over the airfield complete with a dramatic trail of white smoke. "The green hills below made a beautiful sight," said Meiman. "You could see for miles in the clean crisp air." Madeline witnessed his landing "with a grin and a jaunty wave." "He got out of the plane with grace, managed the step ladder, and said, ‘Well, that was something,’" Madeline recalled. Meiman brought his World War II flight log book for DelGaizo to sign. "We owe these veterans a debt we can never repay," DelGaizo said. "It was a terrific day." The family retired to a nearby restaurant for a celebratory lunch. "There is a famous poem about flying, a sonnet by John Magee Jr. in which the last line reads ‘I put out my hand and touched the face of God.’" Meiman said afterward. "That is what it is like when you are close to a cloud in an open-cockpit Stearman."

Power of Pink Provides NASA with Pressure Pictures by Jim Banke for NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate Washington DC (SPX) Aug 18, 2016 An aircraft design that could reduce fuel use, emissions and noise is set up for a test in a wind tunnel at NASA's Ames Research Center in California in which pink-colored pressure-sensitive paint is applied to the vehicle. The pink paint shines when exposed to blue light, glowing brighter or dimmer depending on air pressure in the area. For a larger version of this image please go here. They say you show your true colors when you're under pressure. Turns out the old saying works for models being tested in wind tunnels as well, specifically those coated with a unique Pressure-Sensitive Paint (PSP) that NASA engineers have used for more than 25 years. Today the bright pink paint is helping NASA's aeronautical innovators test new aircraft designs that could cut fuel use in half, pollution by some 75 percent and noise to nearly one-eighth of what it is today. "PSP is great because as long as you can apply paint to the area you want to test, illuminate it with a lamp, and view it with a camera, you can gather data you might not otherwise be able to get," said Nettie Roozeboom, an aerospace engineer with NASA's Ames Research Center in California. Engineers need to know how pressure is distributed across an airplane's surfaces as it moves through the air so they can ensure, among many other critical variables, that they understand the loads the vehicle is experiencing at given wind tunnel conditions. When testing scale models of aircraft designs in wind tunnels, pressure readings are traditionally taken using pressure taps, little plastic tubes that are strung through the model's interior up to the surface through a small hole in key places. "The challenge is you can only install so many of these taps, otherwise your whole model becomes one big pressure tap," Roozeboom said. "And in some models, there just isn't enough room inside the model to accommodate the taps." Case in point: Recent tests of a transonic truss-braced wing aircraft design, part of Boeing's Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research project, involved a model in which some of the parts were too tiny for documenting air pressure any other way than PSP. "The wing struts in particular were very thin, and it was difficult to machine taps where the wing met the fuselage, so PSP really was the ideal solution," Roozeboom said. Power of Pink Here's how PSP works: + A thin coat of the special paint, about one-and-a-half thousandths of an inch thick, is sprayed on to the model that will be tested in the wind tunnel and allowed to dry. + The model is then installed in the wind tunnel, which also is equipped with a series of blue LED lights and a complement of specially equipped black and white cameras to record the test. + With the wind tunnel active, air flows over the model resulting in varying surface pressures. The blue lights excite molecules known as luminophores within the paint causing them to fluoresce, or shine. + At the same time, due to the nature of the paint's chemistry, oxygen molecules quench the luminophores. High-pressure areas have more oxygen, so the pink shines dimmer. Lower pressure areas have less oxygen, so the pink shines brighter. + These differences in how much the paint fluoresces or shines is recorded by the cameras, and the resulting black and white images are analyzed. The intensity of the different shades of gray are converted to a color scale indicating the varying pressure levels. Researchers use PSP as one of many tools to better understand how a new aircraft design might perform. It also can be used to help make other tools, such as the computer modeling tool known as CFD, more accurate. "When you start to marry all these technologies to arrive at the best answer, I think you can walk away knowing more," Roozeboom said. Colorful History It was early in the 20th Century when the idea of correlating the luminescent properties of a coating to varying pressure levels was first developed. By 1935 a German scientist, Hans Kautsky, first deduced that the quenching of luminescence was caused by oxygen. As the concept evolved through the years, it was during the 1960s that a potential use was explored in the field of medicine, with some success realized in using the idea as part of a tool for measuring oxygen content in blood. Much of the work that led to biomedical applications of the concept was located at the University of Washington. It was there that during the 1980s a Boeing researcher turned to further develop an idea for using the concept in aviation, and then successfully demonstrated PSP in a wind tunnel. NASA joined the story not long after, still during the 1980s, when an Ames researcher, Blair McLachlan, was doing some work on fluorescent dyes and was referred to the researchers at the University of Washington. Realizing the tremendous potential value of PSP to NASA's work in both aviation and space, McLachlan began the process of bringing that tool to the agency. Interestingly, a key figure in those efforts turned out to be former astronaut Janet Kavandi, a two-time space shuttle veteran who is now director of NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. Kavandi was a PhD chemistry student at the University of Washington and, while waiting for a flight at the Seattle airport, happened to meet the researchers from her school who were working with NASA on PSP, which led to her joining the embryonic team. By early 1989, Kavandi and others had developed a desirable PSP recipe, essentially creating the first generation of the pink paint used today. They drove down to Ames from Washington with the lighting, cameras and a painted wing segment to try out in a wind tunnel. It worked. Pink Plans Today, NASA uses PSP as a research tool in the wind tunnels at Ames, Glenn Research Center in Ohio, and Langley Research Center in Virginia, and engineers continue to look for ways to make PSP even more effective for testing both aeronautical and space vehicles. Roozeboom said the next big thing for PSP is to perfect a new version of the paint in which the luminophores molecules get excited faster and are less sensitive to temperature - work sponsored by NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate. Known as Unsteady PSP, the paint would reveal changes in pressure at the microsecond level, providing a more detailed look at what is happening on the surface of an aircraft or launch vehicle being subjected to high stress during a high-speed flight or launch. But one thing that is not expected to change is the bright pink color of the specialty paint. That means one thing for Roozeboom, who at Ames is currently the "go to" person for all things PSP, including procuring the Pepto Bismol-colored paint - not available in a hobby store - painting the models and leading the test analysis: "Everything that's pink ends up in my office."

"We're not seeing any softness yet," Ihssane Mounir, Boeing's senior vice president of sales for Northeast Asia, said at a briefing marking the 50th 787 Dreamliner delivered to ANA Holdings Inc, Japan's largest airline. "We're watching it close," Mounir added, since global economic conditions could shift. "But if I just look at the Chinese market as it stands today, I'm not seeing any signs of weakness whatsoever." The comments came after other U.S. industrial companies recently reported weak sales growth in China and suggested the weakness could extend through the end of 2016. Global demand for widebody aircraft has also slowed, raising concerns about sales growth at Boeing and rival Airbus. Boeing said last week it may further cut production of widebody 777 jetliners and not increase output of 787s unless sales improve. A strong exchange rate for Japan's currency has slowed some of China's tourism to Japan, said Hideki Kunugi, ANA's senior vice president for the Americas. But he said ANA's decision to expand its capacity and its network in China is supported by demand. ANA took delivery on Wednesday of a new 787-9, the mid-sized version of Boeing's high-tech, long-haul Dreamliner aircraft. The jet seats 290 passengers in a two-class configuration and carries a list price of $264.6 million, though airlines typically negotiate discounts. ANA is experiencing robust growth in business travel from Japan to Latin America, Kunugi said, adding that it plans to launch a route from Tokyo to Mexico City in February 2017 using the 787 as part of its LatAm strategy. "Our current main target will be Tokyo and Mexico and onward," he said.

Jetstar is understood to be working on repairs to a number of General Electric-made engines in its 787 Dreamliner fleet in order to resolve the problem, which could lead to a loss of oil pressure. The engine problem could trigger a mid-flight engine shutdown, such as the one that forced one of Jetstar’s Dreamliners to divert to the Pacific island on Guam during a flight from Japan to the Gold Coast last week. The Australian understands Jetstar has made repairs to engines on 11 of its 787-8 jets since March, however the airline said that figure was “not correct” but declined to confirm a number. Earlier this year General Electric issued a service bulletin to operators of Dreamliners using the GEnx engine regarding an issue related to the engine’s transfer gearbox. The company recommended Dreamliner operators modify a “dampened radial gearshaft” to prevent “induced resonance failures that have caused approximately eight in-flight engine shutdowns and oil loss events across the world”. Jetstar operates a fleet of 11 twin-engine Boeing 787-8s.Source:News Limited Jetstar confirmed it had been issued General Electric’s service bulletin. “Jetstar has been working closely with GE on the service bulletin,” a spokesman for the airline told The Australian. “We are well progressed on our fleet and will have all aircraft engines completed months ahead of the recommended time frame from GE. “We are continuing our invest­igations into the cause of the engine issue with GE on the aircraft that diverted to Guam.” Service bulletins alert operat­ors to known issues in aircraft components, but their instructions are optional. They are not as serious as airworthiness directives that require airlines to make modifications by a set deadline. The engine issue also affects Dreamliners operated by airlines such as Air Canada, Air India, China Southern, United Airlines and Etihad Airways that fly from Australian airports. General Electric says it continually monitors and analyses the performance of the GEnx ­engine fleet. Passengers were diverted to Guam after their Jetstar flight from Japan’s Narita airport to the Gold Coast after encountered engine problems. Picture: Regi VargheseSource:News Corp Australia “Based on the engine fleet’s service history, we are not aware of operational issues that would hazard the continued safe flight of aircraft powered by these engines,” a spokeswoman told The Australian. “As a relatively new engine in commercial airline service, the GEnx by any statistical measure (dispatch reliability, engine remov­als, in-flight shutdown rates) is exhibiting outstanding reliability powering the 787.” On Sunday, Jetstar flight JQ12, heading from Tokyo’s Narita airport to Gold Coast airport made an emergency landing on Guam after encountering engine problems. In a statement to news.com.au, Jetstar said the flight made the premature landing following a warning light turning on indicating an issue with the oil pressure. The captain shut down one of the two engines “as a precaution” and diverted to the US territory located 2600km south of the Japanese mainland. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is invest­igating the incident.

Space Camp Alum Dr. Kate Rubins spent her first spacewalk installing a new front door that astronauts will use when they launch from American soil. Rubin and ISS Commander Jeff Williams spent 6-and-a-half hours installing the door, which will be used by Space X and Boeing. NASA astronauts will start using it in 2018.  Boeing Starliner will use the Atlas V, which is made in Decatur, and they are building the first rocket for that Starliner right now. So in 2018, rather than paying Russia $70 million per seat, NASA will be paying American companies to send our astronauts into space.

The docking adaptor will serve as a "parking spot" for incoming spaceships.  ( NASA | YouTube ) Advertisement With private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin now venturing into commercial spaceflight, the International Space Station (ISS) is expecting more spaceship traffic in the coming years. Before that can happen, however, the space station has to have a "parking spot" for all upcoming commercial spaceships. On Friday, Aug. 19, two NASA astronauts successfully installed a new docking port at the ISS, ending the United States' dependence on Russia for rides to the orbiting outpost. Astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins hovered outside the space station for a spacewalk that lasted five hours and 58 minutes to attach the first of two international docking adaptors. The second docking adaptor will be launched to the space station in late 2017. Williams, who is currently the Station Commander of the six-member crew, has performed a spacewalk four times in his career, while Rubins, who is the flight engineer, experienced the spacewalk for the first time. For more than two hours, the two astronauts attempted to tie down the docking adaptor, which had been built by Boeing, and successfully attached it. The adaptor is around 1 meter (42 inches) in height and 1.6 meter (63 inches) in width. After installation, the robotic machinery at the ISS completed the hard mate, successfully making it permanent. During the rest of the mission, Williams and Rubins linked data and power cables for the adaptor. These fittings will allow the space station to share data and power with visiting spacecraft. "With that, we have a new port of call," Rob Navias, NASA commentator, said as the space station floated over Singapore at 10:40 a.m. (1440 GMT). Kenneth Todd, the operations integration manager at the ISS, described the installation as a significant milestone in the aspect of establishing commercial crew capability. NASA believes the new docking port at the space station is the "gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of American spacecraft to lift astronauts to space. According to NASA, the new adaptors will work with SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, both of which are still under construction and are expected to ferry astronauts to the space station. The new adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment as it will enable automatic parking instead of the grapple and berthing process, NASA said. Rubins and Williams will perform another spacewalk on Sept. 1 to revoke a solar array cooling panel no longer in use, as well as to install a television camera on the exterior frame of the ISS.

Home Gaming Sci + Tech Gear Lifestyle Movies + TV Contact Sci + Tech Trending Astronauts are Installing a Critical New Airlock on the ISS August 19, 2016 Share Tweet Pin Reddit Stumble NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are conducting one of the most vital spacewalks for the future of the International Space Station. The pair switched their spacesuits to battery power at 8:04 am ET and began a more than six-hour spacewalk. Their mission? To install the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs). Without these adapters, manned missions from Boeing and SpaceX are a no go. Getting the first IDA to the ISS took a bit longer than expected. The first one was originally launched to the ISS back by SpaceX in June 2015. But that mission failed when the launch vehicle disintegrated about two minutes after launch. Installing the international docking adapter Williams is no stranger to working outside the ISS. Today’s spacewalk will be his fourth. For Rubins, it will be her first stroll into space. Did You Know: Today’s spacewalk is the 194th for the International Space Station. The first three happened in quick succession as astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman worked on the ISS three times in just six days in December 1998. The longest spacewalk was in March 2001 and lasted 8 hours, 56 minutes. Work for today’s spacewalk began on Wednesday when ground controllers used the robotic arm to snatch the IDA from the Dragon spacecraft and place it 2 feet away from the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA). Once the IDA is moved into contact with the PMA, Williams and Rubins will hook up tethers. After that, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi will send commands to close the hooks between the two docking ports. With the IDA secured to the ISS, the two spacewalking astronauts will connect the all-important power and data connectors. Related New Horizons Will Be Seeing Red Again on 2014 MU69 In about four hours, Williams and Rubins will wrap up their work installing the first IDA. And with it, the first important step to NASA no longer relying on Russia to get astronauts to the ISS. SUCCESS! Intl. Docking Adapter officially installed at 10:40am ET. Will welcome future @Commercial_Crew vehicles. https://t.co/t8KQbBZMJV — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 19, 2016 Launching astronauts from the U.S. The last time NASA astronauts headed to orbit from the U.S. was the final shuttle flight in 2011. Five years later, Williams and Rubins are laying the foundation for those flights to start again. NASA tapped SpaceX and Boeing to bring their astronauts to the ISS and back again. SpaceX is targeting a test flight with two astronauts in late 2017. Boeing is looking at 2018 for their first test flight. Once the tests are completed and NASA gives the go-ahead, the two companies can begin ferrying astronauts to the ISS. Look for these dates to shift around some. It wouldn’t surprise me for both tests to be in 2018 with the first official crew mission to the ISS in 2019. With SpaceX and Boeing shouldering the load for delivering astronauts to orbit, it frees up NASA for grander things. The main one being a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s. We’ve heard all about the elusive mission to Mars when we were kids. But it feels like some progress is finally being made now.

McAdams proposed a $1.1 billion budget for 2015 on Oct. 28, 2014. (Scott Sommerdorf | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams during an interview in his office, Wednesday, April 17, 2013. McAdams proposed a $1.1 billion budget for 2015 on Oct. 28, 2014. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Economic development and jobs are top priorities for us. As Salt Lake County mayor and as a state senator, we've supported many projects where businesses get tax support in exchange for creating good-paying jobs and bringing more economic growth to the state. But when taxpayer dollars are on the line, one question stands out: Is it a fair deal for taxpayers? West Jordan City's proposed data center project would be built on 230 acres of vacant West Jordan farmland. It will be highly automated and managed remotely with software installed on laptops. Initially, 50-70 jobs would result. The Economic Development Area plan put forth by West Jordan City asks for a total tax subsidy of $240 million — taxes that would come from the school district, the county, the county library, the state, and even city energy taxes for 20 years. VIDEOS TOP JOBS If you do the math, we'd be paying between $2 million and $3.4 million per job. That's far more than has ever been spent by economic development officials to lure businesses such as eBay, Adobe or Boeing. Those companies not only support thousands of jobs, but also produce a multiplier effect, as they spend money locally for goods and services. The data center's equipment is manufactured and purchased in China. Much of the building itself is pre-fabricated, trucked in and then assembled. West Jordan City has provided shifting and incomplete budget numbers. We know that the city has approved projects whose terms were rejected by other neighboring cities and has a poor track record with past Economic Development Areas. Four EDAs that the city created went bankrupt or left Utah's market; one only produced taxes for six of the projected 12 years; and one didn't trigger any growth until six years after its approval. As elected officials who must balance our budgets and advertise every proposed tax increase, we must scrutinize these deals. A bad deal means less money to fund all the services our residents currently receive, a shortage for our school children, and a worst case scenario of having to raise taxes to make up a deficit. We know that the proposed structures, which are essentially very large refrigerated buildings to keep computer servers from overheating, come with a legal contract for delivery of 4.8 million gallons of water per day. They may use less during the winter season, but the water must be available should they need it. Utah is the second driest state in the country. In our fast-growing area, water is a finite and a precious commodity and is essential to every current and future resident and business. The data center company in question is worth billions of dollars and earns a profit of more than $22 million a day. We offer one vital ingredient other states cannot match — numerous fiber optic cables buried in the ground for them to connect to the Internet. In fact, Salt Lake County has one of the greatest densities in the country for fiber optic lines. We should not sell our real estate or our taxpayers short just because a famous name comes calling. The data center needs our location far more than we need the 50-100 server manager jobs it offers. Openness and accountability for how we spend your hard-earned tax dollars is our priority. Our duty as public servants is to shine a light on any deal that involves taxes and billion dollar private corporations. After all, it's your money.

The successful spacewalk occurred a day after a key leader at NASA announced the space agency was looking to hand off control of the ISS to a private company within the next decade. The astronauts installing the new International Docking Adapter (IDA) were Jeff Williams, the commander of the most recent expedition of NASA astronauts to the ISS, and flight engineer Kate Rubins. The spacewalk was the first for Rubins and the fourth for Williams. The IDA will allow new capsules built by private space exploration companies to connect to the ISS. With the new entrance, NASA is also effectively ending Russia’s dominance of handling cargo to the ISS – all other entrances to the ISS are controlled by the United States’ historic space rival. NASA believes that by allowing more commercial access to the ISS, it is preparing the way for the first manned mission to Mars. “Commercial crew flights from Florida’s Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America’s human launch capability and increase the time U.S. crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars,” NASA spokesman Mark Garcia said in a statement. The expansion of NASA’s partnership with private companies does not end with the IDA. NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development Bill Hill announced Thursday that the space agency is planning to hand over control of the ISS to a private company by the mid-2020s. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit,” Hill said at the conference.

(Aug. 15, 2016) -- Six Technology Investment Agreements were awarded under the Architecture Implementation Process Demonstrations as part of the Future Vertical Lift efforts that continue in the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator program. The JMR TD is an Army science and technology program designed to develop, expand and demonstrate new capabilities in vertical lift technology and is a precursor to the Department of Defense FVL program. FVL will deliver the next generation of vertical lift aircraft to the joint warfighter, providing the speed, range, payload and mission systems critical to successfully engaging the enemy in future operations. The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center leads the JMR TD effort. The six TIAs were awarded to: The Boeing Company, GE Aviation Systems, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation and Rockwell Collins. The AIPD efforts are the second major demonstration effort within the Mission Systems Architecture Demonstration portion of the JMR TD. "These awards represent the next major step in identifying the elements required for successful implementation of a truly Open Systems Architecture for DoD's future vertical lift fleet," said Dan Bailey, JMR TD program director. The AIPD TIAs are 12-month efforts with each company proposing a technical path to use available design tools and standards. The TIAs are intended to further mature the Joint Common Architecture approach and its role in supporting both Open System Architecture and systematic reuse of software and integration knowledge. The previous demonstration, JCA Demo, was a proof of concept to verify the feasibility of the JCA approach. The next major demonstration, Capstone, will begin in the 2018 timeframe and include a more complete implementation of the many elements of an architecture and the partnerships required to execute that strategy. ---- The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to ensure decisive overmatch for unified land operations to empower the Army, the joint warfighter and our nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.

Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power and floated outside the orbiting laboratory to begin the work of attaching the first of two international docking adaptors. The spacewalkers finished the task in just over two hours. Then, robotic machinery at the space station completed the hard mate, making the attachment permanent. American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a space walk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station. Source: APSource:AP “With that, we have a new port of call,” said NASA commentator Rob Navias, as the space station flew over Singapore. More work lies ahead in the six-and-a-half-hour space walk for the astronauts, who must also connect power and data cables for the adaptor. These fittings will enable the space station to share power and data with visiting spaceships. Williams is making his fourth career space walk. He has accumulated 19 hours of space walk time so far. The space walk is Ms Rubins’s first. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. Kate Rubins viewed near the docking port. Source: AFPSource:AFP ‘Gateway to future’ NASA describes the docking adaptor as a “metaphorical gateway to a future” that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft — the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 — to carry astronauts to the space station. The second docking adaptor is expected to be installed in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called Friday’s installation a “very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability.” Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one metre) tall and about 63 inches wide. Kate Rubins, right, and Jeff Williams viewed near the docking port. Source: AFPSource:AFP The adaptors will work with Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts.

Source: AFPSource:AFP Space walk During the last US space walk was on January 15, a problem with American Tim Kopra’s spacesuit allowed a small amount of water to build up inside his helmet by the end of the outing. It was the latest in a series of spacesuit issues, but was not as severe as an emergency in 2013 when Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet flooded, forcing him to end his space walk early. NASA commentator Rob Navias said the US space agency has done a thorough review of the spacesuits being worn by Rubins and Williams, and they are in “excellent shape” for Friday’s space walk.

Jeff Williams, an experienced spacewalker, is joined by Kate Rubins, who is the twelfth female astronaut to perform a spacewalk. The Docking Adapter is the connecting point for spacecraft joining the ISS. NASA calls the new adapter “a metaphorical gateway to a future” as it will bring future astronaut crews riding on NASA’s first human-rated spacecraft since the space shuttle, Space X’s Crew Dragon spacecraft and Boeing's CST-100 to the ISS. It is part of NASA’s Commercial Crew programme, an effort between NASA and private companies to develop and fly human space transportation systems, and will begin in 2017. The new adapter will make it easier for spacecrafts to enter the station’s driveway and park. It features built-in sensor systems for automated docking and allows visiting spacecrafts to re-charge batteries and exchange data with the ISS. "It's really opening up a new era for commercial crew support to ISS," said Mark Ortiz, Boeing's project manager for the two IDAs. “The IDA enables flexibility for multiple commercial and international vehicles to dock to ISS and opens the door to a new international standard."

Another adapter is expected to be delivered to the station on the ninth SpaceX resupply mission. It weighs 1,000 pounds (453 kilograms) and a robotic arm, known as the Canadarm2, will take the adapter out of the Space X’s cargo-carrying Dragon spacecraft and drag it closer to the space station. The astronauts will then venture outside the ISS to attach the adapter to the Pressurised Mating Adapter. The spacewalk commenced at 8:05 am ET (12:05 BST) and is planned to continue for six and a half hours whilst Rubens and Williams bolt the adapter into place.

The report forecasts the global cloud CFD market to grow at a CAGR of 10.73% during the period 2016-2020. One of the key trends for market growth will be increase in Research & Development in aerospace and defense industry. The aerospace and defense industry is the largest end-user in the global cloud CFD market. One major trend in the industry is the emergence of many SMEs. Though they are smaller in terms of revenue and size compared to larger companies such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, or Boeing, their achievements in the past two to three years has gained them a good position in the aerospace and defense industry. According to the report, increase in number of data centers will be a key driver for market growth. With the growth in cloud services, the demand for data centers has increased considerably. The worldwide spending on public cloud services will be $200 billion in 2016, which will be approximately a 15% increase compared to the previous year. The space occupied by data centers was approximately 1.6 billion square feet in 2014, and it will increase to approximately 2 billion square feet by 2019. This will lead to a greater demand for CFD from data centers.

(VIDEOS) Published time: 19 Aug, 2016 14:26Edited time: 21 Aug, 2016 13:55 Get short URL © airbusgroup.com Aeronautics manufacturer Airbus wants to save commuters from gridlocked city streets with an autonomous ‘flying taxi’ called Vahana, and claims it may have a prototype version in a year’s time. TrendsViral Described as a “flying vehicle for individual passenger and cargo transport,” the Vahana is the product of the Airbus A3 innovation team. If engineering and design efforts are fruitful, it could mean the drastic transformation of skylines: think ‘Blade Runner’ Spinners zooming through a high-density metropolis. Ideas promising the dream of personal aerial transport are not uncommon; raising hopes before ultimately failing to get off the ground. Anyone remember the $6 million Sky Commuter developed by Boeing engineers? Rather than ease the commuter rat race, that 1980s concept misfired and the last (non-functional) prototype ended up being sold for a fraction of its cost online. However, Airbus insists the Vahana project is not a pie-in-the-sky fantasy, pointing out that much of the technology required “such as batteries, motors and avionics are most of the way there.” The aircraft manufacturer cites population increase in much of the world’s “megacities” as a reason why the skies should be opened up to smaller, individual flying vehicles. As far as Airbus’s early projections suggest, the Vahana would either be a single seater craft or cargo delivery drone - and possibly both. The biggest obstacle facing the project appears to be the development of a functional “sense-and-avoid” system, presumably to stop the self-flying craft from crashing into fellow commuters, high-rise buildings, birds or other obstacles along its route. © airbusgroup.com The fact flight pathways above major cities are pretty much locked down by civil aviation law means a change in regulations will also be required before such aircraft take to our city skies. However, Airbus says it will carry out tests next year on a smaller scale, using drones at the National University of Singapore. This will help provide “tangible proof” that the technology can be developed safely, according to the French manufacturer. “I’m no big fan of Star Wars, but it’s not crazy to imagine that one day our big cities will have flying cars making their way along roads in the sky,” said Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders, in a statement. “In a not too distant future, we’ll use our smartphones to book a fully automated flying taxi that will land outside our front door - without any pilot.” Flights of fancy or the real deal? Volocopter A German firm E-Volo is already part of the way there. It carried out its first test flights of the Volocopter VC200 in March this year. The two-seater, electronic craft is essentially a drone-helicopter mash-up. A commercial sale date has not been released by the company, who estimate the first models will “reach the price level of an upmarket automobile.” Terrafugia TF-X The completion date for the Terrafugia’s flying vehicle - part car, part plane - has been slated for a number of years. But last year, a positive leap was made when the US Federal Aviation Administration approved test flights on a smaller version of the plane.

The US company itself estimate a more advanced model called the TF-X will go in production between 2023-2027. Terrafugia is reluctant to state a cost price, only suggesting it will be “consistent with super sports cars.” Lilium Jet Resembling the Lightning Strike drone currently being used by US defense researchers, the Lilium Jet project planners hope it will become the first “electric vertical take-off and landing jet.” And with a “rollout” date of January 2018, it just might be. Then again, the world of aviation innovation is littered with failed projects that flew too close to the sun.

Partly funded by the European Space Agency, the Lilium team has already performed “several scale” trials of the aircraft. “Our goal is to develop an aircraft for use in everyday life,” Lilium CEO Daniel Wiegand, explained earlier this year. “We are going for a plane that can take off and land vertically and does not need the complex and expensive infrastructure of an airport. To reduce noise and pollution, we are using electric engines so it can be used close to urban areas.” AeroMobil Also chasing the land-to-air roadster dream is Slovakian innovator AeroMobil. Its latest prototype, a petrol-powered creation, underwent testing in 2014 and 2015, with plans for commercialization as early as next year. Working on the project since the early ’90s, AeroMobil released test flight footage last year revealing just how far the development of a flying car had progressed. It shows the single propellor ‘car’ taking off from a field before gliding gracefully into the air. Preliminary orders for the contraption are due to be taken this year. The price has not been disclosed, but company representatives have indicated it could sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
