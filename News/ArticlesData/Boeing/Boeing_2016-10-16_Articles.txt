The 424,000-square-foot building will serve as site to manufacture parts of the 777X, the next generation of the massive, twin-engine wide-body jet Boeing first delivered 21 years ago. The parts the St. Louis plant will produce are separate from the forward fuselage, engine nacelles and pylons that Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita manufactures for the Boeing 777 – and the 777X when production begins in 2017. Specifically, St. Louis will produce the 777X’s wing edge and parts of its empennage, or tail, all made from composites. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:26 Nov. 14 supermoon is closest moon to Earth since 1948 Pause 0:23 Klutzy robber sets self ablaze in convenience store heist 1:35 Textron AirLand Scorpion in the air 3:00 Trump vows to be a president for all Americans 1:26 Inside Doc's nose 2:26 Crowd, volunteers rejoice as B-29 makes historic return to flight 0:38 Spectators talk about seeing Doc fly for the first time 1:25 First flight of Citation Longitude super-midsize jet 0:44 WSU's YuMi the robot at NBAA 1:22 500th SpiritAeroSystems Boeing 787 Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Boeing 777X St. Louis manufacturing Crews move an autoclave, used to harden aircraft parts made of composites, to Boeing's new 424,000-square-foot composite center in St. Louis, where workers will manufacture the 777X's composite wing edge and parts of its tail. (Video courtesy of Boeing Co. and Unbridled Media) jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com   Boeing’s St. Louis site, which it acquired from its 1997 merger with McDonnell Douglas, has largely been a center of production of military aircraft, including more than 12,000 fighter jets. “With the opening of this new composite center, our well-trained, high-quality workforce is able to demonstrate its versatility and expertise, positioning our region for additional commercial and defense work in the future,” Bob Ciesla, vice president and 777X program manager, said in a statement. Boeing spent $300 million on the new facility, which it said will have about 700 workers supporting it in the next four years. Final assembly of the 777X will be done at Boeing’s Everett, Wash., plant. Unlike the current generation 777, the 777X will have a composite wing and new, GE9X engines that Boeing says will be 5 percent more efficient than other engines in its class. The first 777X delivery is expected in 2020. Boeing so far has 320 orders and commitments for the airplane that will come in two variants: the 777-8, which will have seating for 350 passengers and a 9,300 nautical-mile range; and the 777-9, with seating for 400 passengers and a range of 8,200 nautical miles.

The agreements with Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT by EnCore, which are due to be announced as early as this week, are the first in which Boeing buys the seats from the supplier, known as "seller-furnished equipment," essentially guaranteeing they will arrive on time. With other seat makers, which include B/E Aerospace and Zodiac Aerospace, airlines are required to buy the seats and have them delivered to aircraft factories, a process that has led to problems for the plane makers when seat deliveries are late. European plane maker Airbus made a similar move in 2015 when it chose German seat maker Recaro to supply seats for the A320 family. Recaro and LIFT are privately held. LIFT's initial orders will equip at least 50 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft with seats designed for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior, with deliveries beginning in 2017, said the source, who could not be named because the negotiations are private. The airline customer names could not be learned. The deals for seats on Boeing's top-selling 737 show initial market acceptance and would allow LIFT to begin certification and production, the source said. Boeing's choice of LIFT as its sole seller-furnished seat supplier prompted drops in B/E Aerospace and Zodiac shares when the deal became public in April. Boeing currently has orders for 4,350 of its 737 jetliners. Boeing declined to comment on LIFT's orders, but said it is seeking new seat suppliers to solve capacity problems that have hampered its assembly lines in the past. "To bring more capacity into the market ... we are looking for and helping to develop more seat companies," Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said. Boeing shares were up 0.37 percent at $134.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing also has been working with Chinese seat maker Ali-Jiatai, which delivered its first set of 737 seats to a Chinese airline over the summer, Kowal said. LIFT by EnCore, founded in 2011, has not delivered seats before. Founders Tom McFarland and Jim Downey sold their previous company, C&D Aerospace, to Zodiac in 2005. EnCore has produced galleys and other aircraft fixtures for customers such as Southwest Airlines.

He said the operation of these routes would likely to start in next summer that is from March 28. Replying to a query, Meraj said now Biman has 12 Boeing new generation aircraft in its fleet by which it can operate more flights. On the other hand, the state-owned carrier has initiated a process to lease two more Boeing 737-800 aircraft by December this year. It has taken the move to replace two decades-old aircraft Airbus A310-300 that were grounded last month. Shakil Meraj said the process is under way to lease the two Boeing 737-800 aircraft for “a long period”. “We are optimistic of completing the process by December this year,” he hoped. He said several companies have submitted proposals after Biman had invited the request for proposal (RFP). “Now, we are evaluating the proposals and the appropriate one would be picked soon,” he added. With the inclusion of the two new aircraft in its fleet, the total number of aircraft of Biman will be 14. “Now, Biman fleet is younger and stronger,” said the Biman general manager. Besides, Biman has an agreement with Boeing for two modern and updated Boeing 787 Dreamliners which would be added to the carrier by 2019. “The Dreamliners would strengthen Biman’s capability for long-haul routes,” said Shakil Meraj. “With the Dreamliners, Biman would operate more long-haul routes like New York and Sydney,” he added. Earlier, Biman had brought four new 777-300 ER aircraft from Boeing as part of its modernisation initiative. Later, the national carrier procured two Boeing 777-200 ER aircraft, four Boeing 737-800 aircraft and two Dash  8-Q400 aircraft to strengthen its fleet.     Biman planning to spread wings to China, Sri Lanka, Maldives BSS Biman Bangladesh Airlines is planning to expand its destination to four new routes - China, Sri Lanka and the Maldives in March next year, reports BSS.

Investors don't seem to have noticed. Adam Levine-Weinberg (TMFGemHunter) Oct 17, 2016 at 1:30PM Embraer rolled out the first E190-E2 earlier this year. Image source: Embraer. Whenever an aircraft manufacturer introduces a new model, it risks cannibalizing demand for its existing products. This is aggravated by the length of development cycles in the industry -- it usually takes more than five years for production of a new model to ramp up. As a result, maintaining stable production rates during model transitions is very challenging. Boeing (NYSE:BA) has learned this lesson the hard way with its 777 aircraft program. While it had hoped to maintain production at 8.3 aircraft per month through the transition to the 777X, Boeing has been forced to reduce production to seven per month in 2017 due to slow sales. Many analysts believe that Boeing will have to cut production further in 2018 or 2019. By contrast, Embraer (NYSE:ERJ) is doing an excellent job of transitioning from the first-generation E-Jets to the new E2-series models. It isn't getting any credit for this success, though. Embraer shares have lost half of their value in the past two years. Embraer Stock Performance, data by YCharts. A tough transition After a stretch of slow sales, by late 2012, Embraer's backlog had fallen to its lowest level in more than six years. Many analysts were worried that it would have to drastically reduce production. The company reeled in a boatload of orders from U.S. regional airlines during 2013. However, Embraer also launched the E2 series of its E-Jets product line during the year. The new versions will offer up to 24% improvements in fuel efficiency, which clearly could deter airlines from buying the outgoing model. Maintaining a smooth transition was particularly essential for Embraer because the E-Jets are its only commercial aircraft family in production. By contrast, Boeing can fall back on its other models to offset slumping 777 production. Embraer pulls a rabbit out of the hat Impressively, Embraer has managed to land order after order for its current-generation E-Jets over the past three years. Most of its orders have come from U.S. regional airlines looking to refresh their fleets with the market-leading E175, but it has also received dozens of orders from airlines in Europe and Asia. U.S. regional airlines have ordered hundreds of E175s since early 2013. Image source: Republic Airways. Thus, there has been more than enough demand for Embraer to hold production steady. In fact, Embraer has been ramping up its commercial jet deliveries lately. After delivering 92 E-Jets in 2014, Embraer delivered 101 in 2015 and expects further growth in 2016 to 105-110 deliveries. To win these orders, Embraer has had to offer bigger discounts, but it has hardly faced drastic pricing pressure. Its commercial aviation segment continues to earn double-digit margins: something that Boeing hasn't been able to deliver in recent memory. Looking ahead to 2017, Embraer has already locked in nearly all of its production, although it will probably end up delivering somewhat fewer aircraft than in 2016. Embraer has also sold about 65% of its planned production for 2018, the last year for which E1-series planes are likely to represent the majority of its output. Other headwinds are fading Embraer's weak stock performance over the past two years can probably be traced to disappointments outside its commercial jet business. The executive jet market has been weak for years. Overproduction has led to severe pricing pressure, undermining profitability. Meanwhile, revenue for Embraer's defense segment plunged last year, due to a combination of budget cuts in Brazil and the impact of the weak Brazilian real. Finally, Embraer recently took a $200 million charge to reflect the cost of settling a years-long corruption probe. However, all of these problems should fade in the next year or two. Embraer recently reduced its workforce by about 9% through voluntary buyouts, which will help offset margin pressure in the executive jet and defense businesses. Additionally, Embraer's new KC-390 multi-role military plane should be ready for its first delivery in 2018, driving a return to growth for the defense segment. As Embraer gets its other business segments back on track, the strength of its commercial aviation business should start to shine through. With 272 firm orders and another 400 options and letters of intent, Embraer's E2-series E-Jets are on their way to becoming a big success. Embraer has almost completed the difficult step of lining up a smooth transition to the new generation of jets. Sooner or later, investors are bound to recognize this achievement.

American Airlines became the first U.S. carrier to offer such a seat on Oct. 4. That's when it began flying an entirely new "premium economy" cabin on its first Boeing 787-9 "Dreamliner" aircraft. The 787-9 is the second version of the Dreamliner to fly for American, joining the smaller 787-8 variant that's already in its fleet. But it's the 787-9 that now offers American's premium economy cabin, which will eventually expand to more of the planes American uses for long-haul international flying. Today in the Sky recently took to the air in American's new premium economy cabin, checking it out on an Oct. 14 domestic flight between Los Angeles and Dallas/Fort Worth. American's premium economy seats will transition to international flights next month. In the meantime, you can review the seats yourself in the photos above. The seats mark a notable change for travelers on U.S. airlines. Until now, "premium economy"' has meant little more than the same old economy seat with a bit of extra legroom. There have been moderate other perks, such as enhanced snack options or priority boarding. But the experience has been more "economy with a snack" than anything approaching an actual premium cabin. With American’s new premium economy cabin, fliers will notice a distinct difference. It bears little semblance to typical economy, instead looking more like "business-class lite." Gone are the economy seats. Instead, customers will find recliner seats that look more like what one would expect in domestic first-class. They feature extra seat width, additional recline, individual armrests and a lot more legroom. USA TODAY Premium economy: Is it worth the upgrade? The new premium economy cabin is set up in its own private mini-cabin: 21 seats arranged in a 2-3-2 configuration that sit right behind the (admittedly much swankier) business class cabin and ahead of economy. The experience is noticeably roomier than standard coach, making this particular three-hour flight much more pleasant. But this product wasn’t meant for three-hour flights. The jet will soon shift to long-haul intercontinental flights, where airlines sense demand for a product that is better than economy but not as pricey as business class. American's new cabin goes beyond the seat. The airline also will introduce a number of "soft product" perks to the premium economy experience. Better meals, free alcohol, amenity kits, a free checked bag and noise-reducing headphones are among the additional features premium economy fliers can expect on long-haul flights. For seasoned travelers used to premium economy on international carriers, American’s effort isn't ground-breaking. Such cabins have existed in various forms since the early 1990s, when it was added by Taipei-based EVA Air and British carrier Virgin Atlantic. Those earlier iterations, which U.S. carriers had never evolved from until now, focused on little more than extra legroom. But as the chasm between business class and economy has grown in recent years, a middle ground has taken root. A number of Asian and European airlines have already added the version of premium economy similar to what American is now introducing. USA TODAY Delta: New international premium economy cabin coming next year USA TODAY Singapore Airlines gives a boost to premium economy American may be the first U.S airline to introduce a "true" premium economy cabin, but it won’t be the only one. Delta Air Lines is also planning to join the pack with its own such version, expected to come sometime in 2017. The moves promises to make the two U.S. carriers more competitive with global airlines like Lufthansa, Air France, British Airways, Singapore Airlines and others that already have such cabins. American’s new premium cabin will begin flying internationally next month on routes to Sao Paulo and Madrid. For those that can’t wait that long to give it a try, American is currently breaking in the cabin through the end of October on flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Los Angeles. The airline stressed that passengers on those domestic runs will not receive the full experience, only the seat. Long-term pricing for the new cabin isn't yet clear. For now, American is selling the seats as Main Cabin Extra, a name given to the airline’s standard extra legroom offering in economy. A quick search on some early long-haul routes showed the newest premium economy seats going for between $150 and $200 extra, one way. Prices hovered around $70, one-way, for a domestic flight. By comparison, similar premium economy cabins on other airlines typically sell for several hundred dollars above the base economy fare, though they are often dramatically cheaper than business-class fares. Eventually, American's soft launch of the product is expected to give way to the carrier selling it as a distinctly different cabin.

The center is a visible representation of the company’s efforts to diversify and grow its St. Louis-area operations. The 424,000-square-foot facility will initially build composite parts for the company’s newest commercial jetliner, the 777X. Boeing has committed more than $300 million in company funds to construct and outfit the center. “Boeing has had a presence in St. Louis for nearly 80 years. We’ve built more than 12,000 fighter jets here,” said Bob Ciesla, vice president and program manager for the 777X St. Louis work. “With the opening of this new composite center, our well-trained, high-quality workforce is able to demonstrate its versatility and expertise, positioning our region for additional commercial and defense work in the future.” Production of 777X wing edge and empennage parts will begin at the new composite center in early 2017. The first 777X delivery is expected in 2020. As a result of this 777X work in St. Louis, a total of approximately 700 jobs are expected to be generated in production, engineering, and multiple support areas by the early 2020s timeframe.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren) UPDATED at 1 p.m. Tuesday with information from new finance reports Political friction over the Iran nuclear deal has filtered down to the race for Missouri treasurer, with Republican Eric Schmitt and Democrat Judy Baker at odds over how far the state should go in restricting financial ties to the Mideast nation. Whether Boeing Co.’s agreement to build 80 passenger planes for Iran should spur the state to block tax credits for the firm is among various issues in the down-ballot Nov. 8 election contest. Schmitt, a state senator from Glendale, says Boeing should be barred from getting up to $229 million in tax credits pledged previously by the state if it maintains and expands employment in Missouri. “I don’t think any taxpayer dollars should go to any company that does business with Iran,” Schmitt says, noting that the country remains on a State Department list of terrorism-sponsoring nations despite the lifting of some international sanctions. Baker, a former state representative from Columbia, opposes ending the state tax credit package for Boeing, saying that such a move could kill Missouri jobs. She said she supported a longstanding policy in the treasurer’s office that prohibits investing state money in terrorism-related nations. But when a U.S. company sells planes to Iran, she said, “we’re not giving money to Iran, money is coming to us.” Moreover, she said, yanking tax credits after they’re awarded sends a message to companies in general that the state’s business climate is unstable. The treasurer’s office doesn’t oversee the Boeing tax credit package but is in charge of some investment of state dollars. Also in the race are Libertarian nominee Sean O’Toole of Kansas City and Green Party candidate Carol Hexem of St. Louis County. Democratic incumbent Clint Zweifel is barred by state law from seeking a third four-year term. Schmitt, 41, a lawyer, and Baker, 56, a former health care administrator and college economics teacher, both cite their experience. Schmitt, a senator since 2009, had a key role restricting municipal court fines and mandating cuts in the state income tax when state revenue reaches a certain level. He also sponsored a new law giving families the ability to open a tax-exempt savings account for expenses related to a disability — a program overseen by the treasurer’s office. He also cites his chairing a Senate panel on economic development. “Running for state treasurer is an extension of that service,” said Schmitt, who got started in elective office as a Glendale alderman. Baker, during her 2005-2008 House tenure, also was an active lawmaker. She tried unsuccessfully to get the GOP-run Legislature to do things such as keep carbonated beverages out of school vending machines and bar younger teen drivers from using cellphones. She worked with a state agency to offer online drivers education for teens after her bill didn’t pass. She laid groundwork for requiring physical education in schools, which passed the year after she left the Legislature to run for Congress — a race she narrowly lost in 2008. While in the House, she said, she started a bipartisan caucus on economic problems keeping people in poverty. She said she would bring to the treasurer’s office the same focus on helping lower-income working families. “Most people have jobs, some have two, some have three, and still can’t make ends meet,” she said at a campaign stop last week at Greater Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. She plans a statewide program — perhaps jointly funded by the state and private entities — to open a $50 bank account for every kindergartner, regardless of family income. The program would be paired with a financial literacy education effort for elementary and high school students. Voters guide:  Detailed looks at the candidates and issues Baker as treasurer also would provide “equal-pay tool kits” for businesses to assess whether women and minority employees are treated fairly. She and Schmitt both say they’ll work to make online information on state finances more understandable to residents and to increase access to information about unclaimed bank accounts. Baker suggests doing that when Missourians renew vehicle licenses. Schmitt says his experience raising an autistic son, Stephen, spurred him to get involved in public service. With bipartisan support, he won passage of a 2010 bill requiring insurance companies to cover autism treatment. “There’s plenty that divides us, but these are the kind of things that should bring us together,” Schmitt says in a TV ad which began running Tuesday. Schmitt first commented about rescinding Boeing tax credits, some of which stem from a 2013 bill he sponsored, when asked last month by a reporter in Columbia. At the time, he said, he was discussing his push in the Legislature earlier this year for a constitutional amendment barring state and local government investment in companies doing business with Iran and other nations on the terrorism list. The unsuccessful measure didn’t deal with tax credits. Schmitt said that if someone in the Legislature next year proposed doing that, he would support it. The treasurer’s office policy prohibits investments by the state in companies known to back terrorism or which “aid the government” in countries that sponsor terrorism. Baker said that policy had worked well and that she would stick with it. Meanwhile, Schmitt has attacked Baker on the Affordable Care Act, noting that she was regional administrator of the federal Department of Health and Human Services during President Barack Obama’s first term. In that job, he said, Baker was “the architect of Obamacare in Missouri.” He contends the law has resulted in higher health insurance premiums. Baker said she played no role in creating the program but did help prepare educational materials on it. She said that she supported the program but that fixes were needed, including cutting costs by focusing reimbursements on quality and value instead of quantity of care. Meanwhile, Baker criticizes Schmitt for opposing Medicaid expansion, which backers say would bring more federal dollars to Missouri and spur new health care jobs. “I want to create jobs in Missouri, and he is killing jobs,” Baker said. Schmitt has a big fundraising lead in the race. Updated finance reports submitted Monday showed Schmitt raising about $3 million and Baker about $551,000 throughout the campaign. The reports cover activity through the end of last month. The reports also showed Schmitt had $2.5 million on hand left to spend and Baker with $350,314. See who is making donations to candidates in Missouri Nevertheless, Baker said she would be able to afford enough commercials to get her message across. Meanwhile, the Libertarian nominee, O’Toole, wants to stop state efforts to get businesses to move from other states with negotiated incentives. Instead, he wants to make Missouri more attractive to business by ending the state income tax and business and occupational licensing. He also wants to end a state program that makes deposits in banks agreeing to issue low-interest loans to small businesses. He said that was unfair to competing banks. Hexem, of the Green Party, said she would establish an ombudsman’s office to advise student borrowers and represent their concerns to the Legislature. She also said she would fight for better options for low-income housing and to reduce homelessness, from the treasurer’s seat on a state housing commission.

"These talks include detailed and complicated technical as well as legal aspects," he told ICANA news agency. "Both Airbus and Boeing had applied to the US Treasury for permit to sell airplanes to Iran. The permits were the major issue, but they have been granted now." Boeing’s Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg recently said his company make take one to three years to deliver airplanes to Iran. According to US law, any company using a minimum 10 percent of US-made parts in their products should have a Treasury authorization to sell the products to Iran. The sale of passenger airplanes and their parts to Iran was banned by the US after the group "Muslim Student Followers of the Line of Imam" stormed the US Embassy in Tehran in 1979 in what came to be known as Iran hostage crisis.

Mounir takes over from John Wojick, who will retire in 2017. Ihssane Mounir will be responsible for sales and marketing of all airliners and related services to airlines and leasing companies, in all markets worldwide. This nomination will come with big challenges for the Moroccan expatriate, as Boeing is striving to keep up with other aviation giants, such as Airbus. According to the American news source Seattle Times, Boeing needs to sell more Boeing 777s to avoid serious production cuts on the jet line. Mounir has a reputation of being an “unusually able and aggressive executive”, as described by the Seattle Times. Ray Conner, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement that Mounir is “a seasoned sales leader.” The 45-year-old executive joined Boeing in 1997 as a senior aerodynamics engineer. His talent in sales oriented him toward the company’s business side, where he sold jets in Africa, Latin America, Europe, Russia, and Asia. At the age of 17, Ihssane Mounir set foot in the United States with no knowledge of the English language. Wichita State University offered him a conditional acceptance to study aerospace engineering. Therefore, he studied English at a language school in Wichita, Kansas. Subsequently, he was admitted into Wichita State University, where he obtained bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aerospace engineering. Mounir’s nomination comes few days after the signing ceremony, chaired by King Mohamed VI at the Royal Palace of Tangier, of a draft agreement for the establishment of a Boeing industrial ecosystem in Morocco. The structuring project will allow the Moroccan aviation industry to improve its position significantly at the international level. Join the Conversation. What do you think?

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) top story Reporter's Notebook: Ex-Im Bank again stymied by political gridlock By Mai Hoang maihoang@yakimaherald.com Mai Hoang Oct 16, 2016 (…) A man walks out of the Export-Import Bank of the United States in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 2015. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) YAKIMA, Wash. -- Nearly a year ago, Dan Roberts was at Boeing in Seattle celebrating the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. Roberts is general manager of Yakima’s Manhasset Specialty Co., one of many small businesses nationwide that benefited from the federal agency, which makes and funds loans to enable countries to purchase U.S. goods. Reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank, which came as part of a $305 billion transportation bill, was to last until 2019, a welcome extension for Roberts, who had been tapped by Washington state representatives to tout the bank’s benefits for smaller businesses. That’s because the bank’s critics, primarily Republican lawmakers, spent months stalling reauthorization, calling it “corporate welfare” for larger companies such as Boeing. But in the last few months, the Ex-Im Bank has again fallen victim to political gridlock. Its five-member board has dropped to two, one short of a quorum, leading to a $10 million limit in the loans the bank can approve. Meanwhile, efforts to confirm President Barack Obama’s nominee to the bank, which was made back in January, have stalled. And the lack of a quorum has opponents calling for the bank’s demise, again. Roberts said Manhasset, whose transactions don’t reach $10 million, hasn’t been hurt by the funding limit. But recent events reinforce the need of the business community — with the help of supportive federal legislators from this state — to continue to tout the bank’s benefits to small businesses such as Manhasset, which exports its music stands to more than 20 countries. Roberts is personally frustrated by the continued gridlock and the uncertainty it’s creating. “I think everyone felt great that there was the reauthorization of the bank,” he said. “Now with the lack of follow-up action ... it is really frustrating to see that’s not the case. There’s still a great deal left not resolved.” Take the survey Later this month, I’m running a story package exploring the minimum wage and Initiative 1433, which aims to raise that wage to $13.50 an hour by 2020 in Washington state. As part of this effort, I would love to hear from you. I am collecting thoughts on the minimum wage and I-1433 through a short online survey.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Iran says plane deliveries still pending talks Sun Oct 16, 2016 7:3PM Home Iran Economy Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi says Iran Air is negotiating with Airbus and Boeing to resolve the technical issues that are hindering the delivery of planes purchased from the two global aviation giants. Iran says technical issues are to blame for the delay in receiving the airplanes it has purchased from global aviation giants Airbus and Boeing.  Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Abbas Araqchi said what was previously obstructing the delivery of the planes were the related authorizations by the US Treasury Department which were issued last month.  “The delivery of the planes now depends on the finalization of negotiations between Iran Air from one side and Airbus and Boeing from another,” Araqchi told Iran’s ISNA news agency. He emphasized that negotiations on plane purchases are complicated and comprise many technical and legal issues.  The official added that Iran Air hopes to receive the first planes it has purchased in the near future.  On 21 September, Airbus said it had obtained an initial license from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for the early delivery of 17 A320 or A330 jets to Iran. This will be part of a deal worth above $10 billion that was signed in January for the delivery of above 100 planes to the Islamic Republic.  The announcement by Airbus was immediately followed by a similar move by Boeing which said OFAC had given the authorization for the company to proceed with a deal it had signed with Iran in June to sell 80 planes to the country.  The company is also expected to lease 29 other planes to the Islamic Republic under the same deal which is estimated to be worth $25 billion.  Officials in Tehran have already announced that Iran needs to purchase between 400 and 500 commercial airliners over the next decade to rejuvenate its ageing aviation fleet.  The country’s current aviation fleet is comprised of around 140 planes with an average age of around 20 years, with many in desperate need of replacement.

Matein Khalid Market View Filed on October 16, 2016 | Last updated on October 16, 2016 at 09.11 pm Share More > Vote he Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and tighten liquidity in the bank aircraft finance market. (AFP) China's 25 year lows in economic growth and Brexit have all hit cross border tourism Commercial aerospace is no longer the valuation darling of Wall Street - with good reason. Oil prices have risen 65 per cent from their February lows. The Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and tighten liquidity in the bank aircraft finance market. The surge in King Dollar has dampened passenger air traffic growth. The AirAsia crash has hit budget travel in Southeast Asia. Civil wars in the Arab world, Russian military interventions in Syria and Ukraine, the Turkish coup attempt, China's 25 year lows in economic growth and Brexit have all hit cross border tourism. The IMF has slashed global growth forecasts to 2.5 per cent from 3.2 per cent. Airlines have begun to defer orders for wide bodied planes. The aerospace sector has been derated on Wall Street as storm clouds darken its macroeconomic and earnings growth outlook. Honeywell's recent 10 per cent share plunge is a dark omen. Boeing at $133 is overvalued if the commercial aircraft cycle has peaked, as I expect it has. Boeing Commercial Aircraft (BCA) faces its first cyclical downturn since the 2008-09 global recession. CEO Dennis Muilenburg warned the Street to expect "flattish" revenues in both commercial and defense in 2017. This means soft 777 orders will reduce the production run rate while 787 Dreamliner deliveries have been flat in the past year. Aggressive pricing on the 737 MAX will not help operating margins though I expect free cash flow growth per share can rise by at least 10 per cent in the next five years. The latest lewd Trump videos mean Hilary Clinton wins the White House on November 8. This means no aggressive ramp up in Pentagon military business or boost to Boeing's military aircraft businesses (e.g. F-15's, Apache helicopters, F-18's, Starlifter transport planes etc), almost 48 per cent of total revenue. Near term production pressures do not negate the strength of Boeing's 5700 order backlog, the scale of US/Europe replacement demand and the emerging market air travel growth potential. While US fiscal pressures will hit specific programmes, such as the C-17 closure, Boeing is one of the world's top military hardware vendors at a time when Washington confronts Russia in the Middle East and China in the Pacific Basin. I expect Boeing shares to trade in a 120-150 range in the next twelve months. Raytheon (RTN) is the world's preeminent supplier of air defence system (the Patriot missiles that confronted Saddam's Sands in the first Gulf War), air to air missiles, radars, sensors and communications equipment to the Pentagon, Nato and Uncle Sam allied air forces all over the world. After some botched acquisitions in the late 1990s, Raytheon has almost doubled its operating margins to 13 per cent in the past decade and has spent a staggering $5 billion in share buybacks since 2012. Raytheon shares were a fabulous winner on Wall Street, up 26 per cent in 2016. Apart from Lockheed, no other company in the world can match Raytheon's technology based global missiles sales momentum. However, after a stellar 2016, I would book profits in Raytheon at $140 a share. Honeywell blamed a weak aerospace cycle when it guided down its estimates to $6.60, the reason its shares tanked last Friday to $105 a share. The firm now trades at a valuation discount to its peers at 15 times earnings, I expect downside on the preannouncement and the industrial conglomerate's project execution woes. Honeywell's $15 billion aerospace business is a classic barometer of demands since it produces everything from cockpit "nose to tail" instruments to landing gear. I would stay short Honeywell for a $98 target. The resignation of Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf was inevitable after the sordid cross selling scandal has devastated the shares of the Californian megabank, once the most valuable bank on the planet. While optically attractive after their fall from 56 to 45, I am afraid to buy the shares because, unlike J.P. Morgan's London Whale or Goldman's Abacus scandal, the victims here are not institutions but millions of Mom and Pop all-American voters in an election year. Litigation risk will be a sword of Damocles on Wells Fargo shares. Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Markets What next for aerospace and defence shares?

About us Membership Contact us Mon November 14, 2016 Home Society Economy Politics Sports Culture Multimedia Araqchi says aircraft deliveries dependent on talks with Airbus, Boeing Politics October 16, 2016 TEHRAN – Abbas Araqchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, said on Sunday that new aircraft deliveries to Iran depends on the ongoing talks between Iran Air and two airplane manufacturers Airbus and Boeing. The negotiations are underway and Iran has not reached an agreement with the two aircraft manufacturers, Araqchi said.  Following the implementation of the last year’s nuclear accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), between Iran and six world powers, Airbus and Boeing received permission, less than a month ago, from the U.S. government to sell aircraft to Iran. European airplane manufacturer Airbus announced the license from the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on September 21, followed by Boeing’s announcement later in the day. Describing the aircraft deals as detailed and complex, Araqchi said the Islamic Republic expects to receive the airplanes in the near future. The senior diplomat also said the United States must not allow any new nuclear sanctions or the old ones under new names to be imposed on Iran. “If Congress tries to impose new nuclear sanctions against Iran, the U.S. president is obligated under the JCPOA to veto the new sanctions,” he explained.  Republican lawmakers have been pushing to kill the nuclear deal.  Following Boeing’s announcement that it was concluding a major deal to sell Iran commercial aircraft, Congress introduced at least seven bills aimed at killing the deal. Three of the bills would prohibit the Treasury Department from issuing export licenses for the aircraft. However, the U.S. President Barack Obama has on numerous occasions threatened to veto any attempt by Congress to undermine the nuclear deal with Iran, saying that the historic accord was the best available option to prevent another war in the Middle East.

REUTERS/Jumana El Heloueh Reuters/Jumana El Heloueh Sunday, Oct 16, 2016 Abu Dhabi: Strata Manufacturing is expected to cross the Dh400 million mark in revenue for the second time in as many years, on the back of new orders from Boeing and Airbus, Badr Al Olama, chief executive officer of the Al Ain-based aeronautical manufacturer, told Gulf News in an interview. The company was awarded two Airbus contracts valued at more than $1 billion (Dh3.67 billion) and a multi-year contract with Boeing to manufacture vertical fins for the 787 at Farnborough air show in July. “Last year we had a revenue of Dh400 million and this year it would definitely be higher. We are aiming to reach Dh1 billion revenue by 2020. There is going to be significant growth in the coming years with the number of work packages we’ve been getting from both Boeing and Airbus,” he said. By contrast, revenue in 2011 was Dh61 million. Advertisement “The new contracts will bring in new capabilities to the company apart from increasing the revenue. The speed of work will go up exponentially — from taking 2-3 days for manufacturing a specific product to completing a significant large structure product every business day. This is something extremely challenging and rewarding at the same time for Strata.” During the year, Strata delivered over 433 shipsets, consisting of more than 7,511 parts — representing a 29 per cent growth in the total number of parts manufactured in 2014. With the government gearing up to host the Global Manufacturing and Industrialisation Summit in Abu Dhabi next year, the presence of Strata with big orders from Boeing and Airbus is expected to boost the manufacturing sector that is contributing 14 per cent of the UAE’s GDP. Al Olama said the company has aspired from day one to become one of the top three global manufacturers for Boeing and Airbus. The new contracts signed at Farnborough will get them one step closer to that vision. “With respect to people, there will be a lot of development and up-skilling and training so that these individuals that we have in this facility today are going to be of at a level that you would expect to see in places like Toulouse or Seattle where Airbus or Boeing are located.” Al Olama said Strata values the relationship with Boeing and Airbus, and the company is delivering parts on time while meeting quality standards. The company is now considering opening new manufacturing new facilities in North Africa and the US as their two main customers are located nearby. No timeline has been given for the new factories. Al Olama says Strata also has plans to tie up with other aircraft manufacturers across the globe to serve the growing demands of the aviation industry. “Strata needs to build its value proposition further to become the supplier of choice for the aircraft manufacturers, therefore when the right time comes for Strata to expand geographically, we will be looking for future customers that are keen to work with us.” The company is looking at China, Canada, Brazil and Russia in particular. “China has its own platform with respect to a commercial aircraft, Brazil has Embraer, Canada has an important player with Bombardier and Russia has a joint venture with Italy on the Superjet. There are multiple platforms that are interesting and are promising for the global [aviation] industry.” The firm expects huge demand for low-cost carriers in the coming years, with the growth of the middle class population across the globe, especially in India and China. “There is a huge growth of low-cost carriers and the backlog is still there. As Airbus and Boeing fulfil the backlog there are more orders that are coming up. As long as people are travelling we are going to continue building parts.” Strata Manufacturing was established in 2010 and is wholly owned by Mubadala Development Company. The Al Ain-based company recently embarked on an expansion project to increase their shop floor area to 31,500 square metres, adding 10,000 square metre of usable production space.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, October 18, 2016 Updated: 1:50 PM, October 18, 2016 NEW YORK - A new supplier of economy-class seats for Boeing Co's <BA.N> top-selling 737 jetliners has signed its first two airline customers, allowing it to begin production, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. The agreements with Huntington Beach, California-based LIFT by EnCore, which are due to be announced as early as this week, are the first in which Boeing buys the seats from the supplier, known as "seller-furnished equipment," essentially guaranteeing they will arrive on time. With other seat makers, which include B/E Aerospace <BEAV.O> and Zodiac Aerospace <ZODC.PA>, airlines are required to buy the seats and have them delivered to aircraft factories, a process that has led to problems for the plane makers when seat deliveries are late. European plane maker Airbus <AIR.PA> made a similar move in 2015 when it chose German seat maker Recaro to supply seats for the A320 family. Recaro and LIFT are privately held. LIFT's initial orders will equip at least 50 of Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft with seats designed for the Boeing 737 Sky Interior, with deliveries beginning in 2017, said the source, who could not be named because the negotiations are private. The airline customer names could not be learned. The deals for seats on Boeing's top-selling 737 show initial market acceptance and would allow LIFT to begin certification and production, the source said. Boeing's choice of LIFT as its sole seller-furnished seat supplier prompted drops in B/E Aerospace and Zodiac shares when the deal became public in April. Boeing currently has orders for 4,350 of its 737 jetliners. Boeing declined to comment on LIFT's orders, but said it is seeking new seat suppliers to solve capacity problems that have hampered its assembly lines in the past. "To bring more capacity into the market ... we are looking for and helping to develop more seat companies," Boeing spokeswoman Jessica Kowal said. Boeing shares were up 0.37 percent at $134.00 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing also has been working with Chinese seat maker Ali-Jiatai, which delivered its first set of 737 seats to a Chinese airline over the summer, Kowal said. LIFT by EnCore, founded in 2011, has not delivered seats before. Founders Tom McFarland and Jim Downey sold their previous company, C&D Aerospace, to Zodiac in 2005. EnCore has produced galleys and other aircraft fixtures for customers such as Southwest Airlines.

Most Popular Boom Technology By Jay Bennett Oct 14, 2016 Building a new supersonic airliner has been the elusive dream of aerospace manufacturers ever since the Concorde made its last flight in 2003. But despite four decades of aviation advancements since the Concorde was introduced in 1976, no one else has managed to achieve the supersonic holy grail: New York to London in just 3 or 4 hours. That might finally be changing. Boom Technology, a small aerospace company with funding from Virgin Galactic, is made up of aviation and propulsion experts from the likes of NASA, Pratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman subsidiary Scaled Composites. The Denver-based team recently redesigned the plans for their Mach 2.2 supersonic airliner, stretching the aircraft to about 155 feet to accommodate 50 passengers rather than 40. They increased the wingspan of the delta-wing slightly as well. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below By using structural composite materials developed by Boeing, as well as heat-resistant composites used on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, Boom believes it can succeed in building a supersonic passenger airframe where others have failed. A third engine, embedded in the tail cone section fighter-style, has also been added to the aircraft's design. Boom Technology Most Popular "Moving from a twinjet to a trijet is a better answer," Boom Technology CEO Blake Scholl told Aviation Week. "A twinjet is more challenging to certify for early ETOPS [extended twin operations], while a trijet will enable unrestricted travel on routes with up to 180 minutes diversion time with an engine out." Related Stories NASA to Build a Supersonic Jet Without the Boom Could Boom Be the Next Concorde? NASA Tests Its Quiet-Boom Supersonic Jet Engine Boom is currently working on a one-third-scale prototype of their aircraft, called the XB-1, which will be powered by General Electric CJ610 turbojet engines. Flight of the sub-scale prototype is planned for late 2017 to test the design and aerodynamic structure. The full aircraft, which Boom hopes will enter service by 2023, will be powered by an as-yet unselected engine, modified by Boom with a low-pressure spool so the jet can take off and fly at all stages without afterburner. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below "At least two off-the-shelf cores are a good fit," Scholl said to Aviation Week of the engine selection process. "One commercial and one military, the latter with good exportability. ... Making the whole flight profile possible without afterburner is crucial to making it viable." Things appear to be on track for Boom, depending on how their prototype flight testing goes next year. What's more, an independent report provided to Aviation Week by Boyd Group International Strategic Aviation Solutions suggests the market is ready to implement supersonic passenger airliners, with an estimated demand for as many as 1,300 aircraft worth $260 billion across multiple airlines (300 planes more than Boom's in-house estimates). NASA's Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator aircraft, an X-plane being developed in partnership with Lockheed Martin to prevent pressure waves from coalescing into a single shockwave as the aircraft breaks the sound barrier, significantly reducing the noise of a sonic boom. NASA/Lockheed Martin The stars might be aligning for Boom, but they still have some hurdles to overcome. Keeping engine noise down on takeoff to adhere to aviation regulations is one of them, and while Scholl said it "can be done with a propulsion system that will make it [noise] compliant for takeoff and be efficient in cruise," he also admitted hitting Mach 2.2 and meeting noise regulations would come with design compromises and "with pain, for sure." Boom isn't alone in its quest for supersonic passenger flight. Aerion plans to launch the certification program for its Mach 1.4 AS2 supersonic trijet by the end of 2017, achieve first flight by 2021, and enter service in 2023. The project is receiving engineering support from aviation giant Airbus. The 12-seat Aerion AS2 supersonic business jet, designed to use natural-laminar-flow over the wings to remain efficient at supersonic speeds. Aerion Corporation NASA is also working to build a new supersonic aircraft, an X-plane called the Quiet Supersonic Technology (QueSST) demonstrator that will be used to test new aerodynamic designs to quiet the noise of a sonic boom. The X-plane will also test new engines capable of supersonic propulsion that are quiet enough to adhere to FAA airport noise regulations. Until the thunder clap of a sonic boom is quieted, companies like Boom can only hope to fly commercial routes over the oceans. But even with only transoceanic routes available to Boom for their first aircraft, airlines are seemingly ready to accept supersonic planes into their fleets. It might not be too much longer until you can take that 3.5-hour flight from JFK to Heathrow, traveling faster than the speed of sound at 60,000 feet, with the curvature of the Earth out your window for a view.

Iran says technical issues are to blame for the delay in receiving the airplanes it has purchased from global aviation giants Airbus and Boeing.  Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said what was previously obstructing the delivery of the planes were the related authorizations by the US Treasury Department which were issued last month.  “The delivery of the planes now depends on the finalization of negotiations between Iran Air from one side and Airbus and Boeing from another,” Araqchi told Iran’s ISNA news agency. He emphasized that negotiations on plane purchases are complicated and comprise many technical and legal issues.  The official added that Iran Air hopes to receive the first planes it has purchased in the near future.  On 21 September, Airbus said it had obtained an initial license from the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) for the early delivery of 17 A320 or A330 jets to Iran. This will be part of a deal worth above $10 billion that was signed in January for the delivery of above 100 planes to the Islamic Republic.  The announcement by Airbus was immediately followed by a similar move by Boeing which said OFAC had given the authorization for the company to proceed with a deal it had signed with Iran in June to sell 80 planes to the country.  The company is also expected to lease 29 other planes to the Islamic Republic under the same deal which is estimated to be worth $25 billion.  Officials in Tehran have already announced that Iran needs to purchase between 400 and 500 commercial airliners over the next decade to rejuvenate its ageing aviation fleet.  The country’s current aviation fleet is comprised of around 140 planes with an average age of around 20 years, with many in desperate need of replacement.     Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Advertisement Copyright © 2016 Press TV.

MUNICH: European aircraft maker Airbus (AIR.PA) aims to overtake arch rival Boeing (BA.N) in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020, having fallen behind in recent years, Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said in a German newspaper interview published on Monday. “In 2020 we will deliver more planes than Boeing again,” Fabrice told the Welt daily newspaper. While Airbus has been leading in terms of new orders for years, its American rival has been ahead since 2012 in terms of deliveries. Bregier said Airbus would particularly focus on its A320 neo narrowbody and A350 widebody planes. He said that Airbus was hopeful it would deliver 50 A350 aircraft this year, although deliveries by the end of September stood at only 26.

After dragging its heels initially, state-run Air India has finally coaxed American plane maker Boeing to pay compensation for lower fuel efficiency than promised in B787 Dreamliner aircraft. The aviation behemoth has agreed to pay $45 million for additional fuel burn to the airline. But industry sources said the compensation would not be given upfront in cash. Instead, credit memo of this amount would be issued to the airline, which would be settled against future payment made by Air India towards aircraft purchase. The airline has nine wide-body aircraft, six B787s and three B777s, on order which it hopes to get by March 2018. A proposal to order five more wide-body airplanes is under consideration. While Boeing did not respond to email queries sent by Financial Chronicle sent October 1, an Air India spokesperson refused to speak on the issue citing confidentiality clause. Sources, however, said, “There was initial disagreement between the two parties over compensation amount but later negotiations were held for about $45 million to which they agreed.” Location: India, Delhi, New Delhi MOST POPULAR 1 I was only looking for a fling with Akshay: Twinkle Khanna 2 Apple is preparing to launch 12.9-inch iPad in March 3 Watch: Old lady tells off Priyanka Chopra for trying to be helpful 4 Five decades and 200 films later, Jackie Chan 'finally' wins Oscar 5 'Hoi Kiw (Chalo Chalo)' is a copied song, claims Khasi artist's family! more Columnist Rajiv Bhatia Asia’s natural allies?

Naroff, joel@naroffeconomics.com Posted: 10/17/16, 4:00 PM EDT | Updated: 3 weeks, 6 days ago # Comments INDICATOR: >> September Industrial Production and New York Fed Survey KEY DATA: >> IP: +0.1 percent; Manufacturing: +0.2 percent/ NY Fed: -4.8 points IN A NUTSHELL: >> “Manufacturing remains soft but there might be some signs that the bottom is being reached.” WHAT IT MEANS: >> It is hard to have a full-blown, strong economic expansion if the manufacturing sector is hurting and that has been the case this year. It cannot be said that conditions are good, but they may not be deteriorating any more. Industrial production rose modestly in September after a sharp decline in August. Manufacturing output was up a little faster, but a major drop in aerospace restrained activity. Boeing still has a huge backlog, so that is not likely to continue. Advertisement More worrisome was continued weakness in machinery. That may indicate uncertainty on the part of businesses about the future direction of the economy and an unwillingness to make any major bets. Overall activity was restrained by declining utility production. It’s tough to seasonally adjust for the weather when there is climate change. (No, I don’t think it is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese.) But the most optimistic number in the report was the robust gain in petroleum production. Output is now actually up over the year. While there may be some hints at conditions improving in the Industrial Production release, conditions in the New York Fed’s regional manufacturing sector faltered further. Orders are still declining, but less so. However, optimism about the future is improving. This part of the country is not a hot bed of industrial activity, but a decline there is another indication that manufacturing has a way to go before it can start adding greatly to the economy. MARKETS AND FED POLICY IMPLICATIONS: >> While manufacturing has been soft, that doesn’t mean the domestic economy is falling apart. Remember, we are in a global economy and world growth and the value of the dollar matter. Those factors have been working against the sector. In addition, the collapse of the oil complex has hurt firms that provide goods, much of them manufactured, to the energy companies. But as Nobel Laureate Bob Dylan wrote: The times, they are a changin’. Energy prices are no longer sinking like a stone and firms are starting to swim again (apologies to those who know the lyrics). Indeed, rig counts are rising consistently and are up sharply from the bottom reached in the spring. We might even see some investment in the industry in 2017. That would be a great turnaround that could help the manufacturing sector. But that remains a hope, not a reality. For the markets, though, Monday’s reports probably will not have much of an impact. We are in earnings season. But for the Fed, which produces the industrial production data, the recent data provide a little for everyone. The production rise was modest enough so those that want to wait can say economic conditions are still not great. Meanwhile, those who want to hike rates can say the worst looks to be over, especially with the dollar off its highs and reasonably stable. Which means, we are still nowhere when it comes to having data that demands a Fed rate hike. Of course, that is only a concern to those who actually think the Fed is data driven. Joel L.

The KC-135 Stratotanker’s 60 years of service were recognized during a ceremony at Dock 5 ½ in Bldg. 3001. The KC-135’s actual anniversary coincides with the first flight on Aug. 31, 1956, so the fall celebration at the home of all organic depot workload was perfectly suited. Guest speakers from the Air Force Sustainment Center, Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Rockwell Collins and Boeing credited the longevity of the KC-135 fleet in large part to the skilled workforce at Tinker Air Force Base, which was instrumental in putting a record 75 KC-135 aircraft through programmed depot maintenance in fiscal 2016. Col. Mark Mocio, Legacy Tanker Division commander and program manager for the KC-135 was one of the featured guest speakers at the KC-135 60th Anniversary event Oct. 7 and spoke on the legacy of the Stratotanker. The other distinguished visitor guest speakers included Air Force Sustainment Center Commander Lt. Gen. Lee Levy II; Donald Thompson, deputy program executive officer for Tanker with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center; Ryan Roseke, with Rockwell-Collins; and Pam Valdez, with Boeing. (Air Force photo by Kelly White) “As we celebrate the birthday of a national treasure today, we do so realizing that the 60 years of success of the KC-135 is due to generations that preceded us, this generation and the generations to come that have invested their lives in the tanker fleet — contractor, civilian and military personnel,” said Col. Mark Mocio, Legacy Tanker Division commander and program manager for the KC-135. “Because of your efforts, the KC-135 has served as the backbone of military aerial refueling for 60 years and will continue for decades to come.” The Legacy Tanker program office at Tinker is responsible for life cycle management of the KC-135 fleet, while the maintenance, repair and overhaul is performed by the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex, including the 76th Aircraft Maintenance Group. They have separate organizational chains and separate responsibilities, but the two groups work together to provide combat power to the Airmen. Cooperation is the key to getting the job done, Colonel Mocio said. Col. Kenyon Bell, 76th AMXG commander, agrees. “Our strength really lies in our people,” he said. “We can’t do anything without our talented and dedicated workforce. Our collective team is laser focused daily on providing safe, quality aircraft back to the operational forces.” Donald Thompson, deputy program executive officer for Tankers with the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, said those flying the first KC-135 in 1956 probably never imagined that the same aircraft would be flying 60 years later, much less continue until the 2040’s. “None of that would be possible without you, the men and women of the Air Force and those working for our mission partners,” he said. “For 60 years you have been the unsung heroes on the KC-135.” Members of Team Tinker gathered together Oct. 7 to celebrate the KC-135 Stratotanker’s 60 years of service. (Air Force photo by Kelly White) Addressing the maintainers in attendance, Mr. Thompson urged them to never forget the importance of their role. “Each of the KC-135 crew members and passengers put their lives in your hands every day,” he said. “You see, each of you is just as critical to the KC-135 mission execution chain as the pilot and boom operator. Without you, they will never offload another gallon of gas, they will never save another life and they will never transport another short ton. Thank you for taking this responsibility so seriously and thank you, Tanker family, for all you do.” Air Force Sustainment Center Commander Lt. Gen. Lee K. Levy II said there are many more chapters to be written in the history of the KC-135 and he’s looking forward to seeing what the next chapter will be. The KC-135 60th Anniversary brought a huge crowd to the programmed depot maintenance line in Bldg. 3001 Oct. 7. The event featured guest speakers from the Air Force Sustainment Center, Rockwell-Collins, Boeing and the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center. (Air Force photo by Kelly White) “I don’t know what it will say, but I can tell you it will be impressive,” the general said. “I know it will help the United States Air Force, the world’s most respected and powerful aerospace and cyber force, remain on top in its preeminent role. And whatever it is that the KC-135 is called on to do next, it will be because of everyone in this room and everybody that you represent. It’s an amazing legacy.”   2:34 pm Mon, October 17, 2016 The Tinker Take Off jilliancoleman Related Articles PHOTO: Energy aware November 7, 2016 AF takes initial steps to reduce training unrelated to primary missions November 7, 2016 The importance of Veterans Day November 7, 2016 My Account SUBSCRIBE MANAGE ACCOUNT PRIVACY POLICY SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT Recent Posts PHOTO: Energy aware AF takes initial steps to reduce training unrelated to primary missions The importance of Veterans Day 552nd ACW awarded Meritorious Unit Award Journal Record ABOUT CONTACT US FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS DOLAN BUSINESS BOOKS LAWYERS WEEKLY BOOKS Copyright © 2016 Tinker Take Off 101 N.

(AP) — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016. The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. WATCH: An Orbital ATK rocket was launched from NASA’s Wallops Island Flight Facility at 7:45 p.m. Monday. See the full launch in the video above. WAVY App Users: Click here to watch. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Lift off! @OrbitalATK's #Antares rocket launches to deliver science & supplies to @Space_Station. Keep watching: https://t.co/KX5g7zfYQe pic.twitter.com/OIbREmBJg1 — NASA (@NASA) October 17, 2016 Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. PHOTOS: NASA releases new images of Antares launch explosion This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA’s other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month’s rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Photos: Anteres rocket launches from Wallops NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 18.97%. Over the past four quarters, the company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 11.49%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors at Play for Microsoft  Microsoft reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter results with both the top and the bottom lines exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While increased investment in the cloud impacted margins, forex was surprisingly an offsetting factor. The company has a hybrid and hyperscale cloud spanning multiple jurisdictions, which makes it ideal for multinational companies and banks that have operations all over the world and are required to be in compliance with laws of the countries in which they operate. This is what Microsoft says has drawn some of the world’s largest banks to Azure. Microsoft also offers 33K cloud services, which helps it capture big customers like Boeing, Rolls-Royce and Schneider Electric. Another important customer it won in the fourth quarter was Facebook, which currently uses Office 365 for its 13K employees. For fiscal first-quarter of 2017, Microsoft expects Productivity & Business Process revenues of $6.4-6.6 billion, Intelligent Cloud revenues of $6.1-$6.3 billion and More Personal Computing revenues of around $8.7-9.0 billion. This amounts to total revenue between $21.2 billion and $21.9 billion. Microsoft expects COGS of $7.5-$7.6 billion, opex of $7.35-$7.45 billion and other income/expense of $0. 10 Stocks That Every Investor Should Own Management said that 2017 opex will be in a range of $31.1-$31.4 billion as investments in strategic growth opportunities continue. Non GAAP tax rate is expected to be 20% (+/-2%), depending on the variability of factors such as mix of services revenue versus licensing revenues, the geographic mix of revenues and the timing of equity. A higher mix of cloud revenues is also expected to increase the tax rate. Earnings Whispers Look Good for MSFT  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Microsoft will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 68 cents per share. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Zacks Rank: Microsoft has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. MICROSOFT CORP Price and EPS Surprise MICROSOFT CORP Price and EPS Surprise | MICROSOFT CORP Quote Other Tech Stocks to Consider You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank: Asure Software Inc (ASUR), with an Earnings ESP of +14.29% and Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Barracuda Networks Inc (CUDA), with an Earnings ESP of +25.00% and Zacks Rank #1. Barracuda Networks Inc. (NYSE:CUDA) a Big Buy after Earnings NetApp Inc. (NTAP), with an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Brown Norm Rothery Jason Heath Home Investing What Trump could mean for your portfolio What Trump could mean for your portfolio It makes for great TV. But for investors, the election is unnerving. Here’s how it could affect the markets   1 by Bryan Borzykowski October 17th, 2016 Online only.   1 Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email U.S. elections are known for their outsized hyperbole, but once the ballots are cast any lingering concerns about what it could mean for Canada-U.S. trade typically dissipate. But this is not your typical U.S. election. Canadian investors anxiously awaiting the outcome are smartly asking what it could mean for their portfolios. There is no shortage of bravado in the prognostications about what a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton win would mean for the markets. Mark Cuban, tech entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is convinced a Trump win would plunge stock markets and upend the bond market, should he find a way to follow through on a plan to renegotiate the U.S. national debt. Whereas Marc Faber, a respected market voice and author of the “Gloom, Boom & Doom Report”, cautions Clinton’s US$1 trillion tax hike “will destroy the whole world.” As divergent as these viewpoints are, the takeaway is clear: The outcome of the U.S. election will impact your money. Depending on who gets into the Oval Office, our economy, and our portfolios, could be in for a wild ride, even if it’s much less dramatic than the destruction of the world. If you’re looking for prognostications, there are hundreds—mostly in the event of a Republican win. Some have even the 13% run up in the S&P/TSX Composite this year is due in part to large U.S. investors positioning their portfolios in the event of a Trump win. Here’s a sample: Invest in companies that are sensitive to exchange rates like Dollarama and Baytex, because a Trump win would put pressure on the U.S. dollar and lift the loonie. Buy Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co., as they’d benefit from increased defence spending. Be on the lookout for The GEO Group, the private prison real estate investment trust, which would likely be an important cog in Trump’s pledge to round up and deport illegal immigrants. And lastly don’t forget Cemex, the Mexican cement company—because if they’re going to pay for the wall, then they aren’t going to buy American. For the political neophyte, reality TV has never been so captivating. For investors, it’s unnerving. If you’re rooting—or cringing—on the sidelines, Clinton is the better bet for your portfolio. Trump is such a divisive figure that markets around the world will likely experience more volatility under his watch, says Stephen Lingard, a portfolio manager with Franklin Templeton Solutions. The former First Lady, on the other hand, represents the status quo. Expect volatility if Trump beats the odds » Before you start altering your portfolio, here is a look at some of the larger ways a Clinton or Trump win would affect Canadian portfolios. Let’s start with Trump. Trump on trade Trump is trying to capitalize on a populist anti-trade sentiment in the U.S.  The Republican Presidential nominee’s feelings for the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the North American Free Trade Agreement is clear, repeatedly saying he would love to tear them up. At least when it comes to the TPP, Clinton and Trump appear to be somewhat on the same page. The Democratic Presidential Nominee agrees the TPP has its flaws, even though she once supported it, and now pledges to renegotiate the agreement if elected. Trade is the issue that will impact us the most, says Lingard. The North American economy has more than doubled in size since NAFTA was signed in 1994. According to Global Affairs Canada, “NAFTA has had an overwhelmingly positive effect on the Canadian economy,” and its increased trilateral trade within North American from $288 billion in 1993 to more than $1 trillion in 2015. If NAFTA changed in any significant way, Lingard says it could send Canada into a recession. Scrapping the TPP may not plunge Canada into recession since the agreement isn’t in force, but it could hobble future growth. In September, André Downs, chief economist at the department of Global Affairs Canada, said that the TPP would expand economic output by $4.3 billion thanks to increased access to hard-to-tap markets like Japan. Crossing the border could be harder under Trump » A Trump win would be positive for Canadian stocks Beyond trade, though, the differences between the two candidates are much more pronounced. Matthew Barasch a Canadian equity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, goes as far to say that Trump presidency would be good for Canada. Barasch zeros in on Trump’s tax cuts. “The broad cuts of the magnitude that Mr. Trump is calling for would most likely provide a big boost to the U.S. economy, at least for a period of time, and considering that the U.S. remains by far Canada’s largest trading partner, the flow through to Canadian growth would likely be fairly meaningful,” he writes in a note to clients. Are low interest rates doing more harm than good? If you are willing to put your portfolio before the environment then Trump is good news again. Barasch argues that Trump’s energy policy would be another positive for Canada. Trump is a major proponent of Keystone, a pipeline that would likely spur investment in the oil sands. Iran becomes another wildcard under a Trump presidency. “Should the nuclear agreement with Iran be jeopardized in any way and thus Iranian barrels be put at risk, the positive impact on oil prices could be significant,” writes Barasch in his note. On the flip side, Trump’s plan would reduce federal revenues by $9.5 trillion over 10 years, and that would require the government to massively reduce spending, which could negatively affect Americans, according to the Tax Policy Center. Will markets rally around Clinton? If Clinton gets elected, not much would change, says Bob Sewell, president and CEO of Oakville’s Bellwether Investment Management, though one policy that could impact Canadian health care companies is her desire to cap drug pricing. She’s also said that she’s against Keystone XL, but that she does want North America to invest more in clean energy, which our Prime Minister has expressed an interest in as well. Healthcare stocks might fall under Clinton, while energy companies and defence operations could see gains under Trump. It’s worth noting that overall, markets have done better under a Democrat president than a Republican one. On average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a 7% annualized return under a Democrat leader, while it’s only grown by 3% annualized under a Republican, according to Bespoke Investment Group. All that said, it’s likely that stocks will see more ups and downs as the election draws nearer, and especially if the race tightens even further, says Sewell. He’s getting more cautious and says that now’s not the time to be taking any sort of substantial risks. “Reduce your beta, reduce the volatility of your equity holdings and keep more cash in your pocket,” he says.   Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Share LinkedIn Email Advertisement Advertisement    Show comments Hide comments (1) One comment on “What Trump could mean for your portfolio” Too many grammatical or spelling errors Reply ↓ Don Dutton on October 17, 2016 at 4:09 pm Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

WikiLeaks just released the 9th set of intercepted emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign boss John Podesta. The current batch contains clues that suggest corporate control mechanisms that lead straight to President Obama. © AP Photo/ Twitter via AP WikiLeaks Releases 9th Batch of Clinton Campaign Chairman's EmailsAt least one email shows how those mechanisms ultimately affect United States policy abroad. As election day approaches, more and more evidence suggests Donald Trump is right in his accusations that a corporate oligarchy runs America. By now all the world knows about Obama administration’s funding and arming of so-called “moderates” inside Syria. It’s also widely accepted Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and Turkey have ended up assisting terrorists. What few people understand, however, is exactly how America’s foreign policy on Syria was and is formulated. Most people assume Barack Obama and his cabinet hashed out the now failed scheme to overthrow Assad and to install “somebody” or “something” in his place. The “somebody” is still ambiguous if anyone ever had a plan for after Assad. Just “who” formulated this “genius” plan to kill terror is made clearer by the communiqués of Podesta, who’s the former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, Counselor to President Barack Obama, and aspiring Hillary Clinton Chief of Staff. The email entitled; “Re: Here's where we are coming down on recommendations,” from August of 2014 to Vikram Singh, who’s Vice President for National Security and International Policy at American Progress (CAP), may finally tell us who runs American policy. “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power.” – Abraham Lincoln © AFP 2016/ JIM BOURG / POOL Hillary Clinton's Leaked Emails Show US Aware of Qatar, Saudi Arabia Supporting DaeshSimplification has never been my journalistic strong-suit, but characterizing the disease Washington politics has become easier than I ever imagined. Giving people like John Podesta too much power is a time proven method for screwing up. Ask anyone who ever knew disgraced President Richard Nixon. This new batch WikiLeaks cable pulls the curtain back on a land of political “Wizards of Oz” in America’s capital. When Podesta was characterized as a kind of “savior” for the Obama White House by Politico back in early 2014, somebody should have been watchful of the trouble to come. The magazine offered this about his “unofficial” position with Obama: “…his (Podesta’s) impact is being felt throughout the West Wing, where he’s helping the Obama White House, five years in, grow up.” Now we begin to see why hackers picked on John Podesta, if the gravity of his role spirals any further downward, he’ll be on the same book circuit as H. R. Haldeman. It is my believe Assange has found the “go between” in the middle of a controlled White House, a government Trump and others say is a sellout. Keep mental track of Podesta’s email recipient at the Center for American Progress, Vikram Singh, while I frame this a bit better. Some months before Politico framed Podesta as a “second coming” of a political advising god, The Nation ran a story about the secret donors behind CAP. Ken Silverstein, the author of the piece, received a lot of flack from CAP’s chief mouthpiece, Andrea Purse. © AP Photo/ Manu Brabo, File WikiLeaks Podesta Files: Hillary’s No-Fly Zone Means ‘Killing a Lot of Syrians’The article focuses on the unusual activities surrounding CAP’s donors/sponsors and foreign policy toward Turkey, for instance. Not many people realize it was John Podesta who founded the Center for American Progress, but the fact The Nation reportage implicated CAP for being a corporate control mechanism back in 2013 is a bombshell all its own. The Podesta efforts toward the Turkey-America business end of things now looms large. Silberstein pretty much had the goods on Podesta and the bigger corporate levers in Washington, but few noticed. No wonder Podesta is now taking pot shots at Julian Assange, he’s all done in Washington if worse comes to worse. Here’s another revelation from Silverstein: “A confidential CAP donor pitch I obtained describes the Business Alliance as “a channel for engagement with the corporate community” that provides “the opportunity to…collaborate on common interests. It offers three membership levels, with the perks to top donors ($100,000 and up) including private meetings with CAP experts and executives, round-table discussions with Hill and national leaders, and briefings on CAP reports relevant to your unique interests.” The Nation unknowingly discovered a way for Donald Trump to fend off allegations he and Russia’s Vladimir Putin are in cahoots, for Silverstein uncovered the fact sister think tanks The Atlantic Council took donations from Kazakhstan and Nursultan Nazarbayev! I doubt you find that tidbit in the New York Times tomorrow, though. © AFP 2016/ Jim Watson Obama’s Legacy: US Strategy of Chaos Got Out of ControlAccording to Silverstein’s investigations, the CAP is propped up by donations from the likes of Comcast, Walmart, General Motors, Pacific Gas and Electric, General Electric, Boeing, and Lockheed. As a potent note here, it’s probably no coincidence Zack’s just announced in June a Lockheed helicopter deal for $3.5 billion for the TUHP-Turkish Utility Helicopter Program, or that Boeing and Turkish Airlines just inked a new deal. If my suspicions are right, lots of deals will be finalized before Obama leaves office. What about the Syria-Podesta-CAP-Obama connection, you ask? Well, besides the fact the chief Obama think tank man is sending Singh at CAP containing vital intel foreign nationals may be interested in, via gmail  (Ouch!), this is about Barack Obama forging policies for America almost perfectly aligned with an NGO’s recommendations. The Podesta-Singh mail exchange seems to be a draft copy of Syria/ISIL policy Obama ended up using. CAP recommended five steps to advance the objectives of the United States. The steps were fairly detailed but mirror US actions after the date of the email. After that, the communiqué also reveals the level of failure in these CAP recommendations, as well as Obama, Podesta, and Hillary Clinton foreknowledge they knew about Saudi Arabia and other Gulf entities: “One area in which these countries should take more action is cracking down on private financing that flows from some Gulf countries to terrorist groups such as ISIS—and the United States should increase its Treasury and Justice Department efforts to cut the financial links between the Gulf and extremist groups such as ISIS.” As we can see now, no valid effort was made to curtail the monies and arms flowing to Daesh (also known as ISIS/ISIL/IS/ Islamic State). Secondly, no sustained or real effort was ever made by CENTCOM to destroy Daesh oil revenues; it was Russia’s Ministry of Defense that first blasted terrorist black market oil tankers on YouTube. © REUTERS/ Leonhard Foeger Oil, Power and Daesh: World Leaders to Talk Libya Amid Security ConcernsThe cable in question also damns CAP for being the first to suggest to the US president the need to arm Assad’s opposition. Furthermore, it reveals the “think tank’s” erroneous strategic pondering by creating an armed force pinched in between two powerful combatants, the Syrian Army on one front, and Daesh on the other. This strategy alludes to military morons at CAP, and I am sure the “moderates” really appreciate being put in that cauldron today. Further “advisement” by CAP shows my point AND the reason Daesh still exists: “In the event that ISIS comes to pose a credible and direct threat to the United States, we should be prepared to undertake limited air strikes against ISIS targets inside Syria.” Clearly, these “geniuses” never played military strategy board games as kids, but the larger indications are far more damning. They speak of the refugees, the war, and these plans as if it is a game. As a writer, reading these calculating assessments reveals a disturbing fact about our leadership – their utter detachment from any conscience or accountability. Podesta, the CAP people, and ultimately Obama himself come off like bean-counters at a big bank, callous as hell over the human loss or misery. They even discuss altering Americas laws to suit their agenda: “While the threat to the United States does not yet appear to be imminent, the evolution of ISIS in Iraq and Syria may well require the United States to update the legal framework developed after the September 11th attacks to ensure any president has the authority to combat terrorist groups that threaten America with proper oversight from Congress and accountability to the American public.” © AFP 2016/ DON EMMERT New WikiLeaks Dump Reveals 1000s of Emails from Clinton Campaign Chair PodestaSo here is where we are, the American people have been asleep at the controls of a runaway policy train. The people behind the liberals in America (the Boeings let’s say) have begun steering the engine of America off the tracks. Podesta and his cohorts, whoever they are, have been given far too much power, and far too much leeway. Amazingly, and with the utmost irony, if it were not for Julian Assange and the people of WikiLeaks, we would know nothing of this catastrophic situation. And if Podesta could decide, America and the world would never have known. Think about this for a moment. Obama and other presidents are clearly not running our country; the money interests seem absolutely in control. This explains entirely the steamrolling money machine bent on Hillary for president. As demoralizing and horrid as this is, though, the situation is made worse by the fact we are almost at war with Russia, China, and the “East.” © REUTERS/ Mike Segar Trump Can Still Win US Presidential Election Amid WikiLeaks’ Clinton RevelationsFinally, in all the Podesta and Clinton emails, I have read there are plenty of references to the negative about opponents, Trump especially. One I found made light of how the Republicans put politics above even patriotism, but here’s the thing. I have yet to find one instance of humanity or patriotism in these people’s rhetoric or tone. Not one. There’s speak on “patriotism” in Palestine and elsewhere, but never in America. What I do consistently find is the proof individuals outside the White House running things, and I don’t find the people anywhere in the equation.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official position of Sputnik. ...

There is, as they say, a problem. But there’s no use telling Houston—by the time a distress message reaches home more than 30 million miles away, either the astronauts on board will be space dust or humanity will have become an interplanetary species. That’s the premise of National Geographic’s new series, Mars, which mixes documentary and speculation to tell the parallel stories of two groups: the fictional future explorers who will make that first journey, and the pioneers of today—scientists, astronauts, and strategists—who are blazing the trail. In the premier episode, for example, that white-knuckle landing scene is spliced with a look at Elon Musk’s SpaceX as engineers test a real retropropulsion landing system. Every piece of tech in the show was designed to accurately reflect the current scientific vision of how we’ll get to Mars—and to avoid the gaffes that have undermined recent films and invited the wrath of astrophysicist/space ombudsman Neil deGrasse Tyson. As executive producer Ron Howard puts it, “It’s not sci-fi!” (Indeed, President Obama has outlined a vision to send humans into Mars’ orbit by the mid-2030s.) Here’s how Mars envisions our red future. The Crew The Mission The six astronauts in Mars travel to their new home in a rocket called the Daedalus, and their ship is based on science that’s more than simply plausible—it’s coming, and fast. “This is technology that will probably be tested in the next five years,” executive producer Justin Wilkes says. The spacecraft is heavily inspired by SpaceX, but it also borrows design elements from NASA, Boeing, and even the Russian space program. “Other films say ‘Let’s make it look cool,’” production designer Sophie Becher says. “We asked, ‘How’s this going to function? Where are they going to use the bathroom?’” Slide: 1 / of 7 .

Launch While it’s not shown in the series, Daedalus launches from low Earth orbit. Landing In the show, Daedalus lands on the planet directly rather than from an orbital docking station, using a protective aeroshell to absorb the friction of reentry and help the craft decelerate without, y’know, burning up. Supersonic retropropulsion further slows and stabilizes the ship. In the final seconds, legs deploy for greater stability.

How much recycling of water and oxygen can these systems handle before they have reliability issues?” Quarters Astronaut and show adviser Mae Jemison flagged the ship bunks’ original open-air design: “You guys are looking at me while I’m sleeping?” Jemison says. “It would drive me crazy.” So the beds have privacy screens. OLYMPUS TOWN | Population: 35 Living Habs: 24 Energy source: Low-output Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator, solar arrays, and a nuclear reactorCourtesy of Framestore The Colony Emerging director Everardo Gout (Days of Grace) shot the Mars colony in Budapest and Morocco, where the topography is so similar to the Red Planet’s that NASA has tested rovers there. Producers picked a specific location on Mars to replicate: the foothills of Olympus Mons, the planet’s tallest mountain, where underground lava tubes provide shelter and protection from cosmic radiation. (Scientists are studying Mars-like isolation in the lava tubes of Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii.) The first Mars settlers would construct a bare-bones underground habitat in the tubes; over time, future missions would deliver additional materials, and the colony would expand, module by module. Once the original six welcome more inhabitants, this is how they would live. Slide: 1 / of 6 .

Lava Tubes Subterranean lava tubes may offer the greatest radiation protection, so the show’s fictional settlers will go underground. “It’s like Homo sapiens have returned to our roots as cave dwellers,” ­Wilkes says. “Here we are on a new planet, and we’re huddling in a cave around a pro­verbial fire.” Modular Housing Building on uneven ground in unpredictable conditions without bulldozers and cranes, settlers will have to improvise. The dwelling design is inspired by Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic domes: lightweight, inflatable modular structures that can be connected by flexible concertina-­style corridors. Pieces of Home After consulting with Mae Jemison, who took a brightly hued Swatch watch and some colorful earrings into space, Becher added color to the living area. “No one wants to live in a place that’s completely alien,” Becher says. To make Mars more cozy—and less Star Trek—she spruced up Olympus Town with warm tones and family mementos. Ask an Astronaut How show adviser Mae Jemison kept Mars real. Mae Jemison knows what it’s like to do brave work in dire conditions: She was a Peace Corps medical officer in Liberia and Sierra Leone. She’s also a former astronaut who became the first African American woman in space in 1992, aboard the Endeavour. Today she runs the 100 Year Starship project to support long-term interest in space exploration, and she was an adviser for Mars. It’s a good fit: She has some (very) strong opinions about how Hollywood gets space wrong. What type of astronaut would take such a huge risk to go so very far away? The world has changed because of going to the moon. People think it’s just the astronauts going up into space, but it’s the technology: Magnetic resonance imaging, miniaturization, GPS—we couldn’t have Pokémon Go without it! It’s about the mission and what we’re going to gain from it. These are pioneering days. Why did you start the 100 Year Starship program? Our tagline is “Space isn’t just for billionaires and astronauts.” It’s a place for everyone to participate. But we’re in this time period where our fantasyand our virtual reality havein some ways superseded what we do in reality. Our reality doesn’t seem as thrilling. So how do we include more people and make it more thrilling? How did you advise the producers and the writers for Mars? I wanted to help support the drama and the suspense with plausible operational and physiological activities: What would happen, logistically, in a particular circumstance? So you aren’t saying “Oh, come on now!” What do most movies get wrong about astronauts? When actors play astronauts, they often take them off the deep end. Astronauts are driven, but they’re not crazy. They’re passionate but prac­tical, energetic but measured, decisive but willing tocompromise. What else drives you crazy? When I go to the movies, I can suspend disbelief, as long as it’s not egregious. But would people shout when things go to hell? No. You train so much on so many contingencies, you know how to do things. Think about it: If you’re all screaming on top of each other, you’re not going to be able to work it through. If you can’t hear, that’s a surefire way to get dead. What else? Interstellar did incredible work around relativistic physics, but they couldn’t have given a damn about biology. On Earth, you can’t grow grain and foodstuffs—but you’re driving through lush countryside with trees? You can’t figure out what else to eat? And? When you resort to stuff that physically could not happen. Not like warp drive, but more that somebody didn’t take the time to think this through—like putting a hole in the glove in The Martian. Or my ship is all busted up, so my first reaction is to beat on all the control panels and the switches? What the hell? If I’m already about to die, I’d hit myself in the face before I’d beat on the panels! This article appears in our special November issue, guest-edited by President Barack Obama. Subscribe now.

The benchmark CAC 40 index is currently down 25 points or 0.55 percent at 4,446 in late opening deals after gaining as much as 1.5 percent in the previous session. Airbus shares are little changed. Chief Executive Fabrice Bregier said in a German newspaper Welt daily interview that the aerospace giant aims to overtake its rival Boeing co (BA) in terms of annual plane deliveries by 2020. Energy major Total SA is declining more than 1 percent as oil prices edged lower in European trade on a firmer dollar as well as data showing a rising rig count in the United States. Peugeot is gaining half a percent on a report that the automaker plans to cut more than 2,000 jobs in France next year. In economic releases, a Eurostat report released today showed that Eurozone inflation accelerated as estimated in September to the highest level since late 2014. Inflation rose to 0.4 percent from 0.2 percent in August, matching the preliminary estimate published on September 30. Nonetheless, headline inflation has been below the European Central Bank's target of 'below, but close to 2 percent' since early 2013. Elsewhere, Asian stocks recovered from early losses to end mixed today, while U.S. stock futures indicate a lower open. Oil prices dipped slightly in European trade and London copper prices held above a one-month low, while gold traded flat to slightly higher to hover near four-month lows. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues Indian Markets Closed For Public Holiday Asian Markets Mostly Lower Thai Bourse Draws Flat Lead For Monday Indonesia Shares May Find Traction On Monday Hong Kong Shares May Find Support On Monday China Bourse May Flirt With 3,200-Point Level Little Movement Expected For Taiwan Bourse Singapore Market May See Support At 2,800 Points Malaysia Stock Market To Remain Rangebound South Korea Shares May Be Stuck In Neutral Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower As Trump Rally Fizzles Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        118 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

Source: US Air Force The US Air Force (USAF) briefed six original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on its UH-1N Huey Replacement Program during an industry day at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Ohio, it was disclosed on 14 October. AgustaWestland, Airbus, Bell Helicopter, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and Sikorsky, were each briefed during the event in late September, as were a number of sub-contractors including FLIR Systems, GE Aviation, L-3 Communications, Orbital ATK, and Rockwell Collins. The industry day follows the release on 9 September of a Request for Information (RfI) for the procurement of up to 84 new helicopters to replace the USAF's ageing Bell UH-1N 'Huey' platforms. The industry day briefing schedule posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website did not disclose potential platform offerings, but given the RfI requirement that they be "of the same configuration" as the UH-1N it is possible to identify some likely candidates. Bell Helicopter could offer to refurbish and upgrade the USAF's UH-1Ns as the OEM, or could offer the 412 (an improved variant of the 212, on which the UH-1N is based), or even the UH-1Y Venom as fielded by the US Marine Corps. Airbus has a number of potentially suitable offerings in its portfolio, chief of which would be the EC145 flown by the US Army as the UH-72A Lakota, or the latest-variant H145 / H145M. AgustaWestland has previously offered its AW139 for the predecessor Common Vertical Lift Support Platform (CVLSP) programme, and could do so again for this latest effort, while Sikorsky will no doubt offer its ubiquitous UH-60 Black Hawk (the USAF's preferred choice before the requirement was opened up to competition). Boeing's and Northrop Grumman's interest in the programme is harder to gauge, given that the former does not have a helicopter in its portfolio in the same configuration as the UH-1N, and the latter has no manned helicopter at all.

Home Fe columnist MSMEs eye defence windfall, but here’s what they must do first MSMEs eye defence windfall, but here’s what they must do first It is imperative for Indian MSMEs to integrate themselves into the global supply chain of defence majors New Delhi | Published: October 17, 2016 6:15 AM The Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP), announced recently, finally delivers Indian MSMEs, a growth opportunity they have long been waiting for. The advantages that MSMEs will leverage are their innovative capabilities in niche manufacturing, greater flexibility, lower overhead costs and their ability to learn and absorb new technologies quickly. MSME sector already contributes a significant 38% to the nation’s GDP and 40% and 45% to the overall exports and manufacturing output, respectively. It is engaged in the manufacturing of over 6,000 products ranging from traditional to hi-tech items. However, till now the MSMEs contribution in defence sector was limited to just 9%. According to figures shared by the defence minister, Manohar Parrikar, last year procurement from MSMEs reached 9%, and in the current year, it will reach 15%. Volumes are also set to increase from R40,000 crore in 2014, to R52,000 crore in the current year. There are nearly 6,000 MSMEs across the country supplying components and sub-assemblies to the DPSUs, ordnance factories, DRDO and private industries. As per latest industry reports, India’s defence budget accounted for nearly 17.2% of the total central government expenditure, at R19.78 lakh crore (about $294.36 billion). In terms of defence spends as a percentage of the GDP, India stands fifth globally. Nearly 60% of the defence need is met through imports putting a huge dent on India’s fiscal health. Therefore, boosting ‘Make in India’ initiative via MSMEs and integrating this sector with global supply chain can be a panacea for managing current account deficit, when oil prices rise again. As a sequel to 100% FDI in defence production sector, several foreign majors have already made their entry into India. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Saab, Bell Helicopter, Rolls Royce, Northrop Gruman, Rolta, BAE Systems, Dassault, Honeywell, Thales and Finmeccanica are some of the big foreign players actively looking at Indian market. These companies will have to depend on MSMEs to meet their offset obligation for a host of purposes: equipment, spares, IT-related services and other techno-commercial services. The government has initiated host of measures for simplification of procedures to policy change for boosting manufacturing in defence sector based on priority of MSMEs Sector, these include:  Allowing 100% FDI in defence sector and announcement of DPP. The new DPP encourages the MSMEs associated with the industry with funding up to 90% of their project’s prototype development cost. Adding another safeguard, the MoD has also stated that it will reimburse the remaining 10% prototype development cost, if the request for proposal (RFP) is not called within a stipulated timeframe after the successful test of prototypes. Outsourcing and Vendor Development Guidelines for DPSUs and OFBs have been formulated and circulated to them. The guidelines also include vendor development for import substitution. The Exchange Rate Variation (ERV) protection has been allowed on foreign exchange component to all Indian companies including private companies in all categories of capital acquisitions. The anomalies in excise duty/custom duty have been removed. Now, Indian industries (public and private) are subjected to the same kind of excise and custom duty levies. The defence products list for the purpose of issuing Industrial Licences (ILs) under IDR Act has been revised and most of the components, parts, sub-systems, testing equipment, and production equipment have been removed from the list. The initial validity of the IL granted under the IDR Act has been increased from 7 years to 15 years with a provision to further extend it by 3 years. The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the issue of no-objection certificate (NOC) for export of military stores has been revised wherein; end-user certificate (EUC) to be countersigned/stamped by the government authorities has been done away with for the export of parts, components, sub-systems, etc. With these policy shifts taking place, MSMEs can complement large defence hardware manufacturing industries as ancillary units in time to come. In the case of indigenous manufacture of defence hardware, a substantial portion of the work can be transferred to the MSMEs by the DPSUs and OEMs. They can now act as strategic partners with DPSUs, foreign defence manufacturers and the larger corporates. The first steps have to come from MSME-based industries followed by a government push. MSMEs need to understand OEM expectations in terms of quality and supply commitments which require them to invest in technology, research and manpower training in anticipation of a contract. The government and private players have acknowledged the fact that India needs to increase self-reliance in defence production. Today, it is imperative for Indian companies, especially MSMEs, to integrate themselves to global supply chains of national and international defence majors, to reduce dependence on foreign supplies.

(AP) — One of NASA’s main delivery companies made a triumphant comeback seen up and down the East Coast Monday night, launching its first space station shipment from Virginia since a rocket explosion two years ago. The Orbital ATK Antares rocket lifts off from the the NASA Wallops Island flight facility in Wallops Island, Va., Monday, Oct. 17, 2016. The rocket is carrying supplies to the International Space Station. (AP Photo/Steve Helber) It was the first flight of Orbital ATK’s unmanned Antares rocket since the Oct. 28, 2014, blast that wrecked the pad and destroyed everything on the space station supply run. The launch provided a show for sky gazers along much of the East Coast. Reports poured in via Twitter from observers in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and even Raleigh, North Carolina. For Antares’ long-awaited return, the pad underwent a $15 million restoration, and the rocket got new Russian engines to replace the vintage ones from a half-century earlier. As the Antares streaked through the night sky from NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, it appeared as though all the work had paid off. Launch controllers applauded when the supply ship reached orbit and victory was declared. WATCH: An Orbital ATK rocket was launched from NASA’s Wallops Island Flight Facility at 7:45 p.m. Monday. See the full launch in the video above. WAVY App Users: Click here to watch. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden described the launch as “magnificent” and personally thanked the Orbital ATK team. “It’s been a very difficult two years, and I can’t imagine what those of you in the Orbital team went through. I can’t imagine how long you were holding your breath tonight,” Bolden told the launch control crowd. “But you know, we made it and that’s what’s all important.” Lift off! @OrbitalATK's #Antares rocket launches to deliver science & supplies to @Space_Station. Keep watching: https://t.co/KX5g7zfYQe pic.twitter.com/OIbREmBJg1 — NASA (@NASA) October 17, 2016 Getting a lift from the Antares was Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of food, equipment and research, including some experiments to study flames in space and the robotic toy ball Sphero, part of an educational effort. The Cygnus — named after the swan constellation — will have to hang around in orbit until Sunday before delivering the goods. That’s because three astronauts are awaiting launch from Kazakhstan on Wednesday, which would get them to the space station on Friday. NASA wants the new crew to settle in before the Cygnus pulls up. PHOTOS: NASA releases new images of Antares launch explosion This will be the sixth Cygnus to arrive at the orbiting outpost since 2013. While the Antares was being redesigned, Orbital ATK made good on two deliveries using another company’s rockets flying from Cape Canaveral. NASA’s other commercial shipper, SpaceX, has made nine station deliveries since 2012, but is currently grounded, pending an investigation into last month’s rocket explosion during prelaunch testing at Cape Canaveral. Given the riskiness of space flight, Orbital ATK officials expressed nervousness before the launch, but said they had full confidence in the rocket. Photos: Anteres rocket launches from Wallops NASA has been relying on Orbital ATK and SpaceX to keep the space station stocked ever since the shuttles retired in 2011. Next up will be private flights for the station crews, as the space agency works on getting astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. SpaceX and Boeing are building capsules to carry U.S. astronauts to the 250-mile-high station; those launches are expected in the next couple of years. Until then, NASA will keep flying its astronauts on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. The space station is currently home to an American, a Russian and a third astronaut from Japan. They will be joined by an American and two Russians. Orbital ATK weathered brief hurricane delays over the past 1½ weeks, then a bad cable at the pad on Sunday bumped the launch by a day.

Martin passed away, after a long illness, at Central Washington Hospital, on July 20, 2016, at age 93. He was born June 11, 1923, in Kansas City, MO, to Charles Peyton Martin II and Anna Lee Hogan Martin. When he was very young, his family moved to Nebraska, where he graduated from North High School in Omaha, in 1941. Before going into military service, Charles worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at Langley Field, VA, as a model maker. During this time, he took flying lessons, which led to his joining the Army Air Corps and serving as a B-25 pilot throughout the Pacific during World War II. In 1947, he married Mildred Louise Cooper, daughter of Van Buren Cooper and Amanda DeBord Cooper of Douglas, GA. In March 2016, Charles and Mildred celebrated their 69th wedding anniversary. Upon his return to the United States after the war, he earned degrees in Mechanical, Aeronautical, and Nuclear Engineering. He was a graduate of the University of Kentucky and the Oak Ridge School of Reactor Technology. He worked at The Boeing Company almost 30 years, applying his aptitude for analysis, long range planning, and marketing. One of his most successful assignments happened during the race to the moon, 1967-1969. During this time, he moved his family to Washington, DC, where he headed a group of Boeing scientists and engineers engaged in the Apollo program. Boeing’s group was responsible for the Technical Integration and Evaluation of each Apollo flight, making sure all possible problems had been identified and solved prior to launch. His love of aeronautics continued throughout his life. During the 1970s and 1980s, he built Free Flight Model airplanes and in 1982, he was a member of the Model Airplane Team at the World Championship Contest in Burgos, Spain. This American team came home with the first place trophy. Charlie always loved to fly and enjoyed owning and flying a Cessna 206 for several years. It is interesting to note that Charlie died on the 47th anniversary of man’s first landing on the moon on July 20, 1969. Charles is survived by his wife, Mildred Louise; his sons: Charles Keith (Carol Anway) Martin and Eric Philip (Denise) Martin; his grandsons: Philip Joshua Martin and Matthew Robert Martin of Spokane, WA; and granddaughter, Lilian Amanda Anway Martin of North Bend, WA.

The orders, which are effective immediately in Canada and at noon EDT October 15 in the U.S., say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the U.S. ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the United States. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. Samsung has a website at http://www.samsung.com/us/note7recall/ and a phone number, 1-844-365-6197, for customers with questions. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

The Antares, now outfitted with a pair of Russian-made engines, is scheduled to blast off at 7:40 p.m. EDT (2340 GMT) from a repaired launch pad on Wallops Island, Virginia. Perched on top of the rocket is a Cygnus cargo ship loaded with 5,290 pounds (2,400 kg) of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments for the space station, a $100 billion laboratory in orbit about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. "We've missed these guys," Joel Montalbano, NASA's deputy station manager, told reporters during a prelaunch press conference on Saturday, referring to the Antares team. The mission became more crucial for the U.S. space agency after a Sept. 1 accident destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX and a $200 million Israeli communications satellite. The accident, which occurred while the rocket was being fueled for a routine prelaunch test, has temporarily grounded SpaceX, the only company apart from Orbital currently contracted by NASA to fly cargo to the space station. Private contractors for the cargo runs became necessary following the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011. With SpaceX sidelined, NASA added extra food, clothing, laptop computers and spacesuit parts to the Cygnus cargo list, Montalbano said. The last launch of an Antares rocket, on Oct. 28, 2014, ended in disaster a few seconds after liftoff. After the accident, Orbital sped up plans to replace the rocket's Soviet-era engines with the new Russian-made motors. During the downtime, Orbital bought rides for two Cygnus cargo ships aboard Atlas rockets, built and flown by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Orbital conducted a 30-second engine test firing of the Antares at the Virginia launch pad on May 31. "We're always nervous, but we wouldn't have a rocket out there if we weren't confident we were ready to go," Orbital vice president Mike Pinkston told reporters on Saturday. Orbital is counting on a smooth Antares launch to help attract other customers for the rocket besides NASA. The booster, designed to put up to about 17,000 pounds (8,000 kg) into orbit close to Earth, flew four times successfully before the 2014 failure.

Subscribe Information that drives Canadian industry News Features Insights Technology Centre Events Plant Expo Upcoming Events More Digital Edition Plant West E-newsletter Salary Calculator Contacts Advertise US, Canada ban Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from airliners Those who try to evade the US ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution and fines October 17, 2016 by CP Staff Topics General Industries Electronics Manufacturing Tags Galaxy Note 7 manufacturing Samsung Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones Transport Canada US Department of Transportation WASHINGTON — Passengers and flight crews will be banned from bringing Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on airline flights under emergency orders issued Oct. 14 by both Transport Canada and the US Department of Transportation in response to reports of the phones catching fire. The orders say the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from Canada and the United States or within either country. The phones also can’t be shipped as air cargo. Passengers with the phones will not be allowed to board planes. And those who try to evade the US ban by packing the phones in checked luggage may be subject to criminal prosecution in addition to fines. Transport officials in both countries warned that carrying the phones in checked luggage increases the potential danger to the flight. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones, citing a battery manufacturing error. The South Korean company discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the US. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Transport Canada and the US Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” said US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. At least three US airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can’t be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

SAN FRANCISCO, October 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- The globalflight simulators marketis expected to reach USD 5.62 billion by 2024, according to a new report by Grand View Research, Inc. Increasing adoption of FFS owing to high fidelity and reliability is expected to provide adequate growth prospects over the coming years. Customers also opt for FTDs on account of their low operational costs, modular approach, real-time aerodynamic flight model, and remote configuration as well as management. The industry is expected to witness moderate growth over the forecast period owing to the aforementioned factors. (Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150105/723757 ) The need to effectively replicate real flying training with the usage of motion and visual systems has resulted in the introduction of sophisticated simulators in the market. Increase in government spending and growing security concerns particularly in the military sector is anticipated to escalate product demand significantly. The rising concerns over pilot training cost along with fluctuating fuel prices may further drive demand for flight simulators over the next eight years. Browse full research report with TOC on "Flight Simulator Market Analysis By Product (Full Flight Simulator (FFS), Fixed Flight Training Devices (FTD)), By Application (Military & Defense, Civil), By Service And Segment Forecasts To 2024" at: http://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/the-global-flight-simulator-market Further key findings from the report suggest: The FFS product segment accounted for over 90% of the overall revenue in 2015 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 4% from 2016 to 2024. This growth is owing to features that provide motion, sound, visuals, and all other aircraft operations that create a realistic flight training environment. The demand in civil application segment is primarily due to the rising air traffic coupled with the growing emphasis on the passenger as well as pilot safety. Governments in several countries have enforced strict regulations regarding the use and significance of simulation training. The services segment is anticipated to grow at a CAGR exceeding 3.0% over the forecast period. This is primarily attributed to the rise in number of simulator installation by international airways. Europe accounted for more than 30% of the overall market share in 2015 and is expected to exhibit a modest growth over the next eight years on account of the elevating enforcement of regulations pertaining to pilot training and passenger safety. The Asia Pacific flight simulators market is estimated to exhibit a substantial growth over the forecast period in light of the growing aviation industry, resulting in the increasing demand for flight simulators. The Middle East & Africa is also projected to showcase a substantial demand of over 4%, which is primarily be attributed to the presence of carriers including Emirates, Etihad Airways, and Qatar that are investing heavily in this industry. Prominent industry players include CAE, Boeing, L-3 Link Simulation & Training, Lockheed Martin, Rockwell Collins, Thales and SaaB. Industry participants emphasize on joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions in order to acquire greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing and distribution expertise.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 17 October 2016 | MYT 3:11 PM China aluminium makers to target auto, aerospace in global push MELBOURNE: China's giant aluminium makers are pushing into the global automotive and aerospace markets, with industry sources expecting their presence to heat up competition and possibly spark a buying spree for Western metals companies. China's top aluminium companies are venturing into the more lucrative parts of the global value chain, on course to seize market share from the likes of Alcoa and Constellium, as they look to buy into foreign firms to boost their technical know-how and expand their reach. The chief executive of Novelis Inc, the world's largest maker of rolled aluminium products, said last week he expected competition with Chinese producers to be "very fierce" over the next five to 10 years in the high-value-added sectors of aerospace and engineering - which so far have been dominated by European and US manufacturers. "Certainly (Chinese aluminium makers) will be able to produce high quality products as well," Steve Fisher told the Reuters Commodity Summit in Seoul. Zhongwang USA LLC, backed by Chinese aluminium magnate Liu Zhongtian, said in late August it would buy high precision aluminium product maker Aleris Corp in a deal worth US$2.3 billion, marking the biggest entry by a Chinese company into the US aluminium industry. The deal for Aleris, a supplier to the US defence industry, has yet to be approved by US regulators. "If Aleris is acquired by the Chinese, it would be logical to think that there would be more competition within the higher value-added sectors such as aerospace and automotive. That's where the better margins are," said analyst Robin Bhar of Societe Generale in London. "(But) Aleris is quite a significant supplier to the US military, so it's by no means a done deal."  Shares in Amsterdam-headquartered aluminium product maker Constellium jumped after the announcement, reflecting bets that it could be next. Constellium did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. "There will be more announcements of purchases by Chinese companies of foreign firms in the next 18 months and continued consolidation globally," said Charlie Durant of consultancy CRU in London. "It will enable Chinese producers to better utilise their equipment in China, as well as obviously getting the access to markets around the world."  Alcoa is spinning out its precision manufacturing business into a company to be named Arconic, which industry sources said could be another potential target. Arconic expects to grow its automotive sheet revenue around sixfold, to US$1.3 billion in 2018 from US$229 million in 2013. It has already signed US$10 billion with customers including Boeing and Airbus. An Alcoa spokesperson declined to comment. "Zhongwang have been openly pursuing a downstream focus for years, but they aren't the only ones with capital, a healthy balance sheet and an appetite to expand downstream," said Paul Adkins, managing director of Beijing-based consultancy AZ China. Adkins pointed to China's Hongqaio Group and Shandong Nanshan Aluminium as potential bidders. Hongqaio Group declined to comment. Nanshan's board secretary said the company hasn't received any information about possible mergers from the board. Shandong Nanshan said in July it aims to tap growth in new energy vehicles to become a top automotive and a major aerospace materials supplier as it strives to meet international certification standards. - Reuters Tags / Keywords: Corporate News You May Be Interested Indian banks receive US$30bil in deposits Malaysian palm oil/Vegoils: Market factors to watch Monday Nov 14 'Trump Thump' whacks bond market for $1 trillion loss Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Airbus A350-900 is the 10,000th Airbus: New plane delivered to Singapore Airlines The 10,000th Airbus, an A350-900, has been delivered to Singapore Airlines. Photo: Airbus The "10,000th" logo on the Singapore Airlines Airbus A350-900. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Airbus celebrated the delivery of its 10,000 aircraft on Friday, with Singapore Airlines receiving a new A350-900 at a special ceremony. The aircraft is the sixth A350 delivered to Singapore Airlines, which has ordered a total of 67 of the cutting-edge new planes. Emblazoned with a special "10,000th Airbus" logo, the plane will be used to launch the airline's new Singapore to San Francisco direct route later this month. The long-haul route's flying time will vary between 14 hours and 35 minutes, and an epic 17 hours and 45 minutes, depending on direction and winds. That will be the airline's longest route until it receives a new variant of the A350-900, the A350-900ULR (Ultra Long Range), which will allow it to resume direct flights from Singapore to New York. Once that occurs, Singapore Airlines will regain the title for the world's longest flight route. Emirates currently flies the world's longest route – Dubai to Auckland direct. The ULR version of the A350 will be able to fly for up to 19 hours non-stop. Singapore Airlines placed its first order with Airbus in 1979 and became the launch customer for the world's largest passenger aircraft, the A380 super jumbo, in 2005. The first route for that plane was from Singapore to Sydney. Despite initial success, demand for the A380 has waned in recent years as airlines move on to new aircraft made of lightweight materials that deliver savings on fuel, such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the A350. The A350 uses a combination of materials, including plastic reinforced by carbon fibre, along with titanium and aluminium alloys. More than 70 per cent of the aircraft is made of lightweight materials. The first ever Airbus plane, the A300B2, was delivered to Air France in 1974. In the 1980s the company launched the hugely successful A320, its first single-aisle plane. Airbus is reportedly on track to deliver 650 aircraft this year but has a backlog of 6700 on order – a number it says it will take 10 years to deliver at current production rates.

China's top aluminium companies are venturing into the more lucrative parts of the global value chain, on course to seize market share from the likes of Alcoa and Constellium , as they look to buy into foreign firms to boost their technical know-how and expand their reach. The chief executive of Novelis Inc, the world's largest maker of rolled aluminium products, said last week he expected competition with Chinese producers to be "very fierce" over the next five to 10 years in the high-value-added sectors of aerospace and engineering - which so far have been dominated by European and U.S. manufacturers. "Certainly (Chinese aluminium makers) will be able to produce high quality products as well," Steve Fisher told the Reuters Commodity Summit in Seoul. Zhongwang USA LLC, backed by Chinese aluminium magnate Liu Zhongtian, said in late August it would buy high precision aluminium product maker Aleris Corp in a deal worth $2.3 billion, marking the biggest entry by a Chinese company into the U.S. aluminium industry. The deal for Aleris has yet to be approved by U.S. regulators. "If Aleris is acquired by the Chinese, it would be logical to think that there would be more competition within the higher value-added sectors such as aerospace and automotive. That's where the better margins are," said analyst Robin Bhar of Societe Generale in London. Shares of Amsterdam-headquartered aluminium product maker Constellium jumped after the announcement, reflecting bets that it could be next. Constellium did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. "There will be more announcements of purchases by Chinese companies of foreign firms in the next 18 months and continued consolidation globally," said Charlie Durant of consultancy CRU in London. "It will enable Chinese producers to better utilize their equipment in China, as well as obviously getting the access to markets around the world." Alcoa is spinning out its precision manufacturing business into a company to be named Arconic, which industry sources said could be another potential target. Arconic expects to grow its automotive sheet revenue around sixfold, to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $229 million in 2013. It has already signed $10 billion with customers including Boeing and Airbus. An Alcoa spokesperson declined to comment. "Zhongwang have been openly pursuing a downstream focus for years, but they aren't the only ones with capital, a healthy balance sheet and an appetite to expand downstream," said Paul Adkins, managing director of Beijing-based consultancy AZ China. Adkins pointed to China's Hongqaio Group and Shandong Nanshan Aluminium as potential bidders. Hongqaio Group declined to comment. Nanshan's board secretary said the company hasn't received any information about possible mergers from the board. Shandong Nanshan said in July it aims to tap growth in new energy vehicles to become a top automotive and a major aerospace materials supplier as it strives to meet international certification standards.

China’s top aluminium companies are venturing into the more lucrative parts of the global value chain, on course to seize market share from the likes of Alcoa and Constellium , as they look to buy into foreign firms to boost their technical know-how and expand their reach. The chief executive of Novelis Inc, the world’s largest maker of rolled aluminium products, said last week he expected competition with Chinese producers to be “very fierce” over the next five to 10 years in the high-value-added sectors of aerospace and engineering – which so far have been dominated by European and U.S. manufacturers. “Certainly (Chinese aluminium makers) will be able to produce high quality products as well,” Steve Fisher told the Reuters Commodity Summit in Seoul. Zhongwang USA LLC, backed by Chinese aluminium magnate Liu Zhongtian, said in late August it would buy high precision aluminium product maker Aleris Corp in a deal worth $2.3 billion, marking the biggest entry by a Chinese company into the U.S. aluminium industry. The deal for Aleris, a supplier to the U.S. defence industry, has yet to be approved by U.S. regulators. “If Aleris is acquired by the Chinese, it would be logical to think that there would be more competition within the higher value-added sectors such as aerospace and automotive. That’s where the better margins are,” said analyst Robin Bhar of Societe Generale in London. “(But) Aleris is quite a significant supplier to the U.S. military, so it’s by no means a done deal.” Shares of Amsterdam-headquartered aluminium product maker Constellium jumped after the announcement, reflecting bets that it could be next. Constellium did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment. “There will be more announcements of purchases by Chinese companies of foreign firms in the next 18 months and continued consolidation globally,” said Charlie Durant of consultancy CRU in London. “It will enable Chinese producers to better utilize their equipment in China, as well as obviously getting the access to markets around the world.” Alcoa is spinning out its precision manufacturing business into a company to be named Arconic, which industry sources said could be another potential target. Arconic expects to grow its automotive sheet revenue around sixfold, to $1.3 billion in 2018 from $229 million in 2013. It has already signed $10 billion with customers including Boeing and Airbus. An Alcoa spokesperson declined to comment. “Zhongwang have been openly pursuing a downstream focus for years, but they aren’t the only ones with capital, a healthy balance sheet and an appetite to expand downstream,” said Paul Adkins, managing director of Beijing-based consultancy AZ China. Adkins pointed to China’s Hongqaio Group and Shandong Nanshan Aluminium as potential bidders. Hongqaio Group declined to comment. Nanshan’s board secretary said the company hasn’t received any information about possible mergers from the board. Shandong Nanshan said in July it aims to tap growth in new energy vehicles to become a top automotive and a major aerospace materials supplier as it strives to meet international certification standards.

Read more Airlines begin stocking fire bags to store phones inflight Last updated 08:41, October 17 2016 ITN The US Department of Transport has banned all Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from flights to or from the US. Reporting by Daniel O'Donnell. Some airlines are taking extra steps to prevent a disaster in case a passenger's device powered by a lithium ion battery catches fire during flight. At least three US airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a mobile phone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. The issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier in October. CRUSHADER/REDDIT Customers have reported Samsung Galaxy Note 7s bursting into flames. Aviation authorities around the world have taken steps to warn passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. READ MORE: * Air NZ bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from all flights * Samsung suspends Galaxy Note 7 production  * First known New Zealand case of Samsung Note 7 catching fire   KIM HONG-JI/REUTERS Samsung has suspended Note 7 production.     Air New Zealand banned the devices from their flights at the weekend, as did US airlines. One of the first airlines to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. Ad Feedback The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 1760 degrees Celsius. The sell for US$1800 (NZ$2540) each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas. The airline, which is based in Burlingame, California, has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted on Thursday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners. "This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events,'' Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires. Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades. In Australia, Qantas has previously considered fire containment bags, but decided its current crew training and procedures are sufficient to deal with fire emergencies.  - AAP Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next News story: South Island tour operators not worried about TripAdvisor policy changes Travel Homepage Comments travel headlines Travellers take the long way home Post-quake travel plans Sheer luxury on Laucala Destinations off the tourist trail Kashmir lake in crisis Stork strike damages plane Jilted woman travels with foam cutout Southern skifield numbers rise Youngest person to hit every country?

Reporting by Daniel O'Donnell. Some airlines are taking extra steps to prevent a disaster in case a passenger's device powered by a lithium ion battery catches fire during flight. At least three US airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a mobile phone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. The issue has taken on new urgency following incidents of overheating Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones, including one on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier in October. CRUSHADER/REDDIT Customers have reported Samsung Galaxy Note 7s bursting into flames. Aviation authorities around the world have taken steps to warn passengers not to use or charge the devices while on board and not to stow them in checked luggage. READ MORE: * Air NZ bans Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones from all flights * Samsung suspends Galaxy Note 7 production  * First known New Zealand case of Samsung Note 7 catching fire   KIM HONG-JI/REUTERS Samsung has suspended Note 7 production.     Air New Zealand banned the devices from their flights at the weekend, as did US airlines. One of the first airlines to deploy fire-containment bags on its entire fleet was Alaska Airlines. The Seattle-based airline finished adding them to its 219 planes in May, a process that took two months from concept to deployment. Ad Feedback The bright red bags are made of a fire-resistant material and are designed to hold electronic devices such as mobile phones and laptops that can sometimes overheat and catch fire. The bags can be shut with Velcro and heavy-duty zippers and can withstand temperatures up to 1760 degrees Celsius. The sell for US$1800 (NZ$2540) each but airlines are likely to have negotiated a bulk discount. Virgin America has installed fire-containment bags on all its planes, said spokeswoman Jennifer Thomas. The airline, which is based in Burlingame, California, has about 60 jets. Delta Air Lines noted on Thursday on a call with investors that it too would be adding such bags. The Atlanta-based airline has more than 900 planes, all of which will eventually get the bags, depending on production speeds and the ability to train flight attendants and pilots. The first priority will be the 166 aircraft that cross oceans, as well as some Boeing 757s used for domestic flights, according to spokesman Morgan Durrant. Those jets will have two bags each by the end of the year. In 2017, Delta plans to start adding the bags to its domestic fleet, including planes flown by its regional airline partners. "This has been on the to-do list but has been accelerated by recent events,'' Durrant said. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines don't have any immediate plans for fire containment bags but all said their crews are trained on how to fight such high-energy fires. Additionally, aircraft have been fitted with fire extinguishers in the cabin as well as other fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds for decades. In Australia, Qantas has previously considered fire containment bags, but decided its current crew training and procedures are sufficient to deal with fire emergencies.  - AAP Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next News story: South Island tour operators not worried about TripAdvisor policy changes Travel Homepage Comments travel headlines Travellers take the long way home Post-quake travel plans Sheer luxury on Laucala Destinations off the tourist trail Kashmir lake in crisis Stork strike damages plane Jilted woman travels with foam cutout Southern skifield numbers rise Youngest person to hit every country?

The airline strongly advises travellers not to bring the devices to the airport with them, says an airline spokeswoman. "They cannot be accepted for travel and there is no storage facility available for them at our check in areas," the spokeswoman said on Stuff. Spark has notified customers of the first reported case of a Samsung Galaxy Note7 exploding in New Zealand. The Air New Zealand ban takes effect the same time as the US ban. The United States Department of Transportation issued a total ban on passengers and flight crews bringing the phones on airline flights into and out of the United States. "Air New Zealand apologises to customers for any inconvenience, however, this is an FAA and US DOT safety requirement." The Civil Aviation Authority this week told airlines they had to ensure passengers turn off any Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices when travelling, but fell short of an outright ban. This smartphone began smoking inside a Southwest Airlines plane on October 5, 2016. Photo: Supplied. The US order, which went into effect at 5am today New Zealand time, says the phones may not be carried on board or packed in checked bags on flights to and from the United States or within the country. The phones also can't be shipped as air cargo. Passengers caught attempting to travel with the phones will have the phones confiscated and may face fines, the department said. Samsung has recalled more than 2.5 million of the smartphones worldwide, citing a battery manufacturing error, and discontinued the product earlier this week, less than two months after its August release. In New Zealand, Samsung Galaxy Note 7 buyers will be given $100 compensation – on top of a cash or credit refund – to compensate them for the "stress" and inconvenience of having to return the smartphones. New Zealand Post has told consumers not to post or courier Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones back to retailers because of the safety risk. Instead it is telling buyers to return the smartphones to retailers in person. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission says there have been nearly 100 reports of batteries in Note 7 phones overheating in the U.S. One fire erupted on a Southwest Airlines flight earlier this month. In another case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned passengers not to pack the phones in their checked bags and to power them off and not charge them while on board planes. "We recognise that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority," said Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. "We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident inflight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk." The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. At least three U.S. airlines are adding new fire-suppression equipment to fleets in case a cellphone or laptop battery overheats, catches on fire and can't be extinguished. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.  No more flying for the Note 7.

It plans to launch routes from Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong to various destinations in countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Malaysia, and then routes between Guangzhou and Americas and Oceania. Domestically, it will expand its network between Guangzhou, the provincial capital, and air hubs in Shanghai, Kunming and Xi'an, while exploring markets in Shantou, Zhuhai and Zhanjiang in Guangdong. Guangdong province stands as one of the most dynamic regions economically in the country and the new branch is also meant to serve the country's "Belt and Road" strategy, said Liu Shaoyong, chairman of China Eastern. With the Guangdong branch, China Eastern's capacity for the Guangdong market will increase faster than before and hopefully faster than the market average, said Dong Bo, chief marketing officer of China Eastern. China Eastern will be entitled to apply for more new routes in the Guangdong market, said Zhai Zhigang, general manager of the Guangdong branch. China Eastern's Guangdong branch will fly mainly Boeing aircraft, expanding its fleet by five to eight planes annually to have 60 planes in Guangdong by 2020. Currently, the company runs daily 120 flights from six cities in Guangdong to 59 domestic cities and three overseas destinations, carrying more than 10 million passengers annually. Listed in New York, Hong Kong and Shanghai, with its headquarters in Shanghai, China Eastern carries more than 100 million passengers a year, which ranks it the seventh among all airline firms globally. It runs a fleet of 580 planes.

Director General Joel Feldschuh announced Sunday that passengers would be prohibited from boarding planes in Israel with the devices and that the authority began implementing the ban from Saturday at noon. US officials on Friday banned all Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones from airplanes, saying anyone attempting to travel with the recalled handsets may face fines and have the devices confiscated. Israel joins several countries across Europe in its implementation of the ban following the US decision. The South Korean electronics giant has recalled all Note 7 phones, including replacements, following reports of exploding batteries and fires, which have led to numerous injuries. Samsung has also stopped producing the flagship handset. Samsung Electronics headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, file (AFP) US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said an emergency order banning the devices would take effect on Saturday. Passengers would be barred from carrying the Note 7 on planes, in hand luggage or in checked baggage on domestic flights and international flights to or from the United States, the agency said. “We recognize that banning these phones from airlines will inconvenience some passengers, but the safety of all those aboard an aircraft must take priority,” Foxx said in a statement. “We are taking this additional step because even one fire incident in-flight poses a high risk of severe personal injury and puts many lives at risk.” The Consumer Product Safety Commission this week formalized the recall affecting 1.9 million handsets in the United States, including one million announced in a September 15 recall and an additional 900,000 replacements. The agency said Samsung had received reports of at least 96 of the US handsets overheating, with 13 reports of burn injuries and 47 incidents of property damage. Samsung said in a statement that it is working with the US aviation department to make customers aware of the ban. The company also urged Note 7 customers to get a refund or exchange their phones by visiting their wireless carrier or retail store. An airplane takes off from the Ben Gurion International Airport, on February 26, 2015.

Health insurance costs jump 6 percent By Jim Gallagher St. Louis Post-Dispatch Jim Gallagher Oct 17, 2016 (…) The Associated Press  In this June 14, 2011, file photo, bottles of prescription drugs: Lipitor, TriCor, Plavix, Singulair, Lexapro and Avapro are displayed at Medco Health Solutions Inc., in Willingboro, N.J. U.S. spending on prescription drugs rose 8.5 percent last year, slightly less than in 2014, driven mainly by growing use of ultra-expensive new drugs and price hikes on other medicines.

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File) Here comes the gouge, again. Next month brings open enrollment for company health plans. The cost of covering you and your family will go up 5.5 percent to 6 percent, according to surveys from Mercer and the National Business Group on Health. A 5.5 percent increase would be more than five times general inflation. It is more than twice the rise in hourly earnings. But don’t expect your employer to pay the full 5.5 percent or 6 percent. Employers will see their own costs rise just 4 percent, according to Mercer, the big benefits consulting firm. Bosses will make up the difference by shifting more of the cost of illness to you, the worker. Employees will see higher premiums, higher deductibles, co-pays. Those trends have been underway for years. There’s also an effort to nudge workers toward cheaper medical providers. A few employers will simply boot higher-cost hospitals and doctors out of their networks. Premiums will take a bigger bite out of your paycheck. Expect to pay 5 percent more, according to the National Business Group on Health. Health insurance costs have been rising faster than inflation and wages for 19 years. So, the squeeze on employees and employers this year is just more of the same. There is no “huge shift” in benefits for employees this year, says Alan Loretta, who heads the health care practice at Mercer in St. Louis. There will be exceptions. Some smaller St. Louis employers are being shocked with cost increases of over 20 percent, while others are seeing increases “near zero,” says Chris Johnson, manager of consulting services at J.W. Terrill, an insurance broker in Chesterfield. The typical cost of covering a family this year is $18,142, with workers on average paying $5,277, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Since 2011, the year after the Affordable Care Act passed, average family premiums have increased 20 percent. They rose 31 percent from 2006 to 2011 and 63 percent from 2001 to 2006. Employers are pushing workers to use health care more efficiently. More are offering “telemedicine,” in which employees can visit a doctor via computer video for advice and prescriptions. Such no-touch visits — for things such as allergies or migraines — often run $40 to $45, much cheaper than a typical $125 office visit, says Loretta. Nine out of 10 employers now offer telemedicine, up from seven in 10 last year, says the National Business Group on Health. More companies are adding online cost estimators. These let participants see in advance what they might pay for a procedure out of pocket, and point them toward cheaper providers. For instance, UnitedHealth’s cost estimator shows that a trip to an urgent care clinic averages $90 in St. Louis. But costs in mid-St. Louis County range from $67 at SSM Health Express to $210 at American Current Care. There is a continued drive toward high-deductible health plans. These hold down premiums for workers and employers. But a sick employee must pay more before insurance kicks in, and out-of-pocket maximums are also higher than with other plans. The plans include tax-sheltered health savings accounts funded by employees, and sometimes employers. Workers can use the money to cover deductibles and other medical expenses, and they can take unused money into retirement to help pay medical costs. By government rule, deductibles must be at least $1,300 for self-only coverage and $2,600 for family. The average deductible actually being offered this year is $4,343, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Out-of-pocket maximums can’t be more than $6,550 for self-only coverage and $13,100 for a family. Companies have spent recent years adding surcharges for covering spouses, hoping that they’ll find alternatives to the company plan. Some are booting spouses off their health plans completely if they can get coverage from their own employers. Some companies are dropping coverage for domestic partners, noting that gay marriage is legal. Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Surcharges for spouses seem to be leveling off, according to the National Business Group on Health, with one-third of companies imposing them. Some employers are controlling costs by kicking high-price providers out of their network. “You’re beginning to see a lot of employers look at that,” Johnson says. In St. Louis, narrowing the network generally means excluding BJC HealthCare, the region’s biggest hospital network. Booting BJC normally saves 6.5 to 7.5 percent on health plan costs, Johnson says. Boeing last year began offering employees a lower-cost option that includes only the Mercy hospital system. Health insurance prices have been “wildly erratic” for middle-market companies with 100 to 500 employees, Johnson says. Some firms with 100 to 200 workers are seeing 20 to 30 percent increases in premiums; others are seeing an increase “near zero.” Such firms usually buy insurance to cover their workers. Larger companies typically pay medical bills themselves, using insurance companies to bargain with providers and handle claims. Prices at midsize firms are based partly on the age and health of their workforce. But prices also can be based partly on the insurer’s overall experience with similar employers. The Affordable Care Act provided some temporary help for companies that guessed wrong about the size of medical claims in the act’s early years, but those subsidies are phasing out and companies are changing their prices to adjust. “It’s not time to panic. It’s time to very carefully look at things. We’re going through a market reset,” Johnson says. November also brings open enrollment for people who buy their own coverage through the government-run insurance marketplaces set up under the Affordable Care Act. The number of insurers in the St. Louis area will fall from four to two, Anthem Blue Cross and Cigna. Sharp premium increases are expected. The phase-in of the Affordable Care Act raised concern that employers would cancel their own employee coverage and force workers to buy their own on the new health insurance exchanges begun in 2014. That effect has been small so far. As of this year, 56 percent of employers offered health coverage, down from 60 percent in 2011.

SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP San Francisco Autonomous Drone Company Starts Delivering Blood in Rwanda Starting today, Zipline's drones will deliver up to 150 bags of blood daily to health centers in western Rwanda. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Zipline's team has launched its blood delivery drone service in Rwanda. CREDIT: Zipline Advertisement In the U.S., drone delivery is still in the research and development phase. But in Rwanda, starting today, American-made drones will deliver blood to patients in need. Zipline, an autonomous robotics company based in San Francisco, has partnered with the Rwandan government to make up to 150 deliveries each day to 21 different transfusion clinics in the western half of the country. During a ceremony in the Muhanga District in Rwanda on Friday morning (Thursday night in the states), Rwandan president Paul Kagame launched the first drone to mark the beginning of the nation's drone delivery service. Rwanda's drone delivery service will focus on blood at first but will soon expand to vaccines, medical supplies, and other medicines through a partnership between UPS and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Zipline's aircraft will expand its delivery route to the eastern half of the country by 2017. Over the next three years, Zipline CEO and co-founder Keller Rinaudo says, the startup and the Rwandan government can save thousands of lives, and he hopes Zipline can eventually provide medical supplies to all of the 11 million Rwandan citizens in need. In Rwanda, many patients die each year because blood and medical supplies cannot get to medical centers in rural areas because of poor infrastructure and impassable roads. Most "last-mile" deliveries are done by motorbike, but in emergency situations the motorbikes cannot make deliveries fast enough. During the country's rainy season, the roads connecting cities to remote villages can wash out and prevent ground transportation entirely. But the drones, which reach a top speed of 140 kilometers per hour (about 87 mph), can fly in rain and heavy wind and can deliver the blood before it spoils. The drones can make a delivery 75 kilometers away (about 47 miles) within 30 minutes. "The inability to deliver life-saving medicines to the people who need them the most causes millions of preventable deaths each year around the world," says Rinaudo. "Zipline will help solve that problem once and for all. We've built an instant delivery system for the world, allowing medicine to be delivered on-demand and at low-cost, anywhere." This is how Zipline's drone delivery system works: When a patient needs a blood transfusion, a doctor, nurse, or health center technician will send Zipline a text message and a drone from its fleet of 15 aircraft will airdrop the needed supplies in half an hour. The drone will send a message to the health center when it is two minutes away and the package, equipped with a parachute, will fall safely to the ground. The craft will then return to the launch site all by itself. Zipline, which was founded by Keller Rinaudo, Will Hetzler, and Keenan Wyrobek in 2011 in California, has raised $18 million in funding from investors including Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures, and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The company is composed of aerospace employees from NASA, SpaceX, and Boeing. The private-public partnership between the Silicon Valley company and Rwanda was padded by a $1.1 million grant from the UPS Foundation. The UPS Foundation grant will help Zipline expand its offerings to vaccines and other supplies. (UPS delivered Zipline's infrastructure, the launch pad, and the fleet of 15 drones to Rwanda.) Thanks to regulatory hurdles, Zipline is not currently operating medical supply deliveries in the U.S. The Federal Aviation Administration currently does not allow autonomous drones. The FAA's rules require a pilot on the ground to keep the aircraft in line of sight at all times. Once approved by the U.S. government, Zipline hopes to bring the same model to the U.S. by next year and plans to serve Native American reservations in Maryland, Nevada, and Washington State.

Why LEGO stoppped promotions through The Daily Mail Journey to Mars ... from your couch Orbital ATK is set to launch a rocket loaded with supplies for the International Space Station, on Monday night, nearly two years after one of its Antares rockets exploded shortly after liftoff, and one day after a faulty cable caused a delay. By Lonnie Shekhtman, Staff October 17, 2016 Save for later Saved In this photo provided by NASA, the Orbital ATK Antares rocket, with the Cygnus spacecraft onboard, sits on launch Pad-0A on Sunday, at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Bill Ingalls/NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of It was to be Orbital ATK’s big comeback moment, but Sunday’s highly anticipated launch of its Antares rocket, which had been grounded for two years, had an anticlimactic moment when it was canceled by a faulty cable. “ Oh, how disappointed I am!” tweeted one of the company’s followers, @GrpShawna, on Sunday. The Sterling, Va.-based aerospace and defense contractor is set to try again to launch 5,000 pounds of supplies to the astronauts working aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Monday at 7:40 pm EDT from Virginia’s Wallops Island. Given clear skies, the launch should be visible along most of the East Coast, including Washington, New York, and Boston. Those in other parts of the country can watch a live webcast Monday night on NASA TV. Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! The ISS supplies are packed into Orbital’s Cygnus capsule, which will be delivered to the ISS by Antares a few days after the launch. The rocket, which has been grounded since it exploded on the launchpad within seconds of liftoff two years ago, likely will have to orbit Earth for several days before docking with the space station. Its circuitous route is meant to make room for a launch of three astronauts from Kazakhstan on Wednesday. They will join the three already aboard the orbiting space lab. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Orbital spent two years redesigning its rocket and rebuilding the launch pad. It replaced an old Russian-built engine with a newer one, also built by a Russian company. In the meantime, it continued delivering cargo to the ISS under a $1.9 billion contract the company had signed with NASA, using other companies’s rockets. By the time Antares was ready for launch again on Sunday, there was great anticipation from the space community. "This is a very exciting time for us at Orbital ATK," Frank Culbertson, Orbital's space systems president, said the night before Sunday’s launch. "A lot of hard work has gone into this." Orbital is one of two private companies hired by NASA to deliver cargo to the space station. The other is SpaceX, which also has faced major technical setbacks. Just last month, a test of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral ended in an explosion on the launch pad. SpaceX's explosion is not expected to cause major cargo-delivery delays, according to the company, which says it could resume delivery in November. SpaceX, along with Boeing, are expected to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next couple of years. Today only Russia can launch humans to space aboard its Soyuz rocket. As USA Today reported in 2015, it costs US taxpayers about $75 million for every ride to the space station, a sum that could rise to $82 million in 2018.

Fuller On Oct. 16, 1981, the Screaming Eagle patches came off and the Army's 101st Aviation Group was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion. Five years later, it became the 160th Aviation Group, then the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR) in 1990. But, the regiment is most affectionately known as “Night Stalkers,” after the soldiers who pioneered the Army’s nighttime flying techniques. And on Oct. 21, the Night Stalkers are throwing themselves a party, according to Fort Campbell’s publication. On Friday, the 160th will host a daylong celebration for past and present SOAR soldiers and their families to celebrate 35 years in service. Events will take place at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where SOAR headquarters are located. But there will be no usual party games present. Instead, outdoor activities include a team-building, 10-obstacle mud run course for active SOAR soldiers and a Night Stalker picnic, which will include a cook-off. There will also be bounce houses and live music. The Night Stalker version of "plank holders" and Gold Star families will be in attendance, giving distinction to those who have been there since the beginning, and those who have given the ultimate sacrifice. In the regiment’s 35 years, 94 Night Stalkers have died in training and combat. Outlined in the 160th's creed, being a Night Stalker comes with high risk for which each soldier is prepared. While SOAR headquarters, the training company, 1st Battalion and 2nd Battalion are in Kentucky, the 3rd Battalion is in Hunter Army Airfield, Georgia, and the 4th Battalion is in Fort Lewis, Washington. Each battalion comprises light, medium and heavy helicopters, customized for the units.  First Battalion has one Boeing (based on McDonnell Douglas) AH-6 Little Bird company, one McDonnell Douglas (first Hughes) MH-6 Little Bird company and three Sikorsky MH-60 Black Hawk companies. The 2nd Battalion has two Boeing MH-47 Chinook companies. Third and 4th battalions both have two Chinook companies and one Black Hawk company.

Skip to content Streetsblog New York Los Angeles San Francisco California Chicago Denver Texas Ohio St. Louis Southeast Capitol Hill National Blog Network Streetsblog Jobs Board Streetfilms Donate Streetsblog USA Podcast Transit Bike/Ped Smart Growth Monday, October 17, 2016 11 Comments Transit Vote 2016: Seattle’s Huge, Imperfect Transit Expansion by Angie Schmitt We continue our overview of what’s at stake in the big transit ballot initiatives this November with a look at Seattle. The first installment of this series examined Indianapolis. The transit expansion plan on the ballot in Seattle this November is a big one. Seattle’s “ST3” plan would add 62 miles of grade-separated light rail. Map: SoundTransit3 Known as ST3, the proposal calls for a 62-mile expansion of grade-separated light rail extending across three counties, including about four miles that will run underground in central Seattle. Also included: bus rapid transit routes along two highway corridors, and $20 million to plan transit-oriented development. The total package comes to $54 billion, which will be paid for by a mix of property taxes, sales taxes, and excise taxes. And it will take more than 20 years to complete. Sound Transit estimates that under this plan, ridership will nearly double by 2040 to 800,000 daily trips, and that 361 million miles of driving will be averted each year [PDF]. There are some downsides to the plan, which has drawn criticism for devoting too much to park-and-ride transit in car-centric areas. While expanding the transit network could create new walkable communities across the region, different suburbs have shown varying levels of commitment to transit-oriented development. ST3 calls for spending $661 million on parking at suburban stations, which works out to $80,000 per space. And much of the suburban light rail will run along highway rights-of-way, which is a bad fit for walkable development. Because ST3 is a regional measure that can’t be enacted without suburban support, some compromises were unavoidable, said Zach Shaner, staff reporter at Seattle Transit Blog. And with the price of housing rising in Seattle, he said, “We have a moral imperative to be providing fast reliable transit for people who live outside of the city.” “This is the best package that we can expect given the political realities and the players involved,” he said. “It’s not perfect, but it’s good. And it’s long past time we constructed grade-separated transit in the city.” Ridership on Seattle’s bus system has grown considerably in the last decade, making it a national success story in reducing solo car commuting. But with the region expected to grow by 800,000 residents in the next 20 years, the need to build transit that can’t get bogged down in car traffic is increasingly urgent. The highest-ridership segment will be a new light rail connection from downtown to Ballard, which is projected to draw 144,000 daily trips and triple the speed of the current “rapid ride” buses. Shaner says the investment promises to “grow our downtown northward in a really positive way.” By running high-capacity transit underground, Shaner added, street space will be freed up for purposes like protected bike lanes. These city-focused projects won’t be complete for some time, however. A light rail extension to West Seattle isn’t scheduled to open until 2030, and the Ballard line won’t open until five years after that. Large employers including Boeing, Microsoft, and Amazon all support the ST3 measure. The opposition does not seem strong in comparison, though the Seattle Times is not a fan. It’s important to understand, said Shaner, that a lot of ST3 revenue will come from extending taxes implemented for the last round of light rail investments — known as ST2. The additional annual pricetag on top of those existing taxes won’t be that large. The transit advocacy group Seattle Subway made this graphic to put it in perspective: Image: Seattle Subway Email Share Vooch how Many Miles of protected Bike Lane ? Southeasterner Bikes?!? We don’t need no stinking bikes! Ironically if you choose to drive to a ST park and ride facility it is free. If you choose to bike to a ST station and want protected parking you will pay a non-refundable registration fee (that has to be mailed in!) and a monthly access fee. Where do you think the priorities of this organization are? Raffi256 Sounds really odd to me to use light rail for all these things, especially for long-distance commuter lines to remote suburbs. It’s very slow and light rail cars aren’t designed for long trip times, it’s mostly standing room. They’re really more like a glorified streetcar or tramway, just good for short trips hop on and off. Elias You’re right about light rail in most places. And Seattle could go that route and cut the budget by tens of billions. But the light rail that Seattle is actually proposing to build is more akin to the Chicago L train or the New York subway. It’s grade-separated light rail that is light-years better than the stuck-at-lights light rail that most cities are pumping out. And that sort of high-quality infrastructure unfortunately isn’t cheap. Raffi256 What I’d expect for this is something more like Chicago’s Metra trains, seeing as how it’s primarily a regional commuter system. The L is terrifying enough over short distances, it would be unbearable on a 80 minute ride from the suburbs like what’s proposed here. Seattle already built their light rail route that very nearly reaches the airport (stops short a half mile from the terminal), and it takes longer than the express bus routes that it replaced. It averages about 25 mph. CeeTee55 Seattle would have been better off with heavy rail, but they went with light rail to make use of the downtown bus tunnel so they’re stuck with light rail now. Most of it will not interact with street traffic so it’s more akin to heavy rail in terms of operation. Raffi256 Yes but it’s also more akin to light rail in that the cars are small and aren’t equipped with the accommodations passengers expect for hour-long trips, and the performance (top speed/acceleration) isn’t great either. Remember they need to make it more attractive than what is already there, and who’s going to want to ride in from all the way out in Everett on this thing? It would take over an hour to Seattle, almost 2 hours if you’re going to the airport. Most people would be standing assuming it gets decent ridership. It’s not going to work. Marcus Gillette Hang on. Seattle already has a heavy rail solution (Sounder) which is pushing the capacity of the rail corridor to the limit. ST3 does expand Sounder service, by the way. But commuter rail doesn’t solve all of the same problems that light rail/subway does. Regarding commute times, 60 minutes from Everett to Seattle every time beats daily peak transit times of 90 minutes on busses or worse in single occupancy vehicles. BRT isn’t less expensive or more efficient when you factor in total cost of ownership. The region is crippled and has nowhere else to go but to plug into the existing transit network and right-of-ways. CeeTee55 How about a whole new tunnel for heavy rail? There is this proposal (below), though in this example the new tunnel shown is *still* light rail and the old tunnel is ‘downgraded’ to being for bus and streetcar. https://transportreview.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/2nd-tunnel3.png I agree light rail is being used for things that are “way out of scope” for it. Los Angeles is a great example. It’s going to end up with the world’s longest light rail lines and is probably going to encounter major logistical and operational issues with these. Oemissions The social costs of driving in Canada paid out by got is $200 Billion/yr For the USA it must be much more Drivers and auto corporations should have been paying for all these costs since the beginning frank discussion I hate the Seattle Subway’s misleading comparison of “apples” to “oranges.” 1. The Seattle Times is generally the same price throughout the region, a bit more for outlying areas. What is shown above is what ST calls a median price, and most of Seattle, the Eastside, and South Snohomish County will pay substantially more than that. For instance, how many own a house appraised at $360,658? A vehicle worth $5,333? Go to st3tax.com to see what your total taxes will be, without accounting for inflation or buying habits over the next 25 years, which are impossible to predict. Unfortunately, Sound Transit took over 2 months after its advisory panel recommended having a calculator to put one up, but they passed on the recommendations to: (a) provide the total ST taxes; and (b) the taxes for the duration. 2. One can opt in or opt out of a Seattle Times subscription. In contrast, ST-3 is mandatory: folks who aren’t getting much – if anything – out of ST-3 (like those in 101,500 population Renton) get to pay for it anyway, and some of the taxes go on forever, and there’s no more vote of the people. 3. One can get different levels of a Seattle Times subscription, such as weekends, Sunday only, etc. For ST-3, you’re paying for a program that mostly is for – and benefits – those living and working in Seattle. In contrast, one’s stuck with ST-3 light rail’s projects. For those living in Everett and commuting to Seattle or Bellevue, they get to wait an extra 5-7 years due to the politicians’ desire to appease their contributors at Paine Field. Then, they get to spend the equivalent of 2 weeks/year on a train due to the dogleg. Oh, and higher fares due the longer distances. 4. A single Seattle TImes subscription can be shared with many others. ST-3, with the resultant tripling of car tabs and 10%+ sales taxes, can’t be. You’re stuck. My life won’t be easier in the future with ST-3. Most likely, I will have expired by the time their light rail reaches me, maybe retired, certainly not able to afford to live in an increasingly-expensive area (which this light rail plan encourages: sprawl), for there’s nothing in it for today’s commuters. Further, light rail projected for my area doesn’t duplicate local bus service, so no new bus service, either. We’ll still have 11 bus routes, 7 on weekends, many on hourly frequencies during 8-6 spans.

The Sterling, Va.-based aerospace and defense contractor is set to try again to launch 5,000 pounds of supplies to the astronauts working aboard the International Space Station (ISS) on Monday at 7:40 pm EDT from Virginia’s Wallops Island. Given clear skies, the launch should be visible along most of the East Coast, including Washington, New York, and Boston. Those in other parts of the country can watch a live webcast Monday night on NASA TV. Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! The ISS supplies are packed into Orbital’s Cygnus capsule, which will be delivered to the ISS by Antares a few days after the launch. The rocket, which has been grounded since it exploded on the launchpad within seconds of liftoff two years ago, likely will have to orbit Earth for several days before docking with the space station. Its circuitous route is meant to make room for a launch of three astronauts from Kazakhstan on Wednesday. They will join the three already aboard the orbiting space lab. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Orbital spent two years redesigning its rocket and rebuilding the launch pad. It replaced an old Russian-built engine with a newer one, also built by a Russian company. In the meantime, it continued delivering cargo to the ISS under a $1.9 billion contract the company had signed with NASA, using other companies’s rockets. By the time Antares was ready for launch again on Sunday, there was great anticipation from the space community. "This is a very exciting time for us at Orbital ATK," Frank Culbertson, Orbital's space systems president, said the night before Sunday’s launch. "A lot of hard work has gone into this." Orbital is one of two private companies hired by NASA to deliver cargo to the space station. The other is SpaceX, which also has faced major technical setbacks. Just last month, a test of its Falcon 9 rocket at Cape Canaveral ended in an explosion on the launch pad. SpaceX's explosion is not expected to cause major cargo-delivery delays, according to the company, which says it could resume delivery in November. SpaceX, along with Boeing, are expected to start ferrying astronauts to the space station in the next couple of years. Today only Russia can launch humans to space aboard its Soyuz rocket. As USA Today reported in 2015, it costs US taxpayers about $75 million for every ride to the space station, a sum that could rise to $82 million in 2018.

The following are some of the factors that may move German stocks: DEUTSCHE BANK Indicated 0.3 percent lower Aides to German Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers last week the state would not take a stake in Deutsche Bank if it were to issue new stock, the Wall Street Journal said on Friday, citing a person who attended the briefing. Deutsche Bank is studying a possible change of its strategy in the United States, two sources close to the company said on Saturday. BAYER Indicated 0.1 percent lower Bayer Crop Science CEO Liam Condon said in an interview with Die Welt on Saturday that when the company takes over U.S. seed firm Monsanto, an integration process will be implemented. "Be assured that Bayer will have a unified croporate culture," he said. COMMERZBANK Indicated 0.5 percent higher Commerzbank favours a separate listing of its ETF and derivatives unit EMC, Euro am Sonntag reported in its Saturdy edition, citing banking sources. But it was unclear whether 100 percent would be listed or a smaller share. LUFTHANSA, AIR BERLIN Lufthansa indicated 0.4 percent higher Air Berlin indicated 0.8 percent lower Air Berlin on Saturday said it has banned Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 mobile phones from its flights while rival Lufthansa said it has banned the phones on flights to and from the United States, expecting the ban to be widened later. SIEMENS, OSRAM Siemens indicated 0.3 percent lower, Osram 0.3 percent higher Siemens chief executive Joe Kaeser said in Wirtschaftswoche on Saturday that any takeover by Chinese investors of former Siemens subsidiary Osram must safeguard German jobs. VOLKSWAGEN Indicated unchanged Chief executive Matthias Mueller in an internal meeting demanded that material costs and overheads be cut by 10 percent as part of its annual budget round for 2017, trade magazine Automobilwoche wrote on Saturday in abstracts ahead of a story due to be published on Oct. 17. CONTINENTAL Indicated unchanged Continental on Saturday announced it bought Hornschuch, a supplier for the car industry, via its subsidiary Benecke-Kaliko, in order to expand its industrial business and open up new sales markets. TELEFONICA DEUTSCHLAND Indicated 0.3 percent lower Germany's network regulatory authority, the Bundesnetzagentur, is considering taking measures against Telefonica Deutschland's O2 because complaints received about ongoing server problems and unavailability of service hotlines, Tagesspiegel am Sonntag reported. A company spokeswoman was quoted by the paper as saying it was aware and about to improve the service in coming weeks. ENBW Indicated 2.4 percent lower EnBW, Germany's third largest utility group, will rely on its power transport grids to generate future earnings, having decided to remain integrated in the face of split-ups by rivals RWE and E.ON, finance chief Thomas Kusterer said in a Boersenzeitung interview on Saturday. AIRBUS Indicated down 0.3 percent European air craft maker Airbus plans to overtake United States rival Boeing on plane deliveries in 2020 again, having fallen behind in recent years, chief executive Fabrice Bregier said in an interview with Die Welt on Monday.

While the requirement wasn’t initially included in the missile’s spec, service brass have called for ship-killing capability in general terms. Furthermore, the weapon’s range will still be under 500 kilometers to comply with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces treaty. Contractor Raytheon has deemed the subtle requirement as entirely doable. Middle East & North Africa Militants from the Islamic State have used booby-trapped UAVs to attack forces fighting the jihadists in Iraq. The drone, rigged with explosives, attacked north of the IS-held city of Mosul and left two Kurdish fighters dead and two French soldiers fighting for their lives. Media reports said the drone was shot down and it only exploded when the soldiers approached it. Few units have the equipment to dispose of such threats effectively. Africa Plans are underway for Japan to increase their presence in East Africa by the expansion of their military base in Djibouti. Additional land will be leased to accommodate the expansion and there is also the possibility of Japanese C-130s joining a contingent of currently deployed P-3 surveillance aircraft. Earlier this year, Tokyo announced that $40 billion extra would be added to ongoing investments in African infrastructure, education, and healthcare projects. Meanwhile, China has pledged $60 billion in similar programs as the East Asian rivals battle for influence and resources on the continent. A number of USAF F-16s and KC-130s have been deployed to the Horn of Africa in anticipation of potential violence in South Sudan against American interests. The request was made by the US Africa Command (AFRICOM) based at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, the US counterterrorism hub in the region. In July, AFRICOM dispatched about 50 combat-equipped troops at the order of President Barack Obama to protect US diplomatic personnel amid widespread violence and civil unrest in South Sudan. Europe Bulgaria’s Ministry of Defense has altered the criteria of their fighter acquisition program, lessening the importance of an aircraft’s lifespan to just 5% of the evaluation. The previous weightage of 25% was seen to favor Saab’s Gripen but this advantage has now shifted to second-hand F-16s. Bulgaria had wanted to buy used F-16s from Portugal but the plan was abandoned following the collapse of the government of Boykko Borissov in 2013. Asia Pacific A recommendation has been made by Australia’s Senate committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade that its defense department implement a “hedging strategy” against any delay with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program by 2019. While the committee stated that it had received evidence criticizing the F-35 and calls for participation to be scrapped, its members judged the F-35 as “the only aircraft able to meet Australia’s strategic needs for the foreseeable future.” The Australian Strategic Policy Institute told the committee the most sensible hedge would be procuring additional F/A-18F Super Hornets. Lockheed Martin has offered to collaborate with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) on jointly developing a new fighter for Japan. LM President Marillyn Hewson made the disclosure saying the company will participate in a second round of Request For Information by Japan’s Ministry of Defense next year. Set to be the replacement for Tokyo’s current fleet of F-2s, other potential collaborators who have responded to the initial RFI include Boeing. Basler Turbo Conversions of the USA have offered their BT-64 gunship to the Philippines as a replacement for their Rockwell OV-10 Broncos. A twin-turboprop conversion of the Douglas DC-3 Dakota, the BT-67 has been fitted with updated systems such as digital avionics, a night-vision goggle-compatible cockpit, weather radar, and a forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor. Other PAF requirements filled by the aircraft include running transport, surveillance, aero medical evacuation, and maritime patrol missions.

Raytheon An artist’s rendering of Raytheon’s micro-satellite, which would aid ground troops. web only Raytheon in Tucson developing tiny satellites to help troops on ground By David Wichner Arizona Daily Star David Wichner Oct 15, 2016 (…) Raytheon A technician at Raytheon Missile Systems in Tucson works with a small-satellite prototype. Raytheon An artist’s rendering of Raytheon’s micro-satellite, which would aid ground troops. For more than a decade, Raytheon Missile Systems has been making missile interceptors that destroy their targets in space. Now, the Tucson-based company is adapting those capabilities to develop small, disposable military satellites that give ground troops on-demand views of their locations. Raytheon has modified some of its manufacturing lines in Tucson to produce relatively inexpensive satellites for a program called Space Enabled Effects for Military Engagements, or SeeMe. The program, managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, aims to give ground forces the ability to get high-resolution satellite images of the battlefield via their smartphones or other hand-held devices, within 90 minutes. In contrast to military spy satellites as big as a bus that cost $1 billion or more, Raytheon’s “nano satellites” weigh about 50 pounds, are roughly the size of a 5-gallon paint bucket and have an expected base price tag of less than $500,000. The SeeMe constellation was designed to use some two dozen satellites, each lasting 60 to 90 days in very low-Earth orbit before falling out of orbit and burning up. DARPA’s request for SeeMe designs caught the attention of the folks at Raytheon’s sprawling missile plant at Tucson International Airport, which was looking for new markets. “We determined we could easily translate our capabilities and technologies into the emerging small-space market,” said Randall Gricious, business-development lead for Raytheon’s small-satellite business. It turns out that small satellites are very similar to missiles — they have similar subsystems including power, propulsion, guidance, avionics, communications and sensors, Gricious said. In Tucson, Raytheon Missile Systems already builds two “kill vehicles” for ballistic missile interceptors designed to destroy enemy missiles in space — one for the Ground-based Missile Defense system and another for the Standard Missile-3, part of the mainly ship-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system. In 2015, the company completed a $9.2 million expansion of its Space Systems Operations factory at its airport plant. Funding interrupted Whether the new effort translates into actual business is still uncertain. Raytheon won a $1.5 million SeeMe design contract in 2012, and two other companies were awarded similar contracts in 2012 and 2013. DARPA’s SeeMe program lost funding a couple of years ago, but it is being kept alive by Raytheon and other contractors with some DARPA support. Despite the loss of future funding and launch delays, Raytheon still hopes its SeeMe satellite prototype will be flown into space sometime next year. The company already has adapted some missile technologies to space vehicles. In 2009, it modified a high-resolution synthetic aperture radar from a tactical missile to both the Indian Chandraayn-1 and NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions that detected ice on the moon, Gricious noted. The interest in small military satellites comes as the commercial market for small satellites is booming. Spaceworks Enterprises, an Atlanta-based space engineering company, predicts that launches of satellites in the 1-50 kilogram class (up to about 110 pounds) will double to more than 400 annually by 2022. The global small-satellite market is estimated to be worth $2.2 billion this year and is projected to grow to $5.3 billion by 2021, with a compound annual growth rate of more than 19 percent, according to the research firm MarketsandMarkets. Backlog of launches One major factor that could cut into those forecasts is the limited availability of launch services. Much of the growth in small-satellite deployment is being driven by small, modular satellites known as CubeSats, which were developed by scientists at California Polytechnic University and Stanford University in 1999. Launches of CubeSats — which are assembled in roughly 4-inch cubic units — and similar small satellites accelerated in the mid-2000s and peaked in 2014, but last year launches dropped due to limited launch capacity and launch failures. A couple of dozen companies are working to bring new small-sat launch vehicles to market including launch-industry giants like Orbital ATK and startups like Vector Space Systems, which announced last week it would build its headquarters and rocket production facilities in Tucson. Several launch failures from late 2014 through 2015 contributed to the growing backlog of small-satellite launches, Spaceworks said. Failures of launch provider SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket last year and again on Sept. 1 has put launches of many small satellites — including Raytheon’s SeeMe prototype — on hold while SpaceX investigates. Raytheon’s Gricious said the company’s SeeMe satellite is scheduled to ride into space aboard a Falcon 9 along with the primary payload — an Asian communications satellite — and 86 other small satellites. The launch has been pushed back several times for various reasons, including the Falcon 9 failures, Gricious said. “Our best guess for launch is first quarter 2017,” he said, adding that the prototype recently completed final testing. The other two companies that were awarded SeeMe design contracts, California-based Millennium Space Systems and NovaWurks, a Northrop Grumman tech spinoff, are also awaiting prototype launches, though Millennium tested its craft in a high-altitude balloon flight in late 2013. DARPA program manager Jeremy Palmer said though the government program formally ended in 2014, the agency has been monitoring the progress of Raytheon’s satellite closely and the prototype will be stored until a launch vehicle is available. Flying commercial A space-policy analyst said the Pentagon has been looking to increase satellite-level intelligence capacity because existing military satellites — including huge surveillance satellites built by defense giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin — can’t handle demand. A system like SeeMe would put satellite data into the hands of troops on the ground, but the Pentagon planners have their eyes on the fast-evolving commercial small-sat industry, said Brian Weeden, technical adviser to the Secure World Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit promoting sustainable use of space. “My guess is all this commercial activity, which is starting to solve some of these problems, may have played a role in why this program didn’t get the funding,” he said. Indeed, during comments at a conference on small satellites last year, the commander of the Air Force Space Command said the military will move slowly and look to the commercial sector for help with its small-sat programs. “When the commercial sector starts investing money and starts proving capabilities, just like in the launch business, we’re going to walk into that with eyes wide open and figure out how to take advantage of those capabilities,” Gen. John E. Hyten said in a keynote speech at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics/Utah State University Small Satellite Conference.

Tucson is catching the small-sat save Tucson has deep expertise in space technologies, including the University of Arizona’s longtime work on NASA space missions and the work of Paragon Space Development Corp., a pioneer in life-support and related systems. But the Old Pueblo is catching the new wave of small-satellite development: — Vector Space Systems announced last week that it will build its headquarters and rocket manufacturing facility in Tucson at an aerospace park set up by Pima County south of Tucson International Airport. The company has developed a rocket and launch system to send “micro satellites,” under 50 kilograms, into space and hopes to fly its first production model from its launch site in Alaska in the fourth quarter. — Tucson-based WorldView Enterprises, started by the founders of Tucson-based Paragon Space Development, is building and launching “stratollites” — balloon-launched devices that can essentially hover at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere for purposes such as communications and research. As part of the aerospace park, Pima County is constructing a building WorldView will lease for its headquarters and production. WorldView will manage the planned Spaceport Tucson launch site under a contract with the county.
