T&Cs. Click here to apply. by Chris Chamberlin | November 15, 2016 UPDATE | It'll be at least another few months until Qantas passengers get their first taste of inflight Internet as the airline pushes back public trials of the service until early 2017. While one Qantas Boeing 737 aircraft has now been kitted out with the technology, the delay allows Qantas and its connectivity partner ViaSat to conduct further testing of the system before opening it up to travellers. "While we know that customers will want to connect to the WiFi, we really do appreciate their patience while we go through our final testing process," said Qantas’ Head of Customer Experience Phil Capps. This next round of testing "ensure(s) that, first and foremost, the safety of the installation meets Qantas’ stringent standards, as well as ensuring the system will deliver the level of performance we expect at this stage of the trial," Capps added. Qantas had previously planned to debut inflight Internet on domestic flights by the end of 2016, with passengers to enjoy free inflight streaming of cricket matches under a partnership with Cricket Australia. However, the delay now means that airborne travellers will miss the bulk – if not all – of the summer cricket season, which winds down on February 22 2017. Once public trials of the service do commence in early 2017 aboard one Boeing 737 aircraft, Qantas aims to begin fitting its entire domestic Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 fleets with the tech from the middle of the year, with fleetwide completion due in 2018. The airline remains in talks with suppliers to bring inflight Internet to its regional (QantasLink) and international fleets, but has no firm plans at this stage. PREVIOUS, August 24 2016 | Qantas plans to offer inflight Internet access on every aircraft in its domestic fleet and is looking to extend sky-high WiFi across its international network as well. With a trial to take place on its Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 aircraft towards the end of the year, the Roo will complete the roll-out of inflight WiFi in 2017 and is in the final stages of securing the tech for its QantasLink Boeing 717s and Dash 8s, along with its Network Aviation Fokker 100s. Passengers flying during the Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 tech trials later this year will be able to watch a live stream of the summer's cricket season under a partnership between Qantas and Cricket Australia. “A flight from Sydney to Perth should be enough time to catch an entire match of 20/20," Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce says, "and live cricket is just one of the partnerships we are looking at.” Also on the agenda is inflight Internet across Qantas’ international fleet. “There are over 200 Qantas aircraft and some complex technical issues to work through… but our plan is to provide Wi-Fi to all our customers as soon as we can, and we’ll be providing more detail after the domestic trial,” Joyce’s speech reads.

Jay Kopinski Share Adjust Comment Print   The Thousand Islands Playhouse is following up the hit shows Boeing Boeing and Don’t Dress for Dinner with another frivolous comedy at its waterfront theatre. A Grand Time in the Rapids will be on stage in Gananoque from now to Sept. 17. Set in the 1950s, A Grand Time in the Rapids involves three characters in one apartment setting. Thalia is seeking help from Ted, a well-intentioned etiquette expert whose aim is to provide assistance with her romantic troubles. When Thalia’s boyfriend Boyd enters the apartment, Thalia is left with the task of admitting the details of her disastrous past. Ted is there to chaperon this encounter, while helping Thalia to maintain her poise and manners as she explains her story. The audience can expect a significant transition, as what appears to be a polite and composed play in Act 1 dramatically shifts in Act 2. Drinks are thrown, doors are slammed, and the audience will enjoy it all with a hearty bout of laughter. Craig Pike and Paul Dunn in A Grand Time In The Rapids at the Thousand Islands Playhouse. Jay Kopinski   The story is woven together by the quick wit of Edmonton-based playwright Stewart Lemoine, who has written more than 70 plays and is considered one of the city’s best-kept secrets. Though all of his plays have been produced in Edmonton, they do not often go beyond its city limits, unless an artist has discovered his work or has a direct connection to Lemoine himself. It’s an exciting rarity to have one of his plays brought to Gananoque. “Our audiences love a classic farce, and I think it is important to support the work of Canadian playwrights,” said Ashlie Corcoran, Playhouse’s artistic director. “It is exciting to find a fast-paced show that fits the bill.” This production of A Grand Time in the Rapids is directed by Ron Pederson, who originated the role of Ted at Edmonton’s Teatro La Quindicina. He is also known to Playhouse audiences as an actor, most recently starring in the musical Into the Woods. The small cast of three brings a mighty presence to the stage. They are all Toronto-based artists who have starred in previous productions at the Thousand Islands Playhouse. “The cast is incredible,” says Pederson. “They’re excellent, comedic virtuosos. It takes a very specific skill to handle the language and technicality to get this. These three actors are dynamite.” The Thousand Islands Playhouse is delighted to bring this Canadian show to the stage for audiences to enjoy.

The massive Boeing 737  a passenger jet converted to VIP standard  will be operated by the islands Longtail Aviation. Martin Amick, CEO of Longtail Aviation, declined to discuss the jets ownership, but aviation websites listed the registered owner. Mr Tariko is the billionaire founder and owner of the Russian Standard vodka brand and the Russian Standard Bank. The new Boeing is he second in the Longtail fleet. Mr Amick said: We are very proud and pleased the owners have chosen us and we hope there will be others like them who see we are doing well. I am sure there will be other aeroplanes. As is the case with any other air carrier, you grow in size, you, the staff needed to service the aircraft you have. The limit is more likely imposed by the size of the field  this is a top of the line, high-end type of aircraft and there are very few people who can afford or have the capacity to run them. Mr Amick said that Bermuda management and registration offered special advantages to owners. He explained that Longtail Aviation was the only company in the world that has a Bermuda air carrier certificate  which means aircraft run from the island can be hired out for charters. He added that other countries offered the same type of service  but that the process was more difficult and time-consuming than in Bermuda. Mr Amick said: Bermuda has a very efficient regulatory authority, the Bermuda Civil Aviation Authority is very efficient and run by very competent people, particularly when they are working with a known operating company like Longtail Aviation. He added: The Bermuda aircraft registry is very popular around the world  there are more than 700 aircraft and of this only about 150 of them are private jets. The rest of them are airliners. Mr Amick said that few of the planes operated from the island spent time here. He added: This latest one could come here, but it will not spend a significant amount of time in Bermuda. The aircraft, based on the successful civilian airliner, is configured to carry just 18 VIPs and includes two private staterooms with baths and showers, a galley, private office space and luxurious seating. Mr Amick said: In 1998, the Boeing Aircraft Company re-engineered and successfully introduced the 737 Boeing business jet, nicknamed the BBJ, as a VIP private jet. Immediately upon its introduction, into corporate service, the BBJ became the gold standard for the entire private jet travel industry. The BBJ offers the best of commercial aviation safety and reliability in the private air travel sector. In addition to two Boeing 737 VIP jets, Longtail operates a large MD-87 private jet, a stretched version of the DC-9 airliner, and a smaller Dassault Falcon 900.

Camair-Co The Challenge is Huge For New Management! Victorine BIY NFOR | Cameroon-tribune | Publié : Mardi le 23 Aout 2016 06:51:39 | 5810 hits | Opinion | The implementation of the restructuring plan is awaiting the new management team. | Nous suivre sur facebook | Nous suivre sur twitter | Imprimer | Envoyer cet article à   The stakes are high for the new management team of the Cameroon national air carrier, Camair-Co. The new Board Chairman, Mefiro Oumarou and Director General, Ernest Dikoum appointed by President Paul Biya yesterday August 22, 2016 and commissioned in Yaounde by Transport Minister have the tasked of overseeing the strict implementation of the restructuring plan, proposed by the American consulting firm, Boeing, after a forensic audit. The skies may appear clearer for the company with the proposed plan to restructure the company after months of uncertainty caused by the recurrent breakdown of the Boeing 767-300 ER christened the “Dja” and the Boeing 737-700 coupled with the recent ban by the Civil Aviation Authority prohibiting the company from flying to Europe. The sigh of relief will however be heaved when the new management team takes the restructuring plan to the end. Nine Additional Aircraft The team is expected as proposed by the American firm, Boeing, to purchase nine additional aircraft to step up its fleet to 14 aircraft. Camair-Co’s inability to fly higher has always been blamed on its limited fleet, with Boeing insisting in its strategic audit report that the company’s flight expansion and business plan programme that brings out reliability was only achievable with more aircraft. The task is therefore huge for the new management team that is expected to purchase new aircraft according to its to-be-new destinations. New Flight Destinations Camair-Co’s inability to make ends meet has partly been attributed to its limited flight destinations which is understandable. The company planes, apart from flying across Africa, only go to Europe. The new restructuring plan endorsed by the Head of State makes provision for 27 destinations. Five intercontinental lines like Paris, Bruxelles, Washington and Wangzhou alongside 13 regional and nine domestic lines have been recommended by the consultant as government seeks to redress the country’s lone airline company. Ernest Dikoum and his team will therefore have the daunting task of making the company profitable through the multiplication of its flight destinations. FCFA 35 Billion Debts Camair-Co is in the bad books of its service providers like fuel providers, aircraft lenders and navigation service experts. Boeing consultant is proposing that government pays the company debts worth FCFA 35 billion. The new management team is therefore expected to work out a payment plan to relief the company of this nightmare. FCFA 60 Billion Funding In June 2015, government secured a FCFA 25 billion loan within a plan to re-launch the company. Priority was the purchase of new aircraft to add to the three the company owns. However, the funds are expected to be disbursed now given that the report of the forensic audit of the company required has been endorsed. This notwithstanding, the consultant tasked government to finance the company to the tune of FCFA 60 billion so as to save the dying horse.

Follow @NASASpaceFlight Home Forums L2 Sign Up ISS Commercial Shuttle SLS/Orion Russian European Chinese Unmanned Other NASA classes MMOD as primary threat to commercial crew vehicles August 22, 2016 by Chris Bergin NASA has claimed the threat of MicroMeteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) – small pieces of space debris capable of punching bullet hole wounds into spacecraft – is the “primary” threat to the safety of Commercial Crew vehicles. The claim was made as the Agency works on closing the gap between the current analysis of the Loss Of Crew (LOC) numbers with the Program’s goal. Commercial Crew Advancing: NASA’s latest status overview of its Commercial Crew Program was provided to the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) during its recent meeting at NASA’s Headquarters in Washington DC. The meeting saw the chair of the panel change hands, with VADM (Ret.) Joseph Dyer handing over the reins to Dr. Patricia Sanders. The ASAP is NASA’s primary oversight body focused on crew safety. It was particularly outspoken during the Shuttle extension debate and was actively opposed to any additional missions past Atlantis’ STS-135 swansong. See Also CCP Vehicles Section L2 SpaceX Section L2 CCP Section Click here to Join L2 Since the Shuttle’s retirement, the ASAP has refocused its attention on NASA’s current and future programs involving astronauts, namely the International Space Station and the missions involving Orion and the Space Launch System (SLS), all while playing an active role in the formulation of certification plans for NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The panel was skeptical of the link up between NASA and commercial providers during the early days of CCP. However, its opinion has since thawed, not least following the observation of the progress being made between NASA and its commercial partners on elements such as transparency and data sharing – and is on “a trend that the panel appreciates”. The latest CCP status update was provided to the ASAP by Kathy Lueders, CCP Program Manager, focusing on the two vehicles – SpaceX’s Dragon 2 and Boeing’s Starliner (CST-100) – that will be tasked with launching NASA astronauts to the ISS. “Both providers are working to the schedule, which is challenging. The next year or so will be a defining moment,” noted the minutes from Ms Lueders’ overview. “The Program is about to enter the hardware testing phase. At this point, the providers are tracking to schedule and making significant progress.” While the ASAP will have been pleased by the report card, the panel’s gaze is mainly fixated on paper elements such as programmatic risks. This includes areas such as “requirements changes” where commercial companies attempt to find a “commonality of process” within NASA’s strict rule book. Both SpaceX and Boeing have proposed changes to NASA’s “standards and policies” – although no examples were cited to the ASAP. However, the CCP overview noted the requests are currently being evaluated by NASA. The other item of interest is also related to requirements, with NASA’s standards for crew safety working via a probability matrix known as the LOV/C (Loss Of Vehicle/Crew) ratio. LOV/C is a product of the Shuttle era, where a number of LOV scenarios resulted in a “no win” situation for the crew, equating to a LOV/C. In a number of cases, that was the fault of the vehicle’s design, such as the lack of crew escape options during key phases of the mission. Shuttle had improved its rating via the post-Return To Flight (RTF) modifications, allowing for a LOC ratio of “about 1 in 90”. Although the vehicle’s safety was improved throughout the final flights, the options for saving the crew – such as ISS “Safe Haven” – helped improve the LOC ratio. For the new breed of vehicles, a number of the Shuttle-style threats have been removed, not least during launch. Should a commercial crew launch vehicle, or indeed SLS, suffer a major issue during ascent, the crew will be pulled free of the failure by the Launch Abort System (LAS) on the crew vehicle. Ascent and re-entry/landing were two of the three major LOC threats for the Space Shuttle. The third, however, will remain a threat for the commercial crew vehicles, along with Orion and any spacefaring vehicle. That threat is MicroMeteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) – the unseen threat that all spacecraft need to be protected from, not least because they are impossible to track and thus avoid. This is in contrast to the larger debris threats that the ISS can dodge via a Debris Avoidance Maneuver (DAM). Impacts from MMOD strikes are usually noticed when they strike areas such as windows of the spacecraft. Such strikes were observed on a large amount of Space Shuttle missions, especially late into the mission when the orbiter had undocked from the protection of the ISS and was preparing to head home. Although spacecraft are designed with a level of protection from such impacts, MMOD was the third biggest threat to losing an orbiter during her mission – second only to launch and re-entry. With the improvements to crew launch via the new era of vehicles, launch and landing are not close to the Shuttle’s danger levels. During the Space Shuttle era, all of the orbiters would receive flesh wounds from MMOD strikes. The most serious event was during STS-109 when a small piece of debris was lodged in Columbia’s coolant loop 2 and restricted the flow of Freon-22 in that coolant loop. While the option for an immediate return to Earth was discussed, mission managers opted to press on with what was a successful flight. Atlantis and Endeavour both suffered “bullet hole” impacts to their radiators, with Atlantis’ damage sustained when she was hit by a tiny piece of circuit board on orbit – likely from a destroyed satellite. The damage held no mission impact and was only noticed once she had returned home and was in post-flight processing inside her Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Extensive evaluations took place ahead of each shuttle mission, not least Atlantis’ STS-125 flight into space, a mission that provided one final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. This mission held the largest risk to the orbiter, given it was the only post Return To Flight mission that did not have the “safe haven” option of docking with the ISS, ahead of a rescue orbiter being flown to pick up the crew. STS-125 would also see an increase in the concentration of MMOD, due to the region of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Atlantis flew in for the majority of her mission. The Program Requirements Control Board (PRCB) results – which took into account satellite breakups and a variety of other components evaluated to be in Atlantis’ orbital neighborhood – showed that the overall risk of a Loss Of Vehicle and Crew (LOC/V) scenario due to MMOD impact(s) to the Thermal Protect System (TPS) was 1 in 185, with an error factor of 1.35 based on MMOD distribution, velocity, and density uncertainties. As noted, most of the risk was associated with impacts on the TPS, as opposed to the windows. In the end, Atlantis completed her mission successfully and without any major MMOD concerns. Data has already been gained on the Orion spacecraft’s performance, via the Exploration Flight Test -1 (EFT-1) mission. The review of Orion’s TPS did show a slightly higher than predicted level of MMOD impacts to the outer shell of the vehicle. This was based on computational predictions and post-flight inspections. However, being a test flight, engineers have taken lessons learned and have already been applying them to the Exploration Mission -1 (EM-1) Orion, with further refinements to the TPS and outer shell of the vehicle. EM-1 will also be an uncrewed flight, allowing for more refinements head of EM-2 in the 2020s. MMOD also played a role in dismissing a level of post-Shuttle bravado from the Constellation Program (CxP), which was quick to boast the crews of Orion – launching on the Ares I rocket – would enjoy a LOC of 1 in 1000, based on a 2005 study. However, as the Constellation system design process began and the program started looking at hazards and threats, they found that 1 in 1000 was going to be an impossible number to meet, not least due to MMOD threats. The LOC was reduced to 1 in 270 – or three times better than Shuttle at end-of-life – which was still thought to be an exaggeration by the ASAP. However, it was used as a benchmark for the Commercial Crew vehicles, to “ensure an even playing field.” “NASA needs to be careful as it picks what the controls will be and to be smart about how to make up the gap,” noted the ASAP last year. “Bottom line, there is still a 1 in 270 requirement; some of that has been allocated to the contractors and some to the Program.” It is understood both Dragon 2 and Starliner – designed to be extremely safe vehicles – have yet to satisfy NASA on the LOC ratio, again due to the factors surrounding MMOD. “(There is an) effort involved with closing the Loss of Crew (LOC) gap between what the Program goal is and what the current analysis indicates that the systems will achieve,” noted the minutes from the ASAP meeting during which Ms. Lueders was speaking. “The primary threat to both vehicles is MMOD damage for the long-duration time in orbit.” However, there are factors that can help the MMOD threat numbers, such as the period in which the vehicles will be docked with the ISS. As seen with the recent addition of the new International Docking Adaptor (IDA-2), in the same port the Space Shuttle utilized, the Station can provide a level of protection from MMOD strikes, with the structure of the Station in the direction of travel, effectively providing a shield to vehicles docked to the US segment. The main challenge will be at the beginning and end of missions, where the spacecraft are alone on orbit. While Starliner has yet to fly in space, some data will have been gained from the cargo version of Dragon during her missions to the Station, albeit with a different OML (Outer Mold Line). The key will be to refine the MMOD threat data, which is based on historical flight information and may be – due to NASA requirements – overly conservative. “The MMOD damage analysis depends on the modeling of the environment, which is in many aspects speculative and quite robust,” added the minutes. “There are discussions regarding gathering additional historical information to determine if the environmental model is perhaps too robust. All answers are yet to be determined.” (Images: NASA, L2 Shuttle and numerous L2 Renderings by Nathan Koga.

Delta will begin offering service Oct. 4 between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta on the 110-seat aircraft. George C. Ford The Gazette More stories from George Aug 22, 2016 at 2:44 pm | Print View CEDAR RAPIDS — Delta Air Lines will operate a 110-seat Boeing 717 airliner between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta on daily flights beginning Oct. 4. The service will bring “mainline” service operated by a major airline back to The Eastern Iowa Airport. “It will be morning-originating flight and then come back in the evening for the aircraft to spend the night in Cedar Rapids,” Airport Director Marty Lenss said. “That two-a-day pattern will continue through the fall and winter. We are optimistic that we will get back to our seasonal three-a-day service during the summer.” The Delta flights will be the first mainline service to the Cedar Rapids airport since 2005 when United Airlines transitioned to regional partners providing air service. The Cedar Rapids Airport Commission on Monday ratified an agreement with the Iowa Department of Transportation that will provide up to $25,000 to market the new Delta flights. The airport will be required to match the IDOT Air Service Development Program funding. Delta Connections carriers primarily have been using 65-seat regional jets for flights between Cedar Rapids and Atlanta. Lenss said the larger Boeing 717s will increase the number of available seats by 480 each week, offer more first-class seating and larger overhead bins for carry-on luggage. “It’s a great investment by Delta in the Corridor,” Lenss said. “We will need to fill those seats, but the market has been performing well for Delta. That’s why they are making this additional investment.” The Atlanta Hartsfield International Airport competes with Douglas International Airport in Charlotte, N.C., Lenss said. American Airlines announced plans in July to offer two daily, nonstop flights from Cedar Rapids to Charlotte beginning Nov. 4. Both airports offer hundreds of connecting flights to North American and international destinations. “I haven’t had any conversations with American or Delta, but it certainly looks like a competitive response,” Lenss said.

In March, defense contractor Boeing unveiled its 51-foot unmanned submersible, the Echo Voyager, designed to perform reconnaissance missions. © Sputnik/ Ministry of defence of the Russian Federation Hydrogen Fuel Cells Being Developed to Power Underwater US Navy Drones "Echo Voyager is a new approach to how unmanned undersea vehicles will operate and be used in the future," Boeing Phantom Works president Darryl Davis said in a statement. This fall, the unmanned vessel will begin sea trials, as part of the Pentagon’s effort to maintain its presence in the Pacific. "As tensions continue to grow with China and Russia, two militaries that have sophisticated and very large navies, there is a growing interest in making use of unmanned technology in the maritime sphere," said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College, according to Stars and Stripes. "They are scalable, they are dependable, they can operate with a fairly high degree of autonomy. All these things would have been useful 30 years ago, but the technology wasn’t quite there." © YouTube/Saab AB Underwater Mine Hunting Drone Starts Tests With US Agencies The Navy has proposed $319 million for the coming fiscal year to develop drone submersibles. In addition to Echo Voyager, the Pentagon is perfecting the larger Sea Hunter, an unmanned submarine designed to identify and track enemy vessels. Developers must overcome hurdles unique to underwater drones, however. Transmitting data is more difficult for a submersible than a UAV, and storms can force some models to remain in port. Relying on a hybrid electric-diesel battery and marine-diesel system, Echo Voyager can remain submerged for months at a time, avoiding inclement weather, surfacing periodically to charge its battery. During this time, it can transmit data to relay satellites. © Flickr/ Konny Zürcher Russian Navy to Showcase Modern Robotic Systems at Army-2016 Forum - Defense Ministry Boeing vessels also feature a certain degree of autonomy, with onboard sonar sensors and radar. While this helps cut down on personnel cost, it also comes with its own set of challenges. "The autonomy side of the equation, the research is happening at a very quick pace," Michel said. "But as you see time and time again, it’s very challenging to make unmanned systems that can make intelligent and dependable decisions on their own." Still, with a number of defense and commercial companies pursuing the technology, it’s only a matter of time before underwater drones become just as common as their aerial cousins. ...

SHARC has the Boeing technology/sensors on it that make applicable to defense missions. (Boeing) LOS ANGELES (Los Angeles Times/TNS) - This fall, an unusual vessel will begin sea trials off the coast of California. The 51-foot-long Boeing Echo Voyager will have no crew. It will glide underwater for days or weeks, quietly collecting data from the ocean floor to send back to crews on ships or on land. Ever since the start of the war in Afghanistan in 2001, the U.S. military has relied more and more on flying drones to take on dangerous air missions. But increasingly, drones are taking to the sea as well. The U.S. Navy has proposed about $319 million for the development and purchase of underwater drones in the president’s budget for the coming fiscal year. It envisions them stealthily gathering intelligence on opponents, detecting and neutralizing mines, hunting submarines and charting the ocean floor. Last year, the Navy created the first deputy assistant secretary position focused on managing the development of unmanned systems, including underwater, surface and aerial efforts. Recent advances in autonomy, data transmission and miniaturized computing power coincide with the military’s increased interest in finding ways to integrate unmanned systems into its war planning. It’s part of a much broader strategy to leverage artificial intelligence and stay one step ahead of rivals, as the Pentagon did with guided weapons in the 1990s. “As tensions continue to grow with China and Russia, two militaries that have sophisticated and very large navies, there is a growing interest in making use of unmanned technology in the maritime sphere,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “They are scalable, they are dependable, they can operate with a fairly high degree of autonomy,” he said. “All these things would have been useful 30 years ago, but the technology wasn’t quite there.” The potential for naval drones to operate free of human operators was shown this year when the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency unveiled its Sea Hunter, a largely autonomous, unmanned anti-submarine vessel. The prototype 132-foot-long Sea Hunter is designed to sail on its own for as long as three months, find a submarine using sonar and other sensors and trail it while sending location data to human operators. The vessel completed its first performance trials off San Diego in late July, its builder, Reston, Va., company Leidos said. Underwater drones face different challenges than their aerial counterparts. For one, communication is more difficult, making it hard for an autonomous vehicle to report information it might pick up underwater. That hurdle is being worked on by Liquid Robotics, a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm that makes the Wave Glider. The unmanned vehicle floats on the surface and uses wave and solar power to propel itself and its sensors for as long as a year. The surfboard-shaped drone functions as a kind of gateway between underwater acoustic communications and air-based radio transmissions. The vehicle’s sensor computer connects a surface radio modem and antenna with an underwater acoustic modem, allowing information to be transmitted quickly back and forth. The same connection can be established with ships, though that can be expensive, or with buoys, which don’t allow for much movement. Other underwater vehicles have towed long antennas, but that is a much slower method of transmitting data, said Graham Hine, senior vice president of global partner development at Liquid Robotics. “We’re thinking it would be the router of the ocean,” he said. “Once you start to network things and then have ubiquitous communications and positioning, things start to get interesting.” The Wave Glider can carry a range of acoustic sensors that listen for vessels on the sea or piece together a picture of the ocean floor. Originally developed by company co-founders Roger Hine and Joseph Rizzi to listen to whale songs, the Wave Glider caught the interest of the Navy, which has worked with the company since 2008, Graham Hine said. Two years ago, the company struck a partnership with Boeing Co. to develop a military version, the Sensor Hosting Autonomous Remote Craft, or SHARC, that combines the Wave Glider platform with Boeing’s sensor technology. Boeing sees the platform as a potential communication conduit between underwater vehicles and aircraft, ships or satellites. It is working with the Navy’s research lab to develop additional capabilities for SHARC. “Ultimately, it is a more efficient and effective way to do maritime surveillance, we think, in large ocean areas,” said Egan Greenstein, senior director of autonomous maritime systems at Boeing. But to do a thorough job of surveillance and undersea data collection, drones need to stay submerged for weeks or even months without external help or power. In March, Boeing unveiled the 50-ton Echo Voyager, which is designed to carry out months-long surveillance and reconnaissance missions for defense, commercial and scientific customers. Powered by a hybrid electric-battery/marine diesel system, the drone periodically surfaces to snorkel depth to recharge its batteries by raising a mast and running the diesel engines. That’s when the drone also can connect to satellite operations to transmit data to operators. It can send limited communications while submerged, but only to a nearby ship. To bolster its endurance, the Echo Voyager has backup systems. To give it a degree of autonomy, the navigation system incorporates motion and rotation sensors, as well as sonar to avoid obstacles. The 51-foot Boeing Echo Voyager is an unmanned undersea vehicle intended to roam the ocean for weeks or months. (Boeing) Autonomous systems have the potential to cut personnel costs, but developing them has proved to be complex and costly. In February, the Navy canceled further production of a remote mine-hunting system developed by Lockheed Martin Corp., cutting down the expected order from 54 to 10 that had already been delivered. The system was to be used in the Navy’s new littoral combat ships, but the autonomous vehicles that towed mine-hunting sensors were unreliable. “The autonomy side of the equation, the research is happening at a very quick pace,” said Holland Michel of Bard College. “But as you see time and time again, it’s very challenging to make unmanned systems that can make intelligent and dependable decisions on their own.” Filed under: Drone, Navy Print Email Gmail Related Move Over Drones – Driverless Cars, Unmanned Ship Up Next Drones May Provide Big Lift to Agriculture When FAA Allows Their Use 4.3 Million Hobbyist Drones Will Be Sold by 2020, FAA Predicts Elbit Unveils the Seagull, a Seacraft That Can Take on Subs and Neutralize Sea Mines Navy Upgrades Despite Budget Cuts Subscribe to the Hamodia print edition More in Technology Another Failure in Search for Treatment to Slow Alzheimer’s INVESTIGATIVE REPORT: How Kellogg Worked With ‘Independent Experts’ to Tout Cereal Study: Dementia Rates Decline Sharply Among Senior Citizens Best Weather Satellite Ever Built Rockets Into Space Rocket Blasts Off for Int’l Space Station OP-ED Parties Don’t Matter.

Boeing Will Provide Justine First Posted: Aug 22, 2016 06:02 AM EDT Boeing will soon provide space taxis to the International Space Station. (Photo : NASA / Handout / Getty Images) After being dependent on Russia in flying astronauts to and from the space station for five years, Boeing is getting ready to take charge. Its CST-100 is currently on its way to replacing Russia's Soyuz. Advertisement Known as the Chief Builder of the International Space Station, Boeing thought it should be the one providing taxi services to American astronauts, reports Air & Space Mag. As of writing, the company's goal is becoming closer to reality as a new parking spot gets installed in the station. On Friday, August 19, NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins made a spacewalk and had an adapter attached on the docking port of the shuttle, according to a report made by TRT World. This device will enable the taxis being developed by Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies to park. In 2015, NASA aimed to install the first new docking port. The equipment, however, was destroyed due to a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident.  Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the installation of the second docking port in 2018. Priority maintenance tasks were also expected to be done; but, communication problems occurred with the space suit of Williams, leading to the spacewalk's end. Advertisement On September 1, the two astronauts are set to make another spacewalk. The activity aims to install a high-definition camera on the exterior frame of the station and take back an unused solar array cooling panel. Relying on Russia costs $70 million for each person; hence, ending the dependence will apparently lead to saving a significant amount of money which can be used for the development of other projects. Boeing, since the beginning of its operations, contributed a lot to the International Space Station's integration particularly its complicated parts. It also supports other enhancements for the station in 2024 and beyond. The enhancements include lithium-ion batteries for the solar arrays and new communication system. Lastly, it supports laboratory experiment racks. TagsBoeing, CST-100, international space station ©2016 ScienceWorldReport.com All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

By: PTI | Mumbai | Published:August 22, 2016 9:42 pm The Boeing Corporation on Monday said Jet Airways has asked it to delay the delivery of ten 787 Dreamliners scheduled for next year. The Boeing Corporation on Monday said Jet Airways has asked it to delay the delivery of ten 787 Dreamliners scheduled for next year. “Jet Airways has informed us that it does not want to take the delivery of the 10 787s as per schedule. The move follows its decision to retake a similar number of 777s from Etihad and Turkish Airlines, which were given on lease by the airline earlier,” Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president for sales, Asia Pacific & India at Boeing told reporters. Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual meet of the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, Keskar said Jet leased out these when the oil prices had hit the roof and now they are taking them back. On the commercial implications of the move on Boeing, he said, “This is just a delay in taking the deliveries and that there is plenty of orders with us, including from Jet and the decision is perfectly fine with us.” He said the company has USD 8 billion worth of orders from Jet for as 75 planes of 737-Max and an order from Spicejet for 55 such planes worth USD 6 billion. Also, there is USD 3 billion worth of orders from Air India for six Dreamliners and three 737-Maxes, he said. Keskar said over the past one decade alone, Boeing has got orders worth USD 25 billion from domestic airlines and is expected to touch USD 265 billion or 1850 commercial planes over the next 20 years. Sounding very optimistic about Boeing’s prospects in the country, given the unprecedented growth in domestic aviation sector that has been clipping at over 20 per cent, and the rapidly increasing cooperation in the defence space, he said going forward his company will increase businesses with domestic companies both in software and hardware. While Boeing has technology partnerships with Infosys, Wipro, HCL and Infotech, it has manufacturing tie-ups with a many Tata Group companies and Bharat Forge. Both of this will only increase going forward, he said without quantifying it. On the defence side, Boeing is increasing collaboration with the Air Force and the Navy and has delivered five P-8is Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft to the Navy, on schedule as part of a contract for eight aircraft for over USD 1 billion contract awarded in 2009. Watch Video: What’s making news That apart, it has also delivered C10 -17s and worth USD 4 billion and will be co-producing the attack choppers Apaches and the Chinok brand of transport choppers for the Navy and the Air Force.

Korolev Rocket and Space Corp (RSC Energia) and the US aerospace giant Boeing reached an agreement to solve their dispute over the Sea Launch rocket project, Energia’s General Director Vladimir Solntsev has said. The Izvestia report on the settlement has not yet been confirmed by US sources. The dispute goes back many years and in September 2015 the US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion dollar compensation from its former partners in the Sea Launch project, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. “We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on Sea Launch in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute’s] settlement,” Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. He added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a programme of long-term cooperation, which included projects covering space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator – the best possible location for launch – which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth’s rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-per cent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia. Despite the re-started operation, orders for Sea Launch satellite work has dried up.

By Paul Ausick August 22, 2016 9:35 am EST Print Email Tweet As of August 16, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) has taken net orders totaling 38 for its four wide-body jets: the 747, 767, 777 and 787. The company guided full-year orders for all its commercial planes at 535 and wide-body orders totaling 215. To date, the company has booked 335 orders, of which 297 are for the narrow-body 737. With just over a quarter of the year remaining, Boeing has taken orders for less than 20% of the wide-body planes it has forecast. The company has begun walking back its planned increase of 787 production, currently 12 per month, to 14 per month by the end of the decade. In Boeing’s conference call discussing second-quarter results, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said: Our principle here is to keep wide body supply and demand in balance. And we’re confident in the 787 program across that span of scenarios, and we’re going to continue to work campaigns to fill out to the 14 a month rate step-up, and we’ll evaluate timelines and decisions around that. But you can be very confident that whatever we decide, we’re going to keep supply and demand in balance. In what may be an even more important decision, the company is now planning to reduce production of the current model 777 from 8.3 per month to 7.0 per month early next year, with an eye to reducing the rate to 5.5 per month in 2018. The 777 Classic, as it’s called, is a bridge to production of the new 777X, which is due for production in 2020. Last month the president of the company’s commercial division said that orders for the 777 Classic are “pretty solid” through the third quarter of 2017. According to Aviation Week, 777 production is about 55% sold for 2018 and 30% sold for 2019. Boeing’s chief financial officer told a conference audience earlier this month that over the next couple of months the company will have more insight into orders for the 777 Classic, “We’ll either solidify those orders and be able to [match the bridge plan], or we’ll modify the production rate, at least through that bridge.” Through August 16, Boeing’s backlog of orders totaled 5,697 commercial jets, of which 4,404 are orders for the 737. The 777 backlog is 476, including both the Classic and the 777X, of which just 170 are orders for the Classic. At a production rate of seven per month that backlog will last two years, but that leaves Boeing with no backlog until the 777X is in production. The company has admitted it needs 40 to 50 new orders per year for the 777 in order to bridge the production gap between the new and old versions of the plane. So far this year it has taken eight new orders.

Atherton posted Aug 23rd, 2016 at 11:01am Boeing Promotional Image For Boeing T-X Trainer Just the tip of the plane is visible here. Black metal faintly lit against a dark backdrop gives just the slightest hint of an airplane. The glimpses are parts of a teaser trailer for the Boeing and Saab designed T-X, their entry into a trainer jet competition for the Air Force. If the video is slowed down just enough, it’s possible to see just the tip of the plane: There’s also a trailer with a half-second view of plane from overhead, looking very much like a narrow dart. The competition's goal is to replace the Air Force’s existing T-38 trainers, which have trained Air Force jet pilots since the 1960s. Airplanes have advanced quite a bit since then, so the Air Force wants to make sure their new trainer can adequately prepare new pilots for modern planes. Besides the Boeing and Saab collaboration, three other teams (including Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman) are putting forth bids for the contract to replace the trainer. The Air Force plans to start looking at proposals in December, and we’re starting to see glimpses of many of the designs already in the works. Ultimately, the Air Force is looking to buy 350 new jets to train their pilots on for decades to come, and a 350-jet contract is pretty good business for whatever team can get it. So what will the Boeing- and Saab-designed trainer jet actually look like? The announcement page says “Stay tuned for the reveal in September 2016!” Conveniently, that’s the same month as the Air Force Association's Air & Space Conference and Technology Exposition. Expect it to make a debut in the lead up to that conference.

Mr Brownlee says having an underwater surveillance capability deters interference with the sea lines of communication that New Zealand and many of its friends rely on for trade purposes. “Knowing what is happening underwater is integral to monitoring submarine activity,” Mr Brownlee says. “This is particularly important in the Asia-Pacific region which is home to two-thirds of the world’s submarines. “The current Orion systems are old and have become less reliable. “I am pleased that New Zealand businesses Safe Air, Beca and Marops Limited will also be involved in supporting this acquisition through its life, with around 25 per cent of the value of the contract being spent with these companies.” The recently released 2016 Defence White Paper confirmed the importance of the New Zealand Defence Force having capabilities to cope with the realities of a complex and changing strategic environment, and to enable it to operate across a broad spectrum of geographic and operating environments. Work is already underway within Defence on the Future Air Surveillance Capability project which will select a replacement for the Orion aircraft, which is due to retire from service in the mid-2020s.

AI made operating profit of a little over Rs 100 crore in 2015-16, gaining benefits from reduced jet fuel prices. Its accounts are yet to be audited and it has not shared other financial details. This will be its first operating profit since merger with Indian Airlines in 2007. AI had 27 Boeing 787s on order and has inducted 21 of these. It will add two more this year and the other four next year. And, take delivery of three Boeing 777-300ER planes from 2018 onwards.  The deliveries are part of a $11 billion deal in 2005, for 68 planes. Its low cost arm, Air India Express, is inducting six Boeing 737s on lease this year. Last week, TAL Manufacturing Solutions, a subsidiary of Tata Motors, supplied the  5,000th advanced composite floor beam used in the 787 aircraft.  TAL's facility in Nagpur,  the only non-US facility to supply the floor beams used in the 787, has been providing the floor beams as a part of the manufacturer offset clause in AI's aircraft order of 2005. “We have fulfilled our obligations, including construction of a MRO (maintenance and repair outfit) in Nagpur and AI has begun carrying out checks on aircraft there,” said Keskar.

(Photo : Getty Images/NASA) The United States astronauts went on a spacewalk on Aug. 19, Friday to install a new door or 'parking space' for the visitors at the International Space Station.    The two American astronauts, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, took just a few hours to hook up the docking port. SpaceX had earlier in July accomplished the task of delivering this new gateway packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule.    Advertisement Like Us on Facebook Williams told  NASA TV, "It is a significant door opening in the history of human space exploration," Florida Today reported. NASA has termed the gear as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will pave the way for emergence a new breed of US spacecrafts. This pivotal and first of its kind step which will result in the launch of commercial crew capsules sooner than expected -- It can happen sometime in the next year. The Americans haven't launched into orbit from their home turf since 2011, when NASA rocketed its last shuttle flight.   SpaceX and Boeing are now expected to begin human launches from Cape Canaveral in a year or two. But it would have been impossible for their crew capsules to dock without this new parking spot, which has replaced the old-fashioned shuttle setup. Friday's success will open new avenues for the future of spaceships."We have a port of call for the new U.S. commercial crew vehicles,' announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias,The Daily Mail reported.  A year from now, SpaceX will conduct a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts on board.  Boeing too is aiming to test its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until that happens, Russia will continue to provide all the rides.  The docking adaptor will be the first among two such additions to the space station, with the second likely to be installed in 2018.  Boeing has built the circular adaptor which measures around 42 inches (one meter) long and about 63 inches wide. Kenneth Todd, ISS operations integration manager has termed Friday's installation a "very significant milestone on the path to the establishment of commercial crew capability."  The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction which aims to carry astronauts to the space station.  The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment as it allows automatic parking instead of the grapple and berthing process in place currently, and which requires astronauts.  A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival.  Advertisement Tags:International Space Station SpaceX Astronauts Jeffrey Williams Kate Rubins parking spaces Copyright 2015 en.yibada.com All rights reserved.

The ambitious plan sounds almost laughable when it reveals that it could begin testing as early as 2017, but then you remember that whole part about being the second largest aeronautics company in the US and the fact that most of the technology to do this already exists. Passengers looking for an autonomous taxi ride would book a seat on a zenHop ‘City Airbus’ drone and proceed to a zenHub helipad. From the helipad, they’d be flown to their destination for approximately the same cost as a taxi due to the cost-savings in sharing the ride with several passengers. Since space is at a premium, luggage (if you have any) would be ferried across town by another service, zenLuggage, all while security experts at — wait for it — zenCyber keep you safe from hackers. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Aside from the fascination with the word zen, the plan — codenamed Vahana — makes sense. It’s also feasible, at least in a hypothetical sense. Airbus is keeping the electric aircraft design under wraps, but it did release an artist rendition of what the autonomous taxis could look like. Airbus has been working on the drone-like design for two years, and according to the press release it “could soon become reality without having to wait for too many regulatory changes.” Fingers crossed. via Engadget Future of urban mobility on Airbus Read next: Watch an iPhone fall to its death in this crazy bungee jumping incident Tech Share on Facebook (339) Share on Twitter (406) Bryan Clark is a reporter from San Diego, CA.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, quickly began hooking up a docking port that will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. SpaceX is shooting for a launch of its supped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person test flight of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides – at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA divested itself of cargo deliveries a few years back, hiring private U.S. companies to carry out shipments. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. A repeat effort This is actually NASA’s second newfangled docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-by-5-foot ports at the 250-mile-high lab. Another one, cobbled together from spare parts, should fly up in about a year. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. First, though, Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on September 1 to retract a radiator. Williams, a veteran spacewalker, was the first one through the hatch Friday morning. “Come on out,” he urged Rubins. “The view is phenomenal,” Rubins marveled before getting straight to work. Rubins is now part of an exclusive sorority: She is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th woman in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder that, along with this new docking port, arrived on a Dragon cargo capsule in mid-July. Travel plans SpaceX’s crew Dragon – an enhanced version of its cargo ship – will fly from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights, intended to go all the way to the space station and dock, will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots.

But unlike Kiwisaver, ordinary working people in NZ don’t have any choice about where NZ Super invests our money even though we are paying for it,” said Auckland Peace Action member Valerie Morse “It is totally abhorrent that our retirement fund is making money from war,” said Ms Morse. “Our screens are filled with the horrors of war every day. We see children being killed by bombs and missile strikes across the Middle East. The very least we can do is to make sure that we are not contributing to this devastation.“ “It doesn’t take an investment specialist to know that investing in war is wrong and unethical. Weapons companies profit from war and misery.” The NZ Super Fund currently has $27 million in investments in Boeing, $7.6 million in BAE, and $9.1 million in Raytheon. These are just three of many of the companies that NZ Super invests in that are involved in weapons production.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Table of contents LM Handed $10B Deal on C-130J Super Hercules | Kalashnikov Opens Store at Moscow Airport | Japan’s MoD Looks to Increase Defense Budget Aug 22, 2016 00:53 UTC by Defense Industry Daily staff Americas The US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has scheduled the testing of the SM-3 Block 2A ballistic missile defense interceptor this October. A joint development involving both the MDA and Japan, the interceptor has been previously flight tested twice by the agency without any target intercepts initially planned. October’s test will see it engage and destroy a medium-range ballistic missile target. If successful, the SM-3 will be in full-rate production in 2017. Contractors aiming to secure deals in relation to the Navy’s MQ-25A program have been given vague hints at what the service is expecting. Hopefuls looking to secure a slice of the action have been told they need to get that “sweet spot” between supporting mission tanking and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Born out of the scrapped Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS) program, the MQ-25 Stingray looks to include higher endurance for ISR capabilities in addition to just refueling. A lot of food for thought for those looking to get involved, but at least the initial “stealth tanker” concept has been shelved, for now. Chemical and biological contamination testing is one of the few remaining tasks left to be ticked off on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter before certification for full-rate production. In order to do this, a decontamination system and facility has been constructed at Edwards Air Force Base in California and an F-35A attached to the 461st Flight Test Squadron will be the lucky volunteer. The late August tests will see the fighter (modified to be able to collect test data) contaminated several times and towed into the decontamination facility to see if it can be cleaned of chemical or biological weapons exposure. Last week ended on an extremely good note for both Boeing and Lockheed Martin after the companies were awarded major multi-billion contracts by the USAF. For Boeing, an impressive $2.8 billion award was granted on Thursday as part of the low rate initial production of the KC-46A following the tanker’s Milestone C decision earlier this month. 19 aircraft will be produced alongside spare parts, engines and refueling pods. However, this was astronomically dwarfed on Friday when Lockheed Martin was handed a $10 billion deal for all future orders of the C-130J Super Hercules production program as well as any foreign military sales for the aircraft. Europe Surplus military vehicles have made their way to the Lithuanian armed forces over the last six months through a bilateral defense agreement with the Netherlands. The influx comes as part of a $7.89 million deal, which is providing a phased delivery of vehicles and equipment to bulk up Lithuania’s Baltic Fleet. Lithuania, alongside neighbors Estonia, Latvia and Poland are playing host to a four-battalion NATO force sent to provide a deterrent to any further Russian expansionism. Moscow, on the other hand, sees their presence so close to its own borders as inflammatory and expansionist in its own right. Flying from Moscow and need a last minute gift for a friend on the other side? Well alongside the usual airport fare of fridge magnets and duty-free vodka, Sheremetyevo airport now has its very own Kalashnikov store. Known across the world for the being the father of the infamous AK-47, the company has set up shop selling all things AK including pens, umbrellas, bags, hats, camouflage gear and “I love AK” T-shirts. Model guns are also available, but we’ve been assured that they don’t pose any security problems. Kalashnakov: looking to saturate its wares in the retail market as well as on the battlefield. Asia Pacific Japan’s ministry of defense is to request some $51 billion for its 2017 budget, a new record. The request comes as the government of Shinzo Abe further angles toward increasing the country’s military prowess and rewriting the constitution to remove a pacifist clause imposed on its armed forces at the end of the Second World War. An increasingly daring Chinese military has been a cause for worry for many of its neighbors, all of whom are currently rushing to modernize their naval and air capabilities with US and European hardware. If the funds are secured, Tokyo plans to funnel a portion of the money to its joint development of the new SM-3 Block 2A interceptor and upgrade its F-15 fighters. Approval has been given for the Indian ministry of defense to procure one additional C-130J Super Hercules, adding to six recently ordered by New Delhi in a $1 billion deal. The new aircraft was earmarked to replace one that crashed during an exercise in 2014, resulting in the death of five crew members. Once delivered, the aircraft will most likely be based in West Bengal’s Panagarh, which has been slated to be the base of the Indian Air Force’s second C-130J hub.

(NASA) After 15 years as a pure research lab, the International Space Station (ISS) might be ready for business. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it has become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” The International Space Station.

(NASA) NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, NASA stressed that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an email. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies, declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. During an almost six-hour spacewalk Aug. 19, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body – from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure – as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-Earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science … of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and nonprofits to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about 4 inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

(Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer) McDonnell Douglas-made MD-80s are being put out to pasture By Justin Bachman • Bloomberg Aug 23, 2016 (…) Andrew Harrer An American Airlines McDonnnell Douglas MD-80 (N266AA) aircraft takes off at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Va., on Feb. 19, 2010. (Bloomberg photo by Andrew Harrer) As summer draws to a close, American Airlines is hastening the pace at which it sends aged McDonnell Douglas MD-80s to the aircraft boneyard. Five years into a revamp of its fleet, the world's largest carrier on Tuesday will retire 20 MD-80-family aircraft, "one of the largest single-day aircraft retirements in airline history," according to American. "Summer is the busiest time of the year for airlines, and with summer flying winding down, we can go ahead and park these aircraft," the company said in a statement. The planes being sent Tuesday to the Roswell International Air Center in New Mexico are, on average, 28 years old, about five years older than the carrier's overall MD-80 fleet. American plans to retire 45 MD-80s this year, most of them in the third quarter, and be rid of all of them by the end of 2017 as part of a fleet renewal project. Economically, the MD-80 is no match for the newer Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family of aircraft that have replaced it. American, which ordered 460 new Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. jets in 2011, says the 737-800 and A321 jets replacing the MD-80 are 35 percent more fuel efficient on a per-seat basis. Two other U.S. MD-80 operators, Delta Air Lines Inc. and Allegiant Travel Co., both plan to quit the jet in the next few years. The MD-80 is a modernized version of the Douglas DC-9, which gained range and weight capabilities in the DC-9 80, dubbed by McDonnell Douglas as the Super 80 Series. The first Super 80 (a moniker only American chose to retain among U.S. carriers) flew in October 1979. American took its first of the 140-seat jets four years later, and at its peak had nearly 375 of them in service-the largest operator of the almost 1,200 MD-80s sold to airlines across the globe. Later variants added fuel and performance enhancements. The model has enjoyed a strong safety record, with two of the most high-profile MD-80 crashes attributed to human error. In August 2008, a Spanair MD-82 crashed while departing Madrid, killing 154 people, after pilots had incorrectly configured the plane for takeoff. In January 2000, an Alaska Airlines MD-83 crashed off the California coast while trying to divert to Los Angeles. The accident was blamed on improper maintenance, which caused a key horizontal stabilizer component to fail in flight. That crash killed 88. Last year, a Delta Air Lines MD-80 slid off a snowy runway while landing in New York City. No one was injured seriously. Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Who's hired?

Aviation enthusiasts occasionally refer to it as the "mad dog" owing to the MD designation, or even the "angry puppy." "You really earn your pay" flying the MD-80, an American pilot told Bloomberg Businessweek in a 2008 interview.

Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) on Tuesday launched a website offering a “sneak peek” at the design it has prepared with Saab for the so-called T-X training jet that will replace the venerable T-38. Over the weekend, Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) and its partners began runway testing of its clean-sheet design to replace the T-38. Boeing first teased its design at the Air Force Association conference in September of last year and is planning to reveal the new plane on September 13 at the company’s defense facilities in St. Louis, just a week before this year’s conference. Boeing’s T-X spokeswoman, Rachelle Lockhart, said of the company’s decision to go with an all-new design: We’re investing in the future of the Air Force, and we saw an opportunity to build something better from inception. We could give the Air Force exactly what it wanted while meeting its requirements and schedule. In addition to the clean-sheet design from Northrop Grumman and its partners, BAE Systems and L-3 Communications Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LLL), as well as Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Corp. (NYSE: RTN), also are proposing modified versions of existing training jets. Lockheed has teamed up with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and plans to offer a modified KAI T-50. Raytheon is partnering with Italy’s Leonardo (formerly Alenia-Aermacchi) on a modified M-346 training jet built by the Italian firm and designated the T-100. The Air Force released its final draft RFP last month and is expected to have the final document released late this year or early next. That will start the clock running on a one-year evaluation phase, according to Aviation Week. A milestone decision is expected early in fiscal year 2018 and entry into service is currently set for 2024. The initial phase of the contract is worth about $8.4 billion, but the total could run much higher. The Air Force plans to buy 350 of the new planes.

Published: 11:17 August 23, 2016 Alexander Cornwell, Staff Reporter   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE DUBAI: Nepal Airlines has held informal stake sale talks with a Middle East airline after the Nepalese government mandated it to find a “strategic partner,” its managing director said Monday. The state-owned carrier is in the midst of a turnaround, having recently brought in two Airbus A320 narrow body jets and with plans to bring in two A330 wide-bodies as it phases out out-of-production Boeing 757s. It resumed flights to Dubai from Kathmandu on August 18 after a four-year hiatus and is considering more than doubling its network to 19 destinations. Nepal's government wants the airline to bring in an outside investor to fast track the expansion plan that also includes adding at least one new aircraft a year from 2017. “The government is quite serious,” managing director Sugat Ratna Kansakar told Gulf News following an evening Monday press conference in Dubai. He told Gulf News that executives from a Middle East airline recently visited him in Kathmandu for “informal talks” about purchasing a stake. He declined to provide further details on the airline. Nepal’s government could sell as much as 51 per cent of the airline to Nepalese or foreign investors and retain minority ownership, he said. Majority foreign ownership would not change the airline’s status as Nepal’s flag carrier, he added. Nepal’s government believes an outside investor-led expansion would give the airline a greater share of passenger traffic, of which over 90 per cent of the market is at present controlled by foreign airlines, according to Kansakar.

On Sunday Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said “we are close to our targets” on employment and inflation, adding to recent comments from his central bank colleagues that suggest the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously thought. That further raised the already-high anticipation for a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, this Friday, at the annual central bankers’ meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her comments will be scrutinised for fresh clues. “Stan Fischer’s comments clearly raised the risk of a more hawkish tone from Yellen on Friday,” Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, told Bloomberg. “So that’s impacting the dollar, risk assets and commodity prices.” Wall Street was mixed. In 2.43pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.09 percent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.03 percent higher. In 2.28pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.15 percent. In the Dow, declines in shares of Apple and those of Johnson & Johnson, last 1 percent and 0.7 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Visa and those of Boeing, up 0.5 percent and 0.4 respectively. “We have been moving back and forth with this [Fed] rate increase for a while,” Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, told Bloomberg. “If you look at valuations, they’re not particularly cheap, so indeed markets have been very well supported. Therefore, they’re worried that interest rates will go up.” Deal news offered a boost. Shares of Medivation jumped, up 19.7 percent as of 2.49pm in New York after Pfizer won a takeover battle for the maker of cancer drug Xtandi, with a deal worth about US$14 billion. Shares of Pfizer traded 0.4 percent weaker as of 2.45pm in New York. “The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,” Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1 percent slip from the previous close, as a drop in mining stocks weighed on the market. France’s CAC 40 index declined 0.2 percent, the UK’s FTSE 100 index fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX index retreated 0.5 percent. Shares of Syngenta rallied, closing 10.6 percent higher, as state-owned China National Chemical won approval from the US national security regulator for its US$43 billion takeover of the Swiss chemical and seed company. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz said it was a “major milestone for the deal,” adding in a note to clients that “approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders,” Reuters reported. Kepler Cheuvreux rates Syngenta shares a "Buy".

You won’t find a class like it anywhere but at the new Richland 2 Institute of Innovation. The students of the inaugural class at what officials call R2i2 were introduced to their new $40 million facility at the Village at Sandhill on Monday. This is not your mama’s career center. In fact, it’s not at all what R2i2 director Kevin Alberse would consider the typical career and technology education center for students. “We want our kids to be immediately and immensely employable,” Alberse said. “The advantages that they’ll have is when they learn these skills ahead of their counterparts, they’re actually going to be ahead of the curve. The goal is to make the students “the creators and the innovators of the next thing that happens rather than waiting on something else to happen,” he said. About 80 students, – juniors and seniors drawn from Richland 2’s five high schools – are taking take one of six unique classes offered this semester: ▪  Mobile and nontraditional food service. ▪  Application development for Apple equipment. ▪  Supply chain and global logistics management. ▪  Managerial accounting and finance. ▪  Computer-aided design and manufacturing. ▪  Alternative energy and fuel cell development. These classes are designed to be geared toward local industries and employers such as Volvo and Boeing and exclusively use computer software that R2i2 students will get to learn earlier than their counterparts in college, Alberse said. “I would hope for any of (the students) to get a better understanding of what they might like to do in the future, but also to get a better understanding of what opportunities there are in the future,” said Kirstin Bullington, who teaches an class that will focus on non-fossil fuel energy and engineering for environmental sustainability. “Here, we’re not really restricted by end-of-course exams or whatever else, so if they have an idea, we can explore it,” she said. “This is the way education’s supposed to be.” Unique building features – such as exposed pipes and ducts for study of energy sources and classrooms big enough to drive a food truck into – are designed to complement classes that can also mesh with each another. For example, the food truck entrepreneurship class might partner with the supply chain class and the managerial accounting class as students learn the basics of running a business. Abriana Gibbs, a 17-year-old senior at Blythewood High, is one of five classmates in Mincey’s the food truck class. Already accepted to Johnson & Wales University culinary school in Charlotte, Gibbs said she expects to learn skills about working collaboratively and how to treat people in service situations. She and fellow students will not only learn the basics of entrepreneurship and managing a business, but will work directly with food truck businesses from the community to create and serve meals at R2i2. Some of Gibbs’ classmates said they were drawn to the class because they enjoy cooking or, like 16-year-old Megan Boyd, because they hope to run or own a business one day. “I’m hoping to learn patience because you’ve got to be able to work with people and know how to handle different attitudes and personalities day-to-day in customers.” said Boyd, a Blythewood junior. The roughly 215,000-square-foot R2i2 facility – paid for with $40 million in unused bond debt – is home to much more than the six initial R2i2 courses. Sharing the space are: ▪ 185 new offices and spaces for district personnel, including Superintendent Debbie Hamm, along with a new room for school board meetings. Richland 2 officials long wanted new headquarters to replace the one next to Forest Lake Elementary. The concept of R2i2 started about six years ago just as new district offices before expanding to the idea of a learning center, said Jack Carter, the district’s chief operations officer. ▪  The relocated Sandhills branch of the Richland County library, which is expected to open in its 30,000-square-foot wing by November. ▪  A conference center capable of seating nearly 700 people. The space can be rented for community events as which beer and wine can be served. The center already is reserved for a fundraiser, a business expo and two proms, Carter said.

Reston, Virginia-based Leidos’ Monday volume totaled 5.83 million shares compared to the three-month average of 2.97 million and the government services contractor has climbed 5.63 percent since Aug. 17, the company’s first full day after its merger with the former Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) services segment. The U.S. stock bellwether S&P 500 composite index has slowed down from its rally since early July as investors have examined comments from Federal Reserve leaders on monetary policy and also turned some attention to commodities such as crude oil ahead of a September OPEC meeting. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to address the Economic Policy Symposium Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Crude futures in New York fell 3.03 percent to $47.05 and that decline sent the S&P energy sector down nearly a percent, while the London Brent benchmark tumbled 3.36 percent to $49.17 a barrel.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED US stocks end mixed as oil falls Margreet Dietz Tuesday August 23, 2016 Share Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen Play NBR radio on The latest hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official weighed on equities and lifted the greenback as investors try to gauge the timing of a US interest rate increase. Lower oil prices also pushed energy stocks down. Major US stock indexes haven’t covered much ground in recent weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500 notched its 31st consecutive session without a move of 1% or more in either direction, the longest such stretch in two years. The index hit its 11th record of the year on August 15 but has since pulled back. On Sunday, Fed vice-chairman Stanley Fischer said: "We are close to our targets" on employment and inflation, adding to recent comments from his central bank colleagues that suggest the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously thought. That further raised the already high anticipation for a speech by Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen, this Friday, at the annual central bankers' meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her comments will be scrutinised for fresh clues. "Stan Fischer's comments clearly raised the risk of a more hawkish tone from Mrs Yellen on Friday," Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, told Bloomberg. "So that's impacting the dollar, risk assets and commodity prices." Wall Street mixed  At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 23.15 points, or 0.1%, to 18,529.42. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 0.1% higher to 5244.60  higher while the S&P 500 Index moved down just 1,2 points to 2182.36. In the Dow, declines in shares of Apple and those of Johnson & Johnson, last 1% and 0.7% weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Visa and those of Boeing, up 0.5% and 0.4 respectively. The S&P 500’s energy sector lost 0.9%. Shares of Marathon Oil fell 6.9%. Halliburton lost 3.8%. US crude oil snapped a seven-session winning streak to close down 3% at $US47.05 a barrel, its biggest drop since August 1. Pfizer wins Medivation bidding Deal news offered a boost. Shares of Medivation jumped, up 19.7% after Pfizer won a takeover battle for the maker of cancer drug Xtandi, with a deal worth about $US14 billion. Shares of Pfizer traded 0.4% weaker. "The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer," Ian Read, Pfizer's chief executive officer, said in a statement. "The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer's Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1% slip from the previous close, as a drop in mining stocks weighed on the market. France's CAC 40 index declined 0.2%, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell 0.4% while Germany's DAX index retreated 0.5%. Shares of Syngenta rallied, closing 10.6% higher, as state-owned China National Chemical won approval from the US national security regulator for its $US43 billion takeover of the Swiss chemical and seed company. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz said it was a "major milestone for the deal," adding in a note to clients that "approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders," Reuters reported. Kepler Cheuvreux rates Syngenta shares a "buy." (BusinessDesk) Click the hamburger symbol top right of our homepage to access the Rich List 2016 and other sections. Got a question about this story?

(Photo : NASA/Newsmakers) Recent news revealed that top U.S. space agency NASA is considering to hand over the ISS to private companies. Advertisement This was after the new docking system was installed on the International Space Station (ISS). The new docking system will enable private spaceflight companies such as Boeing and SpaceX to dock their own space shuttles capable of transporting crew from the Earth to the ISS and back.   Newest addition at station will allow future crew vehicles from Boeing and SpaceX to dock. https://t.co/IVWrl6hvDS pic.twitter.com/bgGV5bGj3d — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 20, 2016    NASA's management of the ISS is about to end in 2024 and according to a news report, NASA has confirmed that it has plans to transfer the management of the space laboratory to private or commercial companies in 2024. According to reports, this is due to NASA's move to shift focus in deeper space explorations such as the Journey to Mars. Traveling beyond the low-Earth orbit, NASA will have to rely on new and more innovative space systems to allow observation and even human landing on the red planet. The ISS is a key space laboratory where various experimentations are being held. It is an integral part of space research and in the maintenance of satellites and other engines in space that are governed by the U.S. government. Of course, NASA's hunger to go in deep space shouldn't mean the end of the ISS, so a transfer of management might be inevitable. Over the years, the ISS has been a prolific testing ground for breakthrough space technologies, like the Bigelow Aerospace's expandable module called BEAM. ISS and NASA have always been in cooperation with other nation's space agencies to man the space station. Roscosmos of Russia and ESA of Britain have been partners of NASA for a long time sending their astronauts and cosmonauts to perform space duty for months at a time. After the news broke out, the next question was who are the top companies being considered for the management of the ISS? Although there are no confirmed names yet, rumors are Boeing and SpaceX are more likely to be considered since they are developing space shuttles for NASA that fits the newly installed modules on the ISS. Boeing is developing its CST-100 Starliner that is set to launch in 2018. "We're working toward our first unmanned flight in 2017, followed by a manned astronaut flight in 2018," Leanne Caret, Boeing's executive vice president, said in an interview with GeekWire. The ISS will deorbit in 2020 with the operational mission set until 2024.

(NYSE: NOC) has begun testing its clean-sheet design for a new U.S. Air Force training jet to replace the decades old T-38. According to a report at Aviation Week, the new trainer, designated as the T-X by the Air Force, began taxi testing in Mojave, California. Northrop Grumman and its partners, BAE Systems and L-3 Communications Holdings Corp. (NYSE: LLL), are one of four teams that are expected to compete for the $8.4 billion contract. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) has partnered with Saab and is expected to offer its own clean-sheet design, while Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) has teamed up with Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) and they are expected to offer a modified KAI T-50. The fourth competitor is a group led by Raytheon Corp. (NYSE: RTN) that includes Italy’s Leonardo and Canada’s CAE Inc. (NYSE: CAE), and it is expected to present a version of Leonardo’s M-346 trainer that the group calls the T-100. The U.S. Air Force has released a draft request for proposal (RFP) for a fleet of some 350 training jets to replace the T-38. The draft is expected to be followed by a final RFP by the end of this year with a contract award due in 2017 or early 2018. The unique draft RFP offers incentives for exceeding threshold performance specifications, including high-g force maneuvering, high angle-of-attack maneuvering and aerial refueling. The threshold for high-g force maneuvering is 6.5 g and the objective is 7.5 g. For every 0.1 g above the threshold, the bidder receives a point bonus. Other things equal, including price, the bidder with higher sustained g-capability will receive a higher rating overall. Aviation Week included the following unattributed photo with its story. Source: Courtesy Aviation Week Lockheed and its partners completed the first test flight of the modified KAI T-50 in June. The Raytheon team had their trainer a last month’s Farnborough Airshow, and the Boeing-led team has said next to nothing about their entry.

WARRENDALE, Pa. (PRWEB) August 22, 2016 The SAE 2016 Aerospace Systems and Technology Conference provides attendees the opportunity to participate in plenary panel discussions with the industry’s experts and leaders at the show September 27-30, 2016 in Hartford, Connecticut. With a plenary panel discussion happening each day of the conference, attendees have the ability to learn the latest innovations in the industry and renew and develop important business relationships within the international aerospace industry. Innovations in Integrated Propulsion Systems & Aircraft Systems On Tuesday, September 27 at 9:30 AM, representatives from MIT, AHS, GE Aviation, Lockheed Martin, Rolls-Royce and Air Force Research Laboratory will examine how in this age of higher fuel costs, lower profits margins, high competition, and environmental stewardship, the integration of propulsion and aircraft systems has increasingly blurred the lines between systems and added complexity. This panel seeks to expound upon the innovations that are under development in the classic component areas and the integrated systems development, and then further that discussion with a view of the future. What needs to be done now to assure the Aerospace and Defense Industry maintains the level of safety, technology, and economics advantages while addressing the pressures of the consumer markets? For more information on the panel and the speakers, please click here. Innovations in Intelligent Aircraft Systems Kicking off day 2 of the conference at 8:30 AM is the keynote plenary panel discussion comprised of representatives from Pratt and Whitney, Boeing, NASA, UTAS, Airbus Americas, and Sikorsky. It is envisioned that the Connected Aircraft will follow the “internet of things” evolution, with resulting value added services to all parties in the value chain. Providing services to the operators, such as real-time analytics and diagnostics, improved scheduling of catering, fuel delivery and other ground services are just some examples of a true “Connected Aircraft”. Unlike the consumer sector, the aircraft industry poses some unique challenges, the longevity of the aircraft coupled with the complexity and cost of modification goes against the consumer sector’s approach for continuous and frequent changes. The additional IT complexity and infrastructure required will necessitate significant changes in facilities, personnel and operations. Operators of multiple fleet types, containing different aircraft equipment, face an added challenge of having consistent and uniform connected aircraft operations across their fleets. The goal of the panel is to explore the technologies in development and map out those that need to be developed, discuss potential solutions and foster dialogue among panel participants and attendees on new approaches and ideas. For more details on the panel or speakers, please click here. Innovations in Aircraft Systems Integration To begin the final day of the conference at 8:30 AM, speakers from UTRC, Moog, NASA, Thales and drR2 will examine innovations in aircraft systems integration. It is envisioned that the More Electric Aircraft and Transformative Vertical Flight will result in higher performance, added capability, and more reliable platform. The initial demonstrations by NASA in the early 1990’s are being used in the latest commercial and military planes. The next generation of more integrated systems, such as integrated propulsion, power, and control, is well underway and yielding positive results. The challenges of integrating seemingly disparate functions are well documented, and present real obstacles to implementation, not to mention the cost of designing/testing/certifying entirely new systems. For more information on this panel and panelists, please click here. In addition to the keynotes, there is a full technical program in place. Be sure to secure your attendance at the only event that provides the breadth and depth of technical presentations across commercial, military and general aviation.

Allen teamed with aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which was the first commercial vehicle to reach space in 2004. Now he's building Stratolaunch, the world's largest airplane. (Ricky Carioti/Washington Post) Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson's goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. More than 700 people have bought tickets -- at $250,000 each -- to ride on his spacecraft. By Christian Davenport, The Washington Post Published: August 22, 2016, 6:00 AM A   A Later this year, tech entrepreneur turned space pioneer Elon Musk is planning the blastoff of a new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, that would be twice as powerful as any other in use and one of the biggest since the Apollo era’s mighty Saturn V. The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph — over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeff Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all — making space travel routine — in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs — whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” “Not quite ‘rarest,’ ” Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult — landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast — about five miles per second — that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor — “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea — a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Life-long quest Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” Dreams of space tourism In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he’s proud that more than 700 people — more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space — have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.” The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. ‘Crest of another wave’ For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. … Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Facts 2016-08-22T14:59+02:00 14:59 22.08.2016 Consideration of Ukraine's claim against Russia over terrorism financing to start by end of year - Klimkin Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin expects the UN International Court of Justice to start hearing Kyiv's claim against Russia regarding violations of the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism before the end of 2016. "An arbitration proceeding regarding the International Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism is due to begin this year," the minister told the press in Kyiv on Monday. Speaking of the UN International Court of Justice's hearing on this claim, Klimkin said Ukraine was not expecting any problems. "As to the convention, that situation is clear from the legal angle, because Russia has recognized jurisdiction of the UN International Court of Justice over a limited list of conventions, among them the Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism," the minister said. Also, the investigative team tasked with identifying and indicting persons behind the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 crash in Donbas on July 17, 2014, comprising representatives of the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia, Belgium and Ukraine will post initial results of its criminal inquiry in late September, the Ukrainian foreign minister said. "You must have heard that our Dutch friends plan to publish the second part of the report on the Malaysian Boeing tragedy in late September. We will definitely keep that in mind," he said. Klimkin also mentioned Ukraine's claim against Russia related to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in the context of Crimean events. There is another area of work of the Ukrainian authorities: "assistance to our Ukrainian companies which have lost their assets. A number of claims are being processed," he said. "We have presented our formal stance on the temporary occupation of Crimea, and we are ready to represent it. Every arbitration court will naturally make its own decision, but in each case, in the case of either Ukrainian companies, Naftogaz or Ukrzaliznytsia, we will seek compensation for our companies which have lost their assets, have lost their income. These are the two levels we will continue to work on," Klimkin said. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry is closely interacting with legal counselors and international partners in this area to win at international courts, the minister said.

The Business of Travel: why is Norwegian adding to an already saturated market? Simon Calder @SimonCalder Monday 22 August 2016 10:00 BST Click to follow The Independent Travel Three other airlines already fly from London to Reykjavik Getty You need not delve far back into aviation history to discover when competition in European air travel really began. Thirty years ago this summer, British Midland started flying from Heathrow to Amsterdam.  The UK and the Netherlands were the first nations to acknowledge that allowing direct competition against existing “flag carriers” – in this case, British Airways and KLM – might actually be good for business. And so it proved: the market between the two airports expanded by more than the capacity that British Midland added.  In other words, once lower fares and higher standards stimulated the market, BA and KLM benefited from increased passenger numbers. Nine years later, much the same thing happened when easyJet started flying from Luton to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Even though the upstart wasn’t flying from “fortress Heathrow”, British Midland and BA suddenly found themselves exposed to cut-price competition – and once again the market grew.  Since those aviation milestones, ferocious competition has thrived in Europe. The arrival of open skies means any EU airline can fly between any two European airports – an arrangement that is likely to continue function for the UK even after Brexit. The trajectory for the past two decades has been relentless expansion. To the enormous benefit of business and leisure travellers alike, we now enjoy a near-saturated market. With many city pairs looking full, things are about to get interesting, and business travel costs on some routes could tumble. Most of the big flag carriers are still around, sparring with the low-cost giants, Ryanair and easyJet. New planes are being delivered every week from Airbus and Boeing to help fuel expansion. The fundamental of European aviation in the 21st century is that aircraft make money only when they are flying. That is when the dark art of network planning comes in. Any rational firm will allocate its assets – in this case, planes and crews – to the routes that look most profitable. That’s why, when Stelios Haji-Ioannou started easyJet, his first routes from London were to Scotland’s three biggest cities. Thousands of passengers were already flying on those links, ready to be tempted by the prospect of halved air fares.  Amsterdam and Nice were first on the international route network, and remain prodigious providers of profits. They carry healthy proportions of business and leisure passengers, and both ends of each route generate plenty of traffic.  The latest route announced by easyJet – its 107th from Gatwick – shows how far the airline has gone from those early cherry-picking days. It is to Ostersund in central Sweden. When flights begin on 11 December, the passengers will almost all be skiers and snowboarders heading for the resort of Are. At least easyJet faces no competition from other UK scheduled airlines to Sweden’s ski heartland. In contrast, another northern link announced this week looks like the height of commercial optimism from one of Europe’s leading budget airlines, Norwegian. Every year, November is the month of lowest demand for air travel. There are no school holidays of note in the big countries for aviation; resorts from Greece to the Algarve are in hibernation; and the winter-sports season has yet to begin. So it is not the most auspicious time to begin a new route. This year, 1 November happens to fall on a Tuesday, which is the day of the week of lowest demand for air travel. It is also the day that Norwegian has chosen to launch its latest route from Gatwick. The destination: Reykjavik. If you thought there were already one or two flights from the London area to the Icelandic capital, you’d be right. On that quiet Tuesday alone, easyJet has four flights from three London airports: two from Luton, one from each of Stansted and Gatwick. If the timing from the Sussex airport doesn’t suit, then Wow Air and Icelandair also have planes waiting for you – with the Icelandic national carrier throwing in two more services from Heathrow. That’s about 1,500 seats already shuttling between London and the capital of a country with fewer than one-third of a million inhabitants. While a fair few of the passengers on Icelandair and Wow may be transferring to onward flights to North America, easyJet’s customers won’t.  Into this already well-served market comes Norwegian, promising seats for as little as £30. That’s for a journey that’s further than from London to Palermo in Sicily – which, in November, might be a more tempting destination. Sicily, by the way, has a population of five million, and has only two flights from London on that day. Will Norwegian still be on the route by the winter of 2017-18? The airline’s network planners clearly think so, because dipping a toe into the market is an expensive undertaking. Its Tuesday and Thursday flights could appeal to business travellers, as the first London departure of the day to Iceland. But I can’t see many executives wanting to take the Saturday afternoon outbound service, nor the inbound trip which arrives back at Gatwick at 10.45pm. Should your travels take you north this winter, prepare for the lowest air fares in history between the UK and Iceland. But history also tells us that fares wars rarely stretch beyond a season before one or more of the players retires hurt, and tries to think of the next great destination.  More about: Business Travel cheap flights Iceland Reykjavik Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

But unlike Kiwisaver, ordinary working people in NZ don’t have any choice about where NZ Super invests our money even though we are paying for it," said Auckland Peace Action member Valerie Morse "It is totally abhorrent that our retirement fund is making money from war," said Ms Morse. "Our screens are filled with the horrors of war every day. We see children being killed by bombs and missile strikes across the Middle East. The very least we can do is to make sure that we are not contributing to this devastation." "It doesn’t take an investment specialist to know that investing in war is wrong and unethical. Weapons companies profit from war and misery." The NZ Super Fund currently has $27 million in investments in Boeing, $7.6 million in BAE, and $9.1 million in Raytheon. These are just three of many of the companies that NZ Super invests in that are involved in weapons production. Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

(Photo: Robin Buckson / The Detroit News)Buy Photo While thousands looked to the sky Sunday at the Thunder Over Michigan Air Show at Willow Run Airport, a pair of co-workers enjoyed the view from 2,000 feet up. The air show featured modern aircraft such as L-39C Albatros Jets, flown by France’s Breitling Jet Team, along with a U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor and a U.S. Navy F/A-18 Super Hornet — but Jim Queen and Mario Vano came for a 71-year-old Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. Both men’s grandfathers fought in WWII aboard the same model; Queen’s grandfather was killed within a month of flying missions, while Vano’s grandpa was a gunner on one of the planes, which featured 50-caliber machine guns. The two men, who work side-by-side at Rizzo Environmental Services in Sterling Heights, grinned as the propellers began to whirl, the engine whined and the airplane shook. “You better be good with your maker when you go up in one of these things,” Queen said as the airplane rumbled down the runway and lifted off. It was a bumpy half-hour ride, with the plane ascending to 2,000 feet. After takeoff, Vano unstrapped his seat belt to explore the aircraft, while Queen stayed in his seat, snapping pictures of the landscape outside the small windows. After the plane touched down, Vano uttered a one-word review: “Awesome.” “We both have ties to this airplane,” Queen added. “This was really cool.” David Callanan, director of outreach services for the Yankee Air Museum, which restored the B-17, said people often get emotional when they see the airplane. “I’ve seen WWII vets with tears in their eyes when they see how we take care of the airplane that means the world to them — and that means the world to us,” he said. Callanan’s grandfather also flew B-17s during WWII. “I’m not a veteran, but this is one way I can honor our veterans,” he said. The theme of this year’s air show was helicopters, which was a departure from the usual WWII theme, air show director Kevin Walsh said in a news release. The show, themed “HELOtown USA,” hosted helicopters from around the world, including the Soviet Mi-24 Hind, AH-1 Cobra, CH-47 Chinook and UH-1 Huey. “We have a unique show in so many ways,” Walsh said in the release. “From the jet team and all of the helicopters to the WWII and modern battle re-enactments.” The air show is a fundraiser for the Yankee Air Museum. “It costs a lot of money to restore and maintain these old planes,” Callanan said. ghunter@detroitnews.com 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2bNeAcI TOP VIDEOS Detroit police on shooting of WSU officer 3:23 Pistons return to Detroit 2:35 Apartment manager talks about police shooting 1:36 Surveillance video of armed robbery on East 7 Mile 1:26 Surveillance video of truck connected to fatal hit-and-run 0:05 Meryl Davis and Charlie White skate at Campus Martius 0:47 Robert P.

The Defense Ministry said in a statement on its website that the long-range exercises staged Aug. 19 pitted a red army against a blue one in a simulated bomber attack on a naval task force. It said the primary ships in the exercise were the Jingzhou, a latest-generation type 054A class stealth frigate of which China is planning to deploy more than two dozen, and the type 052C destroyer Xi’an. The statement made no mention of what sort of conflict the exercise was intended as a response to, prospective foes or why the Sea of Japan was chosen as the location of the drills. China claims a chain of uninhabited islands controlled by Japan. AP   Woman sentenced for exporting U.S. military gear to China A California woman has been sentenced to more than four years in federal prison for illegally exporting U.S. military gear to China including jet fighter engines and a drone aircraft. Court records show a Miami federal judge imposed the sentence Aug. 19 on 45-year-old Wenxia Man of San Diego. A jury convicted her in June of conspiring to export and actually exporting military equipment without the proper license. Federal prosecutors say evidence in the case showed Man worked with a person in China to export engines used in F-135, F-22 and F-16 fighter jets as well as an MQ-9 Reaper drone aircraft capable of firing Hellfire missiles. Man allegedly told an undercover Homeland Security Investigations agent she worked with a spy who helped the Chinese military copy items from other countries. AP   Boeing issues layoff notices to 100 employees Boeing issued about 100 layoff notices in Washington state Aug. 19. The Seattle Times reports the 60-day notices will go to 16 employees in the Commercial Airplanes division with the rest going to people in the defense division and corporate units reporting to company headquarters in Chicago. Spokesman Doug Alder says it’s possible that not all who receive the notices will be laid off at the end of two months because in many cases employees find another job at the company. Employees say the layoffs will include some staff in the flight test unit at Boeing Field. Boeing employed almost 75,700 people in the state at the end of July, down more than 3,500 since Jan. 1.

Pilot Alan Kreppert told authorities the Piper single engine, fixed wing plane had engine trouble and he could not make it back to the nearby Creve Coeur Airport.  Kreppert and his passenger were not injured. Jon Sanders and his wife were heading home when they saw the plane’s lights. “Honestly I didn’t know what I was looking at at first. You don’t expect it to be a plane,” Sanders said. But when they drove under a street light on Page, they suddenly saw the plane’s belly and realized it was unusually low. “We immediately started slowing down,” Sanders said adding “he was probably I’d say a 100 yards in front of us when he touched down.”  He went on to describe the landing, “he brought one wheel down.. a back rear wheel.  He kind of bounced around just slightly and dropped it down and immediately started veering off to the shoulder.” The plane is owned by the Boeing Employees Flying Club and it is based at Creve Coeur Airport. This is not the first time the Page Extension (Highway 364) corridor proved to be a safety valve for small planes.  Maryland Heights police recalled a plane crash along a bike path between the Page Extension and the Creve Coeur Airport in 2014. Maryland Heights Police Public Information Officer Mark Fedak said the pilot had been practicing take-offs and landings at the airport.  The FAA is investigating the incident.

NASA's Williams sets U.S. space record James Dean , FLORIDA TODAY 12:53 p.m. EDT August 24, 2016 Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams earlier this month monitored bowling ball-sized internal satellites known as SPHERES aboard the International Space Station. Williams on Wednesday sets a U.S. record for most cumulative days in space with 521 over four missions. His record is expected to total 534 days by the time he returns to Earth in early September. (Photo: NASA) 48 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Scott Kelly is widely known as the Ironman of U.S. astronauts after his recent yearlong mission aboard the International Space Station, during which he set a NASA record for most cumulative days in space with 520 over four flights. But as of Wednesday, that career record will belong not to Kelly but Jeff Williams, an unassuming NASA veteran who doesn't mind if his six-month tour lacks the promotion and buzz of Kelly's "#YearInSpace." The commander of the station’s six-person Expedition 48 crew marks his 521st day in space Wednesday, a total expected to reach 534 days by the time he returns to Earth on Sept. 6 to conclude his fourth spaceflight. Don’t expect the retired Army colonel — a 58-year-old grandfather who the oldest NASA astronaut to live on the orbiting laboratory complex — to boast about the achievement. “It’s an honor to spend any day in space, and certainly to have accumulated that time is truly an honor for me,” Williams told NASA TV recently. FLORIDA TODAY NASA's OSIRIS-REx nearing launch to collect asteroid sample But he prefers to shift the attention to the station itself, which he considers humanity’s greatest technological feat, and the international partnership that has put it together. “That’s really the bigger story to me, personally,” he said. Williams’ 20-year astronaut career has spanned the station’s assembly, which began in 1998. His first flight was a 2000 shuttle mission that helped set up the fledgling outpost for its first permanent crew later that year. Crews have now lived continuously on the ISS for nearly 16 years. Since that 10-day shuttle flight, it’s been all long-duration missions for the Wisconsin native, who has launched three times from Kazakhstan on Russian Soyuz spacecraft. He’s the first American to serve on three ISS expeditions, which typically last five or six months each. The previous two were in 2006 and 2010, before station construction was officially complete. FLORIDA TODAY GOES-R weather satellite arrives for November launch Williams’ current mission has helped set the stage for the station’s next chapter, which will rely more on commercial operations. Last Friday he performed his fourth spacewalk, pairing with NASA’s Kate Rubins to install a docking port that opened the door for Boeing and SpaceX crew capsules to visit the outpost late next year or in early 2018. They are preparing for another spacewalk next week. On Aug. 19, Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams (shown) and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins of NASA successfully installed the first of two international docking adapters to the International Space Station during a five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk.  (Photo: NASA) Williams also has helped set up a prototype habitat module designed by Bigelow Aerospace, a potential precursor to private space stations that could follow the ISS. A West Point graduate in 1980, Williams later earned two master’s degrees and finished first in his class at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. Still, it took him about 10 years and multiple applications to win entry into NASA’s astronaut corps in 1996. He preaches perseverance to young people. Williams is old enough to remember Russia as a Cold War adversary. Now he sees the ISS partnership involving the U.S., Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada as a model for peaceful international relations. “I trust that it serves as a very positive example to the world below,” he said. When he returns to Earth in less than two weeks, Williams told CBS News recently that he looks forward to seeing family and friends and to “the simple things in life.” Those include smells of Earth often taken for granted, relaxing in quiet without the station’s constant hum of fans and pumps, and anything his wife will cook for him. “She’s the real hero in all of this, putting up with me being up here that many days over the years,” he said. And Williams knows records are made to be broken. In fact, Peggy Whitson, currently fourth on NASA's career list with 377 days in space, is scheduled to launch to the ISS in November and set a new U.S. record next year.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak on Friday, comments that are eagerly awaited in terms of fresh clues on the timing of a US rate hike. “The earnings season is largely over and the only thing we can look at is Fed-speak which is antagonising,” Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Key Biscayne, Florida-based Frank Capital Partners, told Bloomberg. “We’re in the most aggressive dip-buying market I’ve ever seen. I wouldn’t even call the last two days a dip, but any little tiny decline seems to be an excuse to buy and talk about the Fed.” In 3.21pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.2 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3 percent. In 3.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4 percent. The Nasdaq touched a record high 5,275.74. The Dow moved higher as advances in shares of Nike and those of Cisco, up 1.9 percent and 1.2 percent respectively, outweighed slides in shares of Wal-Mart and those of Boeing, each 0.6 percent weaker respectively. Shares of Best Buy soared, up 18.9 percent as of 3.12pm in New York, after the company reported quarterly earnings that exceeded estimates, underpinning optimism about a turnaround. There were disappointments too. Shares of JM Smucker dropped after the company downgraded its full-year sales estimate because of weakness in its new pet foods division, acquired last year. Net sales, excluding one-off items, are expected to range from flat to down 1 percent this year, the company said in a statement. It previously had predicted a 1 percent increase. Shares of Smucker sank, trading 8.4 percent weaker as of 1.44pm in New York. Shares of Monsanto rose. Negotiations between Bayer and Monsanto are advancing toward a deal after the companies made progress on issues including the purchase price and termination fee, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Shares of Monsanto climbed 3.2 percent as of 2.21pm in New York, while those of Bayer gained closed 0.7 percent higher in Frankfurt. The latest US housing data offered reason for optimism. A Commerce Department report showed new home sales climbed 12.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 654,000 units in July, the highest level in almost nine years. “This marginally raises our near-term outlook for the housing market, as tightness in the new home market suggests further impetus to new construction ahead,” Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York, told Reuters. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index finished the day with a 0.9 percent advance from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 index increased 0.6 percent, France’s CAC 40 index rose 0.7 percent, while Germany’s DAX index climbed 0.9 percent.

NASA has officially completed installation of the new International Docking Adapter (IDA) on the ISS, which opens the space base up for all manner of new spacecraft to visit. Essentially, it means the ISS is now primed and ready for the private spaceflight revolution. The docking adapter was attached to the ISS’s second Pressurized Mating Adapter (PMA-2) via spacewalk last week. The docking port was previously used for space shuttles (remember those?). By getting the IDA up and running, the ISS can now accept the private ships that will be flying in 2017 and 2018 to bring astronauts to and from the station, as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. It’ll obviously open up a new docking port for the spacecraft being developed by SpaceX and Boeing, but also any future craft, since it’s built to the International Docking System Standard. Along with making the ISS more versatile, this upgrade also makes it more attractive for when NASA packs up and moves on. The space agency has been teasing plans to allow private corporations to keep the station running once the current funding slate runs out in 2024, as NASA shifts its budget and priorities toward Mars. Having a fancy new IDA is certainly a nice perk.  (Via The Verge, NASA) Related Stories em drivescienceTechnologyNASA 6 NASA believes that fuel-free EM Drive concept could potentially work Trent Moore NASAspace 1 Retro NASA concept video from the 1960's shows early version of Apollo missions Trent Moore SpaceXInternetspacescience 2 SpaceX just asked to launch 4,400 satellites to create high-speed space internet Trent Moore spaceStephen Hawking 6 Stephen Hawking predicts humans won't survive another 1,000 years on Earth Trent Moore More from around the web Latest News Blog View Close Latest DuneFrank HerbertLegendary Entertainment 0 Legendary Entertainment wins screen rights to Frank Herbert's Dune Jeff Spry HighlanderChad StahelskiLionsgate 0 Highlander reboot remains immortal, lands a John Wick director Nathalie Caron InterviewMark HamillMark Hamill’s Pop Culture QuestComic-Con HQ 0 Mark Hamill on his collector impulses, a definitive Joker, and the role he'd still like to play Tara Bennett Hulkmarvel comicsShe-Hulk 0 She-Hulk takes up Bruce Banner's mantle in first look at new Hulk comic Trent Moore Game of Thronesellie kendrickHBOhodor 0 Watch: Game of Thrones’ Meera Reed apologizes to Hodor Aaron Sagers Lost in SpaceParker Poseynetflix 9 Danger, Will Robinson!

And on Monday the 53-year-old Pirates Of The Caribbean actor was seen for the first time since his divorce from his 30-year-old Rum Diary co-star was finalized. The father-of-two was spotted climbing aboard a four-level, $200m mega yacht owned by Saudi Prince Abdul Aziz, 42, in Ibiza, Spain, where the movie star has been residing for the past several weeks. Scroll down for video  Riding the high seas in style: Johnny Depp was seen for the first time since he settled his divorce with Amber Heard for $7m. The star was arriving to a mega yacht in Ibiza, Spain  Head down: The 53-year-old actor appeared glum as he hid behind a pair of sunglasses Easy does it: The Pirates Of The Caribbean actor held onto a drink in a plastic cup as he made his way off a speedboat and onto the luxury liner Amber was last seen on Friday in London with friends Margot Robbie and Cara Delevingne. On Monday Depp looked ready for a night of clubbing on Sunset Boulevard in his white shirt with rolled up sleeves that revealed his collection of tattoos, black vest, baggy striped slacks and layers of necklaces and bracelets.

Share this article Share And it also looked as if the rocker wanted to stay under the radar a bit by wearing a black cap and black sunglasses. The Black Mass actor did not appear to be in the best of spirits as he stepped off a small speedboat with Prince Abdulaziz written on the back and onto the massive yacht, which at 482 feet is one of the longest and tallest motor yachts in the world. She is now his ex: Heard accused the movie wonder of being physically abusive and supplied several photos and anecdotes about his alleged violence; here they are seen in January 2015 A long, difficult summer: The bad press started in May when Heard filed legal documents Thanks for the good times: The Alice Through The Looking Glass actor, seen here shaking hands with one of the crew, has had to duke it out with his lawyers over the split He had a hand: Several make handlers made sure the A lister didn't fall; it has been only about a week since he settled with Amber He has friends in high places: The speedboat belongs to Saudi prince Abdul Aziz, 42, and was marked Prince Abdulaziz on the back Depp, who has two children with Vanessa Paradis (Lily-Rose and John), was not alone as there were several male attendants making sure he did not slip as he entered the vessel. Spending time on the giant floating palace is not new for the superstar as he was seen there in early August as well. His host Aziz - who is reportedly worth $10 billion - has also partied with Leonardo DiCaprio so celebrities are not new to the yacht. It is not known why Depp is in Spain but it is believe that he wants some privacy after the poor light Heard cast him in after they split this spring. They were married for only 15 months and had no prenup. His pricey quarters: The father-of-two was spotted climbing aboard a four-level, $200m mega yacht A vessel Jack Sparrow wouldn't mind stealing: With a length of 147 metres (482 ft 3 in) at delivery, the yacht was the longest and tallest motor yacht in the world when built His home for weeks: Depp was also spotted on the mega vessel in early August In May Amber had accused him of battery and even supplied photos of her bruised face. Heard alleged in her court filing that an 'inebriated and high' Depp had grabbed her cellphone, 'wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force' during a dispute. She stated in the filing that Depp continued to attack her even after throwing the phone, claiming: 'He then forcibly pulled back my hair as I attempted to stand up from the sofa. Johnny continued screaming at me, pulling my hair, striking me and violently grabbing my face.' He sure likes celebrities: The Prince has also partied with Leonardo DiCaprio Plenty of room to party: The now single Johnny could fit his entire entourage and a football team on the yacht At play: Prince Aziz, who is reportedly worth $10b, spotted in New York City in April; he also owns a Boeing 777 and Canadair Challenger Earlier this month it was revealed that Depp had cut his finger while in an argument with his wife and had written in his own blood a nasty message for her on a mirror. Daily Mail Online has learned that the incident happened last March while Depp was in Australia and was high on weed and ecstasy on top of having drunk several bottles of red wine. He had been speaking with Heard on the phone while she was filming The Danish Girl in London when they began to fight and he threw the phone at some glass, causing the injury. Tough times: It is not known why he is in Spain but it is believe that he wants some privacy after the poor light Heard cast him in after they split this spring. They were married for only 15 months and had no prenup The court papers claim that Depp then took his bloody finger and dipped it in blue paint before using the mixture of the two liquids to write 'STARRING,' 'Billy Bob, ' and 'Easy Amber' on the wall. 'Billy Bob' is Billy Bob Thornton claims Heard, who had starred in the 2008 film The Informers with the actress and then London Fields, which will be released later this year. Depp was reportedly accusing Heard, 30, of having an affair with the 61-year-old actor during the fight, which occurred in his Australian villa while he was filming the latest installment of Pirates of the Caribbean. It got ugly: In May Amber had accused him of battery and even supplied photos of her bruised face Dirty laundry: Heard alleged in her court filing that an 'inebriated and high' Depp had grabbed her cellphone, 'wound up his arm like a baseball pitcher and threw the cell phone at me striking my cheek and eye with great force' during a dispute The photos of the injured finger and writing in the blood and paint mixture have been entered as exhibits in the case. Heard is also claiming in court papers that Depp did not have the finger treated until almost 24 hours after he sliced off the top of the digit, and that doctors had to use a flap of skin from his hand to fashion a new tip. In photos taken a month after the incident when the pair returned to Australia, Depp and Heard are seen getting off a private jet with his finger wrapped in a scarf. Sad statement: She stated in the filing that Depp continued to attack her even after throwing the phone, claiming: 'He then forcibly pulled back my hair as I attempted to stand up from the sofa' More bad news: Earlier this month it was revealed that Depp had cut his finger while in an argument with his wife and had written in his own blood a nasty message for her on a mirror DailyMail learned that when news leaked that he had cut his finger and written that message, he wanted the settlement reached quickly.  In a joint statement released exclusively to Daily Mail Online the couple described their relationship as 'passionate' and at times 'volatile' but said neither of them intended to cause the other harm. The statement said: 'Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have agreed to resolve their divorce proceedings privately. He wanted the accusations to end: DailyMail learned that when news leaked that he had cut his finger and written that message, he wanted the settlement reached quickly 'They are issuing this joint statement: 'Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has lied nor made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. 'Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future. Amber will be donating financial proceeds from the divorce to a charity. There will be no further public statements about this matter.' The money has been shared: Heard has since donated her settlement to help battered women and sick children Instead a softening of the wording was agreed upon that both Depp and Heard were happy with. A source said: 'Amber is happy with the settlement, it was never about the money for her, she was unhappy with the way Johnny treated her but it has been painful and emotionally rendering to relive this stuff. 'She didn't want to torture Johnny any more and wanted it to be over before the court hearing on Wednesday.' Heard has since donated her settlement to help battered women and sick children. She revealed she is donating the money to both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, where she says she has worked as a volunteer for 10 years.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 1k shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Whittington Follow Following Rate the news Nanoracks being paid by NASA to study making space habitats out of fuel tanks Upper stage fuel tanks of the Atlas V and even the Space Launch System could become space stations Three Station Crews to Answer Media Questions from Orbit | NASA - nasa.gov Advertisements #NASA recently handed out study contracts to six companies to develop deep #Space habitats that will sustain astronauts in cis-lunar space and on the Journey to Mars. Five of the companies are developing habitats that would be launched fully outfitted and ready to go. A team called Ixion, led by Nanonracks, and including Space Systems Loral and the United Launch Alliance, has come up with a different approach. #Nanoracks, which has provided commercial experiments for the International Space Station, envisions using the fuel tanks of upper stages of rockets and outfitting them to become habitats. The idea of using a fuel tank of a launch vehicle to make a space station habitat is an old one. Skylab, which flew in the 1970s, was the upper stage of a Saturn V. In the 1990s a group of NASA engineers proposed a concept called Geode which would have converted the space shuttle liquid fuel tank into a space station, attaching modules, robotic arms, and so on while refurbishing the inside. The first step for the Ixion effort would be to convert the upper stage of the Atlas V, called the Centaur. The Centaur would be equipped with a docking hatch. When the Atlas V takes a Cygnus cargo ship or, later, a Boeing CST-100 Starliner, the Centaur would remain attached instead of being discarded and tossed into the atmosphere. When the Cygnus and later the Starliner docks with the ISS, the robot arm would snatch the Centaur and attached it to another docking port. The Centaur would be vented of fuel and pumped full of oxygen. Then astronauts would enter and outfit the interior to make it a fulling functioning habitat. The newly created module could remain at the International Space Station or could be tugged to a new location to form the basis of a commercial space station. The resulting habitat would be four meters wide and have an interior volume of 54 cubic meters. The process could be adapted to other launch vehicles as well. The upper stage hydrogen fuel tank for the heavy lift Space Launch System would have an eye popping volume of 495 cubic meters, half the volume of the ISS. Using the SLS upper stage hydrogen tank to build deep space habitats would help spread the $1 billion cost of launching the heavy lift rocket, making each mission dual use.

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published:August 23, 2016 11:48 pm The lunar orbiters had sent back a total of 3,062 photos. (Source: NASA) It’s often said, photographs are frozen memories, and rightly so in many aspects as they capture a moment, thereby, making it memorable and sometimes, it could just go on to become historic. Just like on August 23, 1966 – when the first photo of Earth was captured from its satellite Moon. It’s been 50 years since this first photo was captured and produced by NASA’s Lunar Orbiter 1. The photo was transmitted to Earth by the unmanned robotic spacecraft and received at the tracking station at Robledo De Chavela near Madrid, Spain. The image was taken during the spacecraft’s 16th orbit. August 10 was the 50th anniversary of the launch of the first of five lunar orbiters that returned images of “99 per cent of both the near- and far-side surfaces of the moon”. According to a report, the lunar orbiters had sent back a total of 3,062 photos. The first spacecraft, Lunar Orbiter 1, left Earth on August 10, 1966, and after 92 hours, it was finally orbiting the moon. According to NASA, the Lunar Orbiter 1 – built by The Boeing Co. – was launched on an Atlas SLV-3 Agena-D rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. It was mainly designed to take photographs of smooth areas of the Moon’s surface, which would help to select landing sites for the Surveyor and Apollo missions, later launched by NASA.

You don’t want to mess with a working spacecraft if you don’t have to.” Though, initially, there were debates, as changing the satellite position would endanger the orbiter’s main objective, NASA finally decided to take picture of our planet. Thereby after lot of considerations, on August 23, 1966, “the spacecraft successfully took a photo of an earthrise, the blue planet rising above the moon’s horizon,” reports Space.com. Since then, this first photo of the Earth from the Moon has been historical and a printed poster of the image were presented as souvenirs to visiting dignitaries. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

A recent survey of over 1,500 people in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, conducted by YouGov revealed that 43 per cent of Emirates' residents are planning to travel during the Eid holiday. Four and five-star hotels are the top choice for families, with 32 per cent of accommodation requests by UAE residents for four-star options, and 48 per cent choosing to go the full luxury route. Popular destinations winning the public vote include India, just 3.5 hours away which, with the recent introduction of the e-Tourist Visa, has seen rising numbers of UAE visitors since 2015. "The economic slowdown hasn't seemingly deterred UAE residents from their annual travel plans and with a wealth of cultural, relaxing and city destinations reachable from Dubai in under four hours by air, we are seeing a surge of interest for stays at our member properties in destinations ranging from legendary India and the natural beauty of Georgia to pure relaxation in the Maldives," said Saurabh Rai, executive vice-president of Preferred Hotels & Resorts. "The availability of low cost carriers is also helping boost demand, with Air Arabia and FlyDubai's route networks adding new destinations all the time, and opening up a number of new and exciting destinations to intrepid travellers," said Rai. He added that staycations were also a preferred option as 23 per cent of residents were unable to travel due to work. Data released by global aviation leader Boeing, revealed that in 2015 Asian low cost carriers recorded average annual growth of 24.5 per cent over the previous decade, against just 13.4 per cent by European carriers. In India, the growing line-up of Preferred hotels include the Leela Palace Chennai - a five-star hotel that combines Indian tradition and contemporary comfort. The Greater Caucasus, with its dramatic mountains and abundance of outdoor activity options is also becoming increasingly popular with regional travellers. - rohma@khaleejtimes.com   Share More > Vote MORE FROM Business Local business UAE residents opt for short luxury vacations Easily accessible destinations and short luxury trips are the top...

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drone, sits on the floor during a U.S. House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing last fall in Washington, D.C. Commercial drones have become much more common and the Pentagon is taking an interest in them.  (Andrew Harrer / Bloomberg file photo)   By Justin BachmanBloomberg Tues., Aug. 23, 2016 They’re cheap, they’re light and they can carry a small bomb; the commercial drone is essentially a new terror gadget for organizations such as Hezbollah, Daesh (also known as Islamic State, ISIS and ISIL), or anyone else looking to wreak havoc on a budget. “That’s the same quad copter you can get on Groupon or go down to Sam’s Club and buy for $400,” U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said last week at a Washington forum on future warfare. The elusive nature of small drones is one reason the federal government has designated the District of Columbia a “national defense airspace” and prohibited drone flights there. A recent spate of drone-related incidents, including one last year in which a drone crashed on the White House lawn, probably didn’t help, either. But the problem is no longer about enthusiasts with a bad sense of direction. Article Continued Below Weaponized to various degrees of sophistication, such unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being used in the Syrian civil war and along parts of Lebanese and Syrian borders with Israel, where Hezbollah holds sway. “There has been an increasing concern in the military and a wider acceptance of how pernicious this problem is going to be, moving forward,” says Andrew Metrick, an intelligence security analyst at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. “From a U.S. and allies perspective, we haven’t had to think about how to fight where we don’t have total aerial supremacy.” The U.S. military has begun studying small drones and how best to respond. Earlier this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a request for ideas on how to protect troops from the new threat; it is planning a workshop next month. “We’re looking for scalable, modular, and affordable approaches that could be fielded within the next three to four years and could rapidly evolve with threat and tactical advancements,” a DARPA program manager, Jean-Charles Ledé, said in a statement. Closer to the battlefield, the Marine Corps has begun integrating small drones into training exercises at the Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, Calif., Neller said. A Marine or soldier who spots a drone overhead would typically shoot it down, but smaller drones can operate surreptitiously and elude radar since they are barely larger than a bird. Their small motors make acoustic detection enormously hard, and while wide-area camera sensors deployed on the ground might detect a drone, they usually require large computational resources in the field. One solution is an electronic signal jammer to prevent a drone operator from flying within a certain vicinity, an approach that U.S. forces have studied. Unlike an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), a small drone can’t be used by an enemy to “blow up a tank, but you can more easily attack individual war fighters, you can collect intelligence, and you can tie down a lot of resources by forcing U.S. personnel to respond to the danger,” said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute. “If you think there’s a drone nearby that might be watching you or might be a threat, then you have to be more careful, and that means you’re distracted from your primary mission.” It’s worth noting that the U.S. deploys small drones, typically for reconnaissance and surveillance. One of these, called Switchblade (PDF), is a model from California-based Aerovironment Inc. that’s been used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The 5.5-lb. drone can carry a lethal charge and has been flown in Syria, Metrick said. When it comes to large drones, the U.S. has shown itself, somewhat controversially, to be without peer. Remotely piloted Reaper and Predator drones have been used in thousands of attacks, including “targeted killings” for more than a decade. And the U.S. has major ocean-going drones: The autonomous Echo Voyager from Boeing Co., for example, can patrol underwater for months. Those drones are all highly advanced platforms, with technology and price tags that put them far out of reach of almost all but the most advanced militaries. For the guerrilla masses, the numerous cheaper, lightweight models are far more accessible. Their easiest use would be simply to monitor U.S. activities. But it’s their potential for modified, deadlier use that worries U.S. military tacticians. “When was the last time an American military force worried about being bombed by enemy air? World War II?” Neller said. “So what capabilities do we have to defend ourselves from enemy air or enemy unmanned air?” Such drones represent only one facet of a future battlefield on which the U.S. military will no longer enjoy complete dominance, the general said. Technology has given potential adversaries new advantages, especially as the U.S. has “developed a system of war fighting that is very dependent upon the internet, the network, and space.” All three are vulnerable because they establish an electronic signature as they operate. Mobile phones, for example, put soldiers in harm’s way in the new digital conflict zone, because a drone might home in on them and explode. “We’ve just got to change,” Neller said, describing a future battlefield in which fighters must become virtually invisible, a return to a time when electronic detection was impossible because there were no satellite radios, Google Earth maps, or GPS-enabled mobile phones. In many ways, the new era he envisions would replicate the operating environment a soldier in 1916 might have known. “You’re living out of your pack. You’re going to stop at night. You’re going to dig a hole. You’re going to camouflage, and you’re going to turn off all your stuff. And you’re going to sit there and try to sleep. And you’re going to be careful to not make any noise and you’re going to try to have absolutely no signature. “Because if you can be seen, you will be attacked. “That’s the difference. “And that’s what we’ve got to get.” Read more about: United States The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Let's start with a skeptical examination of the latest “new” technology, fixed wireless.  AT&T, Google and Verizon are all testing fixed wireless schemes, with the two cellular carriers relying on 4G LTE and to-be-determined 5G technology for faster speeds with less fiber infrastructure deployments.   Fixed wireless services require a cell tower with fiber capacity to deliver services to subscribers, typically with an external antenna for a subscriber.  No fuss, no muss, no trenching. Sounds great! But it all depends on the radio frequencies involved and the load around the cell tower.  One doesn't typically position cell towers and microcells in low-density areas, due to demand for mobile services.  If service is being delivered in higher and/or 5G licensed frequencies, line-of-sight is needed at some point between the service provider and subscriber – easy enough in rural environments if you have a tower, but denser urban environments and cities become a pain.  Service using 5G technology gets into bigger hand waving, since available frequencies will vary from country to country and geography to geography depending on licensing.   Because 5G requires line-of-site, any service provider playing in those frequencies will need to deploy more cells – more than the “thickening” required for 4G urban deployments – and those cells will have to have fiber to provide sustainable speeds akin to, well, fiber.  There are some interesting tricks with mesh networking to extend coverage without the use of fiber, but RF bandwidth and antennas used for networking deducts from available resources to serve customers. Facebook is testing long-duration unmanned aircraft, drones if you prefer.   Each drone will stay aloft at 60,000 feet for weeks at a time, powered by solar energy and connecting to other drones and the ground via laser, with end-user connectivity delivered via laser beam.  But Facebook has many months of work to build and demonstrate a single production-quality end-to-end constellation, delving into aeronautical engineering territory that only NASA and the Department of Defense have explored.  The economics might not work. Large scale satellite networks using several hundred to several thousand satellites in low Earth orbit are all the rage, with players from Boeing to SpaceX having filed plans with the FCC to reserve spectrum and launch test satellites. OneWeb appears the farthest along, with financial backing from Bharti, Coca Cola, Intelsat and contributions from Airbus, Qualcomm and Virgin Galactic  “Cloud” satellite networks offer low latency and coverage of the entire Earth's surface, but nobody's built one with a couple hundred satellite networked together. The Iridium network is the best working example today, with around 66 satellites and spares put up in the 1990s and delivering voice and lower-speed data. OneWeb, in comparison, plans to put at least 648 satellites into orbit starting in 2019-2020, with ground users getting speeds of 50 Mbps per second or faster.   Initially, OneWeb made a lot of noise about delivering broadband everywhere on the planet, but has since shifted to pitch the ability of the network to serve businesses and extend cellular phone coverage.   Good intentions to deliver broadband to the world are one thing, but business customers will be necessary to pay the bills and keep the lights on. How many cloud satellite networks can the market support? Nobody knows. OneWeb has the daunting task to demonstrate that a single cloud satellite network can be a successful business.  LEOSat believes there's room for a cloud network tailored to the high-end enterprise market, delivering low latency and gigabit speeds for corporate and government customers, with performance equal to or better than fiber.  Many cloud satellite network proposals are also facing a battle with terrestrial 5G networks for radio spectrum, with satellite builders trying to stake out spectrum claims before some 5G providers can get their own equipment running. There is no clear winner in the rush to new networks, except for fiber.  Broadband delivered by fiber doesn't have to worry about radio interference and can easily carry hundreds of gigabits to terabits of traffic per second on a single cable. Fiber has outlasted challenges from other schemes, due in part to its maturity and relative simplicity.  Edited by Alicia Young Author Info Doug Mohney Contributing Editor Click here to read full bio SHARE THIS ARTICLE Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Related Articles Making Sense of SpaceX, Boeing and Other Mega Satellite Broadband Projects By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 SpaceX's plan to put a whopping 4,425 satellites into low earth orbit (LEO) is the boldest plan for adding global non-terrestrial broadband capacity, … Read More The Abysmal Pace of New PC Tech By: Doug Mohney    11/22/2016 While storylines of the death of the PC have been running since the release of the iPad and the wave of tablets, it is clear that style has overtaken … Read More Five Ways Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Customer Experience By: Special Guest    11/22/2016 AI is transforming the way companies interact with customers.

Login Register Public Release: 23-Aug-2016 Tech issues cause most drone accidents: Research Increased regulation and reporting of accidents needed for industry: Researchers RMIT University Share  Print  E-Mail World-first research has found technical problems rather than operator errors are behind the majority of drone accidents, leading to a call for further safeguards for the industry. Researchers Dr Graham Wild and Dr Glenn Baxter from RMIT University's School of Engineering, along with John Murray from Edith Cowan University, completed the first examination of more than 150 reported civil incidents around the world involving drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). The study showed technical problems were the cause of 64 per cent of the incidents, which occurred between ¬2006 and 2016. Wild said their findings illustrated the need for further airworthiness requirements for RPAS vehicles, as well as the mandatory reporting of all accidents or incidents. "Understanding what happens to drones, even those that don't cause damage to people or property, is essential to improve safety," he said. The research came about after an incident earlier this year involving a drone and a British Airways Airbus A320 at Heathrow Airport. Recently published in the journal Aerospace, the study found that in most cases, broken communications links between the pilot and the RPAS were the cause of the incident, leading the researchers to call for the introduction of commercial aircraft-type regulations to govern the communications systems. "Large transport category aircraft, such as those from a Boeing or Airbus, are required to have triple redundant systems for their communications," Wild said. "But drones don't and some of the improvements that have reduced the risks in those aircraft could also be used to improve the safety of drones." Wild said more robust communications systems, even on cheaper RPAS, could help prevent accidents. Part of the problem with current regulations was related to the large difference in size between those drones that required licences and those that didn't, he said. Wild said drones weighing less than 25kg did not require any airworthiness certificate, just licences for the pilot, despite the potential damage that could be caused if they failed while flying in a built-up area. "Drones are being used for a wide range of tasks now and there are a lot of day-to-day activities that people want to use them for - delivering pizzas and packages, taking photos, geosurveying, firefighting, and search and rescue," he said. "It's essential that our safety regulations keep up with this rapidly-growing industry." ### For interviews: Dr Graham Wild, +61-3-9925-8051.

This research report titled 'Global Strategic Bomber Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. In 2015, the Americas had the highest market share of 54.5% due to the ongoing investments for the sustainment of strategic bomber fleets. Simultaneously, investments in the development of new-generation strategic bombers will also play a substantial role in propelling the market in the coming decades. "In the last couple of years, air forces of Russia and China have increased the use of strategic bombers. For instance, Russia is employing strategic bombers to drop heavy munitions to neutralize the rebel forces in Syria, whereas China is developing advanced strategic bombers to maintain its dominance in the South China Sea as well as to combat in long-range warfare," says Arushi Thakur, one of Technavio's industry experts for defense research. Request sample report: http://goo.gl/QINwmQ The report categorizes the global strategic bomber market into three segments based on aircraft engine type: Turbofan Turbojet Turboprop Global turbofan engine strategic bombers market Turbofan engines, also known as bypass jets, are the most efficient engine type compared to its counterparts. With a massive 72.41% market share in 2015, the turbofan segment led the global strategic bomber market and this growth will continue through 2020. Turbofans are the modern version of aircraft turbine engines and are found in most of the new generation supersonic strategic bombers In 1997, the US Air Force introduced one of the most sophisticated long-range strategic bombers, the B-2 Spirit, which was designed and manufactured by Northrop Grumman. The B-2 Spirit is powered by four F118 non-afterburning turbofan engines developed by General Electric, each generating 17,300 pound-force, allowing the aircraft to reach a speed of 0.95 Mach at an altitude of 12,192 meters from sea level. Since 1997, 21 of these aircraft entered into service in the US Air Force. Likewise, the Russian MoD, in collaboration with Kuznetsov, engaged in the R&D efforts to generate up to 35 tons of thrust from the NK-32 afterburning turbofan engine that powers Tu-160 strategic bombers. Such sustainment and modernization efforts for turbofan-powered strategic bombers will have a substantial positive impact on the growth of the market in the coming years. Global turbojet strategic bombers market Turbojet engines are the simplest form of all aircraft turbine engines that consist of four sections, namely compressor, combustion chamber, a turbine section, and exhaust. Turbojet engine-powered strategic bombers have been in service since 1952. Therefore, the need to upgrade the existing technology will be driving the market during the forecast period. The US Air Force currently operates over 60 B-1B Lancer turbojet engine-powered strategic bombers. Over the years, these aircraft underwent numerous technological upgrades to ensure optimum operational capability. In February 2016, the US DoD announced its plan to pull out the B-1B Lancer bombers from its combat mission against Islamic State (IS) in Iraq and Syria, and subsequently, replace them with the B-52 Stratofortress. This strategic move was planned with an aim to modernize the aging fleet of B-1B Lancers. "The upgrade work will include installing integrated battle stations, which have moving maps and enhanced diagnostics systems, as well as the establishment of an automation system that makes an aircraft a more lethal weapon delivery platform," adds Arushi. Global turboprop engine strategic bombers market Turboprop engines provide a greater fuel efficiency and performance at slower airspeeds as compared with turbofans and turbojets. This type of engine is operational only in Tu-95 strategic bombers in service with the Russian Air Force since 1956. In 2013, the Russian MoD initiated modernization programs for its Tu-95 strategic bombers with an aim of enhancing the avionics and the weapon delivery systems of its 16 aircraft fleet. Despite being old, the prime objective of the Russian MoD was to ensure that these aircraft remain operational until 2025-2030. However, the engines and airframes of Tu-95 strategic bombers will not be upgraded. In November 2015, Russian Machines, a Russian conglomerate, delivered the first upgraded Tu-95 strategic bombers that can carry nuclear-tipped missiles. Also, the upgraded Tu-95 is equipped with advanced radio-radar and target navigation system, which functionality is based on the global navigation satellite system. Such development efforts in this segment will drive the strategic bomber market during the forecast period.

About Future Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Holy Land Principles to Face Cisco Again Holy Land Principles to Face Cisco Again Posted on August 23, 2016 by CSRwire Press Releases, Events and Reports in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer The shareholder campaign forges ahead to hold American companies doing business in Israel/Palestine accountable for their fair employment. The campaign launched in 2012 is the first time ever that the companies were faced with this issue, even though larges numbers of Shareholder Resolutions have been filed since 1972 on all sorts of other SRI (Socially Responsible Investing) issues. These issues and concerns are commonly summed up as Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG). The Holy Land Principles — an 8-point corporate code of conduct for American companies doing business in Palestine/Israel— are pro-Jewish, pro-Palestinian and pro-company. The Principles do not call for quotas, reverse discrimination, disinvestment/divestment or boycotts—only for fair employment by American companies. The Principles are based on the very effective Mac Bride Principles, which have powerfully advanced fair employment for Catholics in Northern Ireland. Please visit HolyLandPrinciples.org for more information. In particular, view the Animated Internet Video, which presents the issue in a very compelling way. It is the big existential question for American companies in the Holy Land that no longer can be ignored. Fr. Sean McManus— President of the Capitol Hill-based Holy Land Principles, Inc. and Irish National Caucus— said: “The FedEx annual meeting is on Monday, September 26 at 8 AM (Central time) in Memphis, TN. Our Resolution will call on FedEx to sign the Holy Land Principles. Cisco Resolution — the heart of the matter Fr. McManus continued: “However, our Cisco Resolution for the Annual Meeting sometime in November 2016, calls on Cisco —at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information—to disclose the breakdown of its workforce in Palestine/Israel using the nine job categories which are utilized in the U.S. Department of Labor’s EEO -1 Report (Equal Employment Opportunity): 1.Officials and managers; 2. Professionals; 3. Technicians; 4. Sales; 5. Office and clerical; 6. Craft Workers (skilled); 7. Operatives (semiskilled); 8. Laborers (unskilled); 9. Service workers.” (See text of Resolution: http://www.holylandprinciples.org/cisco-shareholder-resolution-for-2016/). Fr. McManus explained: “Cisco proclaims that it is proud of its fair employment in Israel/Palestine. Now we are providing them with a way to verify, following the adage of President Reagan, ‘Trust but verify.’ Surely, this is an eminently reasonable request to make of Cisco? How could Cisco reasonably refuse? This Resolution is also entirely consistent with the Ruggie Principles, which Cisco says it endorses.” Barbara Flaherty— Executive Vice President of Holy Land Principles, Inc. said: “The following eight Resolutions were filed in July for 2017: Coca-Cola, Corning, General Electric, General Motors, Intel, McDonald’s, Pepsi, and UPS. And after September 15, the following 16 will be filed for 2017: 3M, Alphabet (Google), Apple, AT&T, Boeing, Caterpillar, Crawford &Co, ECM, Estee Lauder, FedEx, Lockheed Martin, Marriott, Marsh and McLennan, Pfizer, Proctor & Gamble, and Xerox. Additionally, after the Cisco meeting in November 2016, we will file yet again with Cisco for 2017.” Nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come Fr. Mc Manus concluded: “We set out to fill a vacuum that was crying out to be filled. It is unconscionable that fair employment by American companies in Israel/Palestine was studiously ignored ever since Shareholder Resolutions became popular and, indeed, almost de rigueur—  especially by the faith-based and SRI community. Now our 25 Resolutions for 2017 help to redeem that sad negligence. We look forward to gaining the support of all shareholders, consumers and stakeholders. The Holy Land Principles can promote fair employment in American companies in Palestine/ Israel just as our Mac Bride Principles promote fair employment in the American companies doing business in Northern Ireland. The Holy Land Principles will continue to grow and flourish, because nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.” NOTE OF INTEREST: Fr. McManus appears in the critically acclaimed documentary film, “Bobby Sands: 66 DAYS,” now showing in Ireland and soon to be shown in the USA. Fr. Mc Manus’ role is to explain the American reaction to the 1981 Hunger Strike in which Bobby Sands and his nine colleagues died. Bobby Sands survived for 66 Days, dying on May 5. Fr. Mc Manus himself did a 12-day hunger strike outside the British Embassy in Washington, coming off his hunger strike when Sands died.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    They're cheap, they're light, and they can carry a small bomb: The commercial drone is essentially a new terror gadget for organizations such as Hezbollah, Islamic State, or anyone else looking to wreak havoc on a budget. "That's the same quad copter you can get on Groupon or go down to Sam's Club and buy for $400," U.S. Marine Corps Commandant General Robert Neller said last week at a Washington forum on future warfare. The elusive nature of small drones is one reason the federal government has designated the District of Columbia a "national defense airspace" and prohibited drone flights there. A recent spate of drone-related incidents, including one last year in which a drone crashed on the White House lawn, probably didn't help, either. But the problem is no longer about enthusiasts with a bad sense of direction. Weaponized to various degrees of sophistication, such unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now being used in the Syrian civil war and along parts of Lebanese and Syrian borders with Israel, where Hezbollah holds sway. "There has been an increasing concern in the military and a wider acceptance of how pernicious this problem is going to be, moving forward," says Andrew Metrick, an intelligence security analyst at the Center for Strategic & International Studies. "From a U.S. and allies perspective, we haven't had to think about how to fight where we don't have total aerial supremacy." The U.S. military has begun studying small drones and how best to respond. Earlier this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued a request for ideas on how to protect troops from the new threat; it is planning a workshop next month. "We're looking for scalable, modular, and affordable approaches that could be fielded within the next three to four years and could rapidly evolve with threat and tactical advancements," a DARPA program manager, Jean-Charles Ledé, said in a statement.  Closer to the battlefield, the Marine Corps has begun integrating small drones into training exercises at the Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, Calif., Neller said. A Marine or soldier who spots a drone overhead would typically shoot it down, but smaller drones can operate surreptitiously and elude radar since they are barely larger than a bird. Their small motors make acoustic detection enormously hard, and while wide-area camera sensors deployed on the ground might detect a drone, they usually require large computational resources in the field. One solution is an electronic signal jammer to prevent a drone's operator from flying within a certain vicinity, an approach that U.S. forces have studied.  Unlike an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), an enemy using a small drone "can't blow up a tank, but you can more easily attack individual war fighters, you can collect intelligence, and you can tie down a lot of resources by forcing U.S. personnel to respond to the danger," said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst with the Lexington Institute. "If you think there's a drone nearby that might be watching you or might be a threat, then you have to be more careful—and that means you're distracted from your primary mission." It's worth noting that the U.S. also deploys small drones, typically for reconnaissance and surveillance. One of these, called Switchblade (PDF), is a model from California-based Aerovironment Inc. that's been used by the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The 5.5 pound drone can carry a lethal charge and has been flown in Syria, Metrick said. When it comes to large drones, the U.S. has shown itself—somewhat controversially—to have no current peer. Remotely piloted Reaper and Predator drones have been used in thousands of attacks, including "targeted killings" for more than a decade. And the U.S. has major ocean-going drones: The autonomous Echo Voyager from Boeing Co., for example, can patrol underwater for months. Those drones are all highly advanced platforms, with technology and price tags that put them far out of reach of almost all but the most advanced militaries. For the guerrilla masses, the numerous cheaper, lightweight models are far more accessible. Their easiest use would be simply to monitor U.S. activities. But it's their potential for modified, deadlier use that worries U.S. military tacticians. "When was the last time an American military force worried about being bombed by enemy air? World War II?" Neller said. "So what capabilities do we have to defend ourselves from enemy air or enemy unmanned air?" Such drones also represent only one facet of a future battlefield on which the U.S. military will no longer enjoy complete dominance, the general said. Technology has given potential adversaries new advantages, especially as the U.S. has "developed a system of war fighting that is very dependent upon the internet, the network, and space." All three are vulnerable because they establish an electronic signature as they operate. Mobile phones, for example, put soldiers in harm's way in the new digital conflict zone, because a drone might home in on them and explode. "We just got to change," Neller said, describing a future battlefield in which fighters must become virtually invisible, a return to a time when electronic detection was impossible because there were no satellite radios, Google Earth maps, or GPS-enabled mobile phones. In many ways, the new era Neller envisions would replicate the operating environment a soldier in 1916 might have known: "You're living out of your pack, you're going to stop at night, you're going to dig a hole, you're going to camouflage, and you're going to turn off all your stuff. And you're going to sit there and try to sleep. And you're going to be careful to not make any noise and you're going to try to have absolutely no signature. Because if you can be seen, you will be attacked. That's the difference. And that's what we got to get."   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Photo: HT Lockheed Martin Corp.’s offer to shift all of its F-16 manufacturing to India comes with an added benefit for Prime Minister Narendra Modi: A strategic win against nuclear rival Pakistan. The proposal would give India partial control along with the US over which countries are able to purchase F-16 fighter jets and spare parts, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. That may allow India to choke off key supplies to Pakistan, which has relied on F-16s as its main aerial defence for decades, if the US allows it do so. “Some components may be produced only in India,” Abhay Paranjape, director of business development at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in an interview about the company’s F-16 proposal. Asked whether Pakistan would still be able to source F-16 jets or parts elsewhere under the arrangement, Paranjape said questions about foreign military sales policies should be referred to the US government. Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the US Department of Defense, in turn referred questions on the sale of F-16 spare parts to Lockheed. The strategic element is a key selling point as Lockheed pushes to win an order that may exceed 100 fighter jets, part of Modi’s plan to spend $150 billion on the armed forces and create jobs under his “Make-in-India” policy. A deal would breathe new life into the F-16, an older model than the stealth F-35 warplane, and further boost US-India defence ties at the expense of Pakistan. India focus “What we are doing is putting India as the center of the supply base,” Randall Howard, Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics business development director, said on 4 August in New Delhi. “Today, there is no potential Pakistan sale.” India and Pakistan have been enemies ever since partition when Britain exited the region in 1947. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars over disputed territory, and have few economic ties. US relations with Pakistan have worsened in recent years. Congress in May refused to give subsidies for Pakistan to buy new F-16s, prompting it to consider buying used ones from Jordan instead. The US this month withheld another $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorists carrying out attacks on American troops in neighbouring Afghanistan. Pakistan looking elsewhere Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign ministry, declined to answer questions about Lockheed Martin’s F-16 proposal, as did Nungsanglemba Ao, a spokesman for India’s defence ministry. The company’s overtures to India will prompt Pakistan to look more to China and Russia for military hardware, according to Najam Rafique, director at Islamabad’s Institute of Strategic Studies. “Pakistan is diversifying its options,” he said. Competition for the India jet order is fierce. Lockheed Martin’s rivals such as Boeing Co. and Saab AB are all offering to shift some production to India as part of their bids to replenish India’s aging fleet. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Stalled negotiations Modi last year scaled back an earlier deal with Dassault Aviation SA, opting to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf instead of building 126 in India after negotiations hit repeated delays. That effort has since stalled over price, providing an opportunity to other jet-makers to step in. It’s unclear when a decision will be made. Lockheed’s proposal attempts to turn its greatest weakness—the fact that Pakistan also flies F-16s —into a main reason for India to acquire the jet. “Since India would house the only existing production line, it would be able to deny Pakistan any further platforms or also have influence on Pakistan Air Force logistics,” said Pushan Das, who follows military modernization at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Lockheed Martin, which is winding down F-16 production in the US, has successfully sold the jet for decades. The proposed facility in India would provide much-needed highly skilled jobs as Modi heads into several important state-level elections in 2017. Manufacturing ‘ecosystem’ “We are not looking at just assembling India’s F-16 here,” Lockheed Martin’s Paranjape said. “We are looking at establishing a complete manufacturing base ecosystem.” Of course, it is still unclear which firm will win India’s lucrative fighter jet contract. Some analysts dismiss the F-16 as a dated “fourth generation” platform opposed by the Indian Air Force because it won’t have major upgrades in the future. Others like Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair have suggested New Delhi is unlikely to get a more advanced fighter jet made in India because of difficulties with transferring state-of-the-art technology. While many obstacles remain, an agreement with Lockheed Martin would cement closer ties between the nations if the US government doesn’t prevent the transfer of advanced radar or avionics technologies, according to Anit Mukherjee, an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If this deal was to happen—and that’s a big if—then it will be a big plus for US—India relations and a significant indicator of the transformation in the defence relationship,” he said. “If this deal goes through, and the US is honest about tech transfer, then it has the potential to really build up India’s military-industrial base.” Bloomberg Topics: F-16LockheedFighter jetsIndiaPakistan More from this Section Demonetisation survey Karnataka realizes 1.8% projects signed before biennial investors meet Govt reaches out to opposition to break logjam in Parliament over note ban Karnataka govt appoints retired judge to probe suicide of DySP Ganapathy Cabinet push for Jawahar Navodaya schools, new merchant shipping bill Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Tracking demonetisation: Our reading list India may gain from Donald Trump’s TPP pullout threat First Published: Tue, Aug 23 2016. 02 34 PM IST Read more from Livemint Demonetisation survey Shapoorji Pallonji to buy 100 acres land in affordable housing push Karnataka realizes 1.8% projects signed before biennial investors meet Editor's Picks New income tax rules to curb unaccounted cash The richest 1% of Indians now own 58.4% of wealth Reliance Jio fails to hit subscriber base of Airtel, Idea, Vodafone: analysts Latest News Demonetisation survey Shapoorji Pallonji to buy 100 acres land in affordable housing push Karnataka realizes 1.8% projects signed before biennial investors meet The propaganda of currency patriotism Airlines brace for demonetisation headwinds by advancing flash sales Mint On Sunday The dilemma of Draupadī’s disrobing The prodigals return to Neroca US elections: How slogans can make or break a candidate Now, the crowd can bankroll your research How to maximize judicial time Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2016 HT Media Ltd.

Ariane 5 is approved for this week's Arianespace launch with two Intelsat payloads by Staff Writers Kourou, French Guiana (ESA) Aug 23, 2016 File image. Arianespace's fourth Ariane 5 flight of 2016 has been given the "green light" for liftoff on Wednesday following the prelaunch readiness review, which was conducted at the Spaceport in French Guiana. This milestone - held prior to each Arianespace mission from the near-equatorial launch base - confirms the heavy-lift vehicle and its dual-satellite payload are flight-ready, along with the Spaceport's infrastructure and the network of downrange tracking stations. The approval also clears Ariane 5 for tomorrow's rollout from the Final Assembly Building to the ELA-3 launch zone, where it is scheduled for liftoff on August 24 during a 45-minute launch window opening at 6:55 p.m. local time in French Guiana. A dual-passenger launch for Intelsat Designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's numbering system, this week's mission has an estimated payload lift performance of 10,735 kg. - a total that factors in the two satellite passengers, Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36, plus the SYLDA dispenser system and integration hardware. Intelsat 33e is to be deployed first during the 41-minute flight sequence and will operate from an orbital position of 60 deg. East. Built by Boeing using a 702MP spacecraft platform, it is the second satellite in Intelsat's next-generation high-throughput Intelsat EpicNG series - joining Intelsat 29e, which was launched by Arianespace aboard another Ariane 5 in January. Installed in the lower payload position, Intelsat 36 will be the second passenger released by Ariane 5. It was manufactured by SSL (Space Systems Loral) based on the company's 1300 platform, and will operate from the 68.5 deg. East orbital position - where Intelsat 36 will be co-located with the Intelsat 20 satellite launched by Arianespace in August 2012.

Russia's 'US Missile Defense-Killing' Hypersonic Rockets Arriving Soon by Staff Writers Moscow (Sputnik) Aug 23, 2016 A hypersonic missile design displayed at an exhibition staged by the Raduga Design Bureau. Image courtesy Sergey Mamontov and Sputnik. Russian defense analyst Vladimir Tuchkov analyses Russian, Chinese and American developments in hypersonic weapons technology, including the expected timeframe for their deployment, which is sooner than you may expect. Last week, Tactical Missile Systems Corporation general director Boris Obnosov told Russian media that he was confident that Russia would be introducing hypersonic missiles capable of speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 7 by the year 2020. The director emphasized that such weapons would significantly weaken the potential of enemy missile defense. "It's obvious that with such speeds - when missiles will be capable of flying through the atmosphere at speeds of 7-12 times the speed of sound, all [air] defense systems will be weakened considerably." Tactical Missile Systems Corporation (KTRV by its Russian acronym) is based in Korolyev, outside Moscow. Several dozen specialized research institutes and industrial enterprises are involved in the development of Russia's hypersonic missile potential, with KTRV a leader in this area not only in Russia but also compared to defense engineering companies globally. Obnosov's comments come on the heels of a recent speech by Admiral Cecil Haney, the Head of US Strategic Command, in which the admiral warned that American anti-missile and anti-aircraft defense systems will be virtually incapable of intercepting the Russian hypersonic systems expected to be deployed soon. Commenting on these developments in a piece for Svobodnaya Pressa, Russian defense analyst Vladimir Tuchkov pointed out that while supersonic weapons have become a very popular topic of discussion today, their development actually began much, much earlier, going back to the Cold War. The analyst recalled that "in the 1970s, the Raduga Design Bureau, now a part of KTRV, began research exploring the possibility of creating a cruise missile with a speed of Mach 5 or greater. At the time, the problem was little studied. Firstly, it was impossible to use ordinary turbojet engines for speeds in excess of Mach 3. The sharp increase in air speed pressure resulted in a loss of efficiency in the engines, with a sharp rise in temperature in the combustion chamber of the air-fuel mixture also reducing efficiency. The higher the temperature, the lower the thrust. Moreover, as temperatures rose, so too did the risk of the rocket's turbine blades becoming deformed and simply melting." "In this situation," Tuchkov noted, "the only option is the use of a ramjet engine - in this case a hypersonic scramjet. The use of a rocket engine, either liquid or solid fueled, for cruise missiles, is impossible, since the entire trajectory of the flight must be actively controlled and adjustable." "The design of the scramjet is very simple, with the number of moving parts reduced to a minimum. Theoretically, these craft can reach speeds of up to Mach 25, although the practical ceiling of operation is about Mach 17-19. However, the scramjet also has a significant drawback - its normal operation begins at speeds exceeding Mach 3. Before this speed, it is necessary to accelerate the missile using a solid booster, or some other method, similar to the kind used to launch a high-speed aircraft." The analyst recalled that when development of hypersonic missile technology first began in the Soviet period, one of the key problems for engineers was overheating. "It was necessary to create the kind of heat shield through which the onboard flight control equipment would continue to work flawlessly." In the 1980s, Raduga Design Bureau created several prototypes of a new cruise missile - the Kh-90, NATO codenamed Koala. The cruise missile weighed 15 tons, had a length of 9 meters, and a 7 meter wingspan. With an expected range of up to 3,000 km, the missile had a design speed of Mach 5. "The project," Tuchkov noted, "advanced far enough for several test launches to be conducted. During the last of them, the missile reached speeds ranging from Mach 3 to Mach 4." The missile was aircraft-launched. Of course, "all of the USSR's hypersonic weapons designs were strictly classified. It was only due to the fact that the project was closed in 1992 thanks to a lack of financing and the collapse of the defense industry in general that some information about the Kh-90 has become publically available." After a period of stagnation in the 1990s, development resumed. Today, the analyst noted, Russia has reached a point where it has created and is actively testing at least two hypersonic systems. "This includes the 3K-22 Zircon anti-ship cruise missile, the main developer of which is the NPO Machine Building plant in Reutov, outside Moscow, which is also part of KTRV. At the same time, an export version of the missile, known as the Brahmos, is being developed for the Indian Navy." The first information about the Zircon appeared in 2011, with testing beginning a year later. "To date, five test launches have been made...During the last launch, in March of this year, the rocket was successfully tested in normal operation mode." Effectively, Tuchkov noted, "work on the Zircon is progressing so rapidly that the first state testing is expected to begin next year, and mass production the year after that, in 2018. In this connection, the Tactical Missile System Corporation director's forecasts about the year 2020 looks quite modest." "Of course, he is talking about speeds of Mach 6-7, while the Zircon's design speed is 'only' Mach 5. Various estimates suggest its range may be between 400 and 1,000 km. Precise information on the engines is not available, but informed analysts suggest that acceleration is carried out via a reactive solid booster, with a scramjet used as the main engine." Furthermore, the Zircon has already been slated for installation onboard the heavy nuclear missile cruisers - the Peter the Great and the Admiral Nakhimov. It is also expected that a new Russian nuclear submarine, codenamed Project-Husky, currently under development, will be equipped with the Zircon. "As for Project 4202, it appears that this system will be able to meet and surpass the speeds discussed by Tactical Missiles Corporation's director. This missile too is being developed by the NPO Machine Building plant. To be more precise - this is not an independent missile, but rather a warhead onboard an intercontinental ballistic missile, which, after separation from the launch vehicle, acts like a hypersonic cruise missile would, maneuvering freely to determine direction and pitch." According to informed estimates, Project 4202 is capable of speeds between Mach 7 and Mach 12. For this reason, Tuchkov noted, the system can overcome "not only modern means of US missile defense, but even those systems which American engineers have not even begun to develop yet." The testing of Russia's hypersonic gliders is taking place using the tried and true RS-18B 'Stiletto' silo-based ICBMs, used to accelerate them up to the appropriate speed. "After being adopted by the military, Project 4202 will be installed aboard the new RS-28 Sarmat, and on future Russian ICBM designs. This is expected to take place between 2020 and 2025. When the expected first batch of 20 supersonic warheads is rolled out, it will effectively make the US missile defense system pointless. Every Sarmat will feature three hypersonic combat gliders." Foreign Analogues: USA Of course Russia is not the only country engaged in the creation of prospective hypersonic weaponry. The X-51, being developed by the Boeing Corporation under the aegis of the Pentagon's 'prompt global strike' concept, is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6-7. Testing began in 2010, but, as Tuchkov pointed out, none of them have been deemed successful so far. Brought into the air aboard a B-52 strategic bomber, the X-51, with a range of 500 km, has clocked a maximum speed of Mach 5.1. "However, all flights ended in the destruction of the test missile before the end of its planned flight." "Setting out on this costly project, the US positioned it as a tool for effective and lighting-speed strikes against terrorist groups. However, there is no doubt that the Pentagon also had in mind the traditional confrontation with Russia, and against a rapidly developing China. Yet the X-51, even if it is brought into mass production, will not solve the problems it was designed to handle, since the prospective Russian S-500 anti-aircraft missile system is expected to be capable of destroying hypersonic missiles." In this sense, Tuchkov noted, the DARPA program's Falcon HTV-2 has better characteristics in terms of its speed, having been successfully clocked at Mach 20. But the vehicle was launched from near space, first carried up by rocket booster, from where it hurled back down to earth. "In other words, there's nothing new here; the US Space Shuttles and our Buran flew in similar fashion. Following the second test, which took place in 2011, the missile was recognized as unpromising, since it was almost uncontrollable, and impossible to establish communications with." Foreign Analogues: China China too is actively involved in the development of hypersonic technology, beginning with its WU-14 rocket, which began testing in 2013. An average of three tests per year has taken place since then. The system's declared speed is Mach 10, although as Tuchkov pointed out, a variety of contradictory information has been circulating, estimating speeds from Mach 1.5 to Mach 7. "Series production of the WU-14 is expected to begin in the second half of the 2020s, and it is expected to be mounted on ballistic missiles, which for the Chinese is very important. Today, only a small number of Chinese ICBMs is capable of reaching the US, giving the Pentagon the hypothetical ability to fight off a Chinese nuclear attack. For Beijing, this is not only insulting, but disadvantageous in the diplomatic competition between the powers. With the arrival of hypersonic warheads, the US is expected to 'behave' more prudently." "Another task entrusted to the new weapon is the destruction of aircraft carriers; their defenses would be powerless against maneuverable warheads traveling at speeds of Mach 10."

Although the number of commercial jets is small compared to the number of cars, trucks and buses, airplanes produce the third-highest total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector, according to Janet McCabe, the Environmental Protection Agency’s acting assistant administrator for air and radiation. Unlike other vehicles, airplanes are not subject to emission regulations, even though the EPA and the United Nations say that planes are responsible for about 2 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the EPA announced that it will use its authority under the Clean Air Act to require reduced aircraft emissions, excluding small piston-engine and military planes. It is on the mark in doing so, despite opposition from aircraft manufacturers and airlines. The U.N. International Civil Aviation Organization recommended in February that emissions by international flights be reduced by 4 percent at cruising altitude by 2020 for planes under design, and by 2023 for planes in production. The EPA is expected to adopt similar standards for domestic flights. The big producers, Boeing and Airbus, already are moving in that direction by competing aggressively for fuel-efficient designs. And airlines are moving that way with fewer flights and higher passenger loads. Both industries and fuel producers are cooperating in developing lower-emission renewable fuels. Boeing estimates that the current global fleet of commercial jets will increase from about 20,000 now to more than 40,000 by 2040, making it all the more crucial to reduce their pollution.

Among the day’s presentations and panel discussions was an extensive conversation about the current state of wide-format graphics and opportunities in the market for commercial printers. By Richard Romano Published: August 23, 2016 Last week, the Printing Industries Alliance hosted an all-day “Post-drupa Report” at Manhattan’s Club 101, which drew an audience of more than 100 printers, mailers, and graphic arts service providers. The full slate of presentations and panel discussions ran the gamut from color management and prepress to postpress and finishing, and highlighted technology and product introductions at last spring’s drupa. One of the panel discussions covered wide-format graphics. Moderated by Denise Gustavson, editorial director of Wide Format & Signage magazine, the panel included David Kehoe of Canon Solutions America, Marc Johnson of HP, and Kristof Dekeukelaere of Landa Digital Printing. Introduced by Gustavson as “truly one of the bright spots of the industry,” wide-format printing was highly visible at drupa (as our coverage indicated), and while there were few new product introductions (save for corrugated packaging) display graphics of all kinds were, well, on display, the response to a market that by virtually every metric is experiencing strong growth. The panelists were in agreement that the number one issue for wide-format print providers was increasing speed. “In display graphics, there’s the need for faster turnaround time, while maintaining the highest print quality for indoor and outdoor graphics,” said Kehoe.  Retailers—perhaps the most conspicuous of wide-format print buyers—are eager to speed time to market, while at the same time striving to customize in-store POP and other displays. “They want to hyper-localize information to a specific city, to a store, even to a season,” said Johnson. Retail displays that would at one time have been printed in long, static offset runs, kitted, and shipped en masse to all of a brand’s stores are now more and more produced in short runs tailored to each specific location. Sometimes this localization is for very practical reasons. “Prices can differ from one state to another,” said Dekeukelaere, “and even from the city to the suburbs.” At the same time, a retailer’s product mix can very often vary by geographic region: you don’t find many snow shovels and ice melter in stores in the Southwest, for example. Brandowners are also standardizing the look and feel across all elements of a marketing campaign, and display graphics are playing a bigger role in those campaigns. Take direct mail. “It’s mailed to customers and they bring that direct mail piece to the store,” said Johnson. “The poster, all the way down to the endcaps, are all drawn off the same campaign.” And, at the same time, “it’s hyper-localized to the store,” Johnson added. So when we talk about growth in wide-format volume, its not what we normally think about when we think of volume. “There’s a lot of volume, but it’s a lot of small pieces,” said Kehoe. “Brandowners are asking, ‘who can turn this the fastest?’” Hence the need for speed without sacrificing quality. It’s not just retailers. The hospitality industry, for example, is taking advantage of display graphics. “If a hotel is hosting a corporate meeting for, say, Boeing,” said Johnson, “the graphics in the meeting space reflect that.” Then, when another company books the space, the graphics are swapped out. “The margins you can make on this are great,” he added. So what market segments did the panelists see as the biggest growth areas? Wallpaper and other forms of décor were cited by virtually all the panelists. “Take wallpaper,” said Kehoe, “People wouldn’t change their wallpaper for 20 years. Now they can change it once a month. These are extremely profitable segments to be in.” As the number of print applications expands, many micro-segments are appearing. HP’s Johnson identified architectural firms and even hospitals. “Hospitals are putting clings on an MRI machine,” he said. “These are all things that weren’t possible 10 years ago.” Floor coverings, draperies, and more were also cited as strong growth areas. The panelists also mentioned a feature that will be debuting at the upcoming Graph Expo 2016: “The House That Print Built,” a show floor destination in which the floor, walls, and furniture were all printed on wide-format or other specialty graphics equipment. We’ve seen this kind of thing at past SGIA Expos, but these applications are now moving more decisively into general commercial printing. Another driver, related to localization, is personalization, especially at the consumer level. “Vehicle graphics are a consumer product,” said Johnson. “And using wide-format printers, it’s easy to print phone or tablet covers.” That’s a function of the versatility of today’s equipment. “These may not be applications you bought the printer for,” said Johnson, “but you can do them.” As you may have gleaned from this space over the past year or so, fabric and textile printing are also big growth areas. Why? “There are very low manufacturing costs, the colors can be more vibrant, and you can overcome the challenges of shipping since you’re just shipping a piece of fabric,” said Kehoe. “Fabric is the new signage,” said Johnson. “Look at how  many trade show booths now have some kind of textile-based signage.” Despite all the interest in fabric printing, the panelists agreed that apparel printing is not an area that they have found too many commercial printers looking to get into, except perhaps screen printers eyeing a move into digital. And then there’s Maude: what about corrugated packaging? “The limitation had been that there was no digital technology that could print corrugated, said Dekeukelaere. As a result, brandowners have a pent-up desire for the ability to do short-run corrugated. “Before they do long runs, they want to prototype everything,” said Kehoe. “They want to do test runs.” There are also more and more customers who don’t need to do long production runs and are asking for short-run corrugated packaging. “They’re saying, ‘we don’t want 10,000 boxes,’” said Kehoe. So, how do commercial printers—or anyone else—take advantage of these new growth areas? “You need to have a plan,” said Kehoe. “You can’t just buy the equipment and hope customers will come.” Digital wide-format printing is disrupting some of the traditional display graphics markets. “Sign companies are completely different today than they were five years ago,” said Kehoe. For commercial printers, that’ a good thing. “They want commercial printers to come in,” Kehoe added, “because there is just so much work.” However, the one important piece of advice Kehoe stressed was: “Don’t drop your margins.” Other panels at the Printing Industries Alliance event included drupa observations and an offset vs. digital discussion, both moderated by WhatTheyThink’s Patrick Henry; a session on color management, labels, and packaging, moderated by Steve Katz, editor of Label and Narrow Web; and a conversation about postpress and finishing moderated by yours truly.     Tweet       Email    Print    Order Reprints Please offer your feedback to Richard.

Finding someone with management and transportation experience, who can work for far less than what the private sector could pay, is proving impossible. That's why whoever is hired is likely to be a management expert outside the industry who has already made enough money and "wants to give back," according to a Port Authority source familiar with the deliberations. "We have high expectations for a person who is a jack-of-all-trades," the source said. But it's likely there will be an interim hire where the focus is more on leadership and management. The challenge of choosing an apolitical CEO is that any leader must be aware of the politics involved in running the agency. That was a problem John Degnan, the board chairman and appointee of Gov. Chris Christie, faced recently when community opposition erupted over plans for a new bus terminal, even though planning had been ongoing for years. Now the agency is hitting the reset button on that project. Another Port Authority executive said: "All options are on the table." The CEO search is a national one, and I could see a number of former Fortune 500 CEOs coming out of retirement to fill the job—should they not mind the accompanying headaches. Former Ford CEO Alan Mulally came from Boeing to steer the automaker through the Great Recession. He knows how to take a skill set from one industry and apply it to another. Ivan Seidenberg led Verizon and is a part owner of the Mets. He understands local. And Kevin Burke, who left Con Ed after 40 years with the utility, can certainly run a service company that operates in the public domain. There are many other exceptional private-sector managers and leaders. Yet the post remains unfilled. It's a sad statement. The Port Authority used to be a magnet for talented New Yorkers, especially engineers who saw themselves as being the master builders of the region. Not anymore.

QuickTake Pakistan’s Turmoil The proposal would give India partial control along with the U.S. over which countries are able to purchase F-16 fighter jets and spare parts, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. That may allow India to choke off key supplies to Pakistan, which has relied on F-16s as its main aerial defense for decades, if the U.S. allows it do so. “Some components may be produced only in India," Abhay Paranjape, director of business development at Lockheed Martin Aeronautics, said in an interview about the company’s F-16 proposal. Asked whether Pakistan would still be able to source F-16 jets or parts elsewhere under the arrangement, Paranjape said questions about foreign military sales policies should be referred to the U.S. government. Roger Cabiness, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Defense, in turn referred questions on the sale of F-16 spare parts to Lockheed. The strategic element is a key selling point as Lockheed pushes to win an order that may exceed 100 fighter jets, part of Modi’s plan to spend $150 billion on the armed forces and create jobs under his “Make-in-India" policy. A deal would breathe new life into the F-16, an older model than the stealth F-35 warplane, and further boost U.S.-India defense ties at the expense of Pakistan. India Focus “What we are doing is putting India as the center of the supply base," Randall Howard, Lockheed Martin’s aeronautics business development director, said on Aug. 4 in New Delhi.  “Today, there is no potential Pakistan sale." India and Pakistan have been enemies ever since partition when Britain exited the region in 1947. The nuclear-armed neighbors have fought three wars over disputed territory, and have few economic ties. U.S. relations with Pakistan have worsened in recent years. Congress in May refused to give subsidies for Pakistan to buy new F-16s, prompting it to consider buying used ones from Jordan instead. The U.S. this month withheld another $300 million in military aid to Pakistan over its failure to take action against terrorists carrying out attacks on American troops in neighboring Afghanistan. Pakistan Looking Elsewhere Nafees Zakaria, a spokesman for Pakistan’s foreign ministry, declined to answer questions about Lockheed Martin’s F-16 proposal, as did Nungsanglemba Ao, a spokesman for India’s defense ministry. The company’s overtures to India will prompt Pakistan to look more to China and Russia for military hardware, according to Najam Rafique, director at Islamabad’s Institute of Strategic Studies. “Pakistan is diversifying its options," he said. Competition for the India jet order is fierce. Lockheed Martin’s rivals such as Boeing Co. and Saab AB are all offering to shift some production to India as part of their bids to replenish India’s aging fleet. About a third of the nation’s 650 planes are more than 40 years old and set to retire in the next decade. Stalled Negotiations Modi last year scaled back an earlier deal with Dassault Aviation SA, opting to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets off the shelf instead of building 126 in India after negotiations hit repeated delays. That effort has since stalled over price, providing an opportunity to other jet-makers to step in. It’s unclear when a decision will be made. Lockheed’s proposal attempts to turn its greatest weakness -- the fact that Pakistan also flies F-16s -- into a main reason for India to acquire the jet. “Since India would house the only existing production line, it would be able to deny Pakistan any further platforms or also have influence on Pakistan Air Force logistics," said Pushan Das, who follows military modernization at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Lockheed Martin, which is winding down F-16 production in the U.S., has successfully sold the jet for decades. The proposed facility in India would provide much-needed highly skilled jobs as Modi heads into several important state-level elections in 2017. Manufacturing ‘Ecosystem’ “We are not looking at just assembling India’s F-16 here," Lockheed Martin’s Paranjape said. “We are looking at establishing a complete manufacturing base ecosystem." Of course, it is still unclear which firm will win India’s lucrative fighter jet contract.  Some analysts dismiss the F-16 as a dated “fourth generation" platform opposed by the Indian Air Force because it won’t have major upgrades in the future. Others like Georgetown University associate professor C. Christine Fair have suggested New Delhi is unlikely to get a more advanced fighter jet made in India because of difficulties with transferring state-of-the-art technology. While many obstacles remain, an agreement with Lockheed Martin would cement closer ties between the nations if the U.S. government doesn’t prevent the transfer of advanced radar or avionics technologies, according to Anit Mukherjee, an assistant professor at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. “If this deal was to happen -- and that’s a big if -- then it will be a big plus for U.S.-India relations and a significant indicator of the transformation in the defense relationship," he said. “If this deal goes through, and the U.S. is honest about tech transfer, then it has the potential to really build up India’s military-industrial base."

While you were sleeping: Hawks weigh on mood Aug. 23 (BusinessDesk) – The latest hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official weighed on equities and lifted the greenback as investors try to gauge the timing of a US interest rate increase. On Sunday Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer said “we are close to our targets” on employment and inflation, adding to recent comments from his central bank colleagues that suggest the Fed might raise rates sooner than previously thought. That further raised the already-high anticipation for a speech by Fed Chair Janet Yellen, this Friday, at the annual central bankers’ meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Her comments will be scrutinised for fresh clues. “Stan Fischer’s comments clearly raised the risk of a more hawkish tone from Yellen on Friday,” Dennis Debusschere, a senior managing director and global portfolio strategist at Evercore ISI in New York, told Bloomberg. “So that’s impacting the dollar, risk assets and commodity prices.” Wall Street was mixed. In 2.43pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.09 percent. However, the Nasdaq Composite Index inched 0.03 percent higher. In 2.28pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.15 percent. In the Dow, declines in shares of Apple and those of Johnson & Johnson, last 1 percent and 0.7 percent weaker respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Visa and those of Boeing, up 0.5 percent and 0.4 respectively. “We have been moving back and forth with this [Fed] rate increase for a while,” Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis in Brussels, told Bloomberg. “If you look at valuations, they’re not particularly cheap, so indeed markets have been very well supported. Therefore, they’re worried that interest rates will go up.” Deal news offered a boost. Shares of Medivation jumped, up 19.7 percent as of 2.49pm in New York after Pfizer won a takeover battle for the maker of cancer drug Xtandi, with a deal worth about US$14 billion. Shares of Pfizer traded 0.4 percent weaker as of 2.45pm in New York. “The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,” Ian Read, Pfizer’s chief executive officer, said in a statement. “The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer’s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term.” In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the session with a 0.1 percent slip from the previous close, as a drop in mining stocks weighed on the market. France’s CAC 40 index declined 0.2 percent, the UK’s FTSE 100 index fell 0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX index retreated 0.5 percent. Shares of Syngenta rallied, closing 10.6 percent higher, as state-owned China National Chemical won approval from the US national security regulator for its US$43 billion takeover of the Swiss chemical and seed company. Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz said it was a “major milestone for the deal,” adding in a note to clients that “approval removes a major potential hurdle and should come as a relief to Syngenta shareholders,” Reuters reported. Kepler Cheuvreux rates Syngenta shares a “Buy”.

Designed by Northrop in the 1950s, the T-38 was the world’s first supersonic trainer aircraft. Now, after serving for over half a century, the US Air Force is looking for a replacement. Northrop’s internally-funded T-X prototype is one of four options under consideration. The defense giant has kept details of the project under wraps. But a photo that surfaced on Friday provides some idea of the new trainer. — David Kern (@David_Kern) August 19, 2016 The photo, taken during high-speed taxi trials at Mojave Air and Space Port, shows a design that doesn’t stray too far from the T-38. The model is a twin-seat aircraft with wings fixed low on the fuselage, but features a single engine, unlike the twin-engine T-38. © Wikipedia/ United States Navy/ Kelly M. Agee Quite a Spin: US Navy F-35C’s 'Precision' Damages Runways The prototype was built by Northrop subsidiary Scaled Composites, despite earlier plans to work with partner BAE Systems. The T-X will compete with trainer aircraft designs from Raytheon-Leonardo, Lockheed Martin-Korean Aerospace Industries, and Boeing-Saab. The US Air Force is expected to make a decision by the end of 2017, with plans to purchase 450 of the aircraft. The photo was taken ahead of the T-X’s highly-anticipated first test flight. © Flickr/ Joint Hometown News Service 'Green Glow' Helmet Issue Is Blinding F-35 Pilots During Landing"We intend to fly the aircraft at a time which we believe aligns with the competition. So we will fly it when the competition dictates it," Tom Vice, president of Scaled Composite’s aerospace sector, said at the time. "Obviously we’re trying to hold on to the uniqueness of the design, but we will be flying that airplane probably in the first half of 2016." Whichever company the US government ultimately settles on, the new trainer will play a critical role in preparing future pilots for the F-35 Joint Strike fighter. ...

In a video showing a panel discussion on NASA's plans towards a mission to Mars, Bill Hill, Deputy Associate Administrator of NASA's exploration systems development division, said the US agency is exploring to hand over the international orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity in the next decade. "NASA's trying to develop economic development in low-Earth orbit. Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit. We figure that will be in the mid-20s," technology website The Verge quoted Hill as saying on Monday. The news came as Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins concluded their five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk last weekend where the two NASA astronauts successfully installed the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs). The IDAs will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft in development under NASA's Commercial Crew Programme. In the video, Hill also explained how NASA is preparing for a crewed Mars mission soon. Earlier this year, NASA awarded the second round of commercial contracts to resupply the International Space Station to three private spaceflight companies - Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. Every one of these companies gets at least six flights to deliver cargo to the space station, which will begin in late 2019 and extend through 2024. Orbital ATK of Virginia and SpaceX of California, the winners of the first round of NASA's Commercial Resupply Services contracts, have already used their own space capsules to send supplies several times to the orbiting lab about 400 km above the Earth.

Your mission – a DNA experiment in space to find out whether it was the sushi or burgers that were tainted with e.coli. That was the problem put to pupils and teachers at the Genes in Space workshop at the Emirates College for Advanced Education yesterday. It offered advice for pupils to fine tune their entries in the Genes in Space competition, the winners of which will have their experiments tested by astronauts on the ISS. The seminar started with a presentation about the space station and the type of experiments conducted on board. Pupils could then bounce their ideas off the co-founders of the miniPCR, a portable DNA lab that can carry out molecular biology, genetics and biological engineering experiments. The ideas included studying the effect of cosmic radiation on cancer cells, researching microgravity’s effect on vestibular ataxia – a condition in which astronauts’ balance, vision, and eyes are affected by space – and reproduction of plants in space. After the session, teachers and pupils had the chance to learn about the technologies that will be used by the astronauts. One pupil who has already had three experiments sent to space said working with the miniPCR would go a long way to help put another into orbit. "This is my first time using the machine. It’s very exciting," said Anoushka Ghosh, 13, of Gems Modern Academy Dubai. Her experiments on effects of microgravity on soft contact lenses, battery life and seed germination were sent to space this year as part of Nasa’s 2015 Cubes in Space. Maitha Al Kitbi, a laboratory technician at Al Sariya school in Sweihan, said she used a PCR machine in her previous job at a hospital laboratory, but had not had the chance to use the mini version. "The children will no doubt benefit from experimenting with it," she said. The competition, organised by the UAE Space Agency, The National and Boeing, allows pupils from Years 7 to 12 to design an experiment that addresses real challenges in space exploration. Mohammed Al Otaiba, The National’s Editor-in-Chief, said the event allowed those attending to expand their knowledge of space and microbiology, while gaining first-hand experience in the use of latest technology. "This is a one-of-a-kind workshop for a one-of-a-kind space contest, which will generate excitement not only among those here but everyone involved in the competition," Mr Al Otaiba said. Chief innovation officer at the UAE Space Agency, Sheikha Al Maskari, said she was astonished by the level of curiosity and knowledge the pupils had. "One of our main goals at the agency is to develop human capital and promote STEM learning and education and we think this competition is going to add a lot of value," she said. Ezequiel Alvarez-Saavedra, one of the miniPCR founders, told pupils theirs was only the second Genes in Space contest in the world. The other is in the US.

It has come to represent the largest city in Kansas, and was also adopted for a time by a flying unit at nearby McConnell Air Force Base, where an image of the sculpture emblazoned the sides of giant Boeing Stratotankers. The sculpture is forged from weathering steel, and stands at the eastern tip of the park.  Two bow and arrow inspired pedestrian bridges provide access to the spot, and there are nightly (weather and river levels permitting) ceremonial Rings of Fire that light the statue and the surrounding landscape.    In addition to his work as a fine artist, Bosin—the grandson of a Kiowa chief—was a veteran of World War II, and a commercial artist as well. His designs, sculptures and paintings are in several prominent public spaces, and are much sought-after by collectors. But it is his steel Keeper, designed, installed and gifted to commemorate the U.S. Bicentennial, that he created to represent a brotherhood of all Native Americans, and the confluence of all the communities of the Plains.  #native americans#rivers#fires#nature#parks#monuments Know Before You Go Keeper of the Plains statue is at the eastern point of the park at the Mid-American All-Indian Center, where the Little Arkansas River meets the Arkansas River. Entrance to the park for cars is off N. Seneca Street, and by footbridge across the Rivers. The park is free and open to the public all year (closed between the hours of midnight and 5am). The Ring of Fire burns for 15 minutes each evening, during daylight savings time at 9pm, and during standard time at 7pm. The lighting of the flame is dependent on weather conditions, as well as the level of the rivers.

"NASA's trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit," said Bill Hill, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development. "Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit," said Hill, speaking on a panel of NASA staff assembled to discuss the upcoming Mars mission. The timing fits with the end of the US government's current funding of the ISS programme, which was extended by Obama administration from its original deorbiting date of 2016 through 2020, 'Tech Crunch' reported. Operations were prolonged through 2024 to help give NASA a platform from which to run its near-Earth preparatory missions leading up to the ultimate manned mission to Mars. However, NASA did not specify any potential buyer. A new docking adapter is being put in place to support crew shuttle missions from Boeing and SpaceX, both of which are set to start shuttling personnel to the ISS in 2017. SpaceX has been running resupply missions for the space station and NASA since 2012, and has completed nine such missions to date.

The chamber exposes individual boxes and the fully assembled flight system to the vacuum and thermal environment they’ll experience in orbit. MEDIA CONTACT Available for logged-in reporters only CITATIONS CHANNELS Technology, Energy, Engineering, Nuclear Physics, Nuclear Power, Space KEYWORDS nuclear detonation detection, Global Burst Detection system, GPS ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Sandia National Laboratories’ Jaime Gomez was too busy to celebrate the successful launch of the latest nuclear detonation detection system — he was already deep into the next generation. The Global Burst Detection (GBD) system launched Feb. 5 from Cape Canaveral aboard the 70th Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite. The GBD looks for nuclear detonations around the world, offering real-time information about potential activity to U.S. policymakers. As project lead, Gomez oversaw teams responsible for everything from development to post-launch testing. The launch was the 12th and final of the Block IIF (GPSIIF) series of GPS satellites in medium Earth orbit. Project Manager Bridget McKenney said that even before the final GPSIIF launch, Sandia was producing and delivering another generation of GBDs for a new round of eight satellites, GPSIII, that Lockheed Martin Corp. is building. Sandia is already looking ahead to detectors for the launch series after that, dubbed Prime. “We work 10 years ahead, from the time we get a concept for what the next generation of improved technologies and sensing will be,” McKenney said. Each GBD program starts with the initial concept, followed by approvals, engineering development, an extensive and complex design cycle and production and testing. The work is funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration. Sandia has been in the business of nuclear detonation detection for more than 50 years, starting with the 1963 launch of the first of 12 U.S. Vela satellites to detect atmospheric nuclear testing and verify compliance with the Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963 and subsequently the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974. That marked the start of the U.S. Nuclear Detonation Detection System that supports treaty monitoring. GPSIII scheduled to launch next year Defense Support Program satellites followed, succeeded by the earliest GPS satellites in 1978. The first of the IIF series was launched in 2010. The first GPSIII is scheduled to launch in 2017. From the start, GPS satellites were seen as an ideal platform to look for nuclear detonations. Gomez said the sheer numbers planned meant there always would be many GBD systems in space, a detection redundancy highly prized during the Cold War. Today, GPS satellites are important for treaty verification and countless civilian uses, including timing signals for communications networks, financial markets and power grids, ship navigation and even pinpointing where crops might need more water or fertilizer. Sandia’s GBD mission is appealing to Gomez and the rest of the Sandia team because it deals with space. “I think we’re all fascinated by space,” said Gomez, deputy project manager for the generation that will fly on GPSIII. “And the treaty verification work is meaningful to a lot of folks.” Detection was a natural extension for the labs that designed the early stockpile. They understood the physics and engineering of the weapons and the detectable optical, electromagnetic pulse and X-ray signals they produce. “Those are the three that make it to space and what the GBD tries to detect,” Gomez said. Sandia develops the optical sensors; Los Alamos National Laboratory is responsible for electromagnetic pulse and X-ray sensors. It takes about two years to build, test and integrate GBD hardware into a satellite system, Gomez said. Five subsystems — what the teams call “boxes” — of sensors and instruments make up a GBD: three from Sandia and two from Los Alamos. Sandia integrates system Sandia integrates it all into an overall system and performs seemingly endless tests. When a satellite launches, everything aboard faces extreme temperatures, vibration and shock. Sandia’s testing and computer models help determine how the rigors of launch and deployment will affect the GBD. Teams assemble boxes from printed circuit boards, wiring harnesses and other mechanical hardware, conducting electrical and thermal testing on individual modules and pieces before assembly into the box. They follow with integration, electrical, functional, thermal and vibration tests for each box. The five completed boxes together become a GBD system or payload. The entire system is then subjected to integration, functional, electrical, thermal-vacuum and other tests before it’s shipped to the space vehicle contractor. Further electrical testing is done at the contractor site. “Teams that build the hardware here develop a test plan suited for their subsystem and do that testing. Then we integrate the payload as the five boxes and do additional testing,” Gomez said. “At every level of integration, whether it’s the box level or a whole system at the vehicle level, you add to the testing to make sure that at every integration point the payload is operating.” That’s especially important because the hardware can’t be repaired in space. “Some things you can fix through software but you depend on building something that has high reliability,” Gomez said. McKenney added, “We have a very good track record for that. I think we can say that our payloads have substantially exceeded their design life.” About 30 satellites and their detectors, representing several generations, remain in operation, some well past their design life, Gomez and McKenney said. The satellite generation before IIF was designed for 7.5 years, IIF was designed for 12 years and GPSIII and Prime will be designed for 15 years. Payload must last as long as satellite “GPS drives us because we want our payload to last as long as the bird does,” McKenney said. Sandia teams work where the payloads go as they move toward launch. Gomez described the process for IIF: Once testing showed the GBD met requirements, Sandia shipped its payload to the satellite contractor, Boeing in El Segundo, California, for more tests. Sandia employees at the Boeing site provided GBD components for Boeing to install. Then the satellite went through months of additional tests, aided by the on-site Sandia team. Some 60 to 90 days before launch, Boeing shipped the satellite to Cape Canaveral, where ground crews aided by Sandia also did tests. Days after launch, a Sandia team arrived at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado, for about a month of early orbit testing before the system was handed over to the Air Force to operate. Even that isn’t the end. “We have a group that examines telemetry coming down from our payloads so we can monitor the state of health,” McKenney said. Developers use that information to improve next-generation technology. Under an agreement with the Air Force, Sandia also develops ground station components that support the Nuclear Detonation Detection System and integrate data from all the satellites. As project lead, Gomez worked with the program office headed by McKenney, subsystem managers, team leaders and colleagues at Los Alamos to ensure GBD development and delivery stayed on schedule. “It’s very much about schedule because our payload is integrated on a satellite that the Air Force is paying a subcontractor to build,” he said. “We have equipment that bolts onto that satellite so we need to be there and we need to be there with a product that works.” He smiled and quoted a 2015 tweet from astronaut Scott Kelly that’s been informally adopted by members of Sandia’s satellite group: “Space is hard.” Permalink to this article COMMENTS | COMMENTING POLICY Comment/Share Share Leave a comment...

The Norfolks are doing marriage right Edward 18th Duke of Norfolk and his wife, Georgina, on their wedding day in 1987 Credit: Mark Richards/ANL/REX/Shutterstock Lucy Mangan 22 August 2016 • 3:31pm It seems that the secret suspicion that owning a castle could solve most of life’s problems is not as ridiculous as you might have been told (mostly by people who own castles and don’t want to give you theirs). In 2011 the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk separated after nearly a quarter century of marriage, saying they had grown apart. The duke went to the east wing of Arundel Castle, the family seat, and she took up residence in the west wing.  They were so bitterly hostile to each other that they turned down an invitation to the Royal Wedding because they couldn’t bear to be in a room together, even one so generously proportioned as Westminster Abbey.  The couple in 2008 Credit: Graham Franks/Camera Press As ever with ducal separations, there was great anxiety and speculation. Who would get custody of the dogs? The paintings? The award-winning village gastropub? But no-one need have worried. The Norfolks have unexpectedly and happily reconciled (one assumes they took it slowly – maybe a few date nights in the folly at first, some trial weekends in the gatehouse followed by a fortnight in the dower house, and so on) and it seems clear that the castle that allowed them to retreat from each other without fully rupturing the relationship must take no small share of the credit. I signed up for sex on tap, not sweating, snoring and scratching all pigging night Couples are always being encouraged to “give each other space”, by cultivating their own hobbies, their own friends, their own nights out and so on. Which is all good advice, but actually what you need first and foremost is real space. The literal, not metaphorical kind. But of course this is tricky for most of us – castle-light and mortgage-heavy as we are – to arrange. Of course there are some people for whom the whole purpose of love and marriage is to have someone with you all the time. Constant companionship is, for them, the greatest advantage of the marital state. Someone to eat with, talk with, sit on the sofa with, go to parties with – they never tire of any of it or of each other.  Arundel Castle, seat of the Duke of Norfolk, in West Sussex Credit: Derek Croucher / Alamy  These are people who need people and indeed they are the luckiest people. They love it, for instance, when a spouse shouts “What are you doing?” whenever you move out of their sightline in the house. They don’t wish you dead for that at all. For the rest of us, it’s a bit more complicated. We need those separate wings. Failing that, we must try to carve out smaller private spaces.  Couples comprising one person who executes their daily ablutions with a bucket of water and bar of carbolic and one who views the two-hour bath surrounded by candles and whale music as essential to civilised living will aim for separate bathrooms.  For introverts like me, having someone around as much as a spouse generally is, is deeply trying If you’ve got one reader and one television watcher or music lover in the pair, you will try  arrange separate sitting rooms.  Or – and anecdotal evidence gathered over many a drunken evening with my female friends suggests this might be top pick among women at least – there is the option of separate bedrooms.  As one of those friends, who shall remain nameless, once put it over a bottle of Chateau d’un Peu Too Much Information: “I signed up for sex on tap, not sweating, snoring and scratching all pigging night. GO TO YOUR ROOM.”  It is a position supported, albeit slightly more decorously by Princess Michael of Kent herself, who, when faced with the prospect of downsizing and having to reside full-time in Kensington Palace, argued that having different sleeping quarters from a husband “keeps you fresher for each other. You won’t see each other being cross or saying ‘I can’t do this up, it’s too tight!’” Couple hoping to get married get divorced by mistake Play! 01:48 I have, in my eight years of married life, tried for all of these divisions at one time or another. I managed to get a super-king-sized bed as a result, which is almost as good as separate bedrooms (“Hmm,” said my husband on our first night in it, from four feet away. “I feel it’s not so much saving our marriage as deluding us into thinking it continues to exist.” “I know,” I said delightedly. “Money well spent!”).  My husband and I both have home offices, which have been only a limited success, however.  As I type this in the (converted) loft, I can hear my husband two floors below. It sounds like he’s wrestling a bear in the wreckage of a Boeing 747 but long experience has taught me that this is just the sound of him making a cup of tea.  Soon he will stomp up the stairs, slam his own study door and return to swearing loudly at the computer. I, meanwhile, will pop another paracetamol and try and make it through another day of marital disharmony.  The more distance we could put between my need for peace and quiet and his inability to move through time and space without leaving what seems like the noise of 17 unfolding disasters behind him, the happier we – by which I mean I, who amnevertheless an important part of We – would be. Could adultery save your marriage? For introverts like me (and there are a lot more of us around than you think, because we prefer to get quietly depressed than make a fuss), having someone around as much as a spouse generally is, is deeply trying. Even if he or she is quiet, there is still a presence in the house. There are still conversations that you don’t want to have, questions you don’t want to answer, and other constant depredations – as your temperament perceives what normal people would call simple human interactions - on your resources.  Good thick walls and a discouragingly long walk between the two of you (I would paste an “Is your journey really necessary?” poster on every door along the way) is very much what’s needed here. We might not have an east (or west) wing to retreat to when the going gets tough, but most of us could carve out some space for ourselves – or our partner, if she/he’s the one prowling round the relationship like a caged lion, that loves you, but will savage you if you don’t stop smashing up Boeing 747s in the kitchen. Ahem – if we just realise that it’s a safety valve, not the thin end of the divorce wedge.  Share all the hobbies and friends you like – but give each other some space.

A recent survey of over 1,500 people in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, conducted by YouGov revealed that 43 per cent of Emirates’ residents are planning to travel during the Eid holiday. “The economic slowdown hasn't seemingly deterred UAE residents from their annual travel plans and with a wealth of cultural, relaxing and city destinations reachable from Dubai in under four hours by air, we are seeing a surge of interest for stays at our member properties in destinations ranging from legendary India and the natural beauty of Georgia to pure relaxation in the Maldives,” said Saurabh Rai, executive vice president of Preferred Hotels & Resorts, the world’s largest independent hotel brand. According to YouGov, four and five-star hotels are the top choice for families with 32 per cent of accommodation requests by UAE residents for four-star options and 48 per cent choosing to go the full luxury route. Popular destinations winning the public vote include India, just 3.5 hours away which, with the recent introduction of the e-Tourist Visa has seen rising numbers of UAE visitors since 2015. In India, the growing line-up of Preferred hotels include Chennai’s stunning The Leela Palace Chennai. This five-star hotel combines Indian tradition and contemporary comfort. Guests can enjoy the Spectra restaurant which boasts seven interactive kitchens and views overlooking the Adyar River and Bay of Bengal. The Greater Caucasus, with its dramatic mountains and abundance of outdoor activity options is becoming increasingly popular with regional travellers. Just a three hour’s flight from the UAE is Georgia, which attracted over 17,000 UAE visitors in 2015, up 687 pe cent year-on-year according to Georgian National Tourism Administration. Home to Georgia’s historic viticulture community, the five-star Hotel Kabadoni, located in the picturesque cobbled street town of Sighnaghi is one of Georgia’s most exclusive country hotels. Overlooking a vista of terracotta roofs and colourful balconies, guests can relax in the traditional Georgian interiors style in any of the 21 guestrooms or enjoy a local glass of grape at the rooftop restaurant. Egypt is another perennial favourite in the under four-hour bracket, and the country’s tourism ministry figures revealed 180,000 MENA region tourists in the first quarter of 2016. UAE visitors topped demand, with 100,000 visitors, boosting the Egyptian economy to the tune of an average US$140 per night. The ultimate R&R destination, the Maldives may be at the high end of the affordable short break spectrum, but is also a preferred destination for UAE travellers, just 4.25 hours away. Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu in the Maldives is another Preferred hotel that defines luxury escapism in every sense of the word. “The availability of low cost carriers is also helping boost demand, with Air Arabia and FlyDubai’s route networks adding new destinations all the time, and opening up a number of new and exciting destinations to intrepid travellers,” said Rai. Data released by global aviation leader Boeing, revealed that in 2015 Asian low cost carriers recorded average annual growth of 24.5 per cent over the previous decade against just 13.4 per cent by European carriers. “Staycations are also a popular alternative, and with 23 per cent of local residents unable to travel due to work commitments, a stay at our partner property Palazzo Versace, could be just the answer for 72 hours of upscale downtime,” said Rai. Newly added to the Preferred portfolio, Palazzo Versace Dubai enjoys a prime waterfront location on the Dubai Creek in the heart of the upcoming Culture Village development. With its architecturally noteworthy exteriors and interiors already attracting a host of local VIPs and international celebrities, guests enter an all-Versace environment complemented by an Olympic-sized pool and collection of on-trend restaurants. - TradeArbaia News Service   Tags: UAE | hotels | travel | Eid | Preferred | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils UAE National Day offers Dubai Outlet Mall to host art festival Air Arabia confirms options for five Airbus A320s Motiongate Dubai unveils sneak peak trailer of Step Up Dubai Bab Al Qasr Hotel unveils special F1 offers Kuwait Airways launches direct flights to four destinations Supercasa awards RAK hotel consultancy contract ME hotel revenues down in October, Africa results mixed Lufthansa cancels 900 flights as pilots go on two-day strike InterCon to restart work on 350-room UAE resort Jumeirah Al Naseem to open in December New digital membership card for Qatar Airways' Privilege Club members Sofitel Abu Dhabi Corniche welcomes new chef de cuisine Turkish Airlines adds new on-board entertainment option Labranda Hotels expands its portfolio in Turkey US approves Airbus sale of over 100 jets to Iran Lufthansa cancels 876 flights on Nov 23 Iata appoints new regional VP for Middle East, Africa Wyndham Hotel Group welcomes new MEA regional VP Abu Dhabi Airport welcomes over 20m passengers till Oct RJ honours best-selling travel agents for 2016 Earn Gulf Air Falconflyer miles with Al Salam Bank visa credit cards Slovenia sees rise in ME tourist numbers Dubai Culture, ArtintheCity launch 24th edition of ArtMap Etihad Aviation Group showcases future of air travel Abu Dhabi food festival to serve culinary extravaganza Wataniya Airways inks key deal to boost passenger service system Gulfstream to showcase business jets at MEBAA 2016 RAK to launch adventure tours Turkish Airlines wins new award in advertising Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

In a video showing a panel discussion on Nasa's plans towards a mission to Mars, Bill Hill, Deputy Associate Administrator of Nasa's exploration systems development division, said the US agency is exploring to hand over the international orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity in the next decade. "Nasa's trying to develop economic development in low-Earth orbit. Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit. We figure that will be in the mid-20s," technology website The Verge quoted Hill as saying on Monday. The news came as Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins concluded their five-hour and 58-minute spacewalk last weekend where the two Nasa astronauts successfully installed the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs).The IDAs will be used for the future arrivals of Boeing and SpaceX commercial crew spacecraft in development under Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme. In the video, Hill also explained how Nasa is preparing for a crewed Mars mission soon. Earlier this year, Nasa awarded the second round of commercial contracts to resupply the International Space Station to three private spaceflight companies - Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada and SpaceX. Every one of these companies gets at least six flights to deliver cargo to the space station, which will begin in late 2019 and extend through 2024. Orbital ATK of Virginia and SpaceX of California, the winners of the first round of Nasa's Commercial Resupply Services contracts, have already used their own space capsules to send supplies several times to the orbiting lab about 400 km above the Earth. US President Barack Obama has proposed $19 billion (roughly Rs. 128,000 crores) for the US space agency in the fiscal 2017 budget -- a little less that $19.3 billion Nasa received for the fiscal 2016.

Last week, Tactical Missile Systems Corporation general director Boris Obnosov told Russian media that he was confident that Russia would be introducing hypersonic missiles capable of speeds between Mach 6 and Mach 7 by the year 2020. © Photo: Youtube / Vasya Ivanov Moscow's No-Fly Zones: Russia to Get New Long-Range Missile InterceptorThe director emphasized that such weapons would significantly weaken the potential of enemy missile defense. "It's obvious that with such speeds – when missiles will be capable of flying through the atmosphere at speeds of 7-12 times the speed of sound, all [air] defense systems will be weakened considerably." Tactical Missile Systems Corporation (KTRV by its Russian acronym) is based in Korolyev, outside Moscow. Several dozen specialized research institutes and industrial enterprises are involved in the development of Russia's hypersonic missile potential, with KTRV a leader in this area not only in Russia but also compared to defense engineering companies globally. Obnosov's comments come on the heels of a recent speech by Admiral Cecil Haney, the Head of US Strategic Command, in which the admiral warned that American anti-missile and anti-aircraft defense systems will be virtually incapable of intercepting the Russian hypersonic systems expected to be deployed soon. Commenting on these developments in a piece for Svobodnaya Pressa, Russian defense analyst Vladimir Tuchkov pointed out that while supersonic weapons have become a very popular topic of discussion today, their development actually began much, much earlier, going back to the Cold War. The analyst recalled that "in the 1970s, the Raduga Design Bureau, now a part of KTRV, began research exploring the possibility of creating a cruise missile with a speed of Mach 5 or greater. At the time, the problem was little studied. Firstly, it was impossible to use ordinary turbojet engines for speeds in excess of Mach 3. The sharp increase in air speed pressure resulted in a loss of efficiency in the engines, with a sharp rise in temperature in the combustion chamber of the air-fuel mixture also reducing efficiency. The higher the temperature, the lower the thrust. Moreover, as temperatures rose, so too did the risk of the rocket's turbine blades becoming deformed and simply melting." © Photo: YouTube/ styropyro Pentagon Developing Secret Anti-Drone Death Laser and They Want Your Help!"In this situation," Tuchkov noted, "the only option is the use of a ramjet engine — in this case a hypersonic scramjet. The use of a rocket engine, either liquid or solid fueled, for cruise missiles, is impossible, since the entire trajectory of the flight must be actively controlled and adjustable." "The design of the scramjet is very simple, with the number of moving parts reduced to a minimum. Theoretically, these craft can reach speeds of up to Mach 25, although the practical ceiling of operation is about Mach 17-19. However, the scramjet also has a significant drawback – its normal operation begins at speeds exceeding Mach 3. Before this speed, it is necessary to accelerate the missile using a solid booster, or some other method, similar to the kind used to launch a high-speed aircraft." The analyst recalled that when development of hypersonic missile technology first began in the Soviet period, one of the key problems for engineers was overheating. "It was necessary to create the kind of heat shield through which the onboard flight control equipment would continue to work flawlessly." In the 1980s, Raduga Design Bureau created several prototypes of a new cruise missile – the Kh-90, NATO codenamed Koala. The cruise missile weighed 15 tons, had a length of 9 meters, and a 7 meter wingspan. With an expected range of up to 3,000 km, the missile had a design speed of Mach 5. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov A hypersonic missile design displayed at an exhibition staged by the Raduga Design Bureau "The project," Tuchkov noted, "advanced far enough for several test launches to be conducted. During the last of them, the missile reached speeds ranging from Mach 3 to Mach 4." The missile was aircraft-launched. Of course, "all of the USSR's hypersonic weapons designs were strictly classified. It was only due to the fact that the project was closed in 1992 thanks to a lack of financing and the collapse of the defense industry in general that some information about the Kh-90 has become publically available." After a period of stagnation in the 1990s, development resumed. Today, the analyst noted, Russia has reached a point where it has created and is actively testing at least two hypersonic systems. "This includes the 3K-22 Zircon anti-ship cruise missile, the main developer of which is the NPO Machine Building plant in Reutov, outside Moscow, which is also part of KTRV. At the same time, an export version of the missile, known as the Brahmos, is being developed for the Indian Navy." © Photo: militaryrussia.ru The Indo-Russian BrahMos II hypersonic cruise missile (pictured here at Defexpo 2014) is the export variant of the Russian 3M22 Zircon missile The first information about the Zircon appeared in 2011, with testing beginning a year later. "To date, five test launches have been made…During the last launch, in March of this year, the rocket was successfully tested in normal operation mode." Effectively, Tuchkov noted, "work on the Zircon is progressing so rapidly that the first state testing is expected to begin next year, and mass production the year after that, in 2018. In this connection, the Tactical Missile System Corporation director's forecasts about the year 2020 looks quite modest." © AP Photo/ DARPA STRATCOM: Russia's 7,680MPH Hypersonic Glider 'Challenges' America’s Defenses"Of course, he is talking about speeds of Mach 6-7, while the Zircon's design speed is 'only' Mach 5. Various estimates suggest its range may be between 400 and 1,000 km. Precise information on the engines is not available, but informed analysts suggest that acceleration is carried out via a reactive solid booster, with a scramjet used as the main engine." Furthermore, the Zircon has already been slated for installation onboard the heavy nuclear missile cruisers — the Peter the Great and the Admiral Nakhimov. It is also expected that a new Russian nuclear submarine, codenamed Project-Husky, currently under development, will be equipped with the Zircon. "As for Project 4202, it appears that this system will be able to meet and surpass the speeds discussed by Tactical Missiles Corporation's director. This missile too is being developed by the NPO Machine Building plant. To be more precise – this is not an independent missile, but rather a warhead onboard an intercontinental ballistic missile, which, after separation from the launch vehicle, acts like a hypersonic cruise missile would, maneuvering freely to determine direction and pitch." According to informed estimates, Project 4202 is capable of speeds between Mach 7 and Mach 12. For this reason, Tuchkov noted, the system can overcome "not only modern means of US missile defense, but even those systems which American engineers have not even begun to develop yet." © AP Photo/ U.S. Air Force via AP US Missile Designed to Challenge Russia's Sarmat ICBM a Decade Behind ScheduleThe testing of Russia's hypersonic gliders is taking place using the tried and true RS-18B 'Stiletto' silo-based ICBMs, used to accelerate them up to the appropriate speed. "After being adopted by the military, Project 4202 will be installed aboard the new RS-28 Sarmat, and on future Russian ICBM designs. This is expected to take place between 2020 and 2025. When the expected first batch of 20 supersonic warheads is rolled out, it will effectively make the US missile defense system pointless. Every Sarmat will feature three hypersonic combat gliders." Foreign Analogues: USA Of course Russia is not the only country engaged in the creation of prospective hypersonic weaponry. The X-51, being developed by the Boeing Corporation under the aegis of the Pentagon's 'prompt global strike' concept, is expected to reach speeds of Mach 6-7. Testing began in 2010, but, as Tuchkov pointed out, none of them have been deemed successful so far. Brought into the air aboard a B-52 strategic bomber, the X-51, with a range of 500 km, has clocked a maximum speed of Mach 5.1. "However, all flights ended in the destruction of the test missile before the end of its planned flight." US Air Force The US experimental X-51A Waverider aircraft tucked under the wing of a B52 bomber. "Setting out on this costly project, the US positioned it as a tool for effective and lighting-speed strikes against terrorist groups. However, there is no doubt that the Pentagon also had in mind the traditional confrontation with Russia, and against a rapidly developing China. Yet the X-51, even if it is brought into mass production, will not solve the problems it was designed to handle, since the prospective Russian S-500 anti-aircraft missile system is expected to be capable of destroying hypersonic missiles." © Photo: Rex Features DARPA Sets Sights on Robotic Space Plane for Next Generation WarfareIn this sense, Tuchkov noted, the DARPA program's Falcon HTV-2 has better characteristics in terms of its speed, having been successfully clocked at Mach 20. But the vehicle was launched from near space, first carried up by rocket booster, from where it hurled back down to earth.  "In other words, there's nothing new here; the US Space Shuttles and our Buran flew in similar fashion. Following the second test, which took place in 2011, the missile was recognized as unpromising, since it was almost uncontrollable, and impossible to establish communications with." Foreign Analogues: China China too is actively involved in the development of hypersonic technology, beginning with its WU-14 rocket, which began testing in 2013. An average of three tests per year has taken place since then. The system's declared speed is Mach 10, although as Tuchkov pointed out, a variety of contradictory information has been circulating, estimating speeds from Mach 1.5 to Mach 7. © Wikipedia The WU-14 hypersonic glide vehicle. Artist's rendering. "Series production of the WU-14 is expected to begin in the second half of the 2020s, and it is expected to be mounted on ballistic missiles, which for the Chinese is very important. Today, only a small number of Chinese ICBMs is capable of reaching the US, giving the Pentagon the hypothetical ability to fight off a Chinese nuclear attack. For Beijing, this is not only insulting, but disadvantageous in the diplomatic competition between the powers. With the arrival of hypersonic warheads, the US is expected to 'behave' more prudently." "Another task entrusted to the new weapon is the destruction of aircraft carriers; their defenses would be powerless against maneuverable warheads traveling at speeds of Mach 10." ...

West was showing ex NAZI'S using lasers on balloons. Blowing up the internal balloons. This is early 50's . Soviets were also at it way before. AA defenses were part of Soviet scratch programs, meaning starting from scratch, way before. MANY believe as soon as BALLOONS were used to watch and drop things. But the evidence may been lost. What is known on Soviet is just SALVAGE. Must was destroyed, to keep west away from it. Like the RD 170 rocket engines. They were ordered destroyed, because the world had nothing even close. They instead hid them. And many things will be un earthed eventually. Reason west is DESPERATE to break up Russia continent in small parts. Japan will get all Kuril and parts of far east.. they have it all divided. Russia MUST get strong and find spies etc FAST. Tomorrow? That was yesterday.

Image via NASA NASA has always said the International Space Station (ISS) would not be a permanent project in Earth’s orbit, but now it has revealed that, within a decade, it hopes to sell off the station to a private company. As the largest human-constructed object in space, costing more than €100bn, the ISS remains one of humankind’s greatest engineering achievements. However, in the years that have passed since the first modules were launched into orbit in 2000, it has become clear that international space agencies like NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA) and Roscosmos are not going to fund it forever. While new modules are currently being installed on the ISS for scientific-testing purposes, NASA has now revealed during a panel discussion on its future mission to land humans on Mars that the ISS will be sold off to private space company within the next decade. Its aim, according to NASA’s deputy associate administrator for exploration systems development, Bill Hill, is to work with private space companies to help us get to Mars faster than NASA could achieve on its own. During the discussion, Hill said: “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit, we figure that will be in the mid-20s.” This would follow the intentions of the current US presidency under Barack Obama, which had penned 2024 as the final year it would directly fund the ISS, despite Boeing’s efforts to conduct a feasibility study to see if it could last until 2028. In fact, Boeing has already contributed to the space station’s commercial future with the installation of a new docking bay. Capable of hosting two astronauts, the docking bay will act as the commercial hub for the ISS and is designed to be compatible with Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon craft.

TrendsViral The Outer Space Treaty is the product of mankind’s bid to reach the stars. Enacted in 1967, the UN resolution set the standard for conduct in space, essentially warning nations to never claim sovereignty over the Moon or stockpile nuclear weapons on future space stations. “States Parties to the Treaty undertake not to place in orbit around the earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction, install such weapons on celestial bodies, or station such weapons in outer space in any other manner,” Article IV of the treaty reads. 49 years ago today the Outer Space Treaty was signed banning orbital WMDs and military actions on the moon. pic.twitter.com/BhbnscqaFd— Chester Fritz Lib. (@UND_CFLibrary) January 27, 2016 First signed by the USSR, the United Kingdom and the US, the treaty has since grown to include 104 countries, such as China, Iran, North Korea and India. Smaller nations such as Haiti, San Marino and Nepal have also promised to keep the peace and pay for any damage they might cause while shuttling astronauts or equipment around the universe. Intergalactic space race? It is of course unlikely that planet-sized death rays will pop up around the universe anytime soon. But inch by inch, step by step, some of the world’s superpowers are preparing to defend themselves way beyond their borders, thus heightening the chances of deadly force being used in space. Weapons of mass destruction are in theory forbidden from entering orbit. But hardware - some carrying real arms, others only displaying potential - have already reached beyond the atmosphere, in the guise of secretive, or at least hush-hush, tests. In fact, the existence of intergalactic weaponry goes back as far as the 1970s. US On Friday, the US Air Force fired two new satellites into orbit from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch is part of the obtusely-titled Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP), designed to track “man-made orbiting objects” floating around the major satellite channels above earth. There are now four operational GSSAP satellites in total. The US Air Force remain coy about their purpose, saying they will perform “rendezvous and proximity operations”, collect data and help prevent satellite collisions. However, it is thought their development is also part of efforts to pre-empt space weapons the US government believes its rivals are developing, such as satellite-destroying ‘space mines’. A statement released to USA Today suggests as much. “The space domain has increasingly become congested, contested, and competitive,” Air Force Space Command spokesperson Lt Sarah Burnett is quoted as saying. “Some countries have clearly signaled their intent and ability to conduct hostile operations in space as an extension of the terrestrial battlefield.” A 2008 operation provides some evidence that the US has what it takes to militarise space. Back then a SM-3 missile fired from the naval cruiser USS Lake Erie blew up a US spy satellite about 250km (155 miles) above earth.   The use of Boeing’s X-37B OTV by the US Air Force has also raised concerns that the ‘space plane’ could one day be deployed as a weapon. A fact sheet drawn up by the Secure World Foundation, which advocates “peaceful” operations in space, states the vehicle has a “near zero” chance of being an “orbital weapons system.” The group do, however, suggest it could be used to “rendezvous and inspect satellites, either friendly or adversary, and potentially grab and de-orbit” them. China In 2007, the nation fired a missile from its Xichang Space Center which destroyed defunct weather satellite, Fengyun 1. Since then the lack of information surrounding Chinese space launches has aroused suspicion. A 2015 US Congress report on China’s military capabilities highlighted a number of suspect tests carried out by the nation, including a case in 2013 where an unidentified object reached an altitude of 30,000km before re-entering the earth's atmosphere 9.5 hours later. In that time no satellites were released, with US surveillance suggesting the incident was “not consistent with traditional space-launch vehicles, ballistic missiles or sounding rocket launches used for scientific research.” READ MORE: China missile test reignites ‘satellite killer’ fears Further images from a test last year did little to quell rumors the Chinese government was ramping up its space capabilities.

After all, the Soviet Union was regarded as one of the first governments to develop ASAT (anti-satellite) technology. A top secret experiment on board the Soviet Almaz space stations resulted in a cannon being fired remotely in space back in 1975.

Preferred Hotels & Resorts' properties ideally situated for short breaks with a collection of world-class hospitality experiences available in under four hours' flight time from Dubai 22 August 2016 According to Preferred Hotels & Resorts, with the Eid holidays on the horizon UAE residents are gearing up for a short getaway with easily accessible destinations the top choice as summer winds down. A recent survey of over 1,500 people in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, conducted by YouGov revealed that 43% of Emirates' residents are planning to travel during the Eid holiday. "The economic slowdown hasn't seemingly deterred UAE residents from their annual travel plans and with a wealth of cultural, relaxing and city destinations reachable from Dubai in under four hours by air, we are seeing a surge of interest for stays at our member properties in destinations ranging from legendary India and the natural beauty of Georgia to pure relaxation in the Maldives," said Saurabh Rai, Executive Vice President of Preferred Hotels & Resorts, the world's largest independent hotel brand. According to YouGov four and five-star hotels are the top choice for families with 32% of accommodation requests by UAE residents for four-star options and 48% choosing to go the full luxury route. Popular destinations winning the public vote include India, just 3.5 hours away which, with the recent introduction of the e-Tourist Visa has seen rising numbers of UAE visitors since 2015. In India, the growing line-up of Preferred hotels include Chennai's stunning The Leela Palace Chennai. This five-star hotel combines Indian tradition and contemporary comfort. Guests can enjoy the Spectra restaurant which boasts seven interactive kitchens and views overlooking the Adyar River and Bay of Bengal. Advertisement The Greater Caucasus, with its dramatic mountains and abundance of outdoor activity options is becoming increasingly popular with regional travellers. Just a three hour's flight from the UAE is Georgia, which attracted over 17,000 UAE visitors in 2015, up 687% year-on-year according to Georgian National Tourism Administration. Home to Georgia's historic viticulture community, the five-star Hotel Kabadoni, located in the picturesque cobbled street town of Sighnaghi is one of Georgia's most exclusive country hotels. Overlooking a vista of terracotta roofs and colourful balconies, guests can relax in the traditional Georgian interiors style in any of the 21 guestrooms or enjoy a local glass of grape at the rooftop restaurant. Egypt is another perennial favourite in the under four-hour bracket, and the country's tourism ministry figures revealed 180,000 MENA region tourists in the first quarter of 2016. UAE visitors topped demand, with 100,000 visitors, boosting the Egyptian economy to the tune of an average US$140 per night. The ultimate R&R destination, the Maldives may be at the high end of the affordable short break spectrum, but is also a preferred destination for UAE travellers, just 4.25 hours away. Coco Palm Dhuni Kolhu in the Maldives is another Preferred hotel that defines luxury escapism in every sense of the word. "The availability of low cost carriers is also helping boost demand, with Air Arabia and FlyDubai's route networks adding new destinations all the time, and opening up a number of new and exciting destinations to intrepid travellers," said Rai. Data released by global aviation leader Boeing, revealed that in 2015 Asian low cost carriers recorded average annual growth of 24.5% over the previous decade against just 13.4% by European carriers. "Staycations are also a popular alternative, and with 23% of local residents unable to travel due to work commitments, a stay at our partner property Palazzo Versace, could be just the answer for 72 hours of upscale downtime," said Rai. Newly added to the Preferred portfolio, Palazzo Versace Dubai enjoys a prime waterfront location on the Dubai Creek in the heart of the upcoming Culture Village development. With its architecturally noteworthy exteriors and interiors already attracting a host of local VIPs and international celebrities, guests enter an all-Versace environment complemented by an Olympic-sized pool and collection of on-trend restaurants.

Speaking to Flightglobal at the World Routes conference in Durban, the airline boss says the Harare-based carrier will “continue to make efforts to engage the necessary stakeholders so that it comes to fruition by the end of the year”. Makona says the Zimbabwean flag carrier is in the midst of its “relaunch phase” and says that “at the heart of that strategy is growth so we really intend to grow our route network and very soon we will also be implementing our long-haul routes, London Beijing very soon”. The airline chief says Air Zimbabwe is currently operating from Harare to Johannesburg, Lusaka, Victoria Falls and Bulawayo. Makona says the the Harare-Joahnnesburg route is the most lucrative in the network. The African airline currently has eight aircraft of which six are operational says Makona. This includes three Boeing 767s, two 737s and an Airbus A320. Makona says the carrier is currently evaluating its fleet expansion options, with both Airbus A320s and A330s or alternatively the Boeing 787 under consideration. The airline executive says the carrier is currently in a “transformative process of transforming the airline from non-profit to profitability” adding that since relaunching operations in 2013 Air Zimbabwe has managed to reduce its losses. Air Zimbabwe is targeting break even this year with Makona adding: “This is our intention we believe we can achieve that”.

Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Locality World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# demonetization War on Black Money Donald Trump Narendra Modi Bigg Boss 10 Home Money Even foreign airlines are showing interest in our services: Air India Engineering Services CEO H R Jagannath, CEO of AIESL Shares38 Shahkar Abidi | Mon, 22 Aug 2016-09:41am , DNA H R Jagannath, CEO of AIESL, in a freewheeling chat with Shahkar Abidi, spoke about all the facilities offered by Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL). Air India Engineering Services Ltd (AIESL) provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) services for aircraft and was hived from the parent company Air India as part of turnaround plan. The construction work for its Nagpur MRO commenced in March 2011 and in December 2014, the facility was handed over to AIESL, which began its operations on August 27, 2015. The Air India subsidiary has now secured business from various Indian airlines including Jet Airways and SpiceJet. On AIESL's invitation, dna recently visited their MRO hub in Nagpur. AIESL also has MRO facilities in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Kolkata. HR Jagannath, CEO of AIESL, in a freewheeling chat with Shahkar Abidi, spoke about all the facilities offered by AIESL, how he plans to turn it into a self-sustained and profitable firm in next five years, among other things. Q. You signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with low-cost carrier SpiceJet for its maintenance services. Prior to that, it was Jet Airways. Which other airlines are you planning to rope in as your customer? A. SpiceJet, at present, has 42 aircraft and another 100 plus are expected to get added in the coming time, which is a very significant number. With SpiceJet, we recently signed a strategic partnership which will be mutually beneficial. Some time back, we did a major check for one of the planes of Jet Airways. We have provided such services in the past to GoAir which included an engine change and repair of landing gear, and we are looking forward to working with them again in future. This work is apart from servicing of planes of our parent company Air India and its other subsidiaries which have a large fleet together and are planning a further addition to it. Apart from Indian airlines, even the foreign carriers are showing a lot of interest in our services; considering the fact that we have a very large setup, best of facilities available in Asia and worldwide, plus at a very competitive cost. For example, recently we did the flap repair work of an airline after it was told by other MROs that it could not be repaired. So all in all, the response has been tremendous so far. Q. What about business from Air Force? There have been plans to get MRO work from them... A. There is an Air Force base in Nagpur. We are seeking to service IL76 and AN32 aircraft of the Air Force initially. In addition, slowly, we can expand and get more work from them in the future. Q. Where do you see AIESL in the next five years? Will it able to charter a flight path of success for itself? A. Though I don't have a number to give you about the plans in the five years from now, I can clearly say that our blueprint is well in place and we will soon be getting people in marketing and hiring department to expand our customer base. Our business plan is very clear as we want to become a self-sustained and profitable company in the next five years. We aim to earn around 40% of our revenue from the third-party servicing in near future, which is around Rs 130 crore of revenue in FY17; about double from the present. Q. Please continue... A. We will be marketing the concept of 'per hour of flight' which is very prominent in the foreign countries but has not yet caught up in the Indian aviation market. The primary aim of an airline is to serve passengers from point A to B and then further to point C. Maintenance and other work is not their core work and may seem to be a headache for them, as it requires setting up of an entire set up including engineers and other staff. The airlines as such will be more than happy to outsource this job (MRO) to us. As the name suggests, we will be charging the airline for per hour of flying plus other types of arrangements, depending on the work required. So, it is a win-win situation for both the parties. Q. Do you think the new policy which aims at pushing regional connectivity in India helps in giving further impetus to MRO industry in India? A. Regional connectivity is at the forefront of promoting aviation in India. More aircraft for regional connectivity means more opportunity as the planes will definitely require all kinds of maintenance and overhauling. Hence, definitely, I can sense a great business for MRO industry in general in the near future. The regional airlines, like the mainstream ones, will be able to save a great amount of their money which comes to about 20-25% if they service their planes in India instead of flying them abroad. Q. As an MRO will you also be importing spare parts for the airlines? A. No, we will like to avoid that as traditionally it is airlines which get the tax benefits for importing of spare parts, and hence, it is imported by them. But we will be helping them source it and facilitate. Q. Tell me something about the engine facility to be set up by GE at Nagpur MRO and how important is its role in the overall servicing that you will be offering at the centre? A. The engine facility set up of GEnx will be a money spinner for us. It is under construction and may get completed by November this year. A workshop for it will be set up and the complete service should get started by the year 2018. Q. Tell us in brief about the MRO in Nagpur… A. As part of commitment to the purchase of agreement for fleet, aircraft manufacturer invested about $100 million (which escalated to $107.4 million) towards the MRO facility including certain equipment/tooling required for aircraft maintenance and associated overhaul shops for maintenance of aircraft and components. An additional investment of at least $6 million has been made to make the facility functional. 50 acres of land has been acquired by Air India on a lease of 99 years from MADC in SEZ area near Nagpur airport to set up the facility. Boeing selected CBRE (CB Richard Ellis) as project management consultants (PMC) and M/S Larsen and Toubro as Design & Build (D&B) contractor. The MRO facility is designed for undertaking maintenance of any type and size of aircraft including A380. Each hangar can accommodate one wide body or three narrow-body aircraft at a time. Q. What about the permissions? Are all such approvals and permissions in place? A. Approval from aviation regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for C-checks (2,250 days inspection) on B777 series aircraft fitted with GE 90-100/115 engines have been granted in May 2015. Subsequent to it, D-check (3,000 days inspection) approval was granted in February 2016. Likewise, an internal audit has been carried out for Airbus family approval and approval is awaited for the application to DGCA for certification of A319/A320/A321 series aircraft fitted with CFM56-5b/V2500 A1 series engines up to 4A check. Q. Manpower seems to be a major problem with AIESL. It is rumoured that not many engineers and others want to shift to Nagpur due to reported lack of social life as in a metro city. What is the management doing to tackle the issue so that it does not create a road block in the performance? A. There have been no recruitment drives since past around a decade. So no new AMEs have been inducted. On the other hand, about 15-odd retirements are taking place every month out of total 300 AMEs all over the country. So, we are taking back the services of the good retired personnel on a contract basis. So, at present, we are just about managing the things. The situation may go out of hand if things don't improve in the next 3-4 years as then there will be a huge vacuum in the demand and supply. Further, the number of aircraft are increasing with each passing year. So, at one point it may become a problem. Secondly, there are not enough engineers in the market with a licence as there is no provision in India to get typed licences like in the case of a pilot. To tackle the situation, we have started a training school in Trivandrum for third-party training of AMEs. However, still, a candidate takes around five years to get into the system. For example, the candidate has to first appear for a basic level examination. Then, he/she is put to type training followed again by an exam. If he/she passes the exam, then they are put under supervision. So it all takes about 5 years. Now there is a legal issue whether a third-party candidate can be absorbed into the company. For this, we are in talks with DGCA, which has shown some positive signs for it.

According to officials at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), India and the US are highly likely to sign the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), on which the two nations agreed in principle during the US defence secretary Ashton Carter's visit to New Delhi in April. LEMOA, that will allow sharing of military logistics by using each other's Army, Air Force and Naval bases for supplies, repair and rest was the highlight of Carter's visit and signalled a crucial shift in India's stand on defence ties with the US. The US has been maintaining that cooperation under the Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) can grow if India signs what US calls three foundational agreements – LSA (of which LEMOA is a modified form), and the other two being the Communication and Information Security Memorandum Agreement (CISMOA) and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). Even as CISMOA and BECA too will be followed up during the visit, officials said another important agenda during Parrikar's visit will be the Indian Navy's requirements of the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) for aircraft carriers as well as the long-range Predator B Guardian surveillance unmanned aircraft or drone. Navy has put an initial requirement of 22 Predators. Parrikar's visit also coincides with India's lookout for a technologically new set of fighter jets for its air force and two US companies, Boeing and Lockheed Martin pitching hard for it even as the government to government deal on the French Rafale jets is still stuck in negotiations. India is also on a look out for technology cooperation for its second indigenous aircraft carrier, the 65,000 tonnes INS Vishal. Even as India's first indigenous aircraft, INS Vikrant is in advanced stage of construction, Navy is in the process of finalising the design for INS Vishal, which will be India's largest battleship. India has been eyeing the advanced US aircraft carrier technology for this project.

By: PTI | Washington | Updated: August 23, 2016 6:21 pm NASA plans to handover the control of ISS to a private company. NASA is planning to hand over the control of the International Space Station (ISS) to a commercial company around the mid 2020s, the US space agency has said. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit,” said Bill Hill, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit,” said Hill, speaking on a panel of NASA staff assembled to discuss the upcoming Mars mission. The timing fits with the end of the US government’s current funding of the ISS programme, which was extended by Obama administration from its original deorbiting date of 2016 through 2020, ‘Tech Crunch’ reported. Operations were prolonged through 2024 to help give NASA a platform from which to run its near-Earth preparatory missions leading up to the ultimate manned mission to Mars. However, NASA did not specify any potential buyer. A new docking adapter is being put in place to support crew shuttle missions from Boeing and SpaceX, both of which are set to start shuttling personnel to the ISS in 2017. SpaceX has been running resupply missions for the space station and NASA since 2012, and has completed nine such missions to date.

Facebook Twitter Google RSS Cloud Mobile Social Big Data Bleeding Edge Columns Get McAfee’d Dr. Bitcoin smartworld Future Data City of Paradigm Masthead Send Us a News Tip Select Page NASA wants to sell the International Space Station to a commercial entity by Mike Wheatley | Aug 23, 2016 | 0 comments The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) wants to sell off, or possibly donate the International Space Station (ISS) to private enterprise in the next few years. The agency is hoping to hand over control of the orbiting laboratory to a commercial entity sometime in the next decade, it said. NASA made the announcement during a press conference yesterday on its plans for future manned missions to Mars. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-Earth orbit,” said Bill Hill, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit.” In a blog post, NASA expanded on the idea, saying that: “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” and that today’s solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability”. NASA said no more than that, not even mentioning any potential buyers by name. Any deal would likely be complicated too, given that the ISS is managed by a group of international partners, including the Russia’s Roscosmos space agency and the European Space Agency. It’s not clear what they have to say about the idea. Coincidentally, NASA’s announcement comes just days after Roscosmos made an announcement that it’s looking at the possibility of reducing its ISS crew contingent from three to two. NASA and Russia are committed to maintaining the ISS until 2024, which is the orbital platform’s current end-of-life date. However, today’s declaration suggests NASA may be looking to extract itself from the arrangement sooner in order to free up the $4 billion a year it spends on ISS for deep space missions. By handing over ISS to the private sector, NASA would have more funds to spend on proposed crewed missions to Mars and asteroids. RELATED:  We talked to women at NASA, where a third of employees are female As for potential buyers of the ISS, the obvious candidates would be commercial space operators like Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (Space X) and The Boeing Company, both of which are on track to begin flying astronauts to the ISS by 2018 anyway, and would likely benefit from data on how to minimize the effects of space on the human body. Other interested parties might be commercial space tourism entities such as Virgin Galactic Ltd. and Blue Orgin LLC, which could use the space station to offer extended vacations in zero gravity.
