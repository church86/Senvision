 Trump's administration is looking for ways to make Boeing's new Air Force One cheaper Benjamin Zhang Jan. 27, 2017, 2:56 PM 5,121 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing VC-25A that serves as Air Force One.AP Secretary of Defense James Mattis officially ordered a review of the US Air Force's next generation presidential transport program to determine potential cost cutting opportunities.  In a memo dated January 26, Secretary Mattis announced that his department will work with the White House Military Office to "identify means to substantially reduce the program's cost while delivering needed capabilities." "We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration," a Boeing spokesperson told Business Insider in an email. "We are focused on providing the armed forces with needed capabilities at the best possible value." In December, then President-elect Trump tweeted that the two Boeing 747-8-based jet are too expensive and threatened to cancel the entire program citing a $4 billion price tag.  According to a report by the Government Accountability Office published in March 2016, the new aircraft that will serve as Air Force One — also known as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program — has an estimated total cost of $3.21 billion spread out over the next decade or so. The PAR program will consist of the development, testing, and construction of two 747-8-derived jets set to enter service in 2024. This means that even if Boeing delivers on time, Trump will not have the opportunity to fly on the aircraft. By that time, the existing Boeing 747-200-based VC-25A aircraft — which were ordered by Ronald Reagan — will be 34 years old. In the memo, Secretary Mattis identified areas such as autonomous operation, aircraft power generation, environmental conditioning, survivability, and military/civilian communications capabilities as potential cost-cutting targets.  Earlier this month, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg met with President Trump prior to his inauguration at Trump Tower in New York. At the company's latest earnings call, Muilenberg made it clear to analysts and the media that he is optimistic about his company's future under the Trump administration.  The Department of Defense review of the PAR program is expected to commence immediately.  SEE ALSO: Check out the Boeing airliner President Trump is trading in for Air Force One NOW WATCH: There is a secret US government airline that flies out of commercial airports Loading video...

The suit capitalizes on historical designs, meets NASA requirements for safety and functionality, while introducing cutting-edge innovations. Boeing unveiled its spacesuit design Wednesday as the company continues to move toward flight tests of its Starliner spacecraft and launch systems that will fly astronauts to the International Space Station. Astronauts heading into orbit aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft will wear lighter and more comfortable spacesuits than earlier suits astronauts wore. The suit capitalizes on historical designs, meets NASA requirements for safety and functionality, and introduces cutting-edge innovations. Boeing unveiled its spacesuit design Wednesday as the company continues to move toward flight tests of its Starliner spacecraft and launch systems that will fly astronauts to the International Space Station. A few of the advances in the design: Lighter and more flexible through use of advanced materials and new joint patterns Helmet and visor incorporated into the suit instead of detachable Touchscreen-sensitive gloves Vents that allow astronauts to be cooler, but can still pressurize the suit immediately The full suit, which includes an integrated shoe, weighs about 20 pounds with all its accessories – about 10 pounds lighter than the launch-and-entry suits worn by space shuttle astronauts. The new Starliner suit's material lets water vapor pass out of the suit, away from the astronaut, but keeps air inside. That makes the suit cooler without sacrificing safety. Materials in the elbows and knees give astronauts more movement, too, while strategically located zippers allow them to adapt the suit's shape when standing or seated. "The most important part is that the suit will keep you alive," astronaut Eric Boe said. "It is a lot lighter, more form-fitting and it's simpler, which is always a good thing. Complicated systems have more ways they can break, so simple is better on something like this." Of course, the suit has to be as functional as it is safe, Boe said. If an astronaut gets strapped in but can't reach the switches or work the touchscreen, the spacesuit would not be effective. That's why astronauts have spent some of their time sitting inside a Starliner mock-up wearing the spacesuit. They climb in and out repeatedly and try out different reaches and positions so they can establish the best ways for astronauts to work inside the spacecraft's confines. "The spacesuit acts as the emergency backup to the spacecraft's redundant life support systems," said Richard Watson, subsystem manager for spacesuits for NASA's Commercial Crew Program. "If everything goes perfectly on a mission, then you don't need a spacesuit. It's like having a fire extinguisher close by in the cockpit. You need it to be effective if it is needed." Boe and astronauts Bob Behnken, Doug Hurley and Suni Williams are training for flight tests using spacecraft under development for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, including Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon systems. Flight tests with astronauts aboard are slated to begin in 2018. The spacesuits astronauts wear for walking in space are already aboard the station. Heavier and bulkier than launch-and-entry suits, spacewalking ensembles – called EMUs for extravehicular mobility units – have to function as a spacecraft unto themselves. Standing inside the company's Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, former astronaut Chris Ferguson, who is now director of Crew and Mission Systems for Boeing, modeled the new suit in front of a mock-up of the Starliner spacecraft. On launch day, astronauts will don the suit in the historic Crew Quarters before striding across the Crew Access Arm at Space Launch Complex 41 and boarding a Starliner as it stands atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. "We slogged through some of the real engineering challenges and now we are getting to the point where those challenges are largely behind us and it's time to get on to the rubber meeting the road," Ferguson said. Carrying up to four astronauts at a time for NASA, operational Commercial Crew missions are to take astronauts to the space station on a regular basis permitting the crew on the orbiting laboratory to grow to seven residents. That will mean more science and research time for NASA to seek vital answers for the challenges of future deep-space missions. From this point, Boeing will continue fit checks and other testing alongside the astronauts as all the teams train for the missions and push toward flight tests. "To me, it's a very tangible sign that we are really moving forward and we are a lot closer than we've been," Ferguson said. "The next time we pull all this together, it might be when astronauts are climbing into the actual spacecraft."

(IDF Spokesperson's Unit) Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics James Mattis Donald Trump F-35 WASHINGTON (AFP) — US Secretary of Defense James Mattis has ordered a review of the Lockheed Martin F-35 stealth fighter program after President Donald Trump assailed its $400 billion price tag, the Pentagon announced Friday. At the same time, Mattis ordered a similar review of the $4 billion cost for developing a new aircraft for the US president, Air Force One, the ultra-high-tech and secure 747 built by Boeing. “The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is a critical acquisition program that warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated program costs,” Mattis said in the order. He said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” while ensuring the new jets, which cost about $100 million each, meet US defense needs.

Scott Applewhite) He said the review should also compare the F-35 with the Boeing-built F-18 Super Hornet fighter to see if the latter, which costs significantly less, can meet US needs. This file photo taken on July 12, 2016 shows the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II taking part in a flying display at the Farnborough Airshow, south-west of London. (AFP/Adrian Dennis) In December, Trump assailed both the F-35 and Air Force One programs as overly costly, and after that met with the chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to extract savings. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases,” Trump said on Twitter at the time. The first 200 F-35s of a program that envisions some 2,450 ultimately being acquired by the different US armed services have been delivered. The aircraft have also been sold to Israel, with the first two delivered in December. Illustrative photo of an F-35 fighter jet. (US DoD/Staff Sgt. Devin Doskey, US Air Force) Proponents tout the F-35’s radar-dodging stealth technology, supersonic speeds, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information. But the program has faced numerous setbacks, including a mysterious engine fire in 2014 that led commanders to ground planes until the problem could be resolved. News of Mattis’ order sent Lockheed shares tumbling. They were trading up about 1.0 percent before the announcement; dropping 1.0% at $252.18 afterward. Boeing shares fell in early trade and were off 0.9% after the announcement. Lockheed said in a statement that it “welcomes” Mattis’s review and its focus on costs. The company said costs can be cut if the program adopts a multi-year procurement approach that would allow components to be bought on a large scale. It also argued that the F-35 is the best alternative. “We are confident such a thorough and objective analysis will show that only the F-35, with its advanced stealth and sensors, can meet the 21st century air superiority requirements of all of our military services,” Lockheed said. On Tuesday, Lockheed chief executive Marillyn Hewson sought to assuage shareholders by saying the new president’s objective is not “about slashing our profits.” “We understand his concerns about affordability and we certainly share that,” she said in a conference call with analysts. “It’s about how do we get the costs down today and in the future.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Tweet Read more on:  James Mattis,  Donald Trump,  F-35,  Air Force One,  US Defense Department,  Lockheed-Martin,  US Air Force More in Israel & the Region Trump orders 'great rebuilding' of US military Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments The Times of Israel Current top stories How Steven Spielberg grew a social conscience By JP O’ Malley   Storm washes explosives fuses up on Tel Aviv beaches By Times of Israel staff   As president, Trump less gung-ho about dramatic changes in Israel policy By Ron Kampeas   Trump’s Holocaust day statement fails to mention Jews or anti-Semitism By Eric Cortellessa   PM denies latest leaks from graft probe as ‘lies and exaggerations’ By Times of Israel staff   The Times of Israel Daily Edition Free to Your Inbox The email is either missing or invalid Almost finished...

The current Air Force One planes were built more than a quarter-century ago. (White House Photo) President Donald Trump’s defense secretary, James Mattis, has ordered reviews of the multibillion-dollar programs to acquire new Air Force One jets and more F-35 fighter jets – two programs that sparked his boss’ ire in the run-up to his inauguration. “Yesterday Secretary Mattis directed separate reviews of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program,” Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said today in a statement quoted by The Hill. “The purpose of these reviews is to inform programmatic and budgetary decisions, recognizing the critical importance of each of these acquisition programs.” Lockheed Martin is the main contractor for the F-35 program, which has experienced cost overruns and production delays. The Boeing Co. is working with the Air Force on the specifications for two replacement Air Force One jets to be used for presidential flights. Last month, Trump tweeted that the Air Force One project should be canceled. He charged that the estimated cost was mounting to more than $4 billion, even though Boeing and the Air Force were still working out the requirements for the two modified 747-8 jets under the terms of a much smaller $170 million contract. In a different set of tweets posted days later, Trump complained that F-35 costs were “out of control.” Lockheed Martin expects to sell thousands of the jets to the U.S. and its allies for a return that could eventually add up to close to $400 billion. During follow-up meetings with the then-president-elect, top executives for both Boeing and Lockheed Martin pointed out that they were already taking measures to control expenses but pledged to work for further cost reductions. Trump tried to play the two aerospace giants off against each other by hinting that the Pentagon could start buying modified F/A-18 jets from Boeing rather than Lockheed Martin’s F-35. Today the Pentagon said its review of the F-35 would include a comparison with the F/A-18. Boeing has said it’s willing to work with the Trump administration “to affordably meet U.S. military requirements.” However, outside observers say even modified versions of the F/A-18 would not be sufficiently stealthy to substitute for the F-35. In a tweeted statement, Lockheed Martin said it “stands ready” to support the Pentagon’s F-35 review, and repeated its view that “there are opportunities to continue to drive down program costs”: We stand ready to support @deptofdefense review of F-35 program pic.twitter.com/gpihELJyAG — Lockheed Martin (@LockheedMartin) January 27, 2017 Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

The KC-46A is a multirole tanker that can refuel allied and coalition military aircraft and also carry passengers, cargo and patients. (Boeing photo) Boeing has won a $2.1 billion contract to build more tanker planes for the U.S. Air Force, the manufacturer and the Pentagon announced today. Under the deal, Boeing will build 15 KC-46A tanker aircraft, plus spare engines and wing air refueling pod kits. It’s the third low-rate initial production order for the company. The first two orders were for seven and 12 planes. “This award is great news for the joint Boeing-Air Force team and reinforces the need for this highly efficient and capable tanker aircraft,” Mike Gibbons, Boeing’s KC-46A tanker vice president and program manager, said in a statement. The Pentagon gave Boeing the initial contract to design and develop the next-generation tanker aircraft in 2011. Eventually, the Air Force intends to buy 179 KC-46 tankers to replace its current fleet. When follow-on orders and international sales are included, Boeing could sell as many as 400 of the tankers for as much as $80 billion. “Placing an order for another 15 aircraft is another important milestone for the KC-46 program,” said Col. John Newberry, Air Force KC-46 System program manager. “I know the warfighter is excited about bringing this next generation capability into the inventory.” The aircraft will be assembled at Boeing’s plant in Everett, Wash. The tanker development project has suffered some setbacks along the way: In Wednesday’s fourth-quarter earnings report, Boeing announced it was taking $312 million in pre-tax charges on the program, primarily due to design modifications that had to be made in the course of flight tests. There are currently four test planes flying, including two that are configured as 767-2C jets and two as KC-46A aircraft. In the long run, Boeing sees the tanker program as a “great long-term franchise program,” said Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s chairman, president and CEO.   Love space and science? Sign up for our GeekWire Space & Science email newsletter for top headlines from Alan Boyle, GeekWire’s aerospace and science editor.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Southwest is launch customer for Boeing 737 MAX but won’t get the first delivery Originally published January 27, 2017 at 4:31 pm Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier: Norwegian Air Shuttle. Share story By Justin Bachman and Mary Schlangenstein Bloomberg News Southwest Airlines was eager to sign up as the “launch customer” for Boeing’s new 737 MAX, soon to be the Greyhound of the skies as it replaces its older, less fuel-efficient cousins in fleets worldwide. But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle. Norwegian will receive the first MAX 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said, with flights starting as early as June. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 MAX, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 MAX’s by July — two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  Most Read Stories Seattle ‘won’t be bullied,’ will fight Trump’s sanctuary-city order, mayor says Seattle cop’s son killed after trying to stop car prowler in Sammamish  VIEW For thousands, light rail could be the only way through downtown Seattle next year What does Trump’s action on sanctuary cities mean for Seattle? Here’s what we know Seahawks assistant head coach for defense Rocky Seto leaves team to enter ministryUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The MAX’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets — and flies — the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways, didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights — although that’s a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the MAX. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it’s operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s MAX development is on-budget and ahead of schedule. All this good news, as far as production is concerned, is a rarity in an industry renowned for being late to everything. Southwest plans to put its first MAX into service later this year, once it retires its 87 remaining 737-300 Classics, the oldest planes in the fleet. And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 MAX planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Rentonh. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 MAX this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs.

Boeing has been ramping up production of JDAMs at its plant in St. Charles. Photo courtesy of Boeing. ST. LOUIS • On a stage at Boeing, a charismatic Air Force pilot dressed in a flight suit told an auditorium full of executives, engineers and suppliers how impressed he was with the precision-guided bombs they help make. “I have been fortunate or unfortunate — depending on how you think about it — to employ these in training and combat,” said Maj. Mike “Pako” Benitez. He was speaking about joint direct attack munition, or JDAM, which converts conventional “dumb” bombs into guided “smart” bombs. The computerized tail fin kits are slapped onto warheads weighing 500, 1,000 and 2,000 pounds. Fitted with GPS, the $25,000 gizmos make bombs so accurate pilots like to say they can drive in nails from far away. The air-to-surface munitions have dramatically changed war since production began in the late 1990s beside the Missouri River in St. Charles. The military needed a coordinate-seeking bomb that could be dropped during all weather conditions with minimal collateral damage, for example, on a row of apartments in a metropolitan area. Boeing answered with JDAMs, which are being used a lot today, as coalition forces rely much less on ground troops and more on airstrikes in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq. The meeting this week between operators and builders was called to celebrate a production milestone and to mark a new goal to make 36,500 JDAMs a year, up from 8,000 in mid-2015. As Benitez explained, once released from his fighter jet, it takes about 30 seconds — as long as he can hold his breath — for the JDAM to glide five miles to the fixed target. Lasers are used on the devices to hit moving objects. “There’s a lot of things that run through my mind having that great responsibility to employ this weapon on a particular target,” said Benitez, about to draw applause. “The one thing I have never thought about is if the JDAM will work.” To demonstrate in his presentation, Benitez narrated the scene of a silent video playing on an overhead screen. A coalition convey had been shot at in Afghanistan. Smoke from an artillery round marked the enemy position way up on a hilltop. An enormous explosion eliminated the threat. Playing the video back in slow motion, the glimpse of a 2,000-pound black dart was seen piercing the skyline at 750 feet per second. The pilot chose to detonate the bomb about 20 feet above ground, to cover more area. The blast unleashed a 700-ton-per-square-inch punch of molten metal at its center point that burned to 7,000 degrees. Benitez turned to the silent crowd of 70 people. “And that is what you guys do,” he said. Rebuilding stockpiles Boeing recently announced that it had made 300,000 JDAMs in the past two decades. They were sold to 28 countries, but the U.S. government is the largest customer, having dropped 60,000 of them in combat. “It is by far the weapon of choice,” Brig. Gen. Shaun Q. Morris, in charge of all munitions fired from the air for the U.S. Air Force, told the Post-Dispatch. But he said it had been used in excess of production. In 2016 alone, the Air Force dropped about 15,000 JDAMs. Last weekend, he said, 243 were used, some of them against jihadist in Mosul. A New York Times report from a photographer embedded with the Iraqi Army seemed to speak to this. “Though much of the worst fighting was over, the soldiers were still on alert for suicide car bombers, a fear well founded,” wrote Ivor Prickett. “Occasionally, a radio would crackle with news that a car bomber had been spotted nearby. After a few tense minutes, we would hear the sound of a missile fired by a coalition warplane and the car exploding.” A French television news report showed footage of a tunnel system the Iraqi Army discovered. Militants had spray painted on the walls as a reminder: “Watch out for jets.” One week earlier, two B-2 stealth bombers from Whiteman Air Force Base in western Missouri flew half way across the globe, with the help of multiple aerial refueling tankers, to hit desert targets in Libya with about 100 JDAMs, killing a reported 80 Islamic militants. In 1999, B-2s from Missouri were the first to use JDAMs in combat when they dropped the munitions during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. In May, Boeing won a $3.2 billion contract to make JDAM guidance kits for the U.S. government through September 2020. Production goals are expected to reach 150 a day by July, up from 40 a day less than two years ago. “We expect to sustain that rate for some amount of time, not only to support ongoing operations but also to rebuild our stockpiles,” Morris said. Evolution of bombs, holy war Eliot Cohen, former Counselor of the U.S. State Department, said the military was in a new era of warfare that was about routine and relatively cheap precision.

Check our People in Business See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid “That’s the advantage of the JDAM over more expensive cruise missiles,” said Cohen, who now teaches at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “We’re clearly dropping a lot of them, because we are engaged in three wars: Iraq, Afghanistan, and against various jihad movements. Our land forces may have drawn down, but effectively we are the Iraqi and Afghan air forces, as well as our own.” Paul Rogers, who teaches in the department of peace studies at Bradford University in England, warned that radical religious movements could be impermeable to smart bombs. For instance, a former most-wanted terrorist in Iraq was killed by a precision-guided bomb in 2006. At the time, Al-Qaeda in Iraq confirmed his death, yet it vowed to continue its “holy war.” “We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,” their statement said then. “In the short term, it appears to work, ISIS is in retreat,” Rogers said about JDAMs’ being dropped more recently in Mosul. “But what will probably happen is they will tend to go underground and not engage in open conflict and be subject to air raids. They will probably put more of a focus on staging attacks overseas, as they have been doing in Europe and other places.” Mistakes and collateral damage still happen. In 2½ years of coalition airstrikes in Libya, Iraq and Syria, an estimated 2,300 civilians have been killed, according to Airwars, which tracks the numbers. U.S. government estimates are much lower. Still, precision-guided munitions are significantly more accurate than free fall “dumb” bombs. JDAMs are tested to 95 percent accuracy — striking within 30 feet of the intended target. By comparison, most of the 2.7 million tons of bombs the Allies dropped on Europe in World War II missed their marks. According to an exhaustive government report, only 20 percent of daytime “precision” raids fell within the 1,000-foot target area “What JDAM gives us in a level of precision with the ability to minimize collateral damage, which really, in today’s warfare, are complete imperatives,” Morris said. “The only drawback we have today is we don’t have enough of them.” Greg Coffey, director of JDAM programs at Boeing, said during a tour of the nondescript assembly plant in St. Charles that they were currently running two shifts and didn’t anticipate hiring more employees to meet the higher production goals. The $105 billion air and space behemoth wouldn’t say how many people worked there. “We will grow to whatever the demand of the customer is,” he said.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Southwest is launch customer for Boeing 737 MAX but won’t get the first delivery Originally published January 27, 2017 at 4:31 pm Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier: Norwegian Air Shuttle. Share story By Justin Bachman and Mary Schlangenstein Bloomberg News Southwest Airlines was eager to sign up as the “launch customer” for Boeing’s new 737 MAX, soon to be the Greyhound of the skies as it replaces its older, less fuel-efficient cousins in fleets worldwide. But Southwest won’t be first to fly or even receive the new aircraft. That honor will go to a smaller low-cost carrier across the Atlantic, Norwegian Air Shuttle. Norwegian will receive the first MAX 8 in May, spokesman Anders Lindstrom said, with flights starting as early as June. Southwest made its bones as the low-cost carrier that famously flies only one airplane family. As Boeing’s largest customer for the 737, it’s been involved in the redesign, which included outfitting the workhorse with a more powerful engine. In 2011, the Dallas-based airline placed the first order for the 737 MAX, followed by Norwegian and Indonesia’s Lion Air. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said his airline will get the first of its 200 737 MAX’s by July — two months earlier than expected, but two months after Norwegian.  Most Read Stories For thousands, light rail could be the only way through downtown Seattle next year Sumner’s Connor Wedington part of growing trend of football players opting to decommit Dense city?

Ignore them. Repeat.Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The MAX’s sprightly release clip has prompted delivery questions for both Southwest and Boeing, given that an aircraft’s launch customer typically gets — and flies — the new plane first. This sort of arrangement has been upended before, when Airbus A320neo, destined first for Qatar Airways, didn’t arrive as planned. Qatar chief Akbar Al Baker last year balked over glitches in the A320neo’s engine software and refused to take the first plane, which went instead to Lufthansa. There’s more to being a launch customer than bragging rights — although that’s a large part of the appeal of being the first to market with a shiny new jet. Aircraft makers also promise that their newest models boast lower fuel and maintenance costs than prior airplanes, providing an immediate bottom-line boost to airlines. “We’re the launch customer, regardless of when we take the first delivery,” Southwest CEO Kelly said of the MAX. His chief operating officer, Mike Van De Ven, said Thursday that “we’re the ones that have done the service-ready operational validation for Boeing. We’re the ones working very closely with Boeing to make sure it’s operating as everyone intended.” Boeing’s MAX development is on-budget and ahead of schedule. All this good news, as far as production is concerned, is a rarity in an industry renowned for being late to everything. Southwest plans to put its first MAX into service later this year, once it retires its 87 remaining 737-300 Classics, the oldest planes in the fleet. And this is the sticking point: Southwest must first retire those old planes before it can accommodate new ones, a conundrum that traces back to pilot training issues. About 10 of Southwest’s 737 MAX planes will be finished by the time the carrier is ready to begin flights in October, Van de Ven has said. The carrier is in talks with Boeing about what to do with those planes between July and October, because several are now parked at the periphery of Boeing’s 737 factory in Rentonh. Norwegian, meanwhile, plans to take delivery of a half-dozen new 737 MAX this year and then deploy them for trans-Atlantic service, though it hasn’t revealed which routes or a time frame. The European carrier has been focused on smaller airports in the Northeast U.S., bypassing the large metropolitan hubs.

Military U.S. defense secretary orders review of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program Most lethal fighter in Navy history reaches the fleet The Navy made aviation history (November 3rd, 2014) as an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant Joint Strike Fighter conducted its first arrested landing aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) off the coast of San Diego. The Navy made aviation history (November 3rd, 2014) as an F-35C Lightning II carrier variant Joint Strike Fighter conducted its first arrested landing aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz (CVN 68) off the coast of San Diego. Carl PrineContact Reporter Taming two of President Donald Trump’s pet peeves in one move, the Pentagon has ordered military leaders to find ways to drive down the costs of both the maligned Joint Strike Fighter and proposed replacement jetliners for the Air Force One program. Announced Friday but issued on Thursday by new Secretary of Defense James Mattis, the pair of memorandums instructs the armed forces to reopen reviews into Lockheed Martin’s $1.5 trillion Lightning II strike fighter and Boeing’s $3.7 billion replacement plan for the two jets used to ferry the president around the world.       In a stream of tweets and in closed meetings with Lockheed Martin and Boeing executives, Trump has squabbled over the proposed costs for both procurement programs, but the project that remains most important to America’s defense needs in the 21st century is the Joint Strike Fighter, which is designed within the military as the F-35. Lockheed Martin plans to build 2,443 of the fighters for the Navy, Air Force and Marines, plus 741 more for foreign partners such as Denmark and the United Kingdom.  On Jan. 11, the defense giant delivered its 200th F-35, which come in three varieties. The Air Force’s F-35A uses a conventional runway.  The F-35Bs bound for the Marines can take off and land vertically from a ship or a battlefield.  The F-35Cs are slated for both the Navy and Marines because they deploy from carriers. The Mattis memo urged the Pentagon to find ways to “significantly reduce costs” for all three fighter variants but took aim at the F-35C, the most troubled line of Joint Strike Fighters.  He asked reviewers to consider whether Boeing’s non-stealthy and less technologically advanced F-18 E/F Super Hornet could be upgraded to “provide a competitive, cost-effective” alternative to Lockheed Martin’s F-35C. Mattis issued his order a day after four F-35Cs landed just outside Lemoore, a sleepy farm town south of Fresno that’s been slated to host 96 more of the jets over the next decade as the Navy swaps out its aging and increasingly rickety squadrons of “legacy” F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets. The quartet of F-35Cs are the first to be permanently stationed on the West Coast, but they’re expensive — they combined to cost more than $400 million — and they’ve been dogged by technological setbacks. They can’t safely catapult from an aircraft carrier and their wings are too weak to launch air-to-air missiles.   They lack a functioning gun, air flowing across the outer casing of the engine sparks oven-hot temperatures and the fighters can suddenly roll when flying below the speed of sound. Those and scores of other serious problems pepper a recent report from the Pentagon office tasked with operational testing and evaluation of the entire F-35 program. Strategists believe that the Navy and Marine Corps need the F-35Cs because dense missile arrays, advanced pursuit fighters and other recent military innovations by China and Russia put America’s “legacy” strike fighters like the F-18s and the Marines’ Harrier II jet increasingly at risk of getting shot down over the Pacific. As a “fifth generation” plane, the F-35 is designed to sneak past enemy radar to use its highly advanced sensors to detect and destroy everything from anti-aircraft defenses to warships, but Pentagon planners believe its stealthiness, raw computing power and communications system also could turn it into a much deadlier weapon. Think of it as part of a basketball team on a fast break.  It can become a swift power forward who slams the ball home, or it could morph into a point guard directing all the others to the basket — although staying invisible the entire time to opposing players. Navy Cmdr. John Turner Jr., skipper of the “Rough Raiders” of Lemoore’s Strike Fighter Squadron 125, calls it the “Ferrari” of fighters. “It’s absolutely incredible.  With its fifth generation stealth capabilities, and the avionics that it brings, it’s exactly what carrier strike groups need to continue its lethality,” he said. Vice Adm. Michael Shoemaker, the Navy’s “Air Boss” who controls all of the service’s air forces, said that the arrival of the four F-35Cs to Turner’s squadron is “a big deal” and he’s already brainstorming how they will be used against potential enemies. “It could do everything, from dropping mines to all the high end warfighting capabilities that I expect from the F-35, but we don’t have the time, bandwidth or the money to train a pilot to do all of those mission sets,” said Shoemaker, a Navy strike pilot decorated for his valor in combat.  “So I want them focused on high end mission sets. There are third- and fourth-generation missions that we’ve got the (F-18 E/F Super Hornet) to do and there are fifth generation missions I want to keep F-35 focused on.” Shoemaker believes that he’ll have a fully operational F-35C squadron in Lemoore by 2020 -- a prediction echoed by Rear Adm. Roy Kelley, chief of the Navy’s Joint Strike Fighter Fleet Integration Office inside the Pentagon. A Hornet pilot decorated for valor, Kelley now fights bureaucratic battles on behalf of the Navy while helping to fix glitches with the fighter alongside defense and industry leaders. “Being able to be the voice of the program for our program, the F-35C, is important,” said Kelley.  “It’s allowed us to make sure that in the middle of a conversation we’re able to voice our opinions.  I can say, ‘Hey, here’s the issue with what you’re trying to do.’ And if it’s a problem for us, we can bring it out and we can work through it.” If called to battle today, Shoemaker insists that his fleet of workhorse F-18 Hornets and Super Hornets, plus the highly advanced electronic warfare EA-18G Growler, would win a war in the skies of Asia, but the day is soon coming when he will need to field the F-35C as the lead strike aircraft. The Marines need it even sooner.  Two Marine F-35B squadrons are marked operational and one of them has been forward deployed to Japan, but in order to keep its legacy strike fleet flying the Corps had to buy scrapped Harrier II jets from Britain to cannibalize for spare parts. “Marine aviation kind of bottomed out around the 2013 time frame,” said William E. Taylor, the Marines’ assistant deputy commandant for aviation.   The former helicopter attack pilot called the problems with the Harrier and Hornet strike fighter fleet “systemic,” caused by wear and tear and corrosion on aging planes that flew too many hours providing air support to ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  “We’re about two years into a six-year readiness recovery plan,” said Taylor. “We’ve shown over the past two years positive results but it’s slow and painful.  We’re hoping to recover and get to where our objective is by 2020.” The F-35Cs are part of that solution, but August test flights aboard the flat top George Washington revealed “vertical oscillations” during catapult launches that were so “excessive” and “violent” that they threaten to make the jet “operationally unsuitable for carrier operations,” according to the recent Pentagon report. Lockheed Martin assembled a “red team” of Navy and industry experts who continue to go “very systematically through the aircraft” to ferret out the gremlins, said Jeff A. Babione, the company’s executive vice president in charge of the F-35 program. “We don’t have an answer yet, but I’m encouraged by what I see and that testing should begin next month” at the Naval Air Engineering Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey, he said. Navy officials told the Union-Tribune that Lockheed Martin already cured several technological headaches raised in the Pentagon report, including an abnormal “green glow” inside the pilots’ top secret helmets discovered during carrier night operations. To slash the F-35C’s cost, Lockheed Martin’s Babione said that the Pentagon should place larger block orders, which would allow the company to negotiate cheaper prices with part suppliers. “Economies of scale generate reductions in price,” he said. “It happens when you buy commodities.  It happens when you buy fighter jets.  Making sure that we continue to add more and more airplanes and maintain that learning curve — that’s absolutely important.” Dan Grazier, a defense expert at the Project On Government Oversight nonprofit in Washington, urged Trump instead to halt F-35 production until the Pentagon finishes initial operational testing. Taxpayers, he said, are on the hook to buy 798 F-35s before Lockheed Martin has proved they can fly into battle. “To give us a really clear picture of the combat capabilities of the F-35, we’re looking at delays into the mid-2020s now,” said Grazier, a former Marine armor officer who fought in Afghanistan.  “When you consider that the origins of this program go back to 1993, here we are in 2017 and we still don’t know at all if this thing is ever going to be really ready for combat.  That’s really saying something about this whole program. “If we agree to this block buy, they’re promising us a discount — essentially, the Costco price for the F-35. But those savings are fake. What’s going to end up happening is they they’ll knock a few million dollars off the purchase price of each plane, but we’ll end up paying later because these immature planes we buy now will have to be sent back to be modified to integrate subsequent changes.” The Mattis F-35C memo didn’t set a deadline for when the F-35C review should finish but indicated it will begin immediately so that its findings can be used to inform “upcoming budget decisions.” Caption One major obstacle to U.S. military cooperation with Russia A National Defense Authorization Act provision prohibits military cooperation until Russia stops its occupation and aggression toward Ukraine.

REUTERS/Alwyn Scott WASHINGTON Boeing Co (BA.N) has been awarded a $2.1 billion U.S. defense contract for 15 KC-46 aerial refueling aircraft, the Pentagon said on Friday. The new agreement is in addition to the initial $4.2 billion contract awarded by the Air Force to develop and test the aircraft, and an earlier $2.8 billion award for 19 planes. Boeing expects to build a substantial business from the tanker, which is based on its twin-aisle 767 commercial jet. Boeing plans to deliver 179 tankers to the U.S. Air Force and expects to sell about 400 in total worldwide. The fixed-cost contract has incurred about $2.4 billion in cost over runs, including a $201 million after-tax charge Boeing announced on Wednesday. Boeing said it expects to deliver the first tankers to the Air Force in late 2017. On Wednesday, Boeing posted fourth quarter profits and operating cash that beat analysts' estimates and said it expected to generate a record $10.75 billion in operating cash this year.

But the official's only response was that the phone 'goes with the office of that position'.  Before taking the oath of office on January 20, President Donald Trump was at first believed to have handed over his personal Android phone. The New York Times reported President Trump swapped his personal phone for a 'secure, encrypted device approved by the Secret Service with a new number that few people possess.' But it seems the story has since changed. Six days later, The New York Times published another article that included evidence that the President is still using his Samsung Galaxy. 'Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their 10-year-old son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television — and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides — to keep him company,' reported Maggie Haberman with The Times.

Share this article Share 28 shares And many are wondering why the President is not using his phone fit for a spy.  The Boeing Black phone is a collaboration between Boeing and the Defense Information System Agency (DISA). It encrypts calls and is specifically designed for government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure. The phone uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks and can be configured to connect with biometric sensors and satellites. And the Department of Defense Information Networks head Lt. Gen. Alan Lynn confirmed the Boeing Black works with 'a large amount of encryption.' Many Android users know that their smartphones can be hacked at any moment, which makes many security experts worry about Trumps decision to keep his phone close. The New York Times published an article stating: 'Mr. Trump's wife, Melania, went back to New York on Sunday night with their 10-year-old son, Barron, and so Mr. Trump has the television — and his old, unsecured Android phone, to the protests of some of his aides — to keep him company (Pictured is Trump campaigning in 2016) 'This is a consumer device, and it's going to have security vulnerabilities,' Bruce Schneier, an internationally renowned security technologist, shared in a blog post. 'He's at risk from everybody, ranging from lone hackers to the better-funded intelligence agencies of the world. And while the risk of a forged e-mail is real — it could easily move the stock market — the bigger risk is eavesdropping. 'That Android has a microphone, which means that it can be turned into a room bug without anyone's knowledge. That's my real fear.' However, experts like Schneier might be able to sleep better at night knowing Trump was just using the Boeing Black phone. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network. The phone itself just send keyboard, mouse and other signals to the 'real' server. said Lynn: 'We're not too worried about losing data,' at least not off the phone,' aid Lynn. He also admitted he thought his boss liked that handset. On November 1, Lynn and President Obama were the first two, maybe even the only two, who received a Black Boeing phone, reports Patrick Tucker with Defense One . Tucker contacted the DISA asking if Obama's Boeing Black phone had been handed off to Trump. But the official's only response was that the phone 'goes with the office of that position'  'I think he does,' he told Defense One in a November interview. 'Haven't heard any complaints.' 'The phone will be sold primarily to government agencies and companies engaged in contractual activities with those agencies that are related to defense and homeland security,' Boeing says. It plans to limit the sale of the device to 'approved' buyers. 'The device will be marketed and sold in a manner such that low level technical and operational information about the product will not be provided to the general public.' Even if approved, buyers will have to sign an agreement agreeing to keep their details of the phone secret. WHAT COULD BE IN THE PHONE  A researcher from the University of  Maryland revealed other features and technology that could be included in President Donald Trump's official phone. One level of protection is what is called 'security by obscurity.'  Many people presumably had Trump's pre-presidential phone number.  Now, relatively few people will have his new number.   'Trusted Platform Module' is included that notifies authorities if phone has been tampered with. The phone may only be able to connect with certain predetermined phone and data networks that are regularly screened against intrusions. Limiting its contact with the internet would be key. Trump's phone likely has some degree of customization such as a unique operating system. The apps allowed on the president's phone should be few and limited only to those verified in advance.   Separately encrypting the memory spaces used by each app can boost security further. Perhaps the phone's microphone and camera could be shut off, and any active Twitter link disconnected, if the phone itself is in the Oval Office, and whenever the president is meeting with members of his national security team.  'Specifically designates and protects as 'proprietary information' the components, hardware, Product Software, applications, functionalities, or internal structure or workings of the Product provided by Seller, including without limitation those that can be obtained by disassembling or opening the Product or its software or components.' 'There are no serviceable parts on Boeing's Black phone and any attempted servicing or replacing of parts would destroy the product. 'The Boeing Black phone is manufactured as a sealed device both with epoxy around the casing and with screws, the heads of which are covered with tamper proof covering to identify attempted disassembly. 'Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.'  Blackberry confirmed the existence of the project in 2015- but refused to reveal any more information. The FCC filing reveal very little about the phone - other than its shape and the fact it will take two sim cards. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network 'We're pleased to announce that Boeing is collaborating with BlackBerry to provide a secure mobile solution for Android devices utilizing our BES 12 platform,' BlackBerry's CEO John Chen said on a conference call held to discuss its quarterly results in 2015. 'That, by the way, is all they allow me to say.'  The Boeing Black device encrypts calls and is aimed at government agencies and others that need to keep communications and data secure.  It uses dual SIM cards to enable it to access multiple cell networks and can be configured to connect with biometric sensors and satellites.  Lynn confirmed the Boeing Black works with 'a large amount of encryption.' However, he said it was its ability to keep data on servers rather than on the handset that made it attractive. 'There's nothing that lives on the devices,' he explained. The system works by using the handset to access a remote server on the military's Top Secret JWICS network.  The phone itself just send keyboard, mouse and other signals to the 'real' server. said Lynn: 'We're not too worried about losing data,' at least not off the phone,' aid Lynn. He also admitted he thought his boss liked that handset.  'I think he does,' he told Defence One. 'Haven't heard any complaints.' It also reveals that the handset will be completely sealed, and any attempt to open it will destroy the phone and delete all the data on it. 'There are no serviceable parts on Boeing's Black phone and any attempted servicing or replacing of parts would destroy the product. 'The Boeing Black phone is manufactured as a sealed device both with epoxy around the casing and with screws, the heads of which are covered with tamper proof covering to identify attempted disassembly. 'Any attempt to break open the casing of the device would trigger functions that would delete the data and software contained within the device and make the device inoperable.'

Alwyn Scott Reuters Published Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 7:45AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Jan. 25, 2017 9:26AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Boeing Co beat analysts’ profit estimates on Wednesday despite another charge for its military tanker aircraft and said it expects to deliver more planes and higher earnings in 2017, though revenue likely will fall. The world’s biggest plane maker also said it expects to deliver between 760 and 765 commercial aircraft in 2017, topping 748 deliveries in 2016. It forecast 2017 core earnings of between $9.10 and $9.30 a share, which exclude some pension and other costs, on revenue of $90.5-billion to $92.5-billion. Analysts estimated $9.28 a share on $92.964-billion in revenue, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Boeing forecast operating cash flow of about $10.75-billion in 2017 versus record cash flow of $10.5-billion in 2016. The company generated $7.7-billion in operating cash flow at the end of the third quarter, fueling expectations it would hit its target of about $10-billion for 2016. But the year-end figure surpassed analysts’ estimates of $10.4-billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We think this release is pretty boring – and boring is good,” Robert Stallard, an analyst at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note to clients. Boeing shares were up 1.4 per cent at $162.80 in premarket trading. Boeing’s higher cash target for 2017 suggested it can keep generating cash by reducing costs while it increases aircraft deliveries. Boeing expects to deliver more planes in 2017 despite plans to cut output of its 777 model by 40 per cent this year. Deliveries of its smaller 737 and 737 MAX models will make up the difference, producing a revenue decline in 2017. Core earnings rose to $2.47 per share in the fourth quarter from $1.60 a year earlier. The increase came despite a $201-million aftertax charge for Boeing’s KC-46A aerial refueling tanker program for the U.S. Air Force. Revenue fell 1.2 per cent to $23.29-billion in the quarter. President Donald Trump has been meeting with corporate executives in an effort to cut better deals with defense contractors. Boeing’s chief executive officer met with Trump earlier this month and said afterward that they had “made progress” on lowering the cost of the Air Force One presidential aircraft fleet and on a potential sale of Boeing fighter aircraft. CEO Dennis Muilenburg suggested after the meeting that a deal could be struck soon. Trump had complained that Air Force One planes were too expensive.

Mattis Takes Lead on Cost-Containment Effort The review will "determine opportunities" to cut F-35 costs "significantly" while "meeting requirements." While many berate Trump for looking into upgrades of the F/A-18 Super Hornet as a comparable alternative to the fifth-generation F-35, Mattis said that the review will investigate to what extent the Boeing-made Super Hornet can provide certain capabilities at reduced levels of military expenditure. The review will look into potential F/A-18 upgrades as well. Lockheed Martin and Boeing shares were both down Friday as of 1:30 p.m., Eastern Time. One official from the General Services Administration, which deals with procurement, told Sputnik News that research and development expenses are always factored into the price of an aircraft. The $100-$135 million price tag generally refers to just the production cost of an F-35, and this is usually what gets reported across media outlets, including here on Sputnik. In 2015, lawmakers authorized approximately $55 billion for research, development, and testing, in addition to $1.1 trillion for operations and maintenance. Lockheed Martin and Trump are "very close to a deal" Sputnik has reported that despite Trump's claims to personally oversee "beautiful" cost-cutting measures, the price of the F-35 was already slated to drop in 2017. An executive from one of the anti-missile designers, private UK defense firm Chemring Group Plc, remarked that cost reductions were "a given, regardless of Trump," due to economies of scale. Officials leaked that the Pentagon and Lockheed would reach an accord on the tenth order of F-35s by the end of January. In a recent earnings call, Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson said "President Trump recognizes the F-35 is a very large program–the largest in the Department of Defense," but promised shareholders and investors that lower F-35 costs would not contribute to "slashing our profit." According to Hewson, the Joint Strike Fighter program is a "growth engine" for the defense mammoth. "We continue to see growing international demand for it," she said. Norway Will Ditch Old F-16 Fighting Falcon Fleet For F-35 Arrival Norwegian air squads will decommission a fleet of at least 50 aging F-16 Fighting Falcons to pave way for the arrival of new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Norwegian pilots have been training on F-35s at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona since 2015. This year, the highly-anticipated fifth-generation F-35s will make their debut in Norwegian air space. The Ministry of Defense is hoping that the move to scrap the F-16 squadron will pay off financially and politically. The politics of selling the F-16s to another party may be too complex, and Oslo does not prefer to front expensive maintenance costs to keep the F-16s as a reserve fighting fleet. The F-16 has been touted as the most combat-proven fourth generation fighter by its manufacturers, General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin. While officials cope with "out of control" costs of the F-35, which Trump hopes to lock-in for less than $100 million per aircraft, it is worth noting that, in the late 1990s, the price of an F-16 hovered between $14-$19 million. Three F-35s will be delivered to Norway this year, prompting the air force to lay the F-16 fleet to rest, Ministry of Defense officials said. Some F-16s will remain in operation until 2021 as more of the 52 F-35As ordered by Oslo make their way across the Atlantic Ocean. The Kingdom of Norway, instituted in 1905, has engaged in several armed conflicts since World War II. But Oslo has totaled just 10 casualties during these conflicts, all of which occurred during the War in Afghanistan, in which Oslo has supported US and NATO efforts against the Taliban. Oslo also contributed forces when NATO swooped into the Libyan Civil War. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print The Dow Jones industrial average crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time today, the latest milestone in a record-setting drive for the stock market. Strong earnings from Boeing and other big companies helped push the Dow past the threshold early on and had U.S. stocks solidly higher by afternoon. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index and Nasdaq composite were on course for record highs of their own after each closed at all-time highs on Tuesday. Financial stocks were leading the gainers, while real estate, phone companies and other high-dividend stocks were among the biggest laggards as bond yields rose. The Dow, which tracks 30 major industrial companies, gained 151 points, or 0.8 percent, to 20,064 as of 1:09 p.m. Eastern Time. The S&P 500 index rose 15 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,295. The Nasdaq added 45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,646. The market has been marching steadily higher since bottoming out in March 2009 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The rally continued after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president last fall. The Dow first closed above 10,000 on March 29, 1999. Wednesday’s rally comes against a backdrop of optimism on Wall Street that executive actions and policy goals announced by the Trump administration this week on trade, manufacturing and business deregulation will be good for corporate America. “Whether its tax reform or infrastructure spending, any of those tend to be optimistic conversations for the markets currently,” said Darrell Cronk, president of Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “We have to wait and see how they play out, obviously. The danger here, if there is one, is that the market gets ahead of itself a little bit.” Most professional investors are skeptical the Dow at 20,000 will have much effect on the market. They more often look to the S&P 500 index as a benchmark, because they consider it better representation of the broad market. “In and of itself, it is just a number,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But what it does is it lifts market expectations, in essence, to continue moving higher.” If the Dow reaching 20,000 has any impact, it will likely be a psychological one. Investors have been leery of the stock market for years, unable to stomach the prospect of losing more than 50 percent of their money for a second time if another financial crisis hits. That trepidation has caused them to pull money out of stock funds — even as the Dow made its march toward 20,000 — and depend instead on safer bond investments. Last year, investors pulled a net $27.1 billion out of U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, according to Morningstar. A year earlier, they yanked $66.5 billion. Over the same time, investors plugged a total of $218.6 billion into taxable bond funds. Anyone who resisted the urge to dump their stock investments through all the tumult of the last decade is now seeing the full benefit of a market with the Dow at 20,000. A $10,000 investment in the largest U.S. stock mutual fund made a decade ago, before the Great Recession began, would have dropped below $5,000 by March 2009. But investors who held on even through the worries of another recession hitting, U.S. debt downgrade, the euro crisis, Brexit and U.S. presidential election of last fall would now be sitting on nearly $20,000. This is expected to be the busiest week for corporate earnings news, with about 30 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 reporting quarterly results. Several companies were moving higher after reporting results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Boeing was the biggest gainer in the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer climbed $7.70, or 4.8 percent, to $168.25. Seagate’s latest quarterly snapshot drove its shares 17.7 percent higher, to lead all other companies in the S&P 500. The stock added $6.64 to $44.08. Investors also bid up shares in Rockwell Automation, which rose $10.06, or 7.1 percent, to $152.09, and Logitech, which vaulted 15.5 percent. The computer gaming and accessories maker’s shares added $3.90 to $29. Some companies posted earnings that failed to impress investors. Textron slumped 10.5 percent after the defense contractor’s fourth-quarter revenue missed financial analysts’ estimates. The company also announced it is buying snowmobile maker Arctic Cat in a deal valued at about $247 million. Textron was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, sliding $5.21 to $44.17. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan fell 5.5 percent after it served up quarterly results that missed analysts’ forecasts. The stock slid 93 cents to $16.09. Major stock indexes in Europe moved higher. Germany’s DAX was up 1.8 percent, while the CAC-40 in France was 1 percent higher. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was up 0.2 percent. Earlier in Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 surged 1.4 percent after Japan’s government said that the nation had a trade surplus in 2016, its first in six years. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4 percent. South Korea’s Kospi rose 0.1 percent. Oil prices edged lower. Benchmark U.S. crude was down 4 cents to $53.14 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $55.31 a barrel in London. Bond prices fell. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.52 percent from 2.47 percent late Tuesday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 113.79 yen from 113.89 on Tuesday. The euro rose to $1.0732 from $1.0723.

There's still a lot of things you'll never know. Like why each time the sky begins to snow, you cry" sang the late, great Dan Fogelberg. I've been known to quietly weep when the sky begins to snow - during rush hour - on 494 - on the drive home. Think of how much time we waste commuting, to do work we could probably do at home. Dr. Mark Seeley reports January temperatures are running 5-7F warmer than average, in spite of that crunchy subzero shuffle a few weeks back. 17 consecutive months warmer than average at MSP - 9 months in a row, statewide. For the next week or two tracking Minnesota's weather will be the rough meteorological equivalent of watching paint dry. I'm OK with that. Any big storms track south, a rag-tag parade of weak Alberta Clippers for us. Starved for moisture, they may spark an occasional coating. Models hint at plowable, 4-inch amounts on Monday from Bemidji to Duluth. That's as exciting as it gets. Slightly warmer than normal temperatures prevail the next 2 weeks. I suspect the worst of winter's chill is behind us now. January 2017: Another Warmer than Average Month for Minnesota. Here's an excerpt of Mark Seeley's Minnesota WeatherTalk: "...As we end the month of January early next week most of Minnesota's climate observers are reporting mean monthly temperature values that are from 5 to 7 degrees F warmer than normal. For the Twin Cities January marks the 17th consecutive month with above normal temperatures, while on a statewide basis it is the 9th consecutive month of above normal temperatures. Extreme temperature values for the month ranged from -46°F at Cotton (St Louis County) on the 14th to a high of 48°F at several locations over the 18th and 19th. In terms of record-setting daily temperatures, 31 daily record maximum temperature records were tied or set over the warm period from the 17th to the 21st, while over the same period 90 daily warm minimum temperature records were tied or set..." Lake Effect - Couple of Clippers. The pattern is (relatively) quiet and benign the next few days as lake effect snows slowly shut off downwind of the Great Lakes. A fairly impressive Alberta Clipper brush Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan by Monday and Tuesday. The western USA enjoys a rare spell of dry weather until the latter half of next week. 84-hour NAM guidance: NOAA and Tropicaltidbits.com. Fun With Positive Numbers. My expectations are pretty low in late January and early February, so the fact that the Twin Cities is forecast to stay consistently above 0F for the next 15 days is a small victory. Temperatures run near or even a degree or 2F above average through the period. ECMWF guidance: WeatherBell. 10-Day GFS Snowfall Guidance. Take all of this with a giant grain of (road) salt - the GFS tends to be overly generous with snowfall amounts. A plowable accumulation is quite possible Monday into Tuesday from northern Minnesota and Wisconsin into Michigan. Pacific storms return by Thursday of next week, adding to rainfall and already-outrageous mountain snows. The GFS is hinting at accumulating snow for the southeastern USA Super Bowl Sunday into Monday, February 7. No, I don't believe it yet, and neither should you. More March Than February. No guarantees this 2-week 500mb (18,000 foot) wind forecast will verify - there never is, but if it does come close much of the USA will be bathed in relatively mild Pacific air; the coldest arctic air pushed well north of the USA. It's still a volatile, fast-paced pattern and I wouldn't' rule out more numbing air, but the odds of record, sustained, day after day of subzero weather drops off fairly quickly by late February. So Long Exceptional Drought. The recent parade of storms off the Pacific has put a serious dent in the drought. Here's an overview from AerisWeather meteorologist D.J. Kayser: "This weeks Drought Monitor marks the first time since the March 29, 2011 issuance that there is no exceptional drought anywhere in the U.S. For California, it is the first time since the January 21, 2014 issuance with no exceptional drought in the state. California is also down to only 2.16% of the state under extreme drought this week. The last time they had no extreme drought across the state was the August 6, 2013 issuance." Map credit: Aeris Maps Platform. California Drought Shrinks to Smallest Level in Years After Onslaught of Rain and Snow. Jason Samenow has details at Capital Weather Gang: "A year ago, exceptional drought — the most serious kind — covered 40 percent of California. As of Thursday, following weeks of heavy rain storms and massive dumps of mountain snow, exceptional drought has vacated the state. The intensity and coverage of California’s drought has shrunk dramatically since October when 80 percent of the state was declared a drought area by the U.S. government’s Drought Monitor. Now just about half the state has drought conditions — entirely focused in central and southern California. The Drought Monitor indicated that Northern California was drought-free two weeks ago..."

It validates a total of 50-60 or more across the Deep South last weekend, including Florida. Here are Dan's comments: "Here's what I could gather from the other NWS offices that service Georgia: 22+ tornadoes in the Peachtree City, GA NWS service area - covers most of central and northern GA. 4 tornadoes in the Tallahassee, FL NWS service area (3 in GA, including one that killed 11 people, and 1 in AL) - they cover SW GA and west FL and far southeast AL.   0 tornadoes in the Jacksonville, FL NWS service area - covers far southeast GA and northeast FL   4 tornadoes in the Charleston, SC NWS service area - covers area around Savannah, GA and far south SC. So the total for GA alone is 29..." The Science Behind GOES-16's Color Composite Imagery. NOAA NESDIS explains why GOES-16 creates a superior "true color" image: "...The composite color images from GOES-16, however, are created by combining data from the satellite's 16-band Advanced Baseline Imager to produce a range of colors within visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum (think the colors of the rainbow, ROYGBIV). The end product is an image much closer to what a human eye would see from space. âYet, as mesmerizing as GOES-16's color images are, the fact is that meteorologists don't always want to view the Earth and its atmosphere this way. This explains why GOES-16 carries an imager with 16 spectral bands as opposed to a camera..." Floods, Damaging Winds Most Destructive Natural Hazards in 2016. Claims Journal has some statistics about last year's storms I haven't seen anywhere else: "At $17 billion, total flood loss in 2016 was six times greater than the overall flood damage experienced in 2015. Five flood-related events in 2016 exceeded $1 billion in losses, including: The Louisiana flood in August with losses estimated at more than $10 billion. Hurricane Matthew in October with losses estimated at $3 billion. As of December 7, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) had received more the 10,000 claims and paid more than $70 million to policyholders and victims in the five-state area. The Sabine River Basin flood in East Texas and Louisiana in March with losses estimated at $1.3 billion. The Houston flood in April with losses estimated at $1.2 billion. West Virginia flash and riverine flooding in June with losses estimated at $1 billion..." Photo credit: 2016 Louisiana flooding, NOAA Remote Sensing Division. Only You Can Stop "Vacation Weather Shaming" I do the weather for free because I'm smitten by Mother Nature. They pay me to put up with the abuse. This is the time of year when friends, family and utter strangers share warm weather vacation taunts - there's more than a little gloating going on. "Paul, it's Tom in Scottsdale, where it's a balmy 66 degrees. How's the weather up in Minnesota?" Click. "Hi Paul, it's Joan in San Diego, where my 4-year old actually FORGOT how to put on a jacket. Isn't that PRECIOUS?" Uh huh. Heidi texted me from Cabo, complaining about high winds and rough seas for fishing. "Is your weather app right? Will winds die down?" God help me.My favorite is spring break trips in March. The greater the difference in temperature between Minnesota and the destination - the happier they are. Sad! Hey, we're thrilled you're going on a warm weather vacation. Just....keep it to yourself. Building to the Sky, with a Plan for Rising Waters. The New York Times reports on a growing trend: "...Along coastlines and lake shores and riverfronts across the country, tenants and homeowners, regulators and planners, private developers and public institutions are embracing the accumulating evidence of climate change and fortifying buildings and infrastructure against rising sea levels and ever more intense storms. To an extent that would have been unimaginable before Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012, resilient design has entered the vocabulary of architects and engineers in parts of the country at risk of inundation..."

Details via Temblor.net: "The San Francisco Seawall was a key factor in turning San Francisco into the prosperous city it is today. Its construction, which took place from 1879-1916 allowed for tidal marshlands to be turned into the Embarcadero, and over 500 acres of downtown San Francisco. However, the Seawall is at risk from a serious threat, earthquakes. Last July, in a joint venture by GHD and GTC, two engineering consultants, a report on the Seawall’s earthquake vulnerability was prepared for the Port of San Francisco. In it, they highlighted the “greater than expected risk to the Seawall,” and strategies which could be taken to seismically retrofit it. This report, and more, was further highlighted at the 14th Annual Northern California Earthquake Hazards Workshop at NASA this last Tuesday and Wednesday..."

Such a quake poses significant threats to the San Francisco Seawall." (Figure from 2016 USGS Fact Sheet on the “Earthquake Outlook for the San Francisco Bay Region 2014–2043”) 3 Republican Governors Embrace Clean Energy's Economic Promise. Here's an excerpt from EDF, Environmental Defense Fund: "Last week, the U.S. inaugurated a new president who has vowed to abandon the landmark Paris climate agreement and roll back bedrock American environmental protections.But turn to the states and you’ll find a different story, even in the red states that elected President Trump. In fact, Republican governors in the Midwest are prioritizing economic growth and job creation by accelerating investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy. In the few weeks after the election, leaders in Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan have adopted new policies that help tackle climate change and grow the clean energy economy..." Americans Overwhelmingly Support Clean Energy. Quartz reports: "...Just 27% of Americans surveyed this month by the Pew Research Center, a think tank, said they thought the US should prioritize expanding the coal, oil, and gas industries, while 65% thought alternatives like wind and solar should be the priority. (The remainder of the 1,502 US adults Pew surveyed didn’t express an opinion.) Those under 50, in particular, leaned toward cleaner forms of energy, with 73% favoring renewables. In the over-50 age group the majority was still in favor of expanding renewables, though by a smaller margin..." Photo credit: "Which do you back?" (Reuters/Brian Snyder). Trump Infrastructure Priority Plan Includes Transmission, Wind, Energy Storage. An "all of the above" strategy, including clean renewables? I'm keeping my fingers crossed. Here's an excerpt from Utility Dive: "...Trump's infrastructure wish list includes many provisions observers would expect — the document is heavy on the bridges and road projects he promised throughout the campaign would create jobs for Americans.  Those in the utility industry who hoped that affinity for big infrastructure projects would translate into power sector programs may take heart in the document released by McClatchy on Tuesday. Just how the Trump administration plans to encourage the projects remains unclear, but it could give an indication of the White House's priorities. Of the 50 infrastructure projects, seven focus on the electricity sector..." Tentative Infrastructure Priority List is here. Big Oil Roars Back. Texas Monthly has the story; here's an excerpt: "...But as 2017 begins, the outlook is radically different. Prices seem to have stabilized (albeit at half their mid-2014 level), and Donald Trump has tapped two prominent Texans with deep energy-industry ties for his Cabinet. Pending their respective confirmations (which had not been completed when Texas Monthly went to press), ExxonMobil chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson will be our next secretary of state, and former governor Rick Perry will run the Department of Energy. And an almost-Texan—Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt—has been nominated as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, where he would likely pursue a pro-oil agenda. After eight years of the cold shoulder, fossil fuels are back in vogue in Washington. “It’s a complete U-turn from the previous administration,” says Craig Pirrong, the director of the University of Houston’s Global Energy Management Institute..."

In a chat with Gizmodo Musk shares his views about pricing carbon and Exxon's Rex Tillerson at Secretary of State: "...My tweets speak for themselves. Please read them exactly as they are written. Tillerson obviously did a competent job running Exxon, one of the largest companies in the world. In that role, he was obligated to advance the cause of Exxon and did. In the Sec of State role, he is obligated to advance the cause of the US and I suspect he probably will. Also, he has publicly acknowledged for years that a carbon tax could make sense. There is no better person to push for that to become a reality than Tillerson. This is what matters far more than pipelines or opening oil reserves. The unpriced externality must be priced..." National Archives Vault. It turns out the U.S. Constitution and other priceless documents are protected in a nuclear-bomb-proof vault.

Interesting details at WIRED: "...The Boeing Blue is designed for intra-vehicular activity, meaning it’s meant for wearing inside the spacecraft. It offers a measure of protection in the event of a serious problem like sudden depressurization or a fire. Unlike a suit designed for extra-vehicular activity, it can’t shield astronauts from micro meteoroids or keep them from being baked like a potato by solar radiation. They’ll wear it primarily during launches and re-entries, when they face the greatest risk of something going wrong. “The nickname for it in the Apollo era was the ‘get me down quick suit,’ says Nicholas de Monchaux, who wrote Spacesuit: Fashioning Apollo, a book about spacesuit design..."

Here's an excerpt from The Daily Home: "...Serious scientists and public health leaders, and Pentagon leaders, are gravely concerned about climate change. We fear that the violent storms, floods, droughts, sea level rise and loss of agriculture associated with climate change will cause migrations hundreds of times larger than the displacement from Syria. An important aspect of this is that I really want to acknowledge and to thank meteorologists for very important work and outreach informing the public about weather threats. I would assert that both physicians and meteorologists are in a daunting and sacred position between people and the world of science. In meteorology the systemic disorder is climate heating as a result of climate forcing gases. I worry deeply about the future of my country, about environment and health, about our economy and about our security threats. Some will likely say that it is not meteorologists’ job to report on longer-term and global threats, such as climate. In response here’s a medical story..." Rain from Thunderstorms is Rising Due To Climate Change. Something I've been witnessing for the better part of 15 years, and I'm hardly the only meteorologist tracking these trends. Scientific American has the story: "Across a vast swath of Europe and Asia, rain is increasingly falling in the short, localized bursts associated with thunderstorms, seemingly at the expense of events where a steady rain falls over many hours, a new study finds. The study, detailed Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, directly links this trend to the warming and moistening of the atmosphere caused by rising greenhouse gas levels. The results fit with rainfall trends already observed in the U.S., as well as model predictions that massive rains associated with thunderstorms could become both more frequent and more intense in the U.S. as the world continues to heat up. The shift toward more extreme rains could have implications for water management and flooding because the ground is less able to absorb rainwater when it falls all at once..." As Climate Change Accelerates, Floating Cities Look Like Less of a Pipe Dream. Here's an excerpt from The New York Times: "You might call it a Noah’s Ark for an era of melting polar ice sheets. An audacious plan to respond to climate change by building a city of floating islands in the South Pacific is moving forward, with the government of French Polynesia agreeing to consider hosting the islands in a tropical lagoon. The project is being put forward by a California nonprofit, the Seasteading Institute, which has raised about $2.5 million from more than 1,000 interested donors. Randolph Hencken, the group’s executive director, said work on the project could start in French Polynesia as early as next year, pending the results of some environmental and economic feasibility studies..."

The Wall Street Journal reports: "...An Environmental Protection Agency spokesman denied media reports from earlier this week that Mr. Trump’s administration was going to imminently delete the EPA’s website on climate change. Meanwhile, incoming Trump officials at agencies including the Interior Department, Agriculture Department and the EPA have demanded a cessation of certain public communication, prompting outcries from some congressional Democrats and progressive interest groups. With nearly seven days under Mr. Trump’s belt as president, many experts say the new administration’s moves aren’t that different from past transitions of power.

What has changed, some say, is a rapid-fire social-media scene and a new president facing opposition not seen in decades. Trump Sparks Fear of War on Science. Here's an excerpt from TheHill: "...The Associated Press reported Thursday that advisers have eyed a two-thirds reduction in the agency’s staffing, a possibility that would upset the EPA’s mission and one that has unnerved federal employees. Those moves come in contrast to the strategy employed by the George W. Bush administration, which used appropriations to pump funding into federal science programs, according to Matt Owens, the vice president for federal relations and administration at the Association of American Universities. Bush oversaw a doubling of the National Institutes of Health budget, an expansion of interagency research activities and a bump up in budgets at the National Science Foundation and the Energy Department, Owens noted..." Exxon Praises "Monumental" Paris Agreement in Signal to Trump. Call me crazy but this is a pretty big deal. Bloomberg has the story: "Exxon Mobil Corp., the U.S. oil giant that’s facing investigations over what it knew and when about climate change, sees the Paris agreement to mitigate global warming as a “monumental” achievement, according to a top executive. The company supports the December 2015 Paris accord as a “very meaningful and constructive process,” William M. Colton, Exxon’s vice president for corporate strategic planning, said in an interview in Berlin on Wednesday. Adhering to the accord’s commitments are achievable and compatible with Exxon’s business strategy, he said. President Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, former Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson, cleared a key confirmation hurdle Tuesday in Washington, overcoming objections that his appointment would threaten climate-change efforts..."

Dr. John Abraham at the University of St. Thomas reports for The Guardian: "...When you use the recommended time period, it turns out that 2015 was the first year on record that passed the 1°C (1.8°F) mark. It means that 2016 was approximately 0.1°C (0.2°F) warmer than we had thought relative to the pre-industrial time period. To put this in perspective, it is almost an extra decade of warming. Why does this matter? Well it means that we have about a decade less time to act on climate change if we are going to avoid the most serious consequences. It means we simply have no time to waste, and no room for error. It also means that even if we take action right now, there will be consequences. That said, it is better in the long run to act now than to wait. The people denying or delaying action are costing us, and our future generation much in terms of financial, social, and human capital..." (File image: University of Wisconsin - Madison CIMSS). Good Luck Silencing Science. Here's an excerpt from techcrunch.com: "...There’s a word for that — a word frequently misused these days, but the correct word in this case: censorship. Unfortunately for the would-be censors, the days when that sort of thing worked are long past. The Streisand effect has for years proven the stronger force than even the most dedicated of information wranglers. But it won’t even get to that stage. You can’t just tell science to shut up. Climate change in particular is a nasty one to try to put to bed. It’s taken decades of research by thousands upon thousands of scientists all over the globe to arrive and strengthen the theory (in the sense that gravity and evolution are also theories) of anthropogenic climate change, or global warming if you prefer.

It is a dangerous cocktail for German industry. Photos REUTERS January 28, 2017  02:29 AM Print Feedback Comment It has been quite a scene at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York recently, with a never-ending parade of stretch limousines and armored S-Class Mercedes pulling up to the building. The heads of Ford, Tesla, Boeing and dozens of other companies have all dropped by for an audience with Donald Trump. The president has consistently gushed about the "great meetings," but little more than silence could be heard from the other side. Behind the scenes, this much has become clear: They didn't come for negotiations or even to offer advice to the new president. They came to hedge their bets. They are on the defensive, in the hopes that Trump will be less aggressive with those who he knows. Senior executives in Germany have been keeping close tabs on the stream of visitors heading for an audience with Trump, full of concern and nervous about what the future might hold. They have refrained from speaking about Trump publicly, but internally, it's the only thing they are talking about. There is significant fear that they too might become Trump targets. Nobody knows what rules are still valid in this new political era, one in which billions in value can be destroyed by a single tweet. An era in which it is no longer clear who is a friend and who is an enemy. It is an era that began on Donald Trump's first day in the White House, when he turned away from what has been the global economy's most important motor for decades: free trade and globalization no longer have any place in America's new populism. Trump immediately backed out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and is intent on renegotiating other such free trade deals, these "horrible deals," which he sees as the source of America's downfall. "This wave of globalization has wiped out totally, totally, our middle class," he said while on the campaign trail. On the same Monday, he received dozens of America's most important executives, representatives of the country's leading economic sectors. Trump called it a "listening session," but he didn't appear to be the one interested in listening. Rather, it was the business leaders who were to receive the new rules of this new era. "America first," is the only relevant philosophy, and those who go along will be rewarded by way of massive tax cuts and investments. Those who resist will be punished, with tariffs, special taxes, government reprisals and, more than anything, the fury of the president -- announced on Twitter and followed by a plunge in the stock price on Wall Street. Attack on the German Model Trump's first week was a power play, full of attempts at intimidation and threats. It was a week that raised new, fundamental questions: Can Trump really suspend the fundamental rules of economics, which force multinational corporations to maximize profits and minimize costs? Can globalization be reversed through a few tweets? And most importantly, is the U.S. president risking a global trade war so that he can impose his domestic agenda? For the moment, the answers to these questions appear to be: Yes. The consequences of this radical political shift are not limited to the United States. When the world's largest and most influential economy makes changes, the shockwaves can be felt everywhere. A new economic world order is coming into being. And it is an attack on the German model. In his campaign speeches and tirades against globalization, Trump primarily identified China and Mexico as his enemies, but Germany, a nation of exports, is likely to be third on that list. No other large economy is more reliant on the free exchange of goods and services, on border-free trade and barrier-free exports, than the German economy. DER SPIEGEL It is becoming apparent that Trump's presidency represents a break in the trans-Atlantic relationship, the kinds of which hasn't been seen since World War II. With a U.S. president who openly threatens a German carmaker with punitive tariffs of 35 percent, one who warns that the Germans were "very unfair to the U.S.," it could even mark a shift from friendship to animosity. In corporate headquarters and in Angela Merkel's Chancellery, executives and government officials are considering how best to stand up to this challenge. Is it better to remain composed and unperturbed, relying on rationality, on the strength of decades of ties and on the rules of the global economy? Or would it be better to prepare countermeasures, search for new allies in, for example, Asia or perhaps even to take advantage of the vacuum that is being created? Either way, with the world looking more fragile than it has in quite some time, there is a lot at stake. The consequences of an economic crisis or even a trade war would likely be disastrous for Germany, particularly with elections approaching in autumn. Right-wing populists, who would love to see Trumpism imported to Germany, would be certain to take advantage of any economic downturn by posing as the champions of the victims of globalization. Much will depend on the economic recipes that Trump ultimately mixes together and the effects they will have -- whether the U.S. economy will begin to wobble or whether it will actually become stronger, at least for a time. Tax cuts and additional government spending would usher in a period of sustained economic growth. That, at least, is what the new president is promising, and the stock markets seem inclined to believe him. Optimists believe that good times are on their way and that if the American economy does well, Trump's threats will quickly fade. A Clear Signal However, most economists believe that anti-globalization policies can only end in a global trade war that would kill corporate innovation and plunge the entire world economy into a recession. The pessimists are concerned. The worse the American economy fares, the more radical will be the measures taken by President Trump. In the first week of his presidency, Trump began putting together his team, charged with transforming his course campaign rhetoric into clear plans for financial and tax policy and for the Fed, for industry and for trade. To do so, he has not surrounded himself with the country's best economists as his predecessor did. That too is a clear signal. Instead, Trump is relying almost exclusively on "businessmen:" men who have made billions, or at least millions, on the free market. They are not all committed to the same ideological course. On the contrary. Some are in favor of protectionism while others are considered to be adherents of globalization. Some want an enormous state-sponsored infrastructure program while others want to see radical spending cuts. Some want to unleash the markets while others are in favor of state regulation of key industries. Some are arch-conservatives while others are liberal. It is -- intentionally -- unclear who will emerge victorious. The president has divided the influence of his advisers across several power centers. In the end, only one person will decide how to proceed, likely on an ad hoc basis, largely dependent on his mood. Unpredictability is one of the tenants of Trumpism. Contradictions and conflicts are intentionally fostered. Basically, though, Trump's team, regardless of ideological proclivities, can be divided into two camps. On the one side is a random collection of speculators and crisis profiteers, provocateurs and extremists. The chair of the Council of Economic Advisors will likely be a television host. On questions of monetary policy, he relies on an arch-conservative lobbyist who wants to reintroduce the gold standard. An oil industry billionaire advises him on energy policy. On the other side, Wall Street is celebrating its political resurrection. Steven Mnuchin is to become Secretary of the Treasury, a man who was long a partner and board member at Goldman Sachs. Head of the National Economic Council is Gary Cohn, who was chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs until a short time ago. His chief political strategist Stephen Bannon was once a Goldman Sachs executive. During the campaign, Trump constantly attacked Hillary Clinton for her close ties to the financial industry. And many of his followers see Wall Street as the core of the conspiracy against American citizens and as the driving force behind the hated establishment. Such crass contradictions show how deeply dissatisfied Americans are with the slow economic growth that characterized the Obama years. They long for an economic boom and for the growth rates seen in decades past -- and are willing to accept any means necessary. An Historic High Stock markets and consumers seem unconcerned that many of the key elements of Trump's economic plan don't fit together, or even cancel each other out. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones climbed to an historic high. Consumer confidence is higher than it has been since before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Their enthusiasm is driven by expectations of trillions of dollars in tax cuts, particularly for corporations. The cuts are supposed to encourage both companies and individuals to invest and consume, with the hope that the resulting economic growth will produce sufficient tax revenues to pay for the cuts. SPIEGEL ONLINE Larry Kudlow, designated head of the Council of Economic Advisors, promises that the tax cuts will "really put a booster rocket underneath this economy" and produce growth rates of up to 5 percent. Growth, he says, solves all problems, including the budget deficit. Such concepts are not new. Ronald Reagan made "supply side economics" popular in the early 1980s. But they didn't work quite as planned. To be sure, the massive tax cuts produced economic growth rates of over 3 percent. But at the same time, the U.S. developed sovereign debt higher than anywhere else in the world along with an enormous budget deficit. Later, one of the architects of Reaganomics, a domestic policy advisor to the president in the 1980s, wrote a book pillorying the supply side approach, saying that the strategy had been a "failure." Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush, even referred to Reagan's policies as "voodoo economics." Bush felt impelled to significantly increase taxes. As such, economists are extremely concerned, regardless of their political affiliations, that Trumponomics could end just as disastrously as Reaganomics in the long term -- with enormous budget deficits, an even more rapidly shrinking middle class and a deeply wounded economy. Perhaps even with a stock market crash. Nikolaus von Bomhard, chairman of the board at the reinsurance giant Munich Re, believes the recent stock market upturn to be excessive. He finds it particularly regrettable that "a part of the price movements will prove expensive, coming at the cost of engagement against climate change and its consequences." He says that if Trump expands infrastructure investments and reduces taxes while pursuing protectionism at the same time, it will drive sovereign debt and inflation in addition to the desired economic growth. "There will be huge disappointment," says Edmund Phelps, a Nobel laureate for economics and director of the Center on Capitalism and Society at Columbia University. He warns that a "deep recession," could result. The worse the U.S. economy, the more likely Trump will be to target his putative enemies from abroad. His policies are likely to become more aggressive, including punitive measures against foreign "dumping" and attacks on all those companies who build their new factories in Mexico instead of Milwaukee. Peter Navarro, a professor at the University of California in Irvine, is responsible for developing these policies. He is head of the newly created National Trade Council. Navarro is an outsider in several different ways. He is the only economist on the president's team. And he is almost the only economist in the U.S. who fundamentally believes that free trade is a bad idea and who favors tough punitive tariffs. China is a danger, says Navarro, a country that doesn't play by the rules. He even produced a documentary film called "Death by China." 1 | 2 Next Part 1: Trump's Attack on Germany and the Global Economy Part 2: German Automakers at Risk Article...

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo SEATTLE Boeing Co (BA.N) and its largest union said on Friday they had agreed on a February date for a union vote at Boeing's jetliner factory in South Carolina, setting up what is likely to be a fresh battle between the union and the world's biggest plane maker. International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers spokesman Mike Evans said in a statement that about 2,850 workers at the factory that builds 787 Dreamliners would be eligible to vote on union representation in the Feb. 15 ballot. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said the company is "strongly encouraging all eligible teammates, roughly 3,000, to be sure to vote." The machinists canceled an earlier vote set for April 2015 citing a "a toxic environment" and violations of workers' rights to organize, in the strongly anti-union state. At the time, union organizers described the decision as a tactical move, allowing time to build union support. Boeing called the union's allegations of intimidation "frivolous." South Carolina is a state where employees are not required to join unions or pay dues. It has among the lowest rates of union membership in the United States. Evans, in the statement, cited fresh "intimidation tactics" against organizing by Boeing. Boeing said it has hired a lawyer it used when workers tried to unionize in 2015. "Boeing is applying the appropriate resources to protect the competitive advantage created by the Boeing South Carolina (BSC) team," the company said in a statement.

Image: AP By Brett Williams2017-01-27 23:28:04 UTC Over the past few days, some of the biggest questions about our national cybersecurity have centered on one device: President Donald Trump's phone.  Shortly after he reportedly traded in his main Twitter machine, an old-model, unsecured Android phone, for a "secure, encrypted device approved by the Secret Service," the famously tech averse executive appeared to still be using the unsecured device. This made waves in intelligence and security circles, as the risks of the president of the United States using a potentially vulnerable device are extensive.     We know about Trump's Android fixation — but what about the specialized presidential handset he might be stiffing? SEE ALSO: Trump's cyber advisor didn't know about Signal According to an exclusive report from Defense One, that device is a modified Boeing Black, a super secure Android device for Top Secret data designed to self-destruct at the first sign of tampering. The presidential model was developed by Boeing and the Defense Department Information Systems Agency (DISA) and “goes with the office,” per DISA officials speaking to Defense One on background. The phone has limited functionality, opting instead for a locked-down, heavily encrypted user experience. When Boeing filed plans for the Black with the FCC in 2014, the device supported two SIM cards and functionality on GSM, WCDMA and LTE networks, along with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.  According to statements made by DISA chief Lt. General Alan Lynn, the presidential version of the Black "has a large amount of encryption tied to it" and is “close to a VDI,” or Virtual Desktop Infrastructure. This means the phone acts more like an extended viewer of another device, displaying the data kept there rather than storing any potentially vulnerable information itself.  Defense One's sources claim that two of the secure devices were in the hands of high-level personnel, then-President Obama and Cyber Command head Admiral Mike Rogers. It's not a stretch to imagine its the device that Obama described as a toy phone in an interview with Jimmy Fallon (jump to the 2:30 mark in the clip). If President Trump is in fact still tweeting from a personal device (as evidence from his timeline and reports seem to corroborate), it's unlikely he has adopted the Boeing Black full time. After all, that type of secure system won't run Twitter — and the president has made it clear he will continue using the platform no matter what, even if he destroys it.   Maybe that's the only way to get Trump on a secure network: If you can find a way to support Twitter, he might just pick it up.

After weeks of unease across trading floors, investors around the world have refound the optimism that fuelled a surge in the two months after Donald Trump was elected president. The latest lease of life comes after the tycoon signed a series of executive orders pushing his pro-growth agenda, including giving the green light to two huge, controversial oil pipeline deals through the United States. There are hopes he will press on with other promises to ramp up infrastructure spending, cut taxes and do away with various regulations he considers a hindrance to businesses. Added to this were a series of upbeat earnings reports from big-name firms including Boeing and United Technologies. In New York the Dow ended above 20,000 for the first time in its history, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed at all-time highs as investors shift back to higher-yielding investments and away from safe bets such as bonds. Asian dealers tracked their counterparts on Thursday, with Tokyo ending 1.8 percent higher. Hong Kong added 1.4 percent and Shanghai gained 0.3 percent on the last day before a week-long Lunar New Year break. Seoul jumped 0.8 percent and Singapore 0.4 percent, while Wellington, Manila and Jakarta also pushed upwards. Sydney was closed for a public holiday. In early European trade London and Paris rose 0.3 percent while Frankfurt put on 0.5 percent. "The US economy is doing well, corporate earnings are good and it looks like Mr Trump´s policies will keep improving the economy," Mitsushige Akino, an executive officer at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. in Tokyo, told Bloomberg News. "With bond yields increasing, we´re seeing gradual moves from bonds to risk assets." The dollar recovered from recent losses against its major peers although it is struggling to break out of tight band as investors mull comments from Trump and his nominee for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin that the unit is too strong and could hurt the US economy. "We may have underestimated... investor sentiment towards Mnuchin and Trump´s comments on the dollar," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA, in a note. "Of course, this does not mean it´s open season to sell dollars; it is certainly weighing on sentiment as there is little dollar appeal in the markets." The US unit´s general weakness also saw it tumble more than two percent against the Mexican peso despite news Trump had ordered work to begin on planning and building a wall along the US-Mexico border. The dollar bought a little more than 21 pesos Thursday, well down from the record levels above 22 pesos touched earlier this month.   0 0 Asian markets’ rally extends after Wall Street records was posted in Business of TheNews International - https://www.thenews.com.pk on January 27, 2017 and was last updated on January 27, 2017.

In his second presidential TV interview, he told Fox News anchor Sean Hannity that he was keen to keep as many of his election promises as he can. Some of them are already in motion, including his push for a wall to be built on the US-Mexican border. “The wall is necessary its not just politics,” President Trump said. “People want protection.” President Trump also reiterated his comments he made during his TV interview yesterday with ABC anchor David Muir, where he stressed the need to have better “vetting” of people coming into the US. “We’re going to have extreme vetting for people coming into our country,” he said. .@POTUS: “How can you vet somebody when you don’t know anything about them and you have no papers? … You can’t.” #Hannity pic.twitter.com/xl9UBCqWEO— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 27, 2017 “You look at Nice ... Germany it’s a mess, the crime is incredible ... and we’re just not going to let that happen here.” “The whole world is angry right now. There are such problems in the world and such anger.” President Trump told Hannity that the FBI had 1000 ongoing investigations, involving “people who were let in”. “We don’t need this,” he said. “We take in tens of thousands of people, we know nothing about them.” When asked about terrorism and Islamic State, President Trump described their recruits as “sneaky dirty rats”. “They are bad people,” he said. “They’re sneaky, dirty rats and they blow people up in a shopping centre and they blow people up in a church.” “We are fighting sneaky rats right now that are sick and demented. And we’re going to win.” .@POTUS: “Some people have come in with evil intentions, most haven’t I guess, but we can’t take chances.” #Hannity pic.twitter.com/cxnHFLGnsN— Fox News (@FoxNews) January 27, 2017 On relations with other foreign superpowers, President Trump said he is expected to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin about China soon. When given the nuclear launch codes, he described it as “serious stuff”. “When you see the kind of destruction that explained to you, you realise getting along with people is a good thing,” he added. “If we can get along with Russia that’s a good thing.” President Trump also took Hannity inside the Oval Office, where he showed him a small bust of former US President Abraham Lincoln, before he pointed out the bust of Martin Luther King Jr was still there, despite earlier reports it had been removed.

He said he liked the desk, which he chose from around seven others. ‘Look at my desk. Papers. You don’t see presidents with that on their desk,” he said. “We’ve had a lot of great presidents use this desk,” he said. Hannity even asked him about his desk phone, and he replied: “I have great phones, the technology we have in this country is great.” President Trump’s desk that he chose for the Oval Office.

Two US-based companies, General Dynamics Corp’s Electric Boat division and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ Newport News Shipbuilding, build the Navy’s nuclear-powered submarines. Trump, who took office on Friday, made increasing military spending a key part of his campaign. President Trump defends himself, saying he will try to keep his election promises on Fox News.

In December, Trump received a pledge from the chief executive of Lockheed Martin to cut the cost of the controversial F-35 fighter jet after Trump complained in a tweet about the plane’s price tag and said he would ask Boeing to offer a cheaper alternative. President Trump took Sean Hannity from Fox News into the White House. Picture: SuppliedSource:Supplied President Trump has also railed against Madonna’s controversial comments at last weekend’s women’s march. The singer attracted criticism for using profanities while addressing the marchers and saying she had thought about “blowing up the White House”. “Honestly, she’s disgusting. I think she hurt herself very badly. I think she hurt that whole cause,” he said. He also said it was a “disgrace” for a Saturday Night Live writer to criticise his young son Barron on Twitter. “For NBC to attack my 10-year-old son ... it’s a disgrace,” he said SNL writer Katie Rich was suspended indefinitely for the tweet and has since apologised. TRUMP TO CREATE ‘GREAT WALL’ TARIFF President Trump will ask US Congress to impose a 20 per cent tax on all Mexican goods to pay for the construction of a wall on the border. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters travelling with Trump aboard air force One that the move would be part of the beginning of a process of widespread tax reform. “By doing it we can do $10 billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone. That’s really going to provide the funding,” he said. But later, Spicer tried to take back his earlier comments by saying the 20 per cent tax is one of several options under consideration and Trump hasn’t settled on it as the way to recoup construction costs for building the wall. Mexico supplies $US21 billion worth of agricultural produce — mostly fruit, vegetables and alcohol — to the US each year. It’s also the third largest source of US goods imports. Such a tax would likely make price rises inevitable. “We are probably the only major country that doesn’t treat imports this way,” Spicer said to justify the move. “This gets us in line frankly with the policies that other countries around the world treat our products.” However, the removal of such tariffs has been a major part of international trade development in recent decades. Trump has previously argued for a 20 per cent tax on all imports to the United States, regardless of their origins. Last year he told the New York Times that he wanted a 45 per cent tariff on all Chinese imports.

Picture: AFPSource:AFP BORDER CHIEF FORCED TO RESIGN The man charged with protecting America’s borders was ousted today, one day after President Donald Trump announced ambitious plans to build a massive wall at the Mexican border and bolster the ranks of the Border Patrol. Border Patrol Chief Mark Morgan said he was asked to leave and decided to resign rather than fight the request, according to a US official with knowledge of the brief video conference in which Morgan informed senior agents of the change. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussion was not intended to be made public. The forced resignation leaves Trump with a leadership gap but also gives him a chance to start fresh with a Border Patrol chief of his own choosing. Border security and a “big beautiful wall” paid for by the Mexican government were centrepieces of Trump’s immigration platform during his presidential campaign. Boys play on a border fence between Mexico and the US in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico. US President Donald Trump on Thursday told Mexico's president to cancel an upcoming visit to Washington if he is unwilling to foot the bill for a border wall. Picture: AFPSource:AFP MEXICAN STANDOFF OVER WALL Mexico is willing to talk with the United States in order to maintain good relations, but paying for President Trump’s border wall “is not negotiable,” Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said. “There are things that are not negotiable, things that cannot and will not be negotiated. The fact that it is being said that Mexico should pay for the wall is something that is simply not negotiable,” Videgaray said during a press conference at the Mexican embassy in Washington. The news of the proposed tariff hike to pay for the wall came after Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto cancelled a meeting with the US President that had been set for next week. Mr Trump jumped on Twitter overnight to demand that his Mexican counterpart should cancel his upcoming visit to Washington if his country refuses to pay for a wall along the border. “The US has a 60 billion dollar (AU$80 billion) trade deficit with Mexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers ... of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting,” Mr Trump said on Twitter. The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with Mexico.

If Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017 Mr Pena Neito showed that he has also mastered Twitter, sending out a tweet to alert Mr Trump that he is not longer coming. “This morning we have informed the White House that I will not attend the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with the POTUS,” Mr Pena Nieto tweeted. At a press conference after the Mexican President’s tweet, Mr Trump said that it would’ve been “fruitless” for Mr Nieto to come for talks if Mexico is unwilling to pay for the wall. “The president of Mexico and myself have agreed to cancel our planned meeting scheduled for next week,” Mr Trump told Republican politicians at a retreat in Philadelphia. “Unless Mexico is going to treat the United States fairly with respect, such a meeting would be fruitless, and I want to go a different route. I have no choice.” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell says Congress is moving ahead with plans for the wall which would cost $US12 billion to $US15 billion ($16 billion to $20 billion). Senator McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan did not say how Congress would pay for the wall that Mr Trump has vowed to build. “We anticipate a supplemental (budget) coming from the administration,” Mr Ryan said. “The point is we’re going to finance the Secure Fence Act.” The tweet came after Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said his talks in Washington DC with a key trade adviser to Mr Trump over the future of bilateral commerce had shown the US side was receptive to Mexico’s point of view. Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto, left, and then Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shake hands. Picture: APSource:AP Mr Guajardo told Mexican television he had held long talks with Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro on Wednesday on how the two countries should seek to modernise the NAFTA trade agreement sensibly, and how to avoid obstacles to free trade. The talks had shown the US side was receptive to what Mexico had to say, Mr Guajardo said. STATE DEPARTMENT HEADS ‘ASKED TO LEAVE’ It came as the entire senior management team of the US State department submitted their resignations as new Secretary Rex Tillerson takes up his post. Despite reports of mass resignations, CNN says two of the four top State Department officials who are leaving have told it that they were asked to go. Among the four top-level staff to leave is Patrick Kennedy, who was widely tipped to become Tillerson’s No. 2 at the department. Mr Trump, who nominated the ex oil tycoon to the key cabinet position, is reportedly seeking to ‘clean house’. Former Exxon Mobil Corp chairman Rex Tillerson was granted to take over the Secretary of State role by the Senate foreign relations committee from Democrat John Kerry last week. He still has to receive approval from the full Senate, but this is widely expected. Former ExxonMobil executive Rex Tillerson is set to be Secretary of State. Picture: AFPSource:AFP Senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy has quit now Rex Tillerson is set to be in charge. Picture: GettySource:Supplied Kerry’s former chief of staff David Wade told the Washington Post: “It’s the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that’s incredibly difficult to replicate”. Among those confirmed to be leaving are Gregory Starr, Assistant Secretary for State for Diplomatic Security, Michele Bond, Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs and Tom Countryman, the acting undersecretary for arms control and international security. “These retirements are a big loss. They leave a void. These are very difficult people to replace”, Wade told the paper. TRUMP ISSUES AUSTRALIA DAY MESSAGE Mr Trump has sent an Australia Day message, declaring America has no better friend than Australia. The message was delivered by acting Secretary of State Thomas Shannon Jr and comes just days after Trump killed America’s participation in the trans-Pacific Partnership with Australia and other allies and as he considers whether to make it harder for Australians and Kiwis to travel to the US. “On behalf of President Trump and the American people, it is my honour to congratulate the people of Australia as you celebrate this Australia Day, 229 years after the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Harbour,” Shannon Jr said in a statement. “It has been over 75 years since your commonwealth and the United States established diplomatic relations, but connections between America and Australia reach back to that fleet.” The Los Angeles Times revealed on Wednesday that Trump, in tightening up America’s borders, is considering ending the visa waiver program that allows Australians, New Zealanders and citizens of 36 other nations, including many close allies in Europe, to easily visit the US on 90-day tourist visas.

On Wednesday, the Dow rallied above 20,000 thanks to a strong uptick in financial and healthcare stocks. The Dow's recent ascent to 20,000 was the second-fastest 1,000-point move in market history at 42 days. That is the fastest since the 59-session span between March and July 2007. It is second only to the 1,000-point gain registered in 24 days back in 1999. Let's look at the numbers from Wednesday for the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq:  Dow Jones: 20,068.51; 155.80; +0.78%  S&P 500: 2,298.37; 18.30; +0.80%  Nasdaq: 5,656.34; 55.38; +0.99%  Here's a look at today's most important market events and stocks, plus a look at Thursday's economic calendar. What's Ahead for the Dow Jones Industrial Average Today The Dow Jones Industrial Average projected a 46-point gain as global markets continue to push higher in the wake of the index's surge past 20,000. It has been a remarkable run for the markets in recent weeks. The rally has been fueled by three key U.S. blue-chip stocks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) has accounted for 379 points of the Dow's surge since the election. Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), which crushed Wall Street earnings expectations Wednesday, has added 172 points to the Dow during that span. Finally, International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) has added 158 points. The three stocks have accounted for roughly 40% of the Dow's gains. Trending: These Are 5 of the Best Stocks to Buy in 2017 Thursday will feature a busy round of earnings reports and economic data. Keep an eye on weekly jobless claims and the monthly report on new home sales. Should the latter report surpass economists' expectations, look for shares of KB Home (NYSE: KBH) and Toll Brothers Inc. (NYSE: TOL) to show gains. On the international front, investors are eyeing statements by British Prime Minister Theresa May about global trade and her country's pending exit from the European Union. May will meet with President Trump to discuss bilateral trade and address senior Republicans on a range of global issues. May has pledged to rekindle the special relationship between the UK and the United States with the goal to "lead, together, again." In silver investment news, the price of silver has been sliding since the election. The price is down again Wednesday morning as investors continue to shift capital back toward equities.  However, there are a few factors setting up silver to be one of the top investments of 2017. Money Morning Resource Specialist Peter Krauth has predicted a 30% surge in the silver price this year. Here's what you need to know and how to position your investments. Don't Miss: A Gold Price Prediction for the Coming Bull Run: $5,236 an Ounce Crude oil prices were ticking higher thanks to a weakening U.S. dollar. The downturn in the greenback offset concerns about rising supplies in the United States. On Wednesday, the Energy Information Administration announced a much larger uptick in domestic crude inventories. The WTI crude oil price today added 0.8%. Brent crude dipped 0.8%. But the big story is President Donald Trump. The president has taken swift action on a number of social and economic issues in the last three days. In addition to paying the way for the construction of a massive border wall and the installation of several major pipeline projects, the president has been speculating on his next major announcement: his nominee for the vacancy on the Supreme Court. On Jan. 24 at the White House, President Trump announced he had "a number of outstanding candidates" for the open Justice of the Supreme Court position. So who will Trump nominate for Supreme Court? According to CNN, these are Trump's top picks for Supreme Court… Stocks to Watch Today, Jan. 26, 2017: In deal news, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced it planned to purchase Swiss pharmaceutical giant Actelion Ltd. (OTCMKTS: ALIOF) for $30 billion. In earnings news, shares of Western Digital Corp. (NYSE: WDC) hit a 52-week high Wednesday before retreating after the bell. The semiconductor giant easily topped profit and revenue expectations in the second quarter. The uptick in growth came thanks to stabilization of the global PC market and a surge in cloud-services sales. Meanwhile, shares of AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) were ticking slightly higher in pre-market hours after the telecom giant matched Wall Street profit expectations and fell just short of consensus revenue forecasts. Keep an eye out for additional earnings reports from Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC), Alphabet Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOGL), Ford Motor Co. (NYSE: F), Starbucks Corp. (Nasdaq: SBUX), VMware Inc. (NYSE: VMW), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), Paypal Inc.

We do want peace,” Trump said in a ceremony at the Pentagon. Trump predicted that Congress, which sets the expenditures for the government, will “be very happy to see” the White House’s new spending request for the military. He made clear during last year’s presidential campaign and in recent weeks that he wants to enlarge the ranks of the military services and expand its fleets of aircraft and ships. For example, he said he envisions a naval fleet of 350 vessels, up from the navy’s current 274 and more than its 310 vessel target. And Trump excluded the military from a hiring freeze across the rest of the government that he ordered just after being inaugurated on Jan. 20. He is also expected to order his new defense secretary, James Mattis, to intensify operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria with more U.S. soldiers and military hardware like artillery and attack helicopters. Another expected move is to review and the strengthen the country’s ability to defend itself against cyberattacks and to conduct offensive cyberattacks itself. The order Trump signed Friday was less specific, calling for a sweeping 30-day readiness review of the U.S. military, with the aim of preparing new budget requests to improve readiness. But he has also pressured the Pentagon to cut costs on some of its most expensive programs. Earlier, Mattis ordered financial reviews of the costs of two major defense programs — the $400 billion F-35 fighter jet project and the $4 billion development of a new Air Force One presidential jet. Trump had complained that both were too costly. The Pentagon needs to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” of the F-35 program, Mattis said, even weighing the competitiveness of the rival F-18. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin, while the F-18 is built by Boeing. At the same time, Mattis ordered a similar review of the $4 billion cost for developing a new aircraft for the U.S. president, Air Force One, the ultra-high-tech and secure 747 built by Boeing. “The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program is a critical acquisition program that warrants a detailed assessment to reduce associated program costs,” Mattis said in the order. He said the deputy secretary of defense will oversee the review to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” while ensuring the new jets, which cost about $100 million each, meet U.S. defense needs. In December, Trump assailed both the F-35 and Air Force One programs as overly costly, and after that met with the chief executives of Lockheed Martin and Boeing to try to extract savings. “The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases,” Trump said on Twitter at the time. The first 200 F-35s of a program that envisions some 2,450 ultimately being acquired by the different U.S. armed services have been delivered. The aircraft have also been sold to Israel, with the first two delivered in December. The first overseas-based F-35Bs arrived at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi Prefecture on Jan. 18, according to the U.S. Marine Corps. Proponents tout the F-35’s radar-dodging stealth technology, supersonic speeds, close air-support capabilities, airborne agility and a massive array of sensors giving pilots unparalleled access to information.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print President Trump has selected the chief executive officer of Dana Inc. to join an advisory council that will focus on boosting jobs in the manufacturing sector. Jim Kamsickas, who runs the global automotive parts firm based in Maumee, was one of 28 business and labor leaders the White House named Friday for the newly announced Manufacturing Jobs Initiative. Administration officials said the President would look to the group for insight in the coming months as part of his broader job creation agenda. RELATED CONTENT: White House press release on Manufacturing Jobs Initiative Jim Kamsickas, CEO of Dana Holding Corp., has been named to a business advisory council by President Donald Trump. The Blade/Andy Morrison Enlarge | Buy This Image “President Trump plans to continually seek information and perspectives from a diverse range of business leaders ... on how best to promote job growth and get Americans back to work again,” the White House said. Mr. Kamsickas, who took over as Dana’s president and CEO in mid 2015, will join leaders from some of the United States’ best-known firms. The White House said early efforts have been led by Andrew Liveris, CEO of Dow Chemical. The list also included CEOs from Ford, Whirlpool, General Electric, U.S. Steel, and Boeing.  Also joining the initiative are two officials from the AFL-CIO, including President Richard Trumka — a frequent critic of Mr. Trump during the election. Mr. Kamsickas was traveling Friday and was not available for an interview. However, he did provide a statement to The Blade. “I look forward to be working with some of the nation’s most innovative and successful business leaders as we explore opportunities to promote job growth,” he said. “It is a true honor to serve our country as we work together to develop strategic initiatives for expanding American manufacturing.” Bringing back manufacturing jobs was a constant campaign promise for Mr. Trump, and he’s shown no change in focus since winning the election. However, significantly increasing the number of U.S. manufacturing jobs is a tall task. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million.  While the number remained relatively stable for the next two decades, manufacturing employment has decreased significantly since 2000. The agency’s data show manufacturing employment fell from 17.2 million at the end of 2000 to 12.3 million at the end of last year. That represents a decrease of more than 28 percent. Still, many are hopeful that progress can be made. Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and one of the members of the advisory council, said industry is looking forward to an opportunity to share thoughts on what can be done to strengthen manufacturing. “There’s a lot of policy work that needs to be done,” he told The Blade. “Rebuilding American infrastructure, reforming trade policies, having a made in America-friendly tax code, those are some of the things at the top of my list, along with a workforce training system that recognizes the value of manufacturing.” Mr. Paul noted that these types of blue-ribbon panels aren’t new — most recent administrations have had some manufacturing focus group — though he’s hopeful the new initiative can help shape policy. One of the first things to come up may be U.S. policy on import tariffs.  The Trump Administration has, for example, floated the idea of a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports. “I imagine that each of the companies and labor leaders and myself will be giving candid advice to the administration about what we think will work and what we think may be a challenge,” Mr. Paul said. The White House did not detail how frequently the group may meet.  Officials said they would not seek policy reports from the group, but mostly individual opinions and knowledge.

Here day breaks over the White House Friday on the day that President Donald Trump met his first world leader since taking office, British Prime Minister Theresa May, who hopes to nudge the populist president towards the political mainstream. Pablo Martinez Monsivais AP i By Mimi Whitefield mwhitefield@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story One word can sum up the global economic outlook for 2017: uncertainty. Cybersecurity, an open internet, potential protectionism, a collapse in confidence in institutions and the impact on other countries if Washington under President Donald Trump pursues a more isolationist policy are among the risks and challenges facing world economies this year, panelists said Friday at a conference organized by WorldCity, a Coral Gables media and trade data company. “What makes us most anxious is the uncertainty,” said Donna Hrinak, president of Boeing Latin America and the Caribbean, during the conference at the Coral Gables Country Club. In Latin America, signs point to a potential uptick in the economies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, said Eric Farnsworth, who heads the Washington Office of the Council of the Americas and the Americas Society. Any recovery from the commodity crash, even if “tepid,” is good, he said. But “what’s going on in Washington will help determine the international policy environment,” Farnsworth said. If Latin American economies are challenged as a result of actions in Washington, it could affect 2018 elections. Among countries where elections are scheduled are Costa Rica, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay. Already Trump has signed an executive order calling for the construction of a wall on the border with Mexico, withdrawn the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and said he wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. But it’s still unclear how the president’s foreign policy will play out. Uncertainty “generates a global paralysis. It’s a wait and see game,” said Magdalena Ramada, a senior economist at Towers Watson, a global risk management, insurance brokerage and advisory company. That waiting game, she said, could dominate most of 2017. If the United States decides to play a lesser role in Latin America, “other countries are going to step into that void,” Farnsworth said. And the most likely candidate, he said, is China. While China may contribute money, investment and political support, it brings “different values and different ways of conducting business” than the United States, he said. A digitally connected world cuts both ways, said Ramada. While information flow improves, “risks are more interconnected today.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story International Business Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:04 Haiti's President-elect Jovenel Moise talks about his love for Les Cayes Pause 0:46 Protesters of all ages, races, faiths decry President Trump 2:15 Kids ask Mayor Gimenez to make Miami-Dade a sanctuary county 1:17 White House: Funding to sanctuary cities a 'taxpayer issue' 0:37 Protestors demand entry to a sealed-off lobby at Miami-Dade's County Hall 1:57 Group fights to preserve Miami's Little Havana section 2:11 Protesters erupt at downtown government center in Miami 1:31 New bodycam shows Miami-Dade police officers at Martin Luther King Day shooting 0:36 Naika Venant's mother: I have to bury my baby 1:57 Did Florida overpay for private prison contract?

The IAM and the Boeing Co. came to an agreement on the date and time of an election today, January 27. “It’s a great day for Boeing South Carolina employees and the entire Charleston community,” said IAM Lead Organizer Mike Evans. “On February 15, they’ll have the opportunity to have a democratic vote on their future. A ‘union yes’ vote will mean a higher standard of living for Boeing South Carolina employees and more money in the local economy. “The workers here have already been up against a flurry of intimidation tactics from the company and an anti-union law firm. We urge Boeing to change course and do what they’ve stated publicly—‘take the high road’—and allow for an election free of threats and the deliberate spread of misinformation. Boeing workers will vote on February 15, and we hope to welcome them to the IAM family then.” The IAM is the U.S.’s largest aerospace union, representing approximately 600,000 members at the likes of Lockheed Martin, General Electric and United Technologies. The IAM represents more than 35,000 Boeing employees at 24 locations nationwide. For more information about the campaign visit BoeingWorkers.com.

Slated for use by the Israeli Air Force, the system was originally tested in 2015 and was designed to neutralize projectiles with a range of 60-125 miles, such as those used by Hezbollah, a militant Shi'a group backed by Iran. After testing, the Jewish News Services quoted US Missile Defense Agency director Vice Admiral Jim Syring saying, "This test campaign is a critical step in ensuring Israel has the capability to defend itself from a very real and growing threat," adding that Washington remains "strongly committed to supporting Israel's development of a missile defense system." US arms-maker Raytheon and Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems is developing the not-yet-operational system, to fill a gap between the US-funded Arrow ballistic-missile interceptor and the Iron Dome short-range rocket interceptor program, both of which are currently in service. Developed by Boeing and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries, the Iron Dome interceptor network was used with much success against Hamas in the 2014 Gaza War. Moshe Patel of Israel's Missile Defense Organization said that Wednesday's testing included intercepting an air-launched test missile, and noted that "The tests were intended to simulate anticipated future threats and in the coming years our system will deliver to the Israeli air force more capabilities and more confidence." According to the Jerusalem Post, the testing occurred under a media blackout, with the Defense Ministry stating, "The success of the test is part of the development on the future threat deterrence system…During the series of tests, after incoming missile detection, the MMR (multi-missile radar) located the targets and transferred the data to the central firing program, which calculated interception protocols." © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Reuters A file photo of US President Donald Trump. Photo: AP Following are the key highlights of the day for US President Donald Trump’s administration on Friday Foreign relations Trump, scheduled to speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday, says he is in the early stages of considering whether to lift US sanctions on Russia, but British Prime Minister Theresa May, other foreign officials and US lawmakers say such a move would be premature. The United States’ and Mexico’s leaders speak by phone after relations between the two countries frayed further over Trump’s border wall plan, with the US president calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties. Nikki Haley, the new US ambassador to the United Nations, pledges to overhaul the world body and warns US allies that if they do not support Washington, then she is “taking names” and will respond. Immigration Trump signs an executive order he says will impose tighter vetting to prevent foreign terrorists from entering the United States. Trump says Syrian Christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status in the United States. Trump’s executive order taking away federal funding from “sanctuary cities” has an exemption for one of his favourite constituencies, the police, who would be protected from cuts. Opponents say that could be grounds for a legal challenge. Abortion Vice President Mike Pence fires up tens of thousands of anti-abortion activists in Washington for the 44th March for Life, celebrating a political shift in their favour with Trump’s election. Election Pence reportedly tells Republicans a “full evaluation of voting rules” will likely be part of the Trump administration’s investigation into what the president claims is widespread voting fraud. Defence spending Defence secretary James Mattis orders cost-cutting reviews of two major aircraft programs, Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet and Boeing’s next-generation Air Force One presidential plane, according to Pentagon memos. Cabinet Trump’s Cabinet is worth a combined $14 billion, and they have been catching flak in recent weeks for confessing an inability to keep track of their vast wealth. Pipeline Trump’s move to revive the Keystone XL oil pipeline is part of his plan to boost US drillers and create new US jobs, but the project’s biggest winners may be Canadian.

On Thursday, Mattis sent two memorandums for Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to review the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to “determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost of the F-35 program while meeting requirements.”  BREAKING: Defense Secretary Mattis orders review of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and Air Force One programs pic.twitter.com/VFJ7qke2Y9— Marcus Weisgerber (@MarcusReports) January 27, 2017 Mattis also directed Work to compare the capabilities and costs of F-35 to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, to determine what improvements can be made “to provide a competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” After Mattis was sworn in by Trump, Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis released a statement to the DOD website that explained the purpose of the separate reviews was to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions,” and provide the president with recommendations on critical military capabilities. “This action is also consistent with the president’s guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation’s defense,” Davis wrote in the statement, “and it aligns with the secretary’s priority to increase military readiness while gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense.” READ MORE: US F-35 fighter jets arrive at military base in Japan in 1st overseas deployment  The memos did not specify if the review would reduce the number of aircraft that were planned. In a separate memo from Mattis, Work was ordered to review the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR), otherwise known as the Air Force One program, to “substantially reduce the program’s costs while delivering needed capabilities.” Mattis said the review of the PAR program should “identify specific areas where costs can be lowered,” including “autonomous operations, aircraft power generation, environmental conditioning [cooling], survivability, and military/civilian communication capabilities.” Before taking office, Trump criticized the budgets of both the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and PAR program, which he promised to reduce. The government contracts to build two new Air Force One planes were expected to cost $4 billion by 2024, while the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program has been criticized as one of the most expensive weapon systems ever created, with an estimated cost of $1 trillion for 2,457 aircraft by 2038, according to the Government Accountability Office. Following a tweet that Trump posted calling costs for the Air Force One planes “out of control,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with Trump and promised he would build the planes for less. Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 6, 2016 Trump also tweeted about the contracts that Lockheed had with the government over the construction of F-35, saying, “Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military.” The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016 After their meeting at Trump Tower in New York, Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson said that she would not only work to make the fighter jets at the “lowest possible price,” he would also plans to add 1,800 jobs at its plant in Fort Worth, Texas, where the F-35s are built.

By Larry Mahoney, BDN Staff Posted Jan. 27, 2017, at 10:38 p.m. ORONO, Maine — University of Maine junior center Cedric Lacroix’s power-play goal with 11:27 left in the third period restored a two-goal lead and momentum, and the Black Bears received an insurance goal from Patrick Shea later in the period en route to a 4-1 Hockey East over the University of Massachusetts at Alfond Arena on Friday night. UMaine improved to 9-13-3 overall and 3-9-1 in Hockey East, while UMass fell to 5-18-2 and 2-10-1. The teams began the evening in the Hockey East cellar. They will play again at 7 p.m. Saturday. Danny Perez and Nolan Vesey staked UMaine to a 2-0 lead in the first period, but William Lagesson’s goal 52 seconds into the third period cut the lead in half as his screened wrister from the left point sailed past the glove of UMaine goalie Rob McGovern. The Minutemen buzzed the net looking for an equalizer, but McGovern made a terrific save on Ray Pigozzi’s rebound attempt and caught a break when Steve Iacobellis rang his rebound off the post. Lacroix expanded the lead at the 8:33 mark when he took a pass from Vesey and threw the puck on net from an acute angle and then pounced on his own rebound and jammed it past UMass goalie Ryan Wischow. Shea provided valuable insurance when he chased down his own rebound and swatted it home. UMass had an edge in play as the Minutemen used their quickness to cycle the puck in the UMaine zone. But the Minutemen entered the game tied for 58th among 60 teams in goals per game at two per game and the Black Bears were opportunistic. McGovern finished with 28 saves in a quality performance, while Wischow wound up with 27. The Black Bears were fortunate to be leading after the first period because the Minutemen carried the play and had much more sustained offensive zone pressure. UMass generated 16 Grade-A (high-percentage) scoring opportunities to UMaine’s seven. McGovern stopped all 13 shots he faced including, nine of the Grade-A variety, while Wischow had just four saves and only one Grade-A stop. University of Minnesota transfer Robin Hoglund, who became eligible for the second semester but had only played in the exhibition game against the United States National Team Development Program’s Under-18 team, set up Perez’s goal. Hoglund hunted down the puck behind the net and fed it to the top of the crease, and Perez was able to jam it home. The goal snapped a 15-game pointless streak for Perez. Vesey expanded the lead 4:59 later off a Patrick Shea face-off win to the left of Wischow. Vesey wheeled briefly with the puck before snapping a wrist shot that squeezed through Wischow’s pads with Cedric Lacroix setting the screen. Vesey’s goal was his fourth over the last five games. UMass had a goal disallowed later in the period during a wild flurry when it was ruled that UMass’ Niko Hildenbrand had interfered with McGovern. McGovern was lying on the ice and Hildenbrand was on top of him when Marc Hetnik fired it home from the left faceoff circle. McGovern preserved the lead with a minute left in the period when he got his glove on Brett Boeing’s backhander after Boeing broke in down the left wing. Wischow was the busier of the two goalies in the free-wheeling second period and came up with seven Grade-A saves among his 10 as the Black Bears held a 10-8 shot margin. He kept the Minutemen within two late in the period when he slid across to smother Peter Housakos’ shorthanded breakaway. UMass, which entered the game with the nation’s second-worst power-play percentage at 10.3 percent, had a two-man advantage spanning 40 seconds early in the second period but couldn’t capitalize. Wischow made a nice save off Vesey’s short wrister early in the period, and McGovern stopped Jake McLaughlin’s shot from the left circle off a two-on-one.   SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« Bangor boys end Hampden Academy’s 62-game home winning streak Next story:Strong start propels UMaine hockey by UMass » View stories by school Please select a school A.R.

See Offers Nation & World Posted January 27 Updated January 27 increase font size Defense Secretary Mattis orders cost reviews for 2 fighter jets Trump targeted costs of the F-35 in tweets and during the campaign. Los Angeles Times Share Comment Read Article Defense Secretary James Mattis has ordered reviews of the Air Force One and F-35 fighter jet programs, two projects that have frequently been in President Trump’s crosshairs. Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said Friday that Mattis ordered separate reviews of both programs to “inform programmatic and budgetary decisions,” as well as his “recommendations to the president regarding critical military capabilities.” JAMES MATTIS Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → In a Thursday memo to the deputy secretary of Defense, Mattis said the review would look for opportunities to “significantly reduce” the cost of the F-35 program while still meeting requirements. As part of that, Mattis said a parallel review would compare the operational capabilities of the F-35C for the Navy, which is designed to withstand the stress of landing on carriers, with the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet. This review would determine whether improvements could be made to an advanced Super Hornet that would provide a “competitive, cost-effective fighter aircraft alternative” to the F-35, the memo said. A separate memo from Mattis ordered a review of the Air Force One program to determine whether costs could be cut. Boeing Co., which builds the iconic presidential 747 aircraft, has several hundred suppliers in the U.S. that support the 747 program. Chicago-based Boeing said in a statement, “We welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with the Trump administration.” Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda, Md., said it was ready to support the review. Since December, Trump has targeted the costs of both the Air Force One and F-35 programs in tweets and speeches. He has met with both Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s chief executives since then. The F-35 has three variants to fit the needs of the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps. Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

While his actual net-worth is a subject for debate, it’s safe to assume that he can afford a new smartphone. Which is why it’s so strange that The Donald continues to use an old Samsung Galaxy S3 – which was first released in 2012 – as the vessel of choice for his ever-deranged twitter shitposting. Android Central analyzed several photos of The Donald using his beloved smartphone, and determined that the phone he is currently using is the Samsung Galaxy S3. This is roughly five years old, and last received an update in mid-2015, when it was updated to Android 4.3 JellyBean. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY While one photograph dating from February 2016 shows the device in use while he was in the midst of his controversial campaign, it’s a bit murky whether the device followed him to the Oval Office. By some accounts, Trump has switched over to a Secret Service-supplied smartphone that’s tightly locked down. However, more recent (and contradictory) accounts reported by The New York Times suggest that Trump continues to use his beloved phone. So, why does this matter? Surely we’ve got bigger things to worry about (like the fact that the human embodiment of an email that starts with “RE:FWD:RE:RE:RE:FWD:FWD” now has his finger on the button) than Trump’s phone of choice, right? It matters because even if you don’t like him, Trump is still president. There’s a huge amount of responsibility on his shoulders. And even if you disagree with him vehemently, what he says matters. We all know what happened when Trump tweeted about the (admittedly expensive) F-35 project, and the upcoming renewal of Air Force One. Shares in Lockheed Martin and Boeing tanked. Imagine the chaos that could happen on the financial markets if a hacker was able to gain access to Donald Trump’s Twitter account and started tweeting things like: “Failing store Wal-Mart sold me a bottle of expired milk. Will apologize or suffer. SAD!” And if Donald Trump is using an ancient, unpatched smartphone, that’s a real possibility. So, please. If anyone from Donald Trump’s team is reading this, can you please get him a new phone? His birthday is in June, but maybe it could be an early present. I know he likes his Galaxy S3, but perhaps he’ll be amenable to the Galaxy S8, which comes out in March. I’m sure Samsung will comp him a pre-release model, what with him being the most powerful man in the world and all.

Mattis asked for a review of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program to find ways to cut costs. He said the review should compare the F-35 with the F/A-18 Super Hornet and determine if an upgraded Hornet could be a cost effective alternative. He also asked for a review of the presidential aircraft program to identify cost savings. The orders mirror tweets by Trump in December, saying that due to cost overruns in Lockheed Martin’s F-35, he asked Boeing to “price-out” a comparable Super Hornet. Trump also tweeted that the new Air Force One cost too much, and he demanded: “Cancel order!” Related Items United States government , Boeing Co , Lockheed Martin Corp , James Mattis , Donald Trump , United States military , U.S. Air Force Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

Eric Greitens made ethics reform and anti-corruption the centerpiece of his administration and his campaign for governor. But he has refused to say how much money was raised for his inaugural festivities, how much was spent, how much each donor chipped in or whether he’ll ever make any of that information public. File photo by The Associated Press 1 of 2 i By Jason Hancock jhancock@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story JEFFERSON CITY A collection of corporations, wealthy donors and lobbyists bankrolled Gov. Eric Greitens’ inaugural celebration earlier this month. But just how much they gave to the new governor may never be made public. That’s because unlike his predecessor, who used a campaign committee to raise money for his inauguration, Greitens formed a nonprofit to seek out donors. Nonprofits aren’t required to disclose their donors and aren’t subject to recently enacted campaign donation limits. Greitens has refused to say how much was raised, how much was spent, how much each donor chipped in or whether he’ll ever make any of that information public. So far, the only thing he’s been willing to share is a list of “benefactors” he says helped finance the inaugural festivities. On the list are some of the state’s largest companies, most of whom have business before the legislature that Greitens may one day have to either sign or veto. The situation has caused heartburn for some, especially given the fact that Greitens made ethics reform and anti-corruption the centerpiece of his administration and his campaign for governor. “I can’t understand how this governor can preach to members of the legislature about corruption, then turn around and behave in a way that most Missourians would say is corrupt,” said state Rep. Michael Butler, a St. Louis Democrat. “He’s taking money from corporations and lobbyists who are trying to get legislation passed, and he won’t tell us how much he’s taking.” Full disclosure is the only way Missouri residents can know for sure that the new administration is free from potential conflicts of interest, said state Sen. Rob Schaaf, a St. Joseph Republican. “Dark money has the potential for corruption,” Schaaf said. “Sunshine helps disinfect. The reason we make people disclose is to prevent corruption.” Greitens did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The Republican governor was elected after a campaign focused largely on his pledge to clean up state government. But his commitment to transparency has always been shaky at best. Greitens’ campaign benefited last year from $6 million in so-called dark money, cash funneled through nonprofits to hide its origin. A federal political action committee called SEALS for Truth cut him a check for $1.9 million in August. It was later revealed the real source of that money was a nonprofit called the American Policy Coalition, which was established by an Ohio attorney whom the Center for Public Integrity labeled the “nexus of one of the nation’s most mysterious networks pouring secret money into elections.” Another federal political action committee, LG PAC, spent $4 million in the GOP primary to help Greitens, with its money coming from a Texas-based nonprofit called Freedom Frontier. In both instances, where the money actually came from will likely never be known. “His campaign took advantage of every big-money loophole in the book,” said John Messmer, a political science professor at St. Louis Community College at Meramec. “And even if you can argue that he violated no laws, his actions clearly suggest a disdain for transparency.” During the campaign, Greitens also refused to release his tax returns. While he was under no legal obligation to do so, his critics said disclosure would help shed light on any possible conflicts of interest, especially considering he earned five-figure speaking fees on the corporate lecture circuit. In December, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch revealed that people serving on Greitens’ transition team were required to sign a gag order. Efforts to obtain records from the transition, which was taxpayer-funded and subject to Missouri’s open-records laws, have met with mixed success. An open-records request filed by The Star on Nov. 29, for example, has still not been fulfilled. Most recently, Greitens has refused to disclose how much the state will be paying Drew Erdmann, who the governor announced shortly after taking office would serve in the new position of chief operating officer. “The only way to make sure the government is doing the people’s work is through transparency, by being able to actually see what our government is doing,” said Jonathan Groves, associate professor of communications at Drury University in Springfield and president of the Missouri Sunshine Coalition. “The best way for (Greitens) to live up to what he said during the campaign would be through radical transparency.” Among the nearly 100 “benefactors” Greitens says helped fund his inauguration were Anheuser-Busch, Boeing, Centene, Enterprise, Express Scripts, Kansas City Power & Light, Kansas City Southern, Monsanto, Pfizer and Wal-Mart. Also listed was Uber. The California-based vehicle-for-hire company is pushing Missouri legislation that would enact regulations Uber thinks would allow it to expand throughout the state. The legislation also would exempt the company from paying local or municipal taxes. Greitens’ inauguration festivities, which included a performance by country music star Sara Evans, appeared to be more elaborate than those of the last two governors. Democrat Jay Nixon and Republican Matt Blunt each spent less than $250,000 on their inaugural celebrations. Missouri’s most expensive inaugural was that of Democratic Gov. Bob Holden, who spent $1 million in 2001. Like Greitens, Holden used a nonprofit to raise money, although he eventually made his fundraising details public. In response to Holden’s inaugural, Republican lawmakers began pushing for legislation requiring disclosure of all future inaugural fundraising and spending. It nearly became law in 2003 but died on the legislative session’s final day when differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill couldn’t be ironed out. Schaaf, the Republican senator from St. Joseph, is sponsoring legislation this year called the Dark Money Disclosure Act, which aims to require certain political nonprofits to disclose where their money comes from. But he doesn’t think his bill would have any impact on inaugural fundraising. “I myself think that should be the law, that the money given for the inauguration and other similar events should be disclosed,” he said. “But I don’t know if my bill would require that. I just never thought about it.” It’s in the public’s interest to know how much individual donors gave to the governor’s inaugural fund, said Jordan Libowitz, spokesman for the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Imagine one donor gave $50,” he said. “Imagine another gave $50,000. Now imagine another donated $5 million. Which one are you most likely to listen to? That’s why transparency is so important. People don’t give huge amounts of money without wanting something in return.” Jason Hancock: 573-634-3565, @J_Hancock Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Government & Politics Suggested for you   Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:41 Trump discusses his hour-long phone call with Mexico's president Pause 11:36 Jesse Newell and Gary Bedore preview Kansas-Kentucky game 1:18 Eric Greitens sworn in as Missouri's 56th governor 3:30 Union pride and the 'right to work' in Missouri 3:33 Tears and cheers at Royals FanFest 2:26 Claire Ryann, 4, and dad sing 'You've Got a Friend In Me' 4:23 Mizzou wrestling coach Brian Smith talks about Tigers' loss to Oklahoma State 1:15 Swimmers plunge into icy Longview Lake waters for Special Olympics 1:25 Prince William and Kate's creepy thank-you to Canada 1:21 Danny Duffy couldn't sleep after learning of Yordano Ventura's death Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago Trump on canceled meeting with Mexico's president 0:26 a day ago Trump on canceled meeting with Mexico's president 1:41 10 hours ago Trump discusses his hour-long phone call with Mexico's president 2:29 a day ago Mexico President Peña Nieto rejects U.S. decision to build wall View more video Government & Politics Kris Kobach weighs run for Kansas governor as likelihood of Washington role fades Missouri Gov.

The industrial average has now risen 9 percent since Election Day. Stronger U.S. economic data and optimism about Trump's business policy, among other factors, have pushed not only the Dow, but also the other major averages and small-cap stocks, higher in that time. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at the Wisconsin State Fair Exposition Center in 2016. Shannon Stapleton | Reuters But risk factors like rising valuations, a potentially strengthening dollar, and climbing interest rates could knock markets back down in the short term, experts said. Stocks have endured a sluggish period since mid-December after the initial post-election rally wore off. Rising — and Sustained — Confidence Experts said Trump's proposals, including corporate tax cuts, repatriation of cash overseas, deregulation and infrastructure spending, give investors enough hope for rising corporate earnings that the Trump enthusiasm may continue well into his administration. "The market is perceiving this as a business-friendly administration that is coming into office for the next four years. It wouldn't take much to give earnings a real boost. I think that's where the market is coming from and I think it will continue," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. While the Dow components are considerably less industrial than they used to be, most of the companies have a lot to gain from Trump's plans. He wants to cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent and has touted that plan in meetings with business executives since he took office. Trump will try to give companies incentives to bring cash back to the United States. Apple, for example, has $216 billion parked abroad. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase would benefit from looser financial regulations, while Exxon Mobil and Chevron could get boosts from easier energy production rules. Trump has already signaled he will be friendly to the oil and gas industry, as on Tuesday he signed executive orders to advance the controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Consumer Spending Caterpillar and Boeing may see big benefits from infrastructure spending. Income tax cuts could push more consumer money to companies such as Walt Disney, Nike, and McDonald's. Those are just some examples of how Trump's proposals could help Dow component companies at a time when U.S. economic data has shown improvement. "I think that all of this together has encouraged investors, given them some semblance of hope," said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at Boston Private Wealth. Still, market watchers said Trump administration policies could get derailed in ways that may quash market optimism. Some plans may not get "enacted with the same order of magnitude as expected" or not get passed "soon enough" to sustain the excitement, said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. For instance, some congressional conservatives have expressed misgivings about the spending binge that Trump has proposed. He has also brought infrastructure up only sparingly since he took office. Related: What Does a Dow 20,000 Mean for Me? While key Republicans in Congress have supported Trump's corporate and personal tax cuts, it remains to be seen if they can pass his desired 15 percent business rate. Even if Trump achieves all of his desired policies, the market could see a pullback before it starts climbing again, strategists added. Major averages fell last month after the Federal Reserve hiked the federal funds rate by a quarter point. The Dow also retreated more than once recently after approaching the 20K mark. Still, strategists said that if the expectations for Trump's pro-business White House become reality, earnings could get enough of a boost to keep pushing stocks higher.

USA TODAY The F-35 (Photo: Staff Sgt. Marleah Robertson, 33rd Fighter Wing/Public Affairs) 9270 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDIN 69 COMMENTEMAILMORE WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has ordered the Pentagon to launch a review on how to save costs on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon’s most costly weapons-buying effort in history. Mattis’ memo, sent on Thursday, also calls on the military to determine whether the F-18 fighter can be modified to provide a “cost-effective fighter aircraft alternative.” The Defense chief also directed the Pentagon to look for ways to save money for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program, which is responsible for developing a replacement for the current presidential aircraft, which goes by the call sign Air Force One when the president is aboard. President Trump has blasted the $400 billion F-35 program for out-of-control costs. In December, he tweeted that “billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases.” He also criticized the higher costs of Air Force One and met with the CEOs of both Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which make the presidential aircraft and the F-35. The F-35 program is slated to supply all the services and close U.S. allies with differing variants of the radar-evading plane. The plane has been plagued by problems with cost-overruns, performance and readiness for combat. On Friday, the Pentagon called the review a “prudent step.” “This action is also consistent with the president's guidance to provide the strongest and most efficient military possible for our nation's defense, and it aligns with the secretary's priority to increase military readiness while gaining full value from every taxpayer dollar spent on defense,” Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement. The F-18 lacks the stealth qualities of the F-35. The Navy and Marine Corps and some allies fly the F-18. The F-35 has support among members of Congress from both sides of the aisle as plants that produce its parts and assemble are scatter among nearly all 50 states. Plans call for nearly 2,500 of the jets to be produced. Sen. Orin Hatch, R-Utah, is one prominent backer. His state hosts Hill Air Force Base, one of the first homes for the F-35.

H&N photo by Kurt Liedtke Dr. Nagi Naganathan visited Oregon Tech on Friday to meet with faculty and students as he prepares to take over as university president in April. Naganathan currently serves as the dean of the University of Toledo’s engineering school. Oregon Tech’s campus on Friday was abuzz with meetings, get-togethers and casual conversations beyond the normal collegiate atmosphere, as a soon-to-be-familiar face roamed buildings to interact with campus faculty, staff and students. Dr. Nagi Naganathan, the dean of the engineering school at the University of Toledo, had returned since being named Oregon Institute of Technology’s new president last November. The official transition from interim president Dr. Jay Kenton to Naganathan is expected to take place in the first week of April, but in the time until then, there is plenty of preparation already underway. From physically relocating from Ohio to information-gathering and introductions to staff and students, it is a veritable whirlwind of activity surrounding Naganathan whenever he travels to Klamath Falls. Unique opportunities Story continues below video × Advertisement “I want to recognize Dr. Kenton for the phenomenal job he has done, he has been encouraging from day one,” said Naganathan. “I am beginning to learn about the various initiatives he began, and the unique opportunities in Klamath Falls, and the ways that people in Klamath Falls can contribute to opportunities.” While Naganathan’s wife is handling much of the packing duties, he is splitting time between Toledo and Oregon in preparation for the big move. While the chance to be named a university president is not new for Naganathan, who in the past served as interim president at the University of Toledo, the campus and community spirit immediately endeared him to making the move. “I saw this as an opportunity to make a difference, I could sense not only the university but the town too is truly engaged in a common goal – that truly sold me when I came here,” explained Naganathan. “I wasn’t looking to leave Ohio, but what drew me here was the people. When I came here I could feel the connection, it felt different. It wasn’t just the title per se, but looking at this place I found a genuine desire to want to build together, that was very appealing.” Naganathan first and foremost wants to always be listening to students, faculty and the community about how to progress the university forward. While interim president at Toledo, he established a Walk With the President program, an informal stroll with students through campus where they could freely voice concerns and opinions about the school. Naganathan plans to implement the same program at OIT. Making a difference “Oregon Tech has a great reputation as a fine institution that makes a tremendous difference in the lives of the students that come here,” explained Naganathan. “I think now there is an excellent opportunity to the go to the next level of excellence. We want to integrate professional opportunities and create additional corporate connections that translate into opportunities for our students, faculty, staff and the community.” Naganathan recognizes the rapid advancement in technology, and how it can inflate tuition costs, as well as facility upgrades and aesthetic improvements desired on campus. Yet he sees innovation as more important, citing as an example the renewable energy program at OIT — one of only two accredited collegiate programs — as more important than the latest-and-greatest machinery for the sake of building if it is something incurred solely as an added financial burden on students. “We want to be on the leading edge of what we can offer our students. We want to embrace new technology, but that doesn’t mean the past isn’t relevant,” said Naganathan. “There are foundational things that still come from the past. We have to look at new programming at the intersection of people’s passion and expertise, affordability, and if it’s economically sustainable. I think no university can stand alone, there has to be a principled commitment to being an engaged institution.” Oregon Tech presents a unique challenge for an administrator, with campuses in both Klamath Falls and Wilsonville as well as a campus at Boeing and a strong online institutional presence. Balancing the needs of each location is a task Naganathan believes he is ready to undertake with great enthusiasm, always with an eye to serve the student’s best interests first while guiding OIT to new heights. “I think this school is possible of great things, and there is interest to go up several different levels,” said Naganathan. “Oregon Tech is starting to blast off, and I want people to know where I come from — the mascot at Toledo is a rocket. So, you have the right man for the job. I truly look forward to being a part of Klamath Falls and Oregon Tech.” “Oregon Tech is starting to blast off, and I want people to know where I come from -- the mascot at (University of) Toledo is a rocket. So, you have the right man for the job.” –Dr. Nagi Naganathan, incoming OIT President Tags Oregon Institute Of Technology Oit Oregon Tech President Nagi Naganathan Jay Kenton University Of Toledo Politics Education Work University Campus Student Dr. Search Faculty Follow Close Get email notifications on daily!

New Delhi (Sputnik) – The Indian Navy has finally decided to rest speculation whether it will opt for a home-developed combat jet or import them for its aircraft carriers. It has sought information from global manufacturers for 57 multi role carrier-borne fighters. "Multi role fighters are intended as day and night capable, all-weather multi-role deck based combat aircraft which can be used for air defense, air-to-surface operations, buddy refueling, reconnaissance and EW missions from Indian Naval aircraft carriers," reads document issued for global suppliers. Apart from some basic guidelines for procurement, Indian Navy has sought answers on the configuration in 55 pages on a range of issues like electronic warfare capability, endurance and payload. Indian government is desirous of license production of the aircraft after acquiring Transfer of technology in the case. The Indian Navy has asked global manufacturers questions like whether the twin- seat variant retains all operational attributes of the single seat variant (radar, air to air refueling)? It also asked for the capability of long/ medium range Beyond Visual Range air to air missiles, short range anti-ship missiles, precision guided munitions and unguided munitions which will be integrated on the aircraft and likely to be offered to Indian Navy. Indian Navy also wants to know from the global manufacturers whether the aircraft has a swing-role capability for the simultaneous carriage of strike weapons and air-to-air missiles. "Does the aircraft have capability to operate from both STOBAR (Short Take-off But Arrested Recovery) and CATOBAR (Catapult Take-off But Arrested Recovery) aircraft carriers without any modification to the aircraft?" another question. Selected aircraft will operate from indigenously developed Vikrant aircraft carrier which will be conventional ski jump based STOBAR layout. Configuration for second aircraft carrier has not yet been finalized. Swedish Saab has claimed that its single engine Sea Gripen has capability to operate from both STOBAR/CATOBAR. Russian made MiG-29K also operates from STOBAR. Both these fighter will receive major competition from India's own LCA Navy MK2, as it may find favor from Indian government to promote Make in India component. Only last month, Indian Navy chief Admiral Sunil Lanma had rung the alarm when he said the indigenous LCA Navy MK-1Tejas was too heavy for aircraft carriers and not fit in current form. If the Indian Navy wants fighters for CATOBAR, Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, Dassault's Rafale M and Lockheed Martin's F-35C will find place in this competition. However, the winner of the competition will have to invest 30 per cent of commercial value under offset contracts. Request for information indicates that delivery for the aircraft is expected only after 2021; by the time India's LCA NAVY MK-2 may prove to be a tough competitor for offerings by foreign firms. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

PHOTO | MANDEL NGAN | AFP  In Summary Trump made clear during last year's presidential campaign and in recent weeks that he wants to enlarge the ranks of the military services and expand its fleets of aircraft and ships. For example, he said he envisioned a naval fleet of 350 vessels, up from the navy's current 274 and more than its 310 vessel target. And Trump excluded the military from a hiring freeze across the rest of the government that he ordered just after being inaugurated president on January 20. Advertisement By AFP More by this Author WASHINGTON President Donald Trump signed an order Friday to begin what he called a "great rebuilding" of the US armed services, promising new aircraft, naval ships and more resources for the military. "Our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will our dedication to peace. We do want peace," Trump said in a ceremony at the Pentagon. Trump predicted that Congress, which sets the expenditures for the government, will "be very happy to see" the White House's new spending request for the military.

And Trump excluded the military from a hiring freeze across the rest of the government that he ordered just after being inaugurated president on January 20. He is also expected to order his new defence secretary, James Mattis, to intensify operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria with more US soldiers and military hardware like artillery and attack helicopters. Another expected move is to review and to strengthen the country's ability to defend itself against cyberattacks and to conduct offensive cyberattacks itself. The order Trump signed Friday was less specific, calling for a sweeping 30-day readiness review of the US military, with the aim of preparing new budget requests to improve readiness. But he has also pressured the Pentagon to cut costs on some of its most expensive programs. Earlier, Mattis ordered financial reviews of the costs of two major defence programs — the $400 billion F-35 fighter jet project and the $4 billion development of a new Air Force One presidential jet. Trump had complained that both were too costly. The Pentagon needs to find ways "to significantly reduce the cost" of the F-35 program, Mattis said, even weighing the competitiveness of the rival F-18. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin, while the F-18 is built by Boeing. Trump signed the new order at a ceremonial swearing-in of Mattis as defence secretary, lavishing praise on the retired Marine general. "Secretary Mattis has devoted his life to serving his country. He is a man of honour, a man of devotion, and a man of total action. He likes action," Trump said. email print In the headlines 9 KDF feared dead in Shabaab battle The base hosted Kenyan soldiers working under Amisom in the Lower Juba.

Googling these 10 things will gross you out By mid-day online correspondent | Posted 28-Jan-2017Now Available on the mid-day iOS App, Download Now Good news: The internet is filled with all the information you need. Bad news: The internet is not always filled with cute kitten videos or viral stuff. Horrible news: The internet also has stuff which will make you gouge your eyes out. The dark side of the internet (not even the dark web) has videos and images which range from gross to disgusting to outrageous to scary to offensive. Beware! you have been forewarned.. Do not.. We mean do NOT google these words under any circumstances...unless you want to make your own skin crawl. Lemon party The term 'Lemon' here is often used to describe an old male. A website of the same name features video clips of three old men having a good timein bed kissing and engaging in oral sex. The website was also mentioned in a number of TV sitcoms like 30 Rock’s Season 2 as well as in animated TV series like Archer, The Simpsons, The Cleveland Show and American Dad. Meat Spin You are directed to the website of the same name featururing a video of two men having gay sex. One of the men is 'spinning around' atop the other man, thus giving rise to the website's name. Not only that the site also flets you know as a viewer, how long you have managed to watch the action unfold. Trypophobia Trypophobia is a claimed pathological fear of holes, particularly irregular patterns of holes. But looking up for an image is the last thing you really want to do unless you want your eyes to bleed. And no, no image would serve the purpose, either. Blue waffle disease Waffles are yummy, alright! but go a step ahead and google blue waffles, rest assured you will never look at them the same way again. A photo of what appears to be a woman's severely infected vagina appears right up the screen.  Tub girl Tub girl is one of the most (in) famous jpeg. The image depicts a naked, masked woman lying in a tub with a fountain of yellowish orange liquid gushing from her raised buttocks onto her face, the apparent result of an orange juice enema. Too much information? Great. Don't tread the path, then.Hungry bitches Smurf porn Forget the small blue creatures who live in mushroom-shaped houses in the forest for some time. This smurf porn leads to extremely disturbing video - the kind of porn vidoes which give you headache. Do yourself a favour, enjoy the movie but don't look up for the vidoes or images for that matter. Degloved face Go ahead, google degloved face if you want see mutilated, bloodied, distorted images. The gore is real! Hungry bitches Brazilian fetish-themed pornographic film called 'Hungry bitches' features two women alternatingly defecating into a cup and then consuming the said excrement. They also manage to work some vomit in there, just so no one feels left out. Ouch! Really Ouch! Goatse One of the shock sites, 'Goatse.cx' features a naked man stretching out his anus using both hands so much that you can actually see the interior of his rectum. The image became so well known that it constantly reminded everyone that doomsday is near. Mr Hands Based on a true incident, 'Mr. Hands' is the professional name of one Kenneth Pinyan, a former Boeing engineer who died in 2005 after receiving anal sex from a horse. The act which was videotaped, was intentional, though it eventually led to the perforation of Pinyan's colon and his eventual death.

Associated Press photo. Share Adjust Comment Print U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has ordered a review of the F-35 program to find savings. In addition, the review will examine into whether the advanced Super Hornet can fill the role as an alternative to the F-35C, the aircraft carrier variant of the Lockheed Martin plane. The memo from Mattis noted that the review will “determine opportunities to significantly reduce the cost,” of the F-35. Mattis announced that the deputy secretary of defense would “oversee a review that compares the F-35C and F/A-18E/F operational capabilities and assess the extent that F/A-18E/F improvements can be made in order to provide competitive, cost effective, fighter aircraft alternative.” The new design of the Advanced Super Hornet “is a mix of new capabilities and upgrades like the centreline fuel tank-mounted infrared search and track (IRST21) sensor, integrated defensive electronic countermeasures (IDECM) Block IV, active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar and next-generation jammer,” according to Flight Global magazine. “Upgrades that have not yet been adopted by the Pentagon include an enhanced engine, conformal fuel tanks and an open architecture cockpit with a 48cm (19in) wide-area display,” the publication pointed out. U.S. President Donald Trump has complained that the cost of the F-35 is out of control. Trump tweeted in December that “based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet!”  Mattis has also called for a review of the Air Force One replacement aircraft program. Boeing has been selected to build two new Air Force One aircraft.   Boeing photo below shows Advanced Super Hornet.   MOJAVE DESERT, Calif. (Aug. 28, 2014) A U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet assigned to the Dust Devils of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 31 at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, Calif., conducts an interoperability test event with a Navy F-35C Lightning II joint strike fighter aircraft over the Edwards Air Force Base test range with the Mojave Desert below. The two aircraft engaged in a series of electronic exchanges to ensure that communications and sensor<br />information could be passed effectively between platforms. The F-35C is the<br />Navy’s variant of the joint strike fighter, designed to operate at sea on aircraft carriers and is scheduled for initial deployment in 2019.

ROS LBoard 1 Run a business on the side, fresh grads told Sheith Khidhir Bin Abu Bakar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Trump orders ‘great rebuilding’ of US military AFP | January 28, 2017 The order Trump signed Friday was less specific, calling for a sweeping 30-day readiness review of the US military, with the aim of preparing new budget requests to improve readiness. WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump signed an order Friday to begin what he called a “great rebuilding” of the US armed services, promising new aircraft, naval ships and more resources for the military. “Our military strength will be questioned by no one, but neither will our dedication to peace. We do want peace,” Trump said in a ceremony at the Pentagon. Trump predicted that Congress, which sets the expenditures for the government, will “be very happy to see” the White House’s new spending request for the military. Trump made clear during last year’s presidential campaign and in recent weeks that he wants to enlarge the ranks of the military services and expand its fleets of aircraft and ships. For example, he said he envisioned a naval fleet of 350 vessels, up from the navy’s current 274 and more than its 310 vessel target. And Trump excluded the military from a hiring freeze across the rest of the government that he ordered just after being inaugurated president on January 20. He is also expected to order his new defense secretary, James Mattis, to intensify operations against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria with more US soldiers and military hardware like artillery and attack helicopters. Another expected move is to review and the strengthen the country’s ability to defend itself against cyberattacks and to conduct offensive cyberattacks itself. The order Trump signed Friday was less specific, calling for a sweeping 30-day readiness review of the US military, with the aim of preparing new budget requests to improve readiness. But he has also pressured the Pentagon to cut costs on some of its most expensive programs. Earlier, Mattis ordered financial reviews of the costs of two major defense programs — the $400 billion F-35 fighter jet project and the $4 billion development of a new Air Force One presidential jet. Trump had complained that both were too costly. The Pentagon needs to find ways “to significantly reduce the cost” of the F-35 program, Mattis said, even weighing the competitiveness of the rival F-18. The F-35 is built by Lockheed Martin, while the F-18 is built by Boeing. Trump signed the new order at a ceremonial swearing-in of Mattis as defense secretary, lavishing praise on the retired Marine general. “Secretary Mattis has devoted his life to serving his country. He is a man of honor, a man of devotion, and a man of total action. He likes action,” Trump said. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.
