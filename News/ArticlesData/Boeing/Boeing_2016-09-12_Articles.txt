Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) today in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at $1.025 trillion. China becomes the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing’s forecast. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years.” Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Tinseth said the backlog from Chinese customers demonstrates that the new 737 MAX 8 and the current Next-Generation 737-800 are at the heart of the single-aisle market. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X. This year’s forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China’s single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China’s widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Tinseth. Driven by China’s growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters.

The complete forecast is available at www.boeing.com/cmo. Today, Boeing jets are the mainstay of China’s air travel and cargo system. More than 50 percent of all the commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the world’s most technologically advanced airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies.

Firm says nation may become first trillion plus aviation market Boeing Co said on Tuesday that China is now the most dynamic market for international flights, and it is very positive about the outlook for the growth of China's long-haul market, due to strong domestic and overseas travel demand, and a rising middle class. The plane manufacturer lifted its forecast for China, and said the nation is likely to become the first country with an aviation market exceeding trillion in the next two decades. Chinese airlines are estimated to purchase 6,810 airplanes valued at .025 trillion in the next 20 years. Among the new deliveries, Boeing predicts that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total, and China's widebody fleet is to triple in size over the next two decades. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice-president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Meanwhile, low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services between smaller cities to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. In the last five years, the number of direct international flights to and from China saw a surge of 150 percent. Direct flights between second-tier Chinese cities and overseas cities have been the main driving force of the growth. Tinseth said the continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new relaxed visa policies and a wide range of wide body airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives Boeing sufficient reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market. Li Xiaojin, a professor at the Civil Aviation University of China in Tianjin, said China is expected to have a surge on international travel volume. By 2020, China is likely to witness 200 million international trips annually. "The trend of airlines to add more international flights between first-tier Chinese cities and second-tier foreign cities, and vice-versa, is likely to continue to grow rapidly, since the direct flights between first-tier cities are nearly saturated, and demand is keeps growing." On the other hand, driven by China's growing e-commerce business－already the largest in the world－air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. In the past five years, the express delivery services saw an average annual growth rate in their total volume of 55 percent, and sales revenues grew by an annual average of 39 percent, according to the State Post Bureau.

Boeing leaders hope it will be chosen as the jet to train the next generation of Air Force pilots. An $11 billion contract is on the line. The Boeing T-X was revealed this morning at the Boeing facility in Bridgeton during a high energy announcement with many Boeing employees and executives. Boeing is one of four companies competing to develop the plane that the Air Force will buy in the future to train the next generation of air force pilots. The overall Air Force project is called the T-X training program. The new training plane chosen by the Air Force will replace the aging T-38 aircraft. Darryl Davis, the President of Boeing Phantom Works, says Boeing`s T-X which has been in the works for nearly three years breaks the norm. He says it incorporates all of the modern technology and techniques. In fact, Davis calls the jet the training plane of the future. 'I think the most important thing that we did here was we started with a clean sheet of paper to meet the Air Force`s advanced pilot threshold requirements. That was the breakthrough-it allowed us to bring all the innovation we`ve been working on for decades in the Boeing company together into this design,' said Davis. Boeing is partnering with Saab in this project. Saab`s President and CEO Hakan Buskhe, told us, 'It`s a good design. And it`s a design that outside looks great of course but also the inside of the aircraft with all the systems and the capabilities.' Winning the contract will mean a lot of jobs for the company that gets it. The Air Force is expected to award the contract next year. The new plane should be in operation in 2024. Boeing officials say they are not sure where the planes will be built if they get the contract. They say they are looking to do it in the most affordable place because they are trying to keep costs down. We understand the winning company will build some 350 planes.

 Saab and Boeing just released their joint attempt for the Air Force's next supersonic trainer David Choi Sep. 13, 2016, 5:26 PM 11,600 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing T-X Boeing After suffering a series of blows — from losing its bid to manufacture the US military’s much anticipated F-35 Lightning II and B-21 bomber, to the industry’s stagnating demand for commercial jetliners — Boeing has shown signs of revitalization as it unveiled its latest aircraft to compete for the US Air Force’s $11 billion T-X trainer program. Partnered with the Swedish manufacturer Saab, Boeing sources claim that the twin-tailed aircraft powered by a General Electric engine was built with the latest fifth-generation fighters in mind: reports show that the trainer aircraft mimics the design and airframe of the latest aircraft that pilots would eventually be flying. Having already built 2 units that were unveiled today, Boeing emphasized that the planes weren’t prototypes, and that they plan on performing flight tests by the end of the year. "Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come," said Boeing Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret in a press release. Details of the aircraft, such as manufacturing techniques, remain a secret due to the competition behind the award. However, what Boeing does seem to emphasize is the affordability of the aircraft. “I don’t want to give away all of the competitive secrets here,” said president of Boeing Phantom Works Darryl Davis in DefenseNews. “But we’re going to shatter that cost curve.” Also undisclosed was the specific agreement between Saab and Boeing to manufacture the aircraft. However, according to DefenseNews, Davis did state that some of the technology originated from Boeing’s F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Saab’s next-generation fighter, the Gripen. “There’s a lot of reuse throughout this whole jet, to include some of the design and manufacturing,” Davis stated in DefenseNews. “They brought a tremendous amount of expertise, technical detail, a lot of reuse of some systems out of the Gripen.” The T-38 Talon Sgt. Jeffrey Allen/US Air Force So far, four competitors have submitted their candidates to replace the US Air Force’s aging fleet of around 500 Northrop T-38 Talons that have been used to train its pilots. Boeing has been the first company to publicly display their newly-designed entry into the competition, while details on Northrop Grumman’s trainer aircraft remain scant — so far, only a few teaser images and pictures on Twitter have appeared. The other two competitors, Lockheed Martin and Kai, and the trio of Raytheon, Leonardo and CAE, have teamed up to build the T-50A and T-100, respectively.

Work on the first two airplanes was already well underway as the articles of incorporation for Pacific Aero Products Company established three Seattle residents as the principals, William E. Boeing, James Foley, and Edgar Gott. The company's diverse crew included men with woodworking skills, women with expertise in sewing fabric, and an American-educated Chinese aeronautical engineer named Wong Tsu. A century later, Boeing is synonymous with commercial aviation, military products, and feats in space. About the Author: John Fredrickson retired as a senior manager of the Boeing Company in 2011 after 36 years of service. He has 21 years of combined reserve and active-duty military service with the US Air Force. He first encountered Boeing products at Minot Air Force Base in 1971. His work experience on B-52 and KC-135 aircraft continued at U-Tapao Airfield in Thailand during the Vietnam War. That background qualified him for a job at Boeing Flight Test in Seattle starting in 1975, where he worked on the AWACS and YC-14 programs before undertaking a more traditional career in backroom accounting. Fredrickson is the author of Kansas City B-25 Factory and Warbird Factory.

 Norwegian Air will offer $69 tickets to Europe — but one thing needs to happen first Benjamin Zhang Sep. 13, 2016, 4:28 PM 34,985 facebook linkedin twitter email print Norwegian Air Boeing 737-MAX8. Boeing For several years, Norwegian Air has teased the flying public with promises of $69 tickets to cross the Atlantic. Now it looks like the cheap tickets for which we have pined for so long may finally be within reach. According to Norwegian Air chief commercial officer Thomas Ramdahl, his airline is awaiting the aircraft needed for the $69 flights.  That's because the first of the 100 Boeing 737 MAX 8 airliners Norwegian Air ordered to operate those flights won't be ready for delivery until 2017. The Boeing 737 Max 8 is expected to enter service with launch partner Southwest Airlines during the third quarter of 2017. However, Boeing told Bloomberg's Julie Johnson and Mary Schlangenstein that the planes could be ready for delivery as early as March.  Ramdahl told Business Insider that his airline plans to make an announcement around November or December of this year with firm details of the $69 fares.  "I can promise you that you will see trans-Atlantic flights on the 737Max next year," Ramdahl told us in an interview last week. "And that's when you will see the $69 fares." The 737 MAX 8 features new fuel-efficient CFM LEAP-1B engines, upgraded avionics, and aerodynamics. As as result, the new jet offers airlines the range and performance to operate trans-Atlantic service with the lower cost of a narrow-body jet.   Norwegian Air Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Norwegian Following the introduction of the 737 MAX 8, Norwegian will introduce the first of the 30 Airbus A321neo LR airliners it has on order in 2018. The A321neo LR will be larger than the MAX 8 and will also offer greater range than the Boeing.  Norwegian currently operates its trans-Atlantic flights using a fleet of new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Even though the European low-cost carrier currently do offer bargain basement prices, the costs associated with operating the wide-body jets make the sub-$100 price point unfeasible.  This month, Norwegian announced that, starting next summer, it will commence flights between several major cities in the US and Barcelona, Spain for as low as $189 per ticket one way. These flights will be operated on the airline's current fleet of Boeing Dreamliners.  In July, Norwegian took home the award for best long-haul low-cost airline in the world from the highly respected consumer aviation website Skytrax. In addition, Norwegian won best low-cost airline in Europe for the fourth year in a row.  SEE ALSO: How Emirates found success with the most controversial jet in the world NOW WATCH: What it's like to fly on Qatar Airways — the best airline in the world Loading video...

Shanahan, Senior Manager, GMD with Boeing Strategic Missile and Defense Systems, and Ms. Champagne Bell, Manager, Small/Diverse Business & Strategic Alliances, Boeing Military Aircraft, Global Services & Support, Phantom Works and Commodities & Services. Topics for the meeting will include the potential economic impact on the region in which missile fields will be located, Boeing’s supply chain requirements, how local companies can participate, and what expectations there are for suppliers, as well as what it takes to become a supplier. “We’re excited to host this event, and to share our new meeting facilities with the Michigan business community.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com Boeing on Tuesday rolled out the sleek prototype of its new T-X trainer, the plane that just might save thousands of jobs in St. Louis County as fighter production winds down in the next decade. Boeing unveiled a twin-tail, single-engine craft designed to mimic a fighter jet with high maneuverability and endurance for high G forces. The Air Force wants 350 new jets to train the next generation of fighter pilots, but Boeing is facing off against three competitors. One of them, Northrop Grumman, has been ground-testing its own prototype. Boeing has one prototype in ground testing, and another is being assembled at Boeing’s sprawling north St. Louis County plant. Design and engineering work for the trainer is being done in St. Louis, but Boeing says it hasn’t decided where it would assemble the plane if it gets the contract. The company is in an “evaluation process” to determine where the trainer would be built, said Darryl Davis, who heads Boeing’s Phantom Works development operation. +2  Buy Now Darryl Davis, president of Phantom Works at Boeing Defense, introduces the new T-X training aircraft at Boeing on Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2016.

Building it in Sweden would cause political problems in the U.S. Several thousand workers build Boeing’s F-15, F/A-18 and E/A-18 fighter and attack aircraft in St. Louis County. Boeing is seeking orders for those planes, but production is likely to end sometime in the next decade. The T-X is the only other fighter-like aircraft on Boeing’s drawing boards. “The T-X is a must-win for Boeing,” said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer at the Lexington Institute, a Washington-area think tank on security issues. “They really need this aircraft to keep their military engineers engaged.” In addition to the 350 planes desired by the Air Force, the trainer would have potential foreign sales. The trainer it replaces, the aged T-38, debuted in 1961 and production totaled 1,146 aircraft before it went out of production in 1972. Analysts say the Air Force order alone could be worth $11 billion. Boeing and Saab designed the plane from a “clean sheet of paper,” Davis said. Northrop Grumman and BAE Systems teamed up to do the same, but two other competitors are offering versions of existing trainers. Lockheed Martin and KAI are offering a trainer based on one used by the South Korean air force. Raytheon, Leonardo, Honeywell Aerospace and CAE-USA are offering a trainer based on a Leonardo plane used in Italy. An existing design might allow for a cheaper plane with a reliable record. But starting from scratch would allow Boeing and Northrop Grumman to design an exact match for the Air Force’s requirements, Thompson noted. Lockheed builds the F-35, the Air Force’s newest fighter and the plane many of its new pilots will fly. The Boeing trainer unveiled Tuesday resembled a giant gray and white mosquito, with some similarity to Boeing’s larger F/A-18. It features a General Electric engine and “stadium seating,” with the instructor seated behind and higher than the student pilot. The Air Force wants a plane that can sustain forces of 6.5 times gravity for sustained periods during maneuvering. The double-tail design increases stability and braking ability. The cockpit will resemble the F-22 and F-35, the Air Force’s newest fighters. “I think they have a very good chance of winning,” said Thompson. “No one else is offering a dual tail. If you look at it from the front, you can see how similar it looks to the F-35 and the F-22.” Much of the design work took place at Saab, Aboulafia said. He detects “distant hints” of Saab’s old 105 trainer in the T-X wing design. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Boeing plans to begin flight testing this year at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. “This is a production jet,” Davis said. Boeing tried hard to keep the costs down, and that led to some innovations. Some composite parts are made whole in 3D printers. Workers can prepare a cockpit canopy in eight days, a task that used to take six weeks, according to Boeing officials. Boeing brought some of that cost-saving know-how from its commercial jet operation. Thompson, who toured the T-X facility, said he was impressed by how few people were assembling the plane. Boeing lost competitions to build the Air Force’s new bomber and the F-35. The T-X may be its last chance to keep a toehold in the fixed-wing, manned combat aircraft business as the F/A-18 and F-15 business fades. That might play to Boeing’s advantage when the Air Force makes its T-X decision, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones investments in Des Peres. “It’s important to them to keep multiple suppliers engaged in developing the next generation of technologies,” Windau said. The U.S. will eventually need a newer fighter, and giving Boeing the trainer might keep Boeing as a competitor until then, Aboulafia said. “That does not mean that Boeing is still in the design game,” he added. “They outsourced so much of the design to Saab.” Boeing holds government contracts for military tanker and surveillance planes, helicopters, drones, missiles and smart bomb assemblies. It employs nearly 15,000 people in the St. Louis area. The Air Force is expected to choose the winner of the trainer contract next year or in early 2018.

AVIATION Boeing lifts China forecast Boeing Co lifted its forecast for aircraft demand in China in the next two decades, saying a rising middle class would spur leisure and business travel. The plane maker projects demand in China for 6,810 aircraft valued at US$1.025 trillion, making the nation the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast, Boeing said in a statement distributed in Beijing yesterday. The aircraft maker last year predicted China would need 6,330 new planes worth US$950 billion in the next two decades. Boeing forecast that China would need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, or 75 percent of total new deliveries. The wide-body fleet would triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes, it said. Boeing also forecast that 39,620 new airplanes valued at US$5.9 trillion would be delivered worldwide in the next 20 years. PAYMENTS Visa launches Kenya app Visa Inc, the world’s largest payments network, has introduced a smartphone application to enable cashless transactions in Kenya, where the majority of wireless payments are being done through the nation’s biggest telecommunications company, Safaricom Ltd. The mVisa app would initially facilitate transactions for people with accounts in four banks, including KCB Group Ltd and Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd, Visa emerging markets senior vice president Uttam Nayak said. The company hopes to convert an estimated 84 million of Africa’s smartphone users who still pay by cash. Users of mVisa can make payments by scanning a unique merchant quick response code using their smartphones. About 1,500 merchants have up signed up, it said. Visa is in talks to roll out apps in Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda within two months, and in Nigeria by the end of the year, it said. ELECTRONICS Samsung shares rebound Shares in South Korean giant Samsung Electronics rallied yesterday, recovering almost half the losses from a two-day collapse linked to its troubled Galaxy Note 7 smartphone, as traders welcomed news it had sold its printer unit for US$1.05 billion to US firm HP. The shares plunged more than 10 percent on Friday last week and Monday after it urged global consumers to stop using its flagship phone owing to a spate of exploding batteries. However, soon after the end of trade in Seoul on Monday, Samsung and HP announced the sale of the printer business. Samsung shares closed up 4.23 percent at 1.527 million won yesterday.

As suppliers grapple with production burdens, one manufacturer has left the ground and achieved cruising altitude September 2016 - “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness…” British author Charles Dickens opened his 1859 novel “A Tale of Two Cities” with these famous words—penned to describe the economic and political unrest that plagued London and Paris in the late 1700s and which led to the American and French revolutions. For the aerospace and defense market, it certainly seems like the best of times. The Farnborough International Airshow, held in July, broke records with $124 billion in orders and options for aircraft, engines and components. Airbus netted the largest deal, selling 100 of its A321 neos worth $12.44 billion to AirAsia.  Yet, escalating orders and burgeoning backlogs could prove to be the worst of times for suppliers, warns Dustin Tillman, president and CEO of Irvine, California-based Elite Aviation Products. At the same time, Tillman has deployed a business approach meant to propel his company ahead of the capacity curve while equipping it to support an industry that is staggering under the intense pressure of customer demands. WORKING THE VALUE STREAM Elite is able to slide freely up and down the supply chain to provide multiple solutions for end users. “The aerospace and defense market is the most bullish we’ve ever seen it,” says Tillman. “There is more booked and undelivered work now than at any other time. There are more new programs being awarded than ever before. It truly is the second Golden Age of aviation.” He deems the view from the supply chain, however, as grim. “Many U.S. suppliers haven’t been able to step up and respond to what is the largest run-up in the history of commercial flight. Customers are tired of inaction, underscored by a lack of investment, and are actively looking for companies capable of partnering with them for the long haul. Elite is stepping up to fill that role,” he says, “and the results are evidenced by the market share we continue to take from incumbents.” Push/pull Explosive growth in single-aisle aircraft has attracted Chinese and Russian aerospace suppliers to a market that is also being cultivated by Brazil’s Embraer and Canada’s Bombardier. But the battle for big jet orders remains between Boeing and Airbus—they hold 70 percent of the market for wide-body and narrow-body commercial aircraft.     According to Forecast International Inc., which performs analysis for aerospace, defense, power systems and military electronics, May 2016 backlogged orders for Airbus hit 6,759 units compared to Boeing’s 5,762, backlogs that represent 10 and seven years of production. Recent earnings statements confirm the A320 and 737 narrow body families are Airbus and Boeing’s mainstays and make up the majority of deliveries.  According to Airbus, “Middle classes in emerging markets will double to 3.5 billion people by 2035, [by which time] 62 percent of the world population will be city dwellers and the number of aviation-served megacities will rise from 55 to 93. In 20 years, the number of daily, long-haul passengers traveling to, from or via aviation megacities is expected to more than double to 2.5 million.”  Inside a Tsugami B326 Swiss-style Turn Mill, high-pressure nozzles are hard at work. Boeing executives report global passenger traffic, at 6 percent growth year to date, is outpacing gross domestic product. Experts agree, though, that with supplier bottlenecks dogging the airframe builders, Airbus and Boeing are pushing the envelope by booking new orders at a breakneck pace that doesn’t match the actual rate of production. Delays spurred Qatar Airways to cancel its order for its first A320neo jetliner from Airbus, the Wall Street Journal reported in June. Boeing took steps to minimize risk, such as pooling its suppliers’ raw material purchases and sharing manufacturing techniques. Kent Fisher, vice president in charge of supplier management at Boeing, told the Financial Times in May that “the supply chain is performing better this year than in 2015 when one supplier’s switch to a new resource management system caused the biggest number of shortages in eight years. It was an exception,” he said, but he’s only “one bad phone call away from that record being eradicated completely.” According to Tillman, the biggest problem suppliers face is a global lack of available capacity. “You have to be able to scale up in a way that doesn’t compromise cost, quality, delivery or service,” he says. “This has proven especially difficult for the industry to manage.” The Airbus A321neo engine is just one of the finished products supported by Elite’s expertise. View from the top Tillman took a blank slate approach to starting his business, which allowed him to establish solid building blocks to facilitate scalable growth. In 2015, the AS9100 Rev C- and ISO 9000-certified manufacturer acquired its second manufacturing facility in Tustin, California. The 34,000-sq.-ft. facility triples Elite’s manufacturing capacity. “I have gained a macro perspective of the supply chain, how it works and how to address these legacy challenges because I spent my career on the supply side of the aerospace market prior to establishing Elite,” Tillman says. At first glance, the sequence of operations that work in concert to design, produce and deliver products for the aerospace and defense market seems simple with a typical value stream comprising Tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers, a subcontractor performing assembly and a prime integrator. But the tiered relationship is complex and difficult to navigate, requiring a knowledge and flexibility that many in the industry lack, according to Tillman. “Today’s project and customer needs don’t always follow a traditional path,” he says. “Suppliers are finding that they must be prepared to play multiple roles.” Nimble-footed Elite is able to slide freely up and down the value stream to provide “plug and play” solutions that go beyond that of a conventional parts supplier. Tillman explained why in testimony he gave before a U.S. House of Representatives Small Business Committee hearing in May 2016. An Elite machine tool operator evaluates the first stage on a new component to ensure speeds and feeds are dialed in. American manufacturing has been stifled over the last couple decades by lack of investment in emerging technologies, slow adoption of business models with 21st century efficiencies, large growth capital requirements and lack of investment in prioritizing the cross training of employees, Tillman testified. “Elite was born out of recognition of these challenges,” he says, adding, “Our ability to address these problems has allowed us to quickly break into the aerospace marketplace while creating domestic manufacturing jobs and dispelling the myth that successful manufacturing in America is a thing of the past.” It’s why Tillman chose to build from the ground up, seeding the workspaces with a homegrown culture that is geared to the customer. “It’s no longer a decade of napkin agreements,” he says. “It’s about commissioning your customer for the work their customers are demanding.”  Tillman’s three-point plan is simple: people, processes and technology. “People are the centerpiece of any business,” he continues. “We hired best-of-breed talent and we maintain a robust human capital management program that empowers our employees through recognition and incentive systems that reward out-of-the-box thinking.” Elite’s infrastructure is networked with enterprise resource planning, quality management systems and business operating system (BOS) to promote an agile manufacturing environment that is populated with the latest equipment. The company subjects each request for proposal to a multi-departmental review and analysis to ensure the right machine tool is selected for the project. Elite’s current offering includes Swiss-style turned products used to support a variety of build-to-print and standard commercial and orbital rocket launch applications. Elite also makes complex, high cost-of-failure components like enclosures, heat sinks, manifolds and engine mounts. Raw materials range from carbon steels C12L15 to aluminum 6061-7075 and titanium 6AL4V to Inconel 625. Elite specializes in turned parts under 32mm and super alloy-milled components within a 17-in. by 24-in. envelope. Elite has plans to expand its product offering and add larger format machining by next year. The company has its eye on the commercial space transportation market as well. Tool holders stand ready to support a scheduled aviation component fabrication job. “Given the maturity of the supply chain at the OEM level over the last decade, especially in regard to total cost of ownership initiatives, we are seeing a sharper focus on quality and delivery,” says Tillman. “With the sheer volume of work in front of us ensuring parts are on-quality and on-time is going to become even more important.” Revival Quality and invisible costs associated with activities like processing and shipping are reasons Elite is also winning work back from overseas competitors, like the large contract it recently landed with an airframe manufacturer that was procuring parts from China used in the fabrication of seat monuments.  “The rejection rate [for the Chinese parts] was over 50 percent per delivery, numbers that left our customer in a predicament,” says Tillman. “Having parts reworked would have been cost prohibitive and caused further delays. Sending a quality team to regularly monitor the manufacturer added up to tens of thousands of dollars in airfare, hotels and other expenses. When our customer tallied these expenses and amortized the costs back through the piece part price, they were appalled,” according to Tillman. “The exercise made their decision a no-brainer.” Experience on the aerospace supply chain side of the fence has given Tillman a macro view of how to address the industry’s legacy challenges. Leading by example, Tillman hopes other suppliers in the global aerospace sector will follow suit. He acknowledges that it takes a certain amount of risk appetite and the ability to manage growth without diluting a company’s offerings. “We represent a very important voice,” he says. “It is the voice of the customer, not just over the next year but for the next 20 years.” Tillman also advocates getting involved in reshoring efforts and ways to remedy the shortage of skilled manufacturing workers from hiring and training veterans to engaging young people.  “As a nation we need to make manufacturing exciting again and reintroduce a curriculum in primary schools where children can be exposed to different vocations. The backbone of America has always been and will continue to be its skilled labor force,” he says. When the skills are homegrown, the entire supply base will be flying high.

Boeing released its China Current Market Outlook on Tuesday in Beijing, forecasting that demand for new commercial airplanes there will reach $1.025 trillion in the next 20 years. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” Randy Kinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes marketing vice president, said in a news release. “Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic.” Boeing’s forecast said China will need 5,110 new narrowbody jets through 2035, accounting for three-quarters of the 6,810 new commercial airplanes there. Boeing said China will need 1,560 widebody jets and 140 regional jets – 90 seats and less – over that period. During the two-decade period, Boeing forecasts annual passenger traffic growth of 6.4 percent in China.

The ratings on both classes of certificates are primarily driven by a top-down analysis incorporating a series of stress tests which simulate the rejection and repossession of the aircraft in a severe aviation downturn. The 'AA' level rating is supported by a high level of overcollateralization (OC) and high-quality collateral supporting Fitch's expectations that senior tranche holders should receive full principal recovery prior to default even in a severe stress scenario. Likewise, the 'A' rating on the subordinated certificates is supported by OC sufficient for the tranche to pass Fitch's 'A' level stress scenario. The ratings are also supported by the inclusion of 18-month liquidity facilities, cross-collateralization/cross-default features and the legal protection afforded by Section 1110 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The structural features increase the likelihood that the certificates could avoid default even if United were to file bankruptcy and subsequently reject the aircraft. The initial 'AA' tranche loan to value (LTV), as cited in the prospectus, is 38.7%, and Fitch's maximum stress case LTV (the primary driver for the 'AA' tranche rating) through the life of the transaction is 82.3%. This level of OC provides a significant amount of protection for the senior tranche holders. The initial 'A' tranche LTV, as cited in the prospectus, is 55.8%, and Fitch's maximum stress case LTV through the life of the transaction is 89.5%, using our 'A' category stress scenario. Transaction Overview UAL plans to raise $919,593,000 in an EETC transaction to fund 13 new aircraft that are expected to be delivered between December 2016 and June 2017. The 'AA' tranche will be sized at $636,512,000 with a 12-year tenor and a weighted average life of 9.1 years. The subordinate 'A' tranche will be sized at $283,081,000 and will also feature a 12-year tenor and a weighted average life of 9.1 years. Collateral Pool: The transaction will be secured by a perfected first-priority security interest in 13 new delivery aircraft including seven Boeing 777-300ERs, two 787-9s, three 737-900ERs and a 737-800. Fitch considers all four aircraft types to be tier 1 collateral, though we view the 777-300ER and 737-900ER as weaker tier 1 assets. All four types are considered strategically important to UAL's fleet. Liquidity Facility: The class AA and class A certificates benefit from dedicated 18-month liquidity facilities which will be provided by Commonwealth Bank of Australia acting through its New York branch (rated 'AA-'/'F1+'/Stable Outlook). Cross-default & Cross-collateralization Provisions: Each note will be fully cross-collateralized and all indentures will be fully cross-defaulted from day one, which Fitch believes will limit UAL's ability to 'cherry-pick' aircraft in a potential restructuring. Pre-funded Deal: Proceeds from the transaction will be used to pre-fund deliveries expected to be completed by June of 2017. Accordingly, proceeds will initially be held in escrow by Natixis ('A/F1'/ Stable Outlook), the designated depositary, until the aircraft are delivered. Fitch notes that this transaction features a 35-day replacement window in the event that the liquidity facility provider or depositary should become ineligible. This is inconsistent with Fitch's counterparty criteria which generally stipulate a maximum 30-day replacement period. However, Fitch does not consider the longer replacement window to be material given that the additional time period is not significant. The transaction also features a downgrade threshold of 'BBB+' for the 'AA' tranche liquidity facility provider, whereas Fitch's counterparty criteria generally stipulate a minimum threshold of 'A-'. This is discussed in more detail below. KEY RATING DRIVERS Stress Case: The ratings for both classes of certificates are primarily based on collateral coverage in a stress scenario. The analysis uses a top-down approach assuming a rejection of the entire pool in a severe global aviation downturn. The scenarios incorporate a full draw on the liquidity facility, and an assumed repossession/remarketing cost of 5% of the total portfolio value. Fitch then applies significant haircuts to the collateral value. The 787-9s and the 737-800s in this pool receive a 40% haircut in Fitch's 'AA' stress scenario and a 20% haircut in the 'A' stress scenario, representing the low end of Fitch's stress ranges, and reflect the firm's view of these models as top-quality aircraft. The 737-900ERs receive a more severe haircut of 45% in the 'AA' scenario and 25% in the 'A' scenario, which incorporates the 737-900ER's limited user base, which could translate into a more difficult remarketing process if the aircraft had to be repossessed and sold. The 777-300ER received a 45% haircut in the 'AA' scenario and a 30% haircut in the 'A' scenario. These assumptions produce a maximum stress LTV of 82.3% for the class AA certificates using Fitch's 'AA' category scenario and a maximum LTV of 89.5% for the class A certificates using an 'A' level stress scenario. These outcomes support a high likelihood that both classes of certificates should receive full recovery with a significant amount of headroom, even in a harsh downside scenario. The highest stress LTVs are experienced early in the life of the transaction and are expected to decline gradually as the deal amortizes. High Collateral Quality: The quality of the collateral pool underlying the transaction is considered solid. 777-300ER (71% of collateral pool value per Fitch's valuations): Fitch considers the 777-300ER to be a high-quality tier 1 aircraft, but arguably weaker than other tier 1's such as the 737-800 or 787-9. The 777-300ER is the best-selling aircraft of its size with a diverse base of global operators and limited competition. With an average age of five years, the 777-300ER fleet is still a relatively young aircraft, though Boeing is preparing to launch its replacement, the 777x, in the early 2020 timeframe. Asset values for 777s have come under some scrutiny over the past year or so as some older 777-200s have been sold for well below what market observers would have expected. However, we note that value pressures have primarily centered on older vintage 777s with Rolls Royce engines, while the demand for newer models has remained intact. According to the Ascend database there is currently only one 777-300ER listed as 'in storage' - meaning that there is essentially no immediate availability for this aircraft type. Fitch notes that there is some concern over the high number of 777-300ERs scheduled to come off of their existing leases in coming years. Ascend lists 58 777-300ERs with lease expiries between now and 2023, 32 of which are from one user, Emirates. It is unclear whether a material number of lease expiries will pressure asset values over the intermediate term. Boeing also faces a gap between the end of its production run for the current 777 and the beginning of production of the 777x. The company still needs to sell a number of the current generation 777s to bridge production to the new model, which could lead to discounting that would pressure existing asset values. As such, Boeing recently cut its production rate on the 777 from 8.3/month to 7/month and is likely to cut production to 5.5/month over the transition period. Fitch's concerns are mitigated by the significant amount of overcollateralization included in this transaction. Fitch estimates that the senior tranche should continue to pass our 'AA' level stress test even if depreciation rates materially outpace our initial expectations. 787-9 (17%): Fitch considers the 787 Dreamliner to be a high-quality tier one aircraft. Despite technical issues early in the life of the smaller 787-8, backlogs for the aircraft family remain strong and delivery slots are scarce, which would support strong re-sale values if any of these planes were to come on the market. For that reason, Fitch applies the low end of its tier 1 stress range to the 787-9. The -9 variant has built up a sizeable backlog of 435 aircraft as of August 2016. Carrying 250 passengers in a standard arrangement, the 787-9 acts as a bridge in Boeing's product line between the 787-8 (typical capacity 224 passengers), and the 777-200ER (300 passengers). In addition, the 787-9 is capable of a similar range as the 777-200ER, but at an improved fuel burn rate. 737-900ER (9%): Fitch views the 900ER as a low tier 1/high tier 2 aircraft due to its attractive operating economics which make it an ideal replacement for older narrowbodies. However, the aircraft has a somewhat limited user base concentrated among a few large carriers. Lion Air and United operate nearly 50% of the fleet while the top four users (Lion, United, Delta and Alaska) operate some 75% of the 900ERs in service. The limited user base may make resale more difficult if the aircraft were to have to be repossessed or re-leased. 737-800 (3%): Fitch views the 737-800s as one of the most popular narrowbody aircraft currently in operation, and classifies it as top-quality tier 1 due to its market depth and desirability among approximately 185 global operators. The 737-800 is one of the world's most widely used aircraft and most attractive narrowbodies to finance. Affirmation Factor: Fitch considers the Affirmation Factor (i.e. the likelihood that UAL would affirm these aircraft in the event of a bankruptcy) for the aircraft in this portfolio to be high, as all are considered strategically important for UAL. The 777-300ERs, which make up the largest portion of the collateral, are a key element of UAL's widebody fleet. UAL placed the order for these 777s in 2015, with the goal of replacing older aircraft and modernizing its fleet. United currently operates 20 747s, and as those aircraft leave the fleet, the 777-300ER will represent UAL's premier large widebody aircraft. Importantly, United will operate a fleet of only 14 777-300ERs in total, seven of which are included in this transaction. Along with the 787-9s, the UAL 2016-2 collateral pool will be around 5% of UAL's widebody fleet, making it unlikely that the company would reject these aircraft in the event of a bankruptcy. The 787s are a meaningful addition to the fleet, allowing UAL to serve city pairs that were not previously accessible with older 767s. In addition, the 787 features significantly lower costs, including 20% lower fuel consumption, and 30% lower airframe maintenance costs, compared to similarly sized aircraft. The 737-900ER comprises 18% of UAL's mainline fleet, making this one of the key aircraft in its lineup. The new deliveries will largely be used to replace older 757-200s as they are taken out of the fleet. The range of the 900ER makes it an ideal plane for longer distance domestic routes, while incorporating significantly lower trip costs than the less fuel efficient 757-200. United still operates 77 757s between the -200 and -300 model, which are much more likely to be rejected in a bankruptcy scenario compared to the -900ERs in this portfolio. The 737-800 is also one of United's workhorse aircraft. The company operates 134 of them, with 737-800s serving each of United's hubs. UAL is one of the largest operators of the aircraft today, ranking just behind the likes of Southwest and American Airlines, which illustrates the importance of the 737 to United's fleet. The fact that this transaction consists entirely of brand-new deliveries and has a low total expected cost of funding also makes it unlikely that the aircraft would be rejected in a distress situation. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Ratings for this transaction are driven by a harsh downside scenario in which United declares bankruptcy, chooses to reject the collateral aircraft, and where the aircraft are remarketed in the midst of a severe slump in aircraft values. Specific assumptions regarding value stress rates, etc. are covered elsewhere in this press release. RATING SENSITIVITIES Both the AA and A tranche ratings are primarily based on a top-down analysis based on the value of the collateral. Therefore, a negative rating action could be driven by an unexpected decline in collateral values. Potential risks for the 777-300ER include potential impacts from the entry of the 777x, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2020, and from the potential for discounting as Boeing looks to fill its production gap. Current generation 737s (both the 800 and 900ER) could be affected by the entry of the MAX. Senior tranche ratings could also be affected by a perceived change in the affirmation factor or deterioration in the underlying airline credit. The 'AA' tranche may also be downgraded to below the 'AA' category if United's IDR were downgraded to 'B-' or below, as stipulated in Fitch's EETC criteria. Fitch currently rates United at 'BB-'/Outlook Positive. Variation from Criteria: Fitch looks to its Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance dated Sept 1, 2016 for guidance on rating requirements for direct counterparties including liquidity facility providers. Criteria stipulate that in cases where the senior-most tranche of rated debt is rated in the 'AA' category, the liquidity provider should maintain an Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of at least 'A-'. Note that the transaction documents that govern this EETC stipulate a downgrade threshold for the 'AA' tranche liquidity facility provider of 'BBB+', representing a variation from Fitch's criteria. The variation recognizes that this aspect of the counterparty criteria does not directly apply to EETC ratings. In particular, Fitch's EETC criteria stipulate that in order to maintain a senior tranche rating in the 'AA' rating category, the underlying airline must be rated at least 'B'. However, if the liquidity facility were to be drawn due to non-payment of interest, the airline would be rated below the 'B' rating level. Thus, the ratings on the senior tranche would have already been downgraded below the 'AA' category, at which point, the threshold rating of 'A-' stipulated in our counterparty criteria is not applicable. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings: United Airlines 2016-2 pass-through trust: --Series 2016-2 class AA certificates 'AA (EXP)'; --Series 2016-2 class A certificates 'A (EXP)'. Fitch currently rates United as follows: United Continental Holdings, Inc. --IDR 'BB-'; --Senior unsecured rating 'BB-/RR4'. United Airlines, Inc. --IDR 'BB-'; --Secured bank credit facility 'BB+/RR1'.

According to Boeing's annual current market outlook, China is expected to become the world's first trillion-dollar aviation market within 20 years, China's Xinhua news agency reported. As China's economic transition into a more consumer-based economy, the aviation industry will play a key role," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing with Boeing Commercial Airplanes. China's continuous economic growth will bring vitality to the aviation market, Tinseth said. Besides, new airliners and a rising middle-class will drive market growth. "As travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years," he said. China has become Boeing's largest customer in the world. In the past three years, Boeing delivered to Chinese customers with 25 percent of its total aircraft production. To meet demand from the surging middle class in China and throughout Asia, low-cost carriers and the traditional full-service airlines have been adding planes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel. Boeing estimated that China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035. And China' s widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes. According to Boeing statistics, China' s single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft. The widebody fleet only represents about 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes give us reasons to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Empowering by its growing e-commerce business, the air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China. Boeing forecast the country will also need about 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters. -- BERNAMA >> Newslist Previous Top Stories Najib Condemns Missile Attack On Makkah Zahid Discusses Strengthening Bilateral Ties With Japan Rally Theatrics Of The Opposition - Najib Other News Headlines Selangor Umno Cannot Stop Members From Participating At Tomorrow's Rally - Noh- politic Labuan IBFC To Offer Cost-effective & Lucrative Solutions To Local Businesses- business Perak Goalkeeper Eyes Debut In AFF Suzuki Cup- sports Malaysia's Halal Products Welcomed In China- features Former Sri Lankan Diplomat Arrested For Corruption- world Most Read News Democracy Means Follow The Constitution - Salleh Minimum 3A, 3B In UPSR For Fully Residential Schools' Admission Former Bernama Executive Editor Hurt In Robbery By Two Armed Men Home | Sitemap | Contact Us | General | Politics | Business | Sports | Features | World | Full News List | Archived News | RSS Feeds © 2016 BERNAMA.

Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in Chinaand throughout Asia, Boeing said. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 percent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. Chinese rivals China's rapidly growing e-commerce business, already the largest in the world -- also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing's deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe's Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The U.S. firm says it made more than half of China's commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 percent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919,China's first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Tinseth said Boeing was "absolutely" vigilant about Chinese competitors. "With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity" for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. "There are areas with COMAC where we're partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors," he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth $5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

Photo: AFP The country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:25 PM, September 13, 2016 Updated: 8:14 PM, September 13, 2016 BEIJING — China will become the world’s first trillion-dollar aviation market as its expanding middle class takes to the skies in ever greater numbers, US manufacturer Boeing predicted on Tuesday (Sept 13). The world’s most populous country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth US$1.03 trillion (S$1.4 trillion) by 2035, Boeing said in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 per cent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Mr Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development,” he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in China and throughout Asia, Boeing said. “The continuing expansion of China’s middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China’s long-haul market,” said Mr Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 per cent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. China’s rapidly growing e-commerce business — already the largest in the world — also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing’s deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe’s Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The US firm says it made more than half of China’s commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 per cent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919, China’s first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing’s 737 and Airbus’ A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Mr Tinseth said Boeing was “absolutely” vigilant about Chinese competitors. “With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity” for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. “There are areas with COMAC where we’re partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors,” he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth US$5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

GiSAT will provide broadcast and broadband capability to a targeted 35 sub-Saharan nations in Africa. GiSat will use Boeing’s tried and tested HS-702 model satellite for a private consortium based on the Cayman Islands. The satellite to deliver streaming media, digital broadcast and other communications services to Sub-Saharan Africa. With a coverage area encompassing 35 countries and 750 million people, GiSAT will deliver higher data rates at lower costs than previous satellites serving this part of the world. “Our vision for GiSAT is to provide end users with connectivity and services that are affordable, rich in local content and truly broadband in nature,” said Bahram Pourmand, CEO, Global IP. “With the ability to reconfigure the GiSAT on-board processor, the Boeing digital payload will allow us to broadcast different channels to different beams from different locations, providing better service to broadcasters, mobile operators and ISPs.” “Boeing’s latest digital payload – the most advanced design in the industry – offers greater flexibility for Global IP’s customers,” said Mark Spiwak, president of Boeing Satellite Systems International. “Boeing is committed to driving innovation in satellite technology so that our customers can bring the benefits of reliable, high-speed communications to people across the globe.” Scheduled to enter service in 2019, GiSAT is designed to operate with more than 10 gateways in Europe and multiple gateways within Africa. Privately owned Global IP was founded by three satellite industry veterans with 75 years of combined experience providing satellite products and services in emerging markets. The company CEO, Bahram Pourmand, was until recently EVP/GM, International Division of Hughes Network Systems LLC. The other two founders, Emil Youssefzadeh and Umar Javed were founders and executives of STM, one of the VSAT industry pioneers with a 15 year track record in Africa before sale of STM in 2013 in a private equity transaction.

The plane maker projects demand in China for 6,810 aircraft valued at $1.025tn, Boeing said in Beijing on Tuesday. The aircraft maker last year predicted China would need 6,330 new planes worth $950 billion in the next two decades. In China, "we continue to see very strong passenger traffic growth. We’ve seen a very strong consumer segment of the market", said Randy Tinseth, the vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "The good news for aviation is that is the segment of the economy that services the aircraft market." Carriers across Asia are expanding their fleets as economic growth makes air travel affordable to more people, lifting orders for Boeing and Airbus. The more-optimistic outlook from Boeing, which last year announced a plan to build an aircraft-completion centre in China, comes after it delivered a record number of planes to China in 2015. The plane maker won more orders from Chinese carriers including China Southern Airlines’ Xiamen Airlines unit this year. Passenger traffic will expand 6.4 per cent annually in China over the next 20 years, Boeing said. About 71 per cent of the new aircraft demand in China will be for growth, the plane maker said. Including a retained fleet of 910 planes, China will have 7,720 aircraft by 2035, the company said. The depreciation of the yuan has improved profitability of Chinese airlines and has not dampened orders at Boeing, Mr Tinseth said. The Chinese currency has weakened 4.6 per cent against the dollar in the past 12 months, the worst performer among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The aircraft-maker predicted China will need 5,110 new single-aisle jets with a market value of $535bn through 2035, or 75 per cent of total new deliveries. The widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes. China’s narrowbody and widebody fleet account for about 18 per cent and 5 per cent respectively of the global figures, Boeing said. In September last year, Boeing said it will open a facility in China with Commercial Aircraft of China to paint, complete interiors of and deliver the single-aisle 737 aircraft to Chinese companies. The US company is still working closely with Chinese partners on the details and will issue a statement at a later date, Mr Tinseth said. The plane maker said it expects 39,620 new aircraft valued at $5.9tn to be delivered worldwide in the next 20 years. business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments Related Air China builds bridge with BOC Aviation in jet sale and lease deal China creates Dh192bn fund to restructure state enterprises Airbus and Boeing get US go-ahead for $50bn aircraft deal with Iran Boeing 777X set to become world’s first flying iPad More Aviation Supercars can now travel in style from Dubai with Emirates Skywheels US regional airline Republic set to fly out of bankruptcy soon Bombardier’s passenger jet woes spur high-cost refinancing Brazil approves Qatar Airways’ stake purchase in Chile-based Latam Airlines MOST VIEWED Business | All Standard Chartered cuts 150 jobs in the UAE, may lay off more by year-end What happens if Dubai tenant stays in property without signing new contract on expiry?

The world's most populous country is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth $1.03 trillion by 2035, Boeing said in its annual China Current Market Outlook. Passenger traffic is estimated to increase 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years as the country reforms its economy to rely more on consumption and the service industry to drive growth, said Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes. For Boeing, China is expected to add more than 6,800 new aircraft to its commercial fleet worth $1.03 trillion by 2035 ©Goh Chai-Hin (AFP/File) "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," he said. Chinese carriers have been expanding their fleets and adding new point-to-point services to cater to both leisure and business travel demand from an increasing number of affluent consumers in China and throughout Asia, Boeing said. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Of the 6,810 new aircraft it will need during the 2016-2035 period, 75 percent will be single-aisle planes with 90-230 seats, Boeing said. A total of 1,560 widebody aircraft are seen as needed, according to the company. - Chinese rivals - China's rapidly growing e-commerce business -- already the largest in the world -- also drives demand for cargo planes, with 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters forecast to be added over the next two decades. A quarter of Boeing's deliveries over the last three years were to Chinese airlines, it says. Boeing, maker of the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner, competes with Europe's Airbus for global dominance in the aircraft market. The US firm says it made more than half of China's commercial jetliners currently in operation, while Airbus says it has an almost 50 percent share. But both Boeing and Airbus are facing rising competition from Chinese rivals, who are supported by the government as Beijing sees the lucrative, technology-intensive industry as of strategic importance and a symbol of national pride. In November last year, state-backed Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (COMAC) rolled out the C919, China's first domestically developed narrow-body passenger plane that would compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus' A320. Airbus in March started construction on a new facility to deliver wide-body planes in China while Boeing has reportedly submitted to the Chinese government plans for a factory in the eastern province of Zhejiang. Tinseth said Boeing was "absolutely" vigilant about Chinese competitors. "With such a large domestic base, there is an opportunity" for a Chinese airplane maker, he told reporters. "There are areas with COMAC where we're partners, and there are areas where we compete. We will be strong partners and we will be strong competitors," he said. Boeing said in July it expected a combined 39,600 jets worth $5.9 trillion will be needed globally over the next 20 years.

Boeing released its annual China Current Market Outlook (CMO) today in Beijing, estimating the total value of those new airplanes at $1.025 trillion. China becomes the first trillion dollar aviation market in Boeing's forecast. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, vice president of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years." Boeing predicts China will need 5,110 new single-aisle airplanes through 2035, accounting for 75 percent of the total new deliveries. Low-cost carriers and full-service airlines have been adding airplanes and expanding new point-to-point services to cater for both leisure and business travel demand from a rising middle class in China and throughout Asia. Tinseth said the backlog from Chinese customers demonstrates that the new 737 MAX 8 and the current Next-Generation 737-800 are at the heart of the single-aisle market. Boeing forecasts the widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes such as the 787, 777 and 777X.  This year's forecast reflects a continued shift from very large airplanes to efficient new small and medium widebody airplanes. China's single-aisle fleet currently accounts for about 18 percent of global single-aisle aircraft; however, China's widebody fleet only represents approximately 5 percent of the global widebody segment. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes with new technologies, capabilities and efficiencies, gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," said Tinseth. Driven by China's growing e-commerce business – already the largest in the world – air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China, with the need for 180 new freighters and 410 converted freighters.

The complete forecast is available at www.boeing.com/cmo. Today, Boeing jets are the mainstay of China's air travel and cargo system. More than 50 percent of all the commercial jetliners operating in China are Boeing airplanes. Meanwhile, China has a component role on every current Boeing commercial airplane model – the Next-Generation 737, 747, 767, 777, as well as the world's most technologically advanced airplane, the 787 Dreamliner. Over 9,000 Boeing airplanes fly throughout the world with integrated China-built parts and assemblies.

The latest estimate of 6,810 planes is 7.6 percent higher than the 6,330 aircraft predicted last year. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, said in a statement. He also said that he expects passenger traffic to grow 6.4 percent in China annually over the next 20 years. Boeing has stayed bullish on China even as other U.S. companies have expressed concern over the country's slower economic growth. A senior Boeing executive said in August that the plane maker was not seeing any softness in demand in China.

Bombproof yacht and flash jet  Like any billionaire worth his salt, Andrey Melnichenko is the proud owner of a superyacht. Creatively named ‘Motor Yacht A’, the boat which sailed into London was created by legendary French designer Philippe Starck. It’s 390ft long, weighs 5,959 tons and has 1.7in thick bomb-proof windows — not to mention a helipad on the sixth deck (there are eight decks in total) and a disco with glass ceiling, which looks up into the swimming pool on the deck above. But this isn’t the 44-year-old industrialist’s only luxury vessel. Fresh out of the docks and set for official launch this year, their new yacht is, at 468ft long, the world’s ninth longest, has three masts (the largest ever made) that are taller than Big Ben’s tower — and reportedly cost £313 million. When their £225 million superyacht cruised into London last week, Tower Bridge had to be raised to let it through. Andrey Melnichenko and his glamorous wife Aleksandra's yatch (pictured with Aleksandra) is 390ft long and weighs 5,959 tons Another Starck design, it features the largest piece of curved glass ever made — 193sq ft — which runs along one stretch of deck, in lieu of railings. There is even said to be an observation pod at the bottom, so the sailing couple can enjoy stunning views of the sea. There are, of course, occasions, when billionaires just want to get from A to B. For these they have a Boeing Business jet, registration M-YBBJ, stamped with their personal logo — a capital A representing both their names, surrounded by stencilled foliage — which is said to be emblazoned on everything including the couple’s stationery and napkins. The Boeing 737 would set buyers back in the region of £42 million, and that’s without all the interior decoration that the discerning billionaire requires. When they’re on terra firma, Andrey was a fan of a sleek, reliable £200k Bentley. more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Seabed 'lifts' out of the water following NZ earthquake Watch video Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Watch video New Zealand earthquake transforms road into cliff Watch video Good pup!

In London, the tycoon once snapped up a Berkeley Square apartment from property developer Christian Candy for £2.9 million in 2002, although he no longer owns it. But that’s a mere pied-a-terre compared with the couple’s 35-acre Ascot estate, a short chauffeur-driven hop from the Queen at Windsor, which has been valued at £24 million. It has formal gardens, parkland and forest, a separate building housing a spa and swimming pool and another for staff accommodation. Just outside London, the tycoon also owns an estimated £24 million estate near Ascot set over 35 manicured-acres - which is within driving distance of Windsor Castle, the Queen's preferred residence when in the south  The three-storey property was originally home to Middle Eastern royalty and had 20 bedrooms and 20 living rooms. But the Melnichenkos thought everything was a little tired, and quickly renovated it. Restyled by French interior designer Jacques Garcia, it is decorated with antique black and white marble floors and 18th-century French furnishings. Aleksandra — who likes to be known as Sandra — supervises the interior design of all her properties. In Moscow, the couple — who have a four-year-old daughter — are believed to own a home in a settlement just outside the city, where neighbours include several former Russian officials. THE GLOBE-TROTTING POOCH CALLED VALA  Purebred Maltese Vala who travels with the family on the yacht  Purebred Maltese Vala was a Valentine’s Day gift from husband to wife and is possibly the best-travelled pooch on the planet. The much-loved pet accompanied the couple — who have a four-year-old daughter — to more than 40 countries.  When they visited New Zealand they forked out an undisclosed sum so that Vala could stay on board his superyacht, in lieu of quarantine. Andrey owns a £9 million 2,800 sqft duplex penthouse overlooking Central Park in New York, which he is said to have paid for in cash. Then there is the obligatory villa in the South of France — in their case in the aptly named Billionaire’s Bay, Cap d’Antibes, where a property won’t leave you much change from £100 million. Neighbours include fellow Russian Roman Abramovich, as well as the Heineken family. Priceless art in every room   The £225 million maiden voyage of his superyacht was reportedly to southern Norway to ‘pick up’ three Monets. Aleksandra is said to sleep next to two enormous works from the artist’s Water Lilies series and is a fan of the French impressionists. All the couple’s homes — floating and otherwise — are decorated with artwork worthy of the best galleries. Indeed, they have loaned some of their collection to museums. When Russian Vogue visited the Ascot estate back in 2011, they found a marble hallway lined with sculptures by 18th-century artist Jean-Baptiste Pigalle, works by contemporary artist Marc Quinn (he is also responsible for a giant orchid sculpture in the garden) along with two canvases from 20th-century Italian Lucio Fontana’s white series. The walls of the living room and library were bedecked with 18th and 19th-century art, inspired by the Frick Collection — a U.S institution known for its array of Old Masters and European sculpture and decorative arts. Another living room is decorated with lithographs made by order of Napoleon. ‘We buy what we like. Favourite works are exhibited in the rooms which we visit more often,’ said Aleksandra. Rise of 'Serbian Angelina Jolie'  Aleksandra started her modelling career in Serbia when she was 15. At 17 she became a member of girl band Models, Serbia’s answers to the Spice Girls. One Models hit was called Money, Money with the lyrics: ‘Money money money I love only money . . .’ Her Serbian father was an architect and Croatian mother an artist. She started school at the Mathematical High School, in Belgrade, and later studied at the city’s Faculty of International Management. Multi-lingual, she speaks English, Spanish and Italian as well as Serbian and Russian and has been nicknamed the Serbian Angelina Jolie. Stars sang at the £3m wedding   The couple met in the South of France when Aleksandra was 28, and Andrey 33 and married there two years later in a £3million, three-day extravaganza. Whitney Houston, Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias were flown in to perform at the celebration, at an estimated cost of £1million. A replica of an ancient Russian chapel was erected for their wedding ceremony and jets and rooms in a five-star hotel were booked for 300 guests. The couple met in the South of France when Aleksandra was 28, and Andrey 33 and married there two years later in a £3million, three-day extravaganza  The bride wore a stunning strapless Vera Wang number, food was prepared by the renowned chef Alain Ducasse and the couple went off to honeymoon on the Red Sea. Socialising with celebrities For a scrupulously private billionaire — he hates the term oligarch — it seems only appropriate that among Andrey’s wealthy friends is that other intensely private billionaire Roman Abramovich. As a couple, the Melnichenko’s love to entertain. Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher (before their split) were guests on Motor Yacht A for one particular New Year’s celebration in glossy St Bart’s. Other celebrity pals include a string of fashion designers and Eva Cavalli, wife of Italian designer Roberto Cavalli.

Share this article Share The couple also move in similar circles to Prince Andrew, and Aleksandra has been pictured with both his ex-girlfriend Caroline Stanbury and his friend Goga Ashkenazi, the Kazhak billionaire who is said to have brokered a controversial deal to sell his Sunningdale mansion for £15million. For her 38th birthday earlier this year Aleksandra celebrated in Las Vegas (flying in on her private jet) with female friends including Demi Moore and Caroline Stanbury. The night ended at a show by Australian male strip act — Thunder from Down Under. J-Lo was £1m party act  Since their wedding in 2005, they have hosted a string of glossy parties, with a list of star performers that would fill a festival line-up. ‘The boat [Motor Yacht A] is perfect for parties, and we are always looking forward to the next one,’ Aleksandra told Harper’s Bazaar. It was the setting for a party to mark the couple’s third wedding anniversary in 2008, with music courtesy of Lenny Kravitz. Three years later rapper Snoop Dogg entertained partygoers in a specially built mirrored disco room while Aleksandra partied in an open-backed Azzedine Alaia dress – she changed for the evening from a lime green Givenchy mermaid gown. Aleksandra started her modelling career in Serbia when she was 15 For his wife’s 30th birthday, Andrey spent £1 million flying Jennifer Lopez from the U.S to perform at his Ascot estate — £600,000 for the performance and a further £400,000 to put her entourage up in top hotels. And last year singers Cher and Kylie Minogue are understood to have performed at a party in glitzy St Moritz, Switzerland to mark the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary. Can’t Get You Out of My Head, Love At First Sight and Wow were on the couple’s set list. Fabulous wardrobe  ‘Three hundred days a year I wear jeans and a white T-shirt,’ Aleksandra Melnichenko once claimed. But she more than makes up for it on the other 65 days of the year. The former model’s first high-fashion indulgence was an emerald green Versace number for her school prom when she was 14. On her 30th birthday, she wore a Japanese-inspired Dior by John Galliano gown that weighed more than 80 lb. Hardly surprising then that she says her personal style is either minimalist or ‘totally over-the-top’.Her wardrobe is packed with pieces by Azzedine Alaia (he calls her one of his ‘daughters’), she loves Givenchy and Lacroix and is a regular at the annual couture shows. She considers herself something of a couture curator and readily admits to purchasing clothing that she will never wear, but simply wants to include in her collection. ‘Fashion is the most accessible art form,’ she says, ‘and it gives us the possibility to create our own art by wearing it.’ Multi-million law suits   There's nothing like a bit of super-rich litigation. Andrey complained that the finish on the paintwork of Motor Yacht A looked cloudy and that paint appeared to be running and sued Azko Nobel, the owner of Dulux, for £62 million, claiming he had to redecorate at a cost of £15 million, as well as fork out £2.5 million a month for a replacement vessel. The case is understood to have been settled out of court. In 2013 they sued over a £423,000 sculpture by Polish artist Igor Mitoraj, claiming it was almost half the height of the promised 7ft. The case against the dealer who sold them the work was settled, according to legal documents. Earlier this year Aleksandra filed a lawsuit against the board of her Central Park home, alleging defects in the building’s roof, façade, windows and terrace doors that caused water damage in her penthouse. Small army of minions   Maintaining a billionaire lifestyle wouldn’t be possible without an army of helpers. Their yacht has a crew of 37 including chefs, deckhands, engineers, and a special team to take care of watersports — all wear Starck-designed uniforms. Their new sailing yacht is expected to have an even larger crew of 54. On land, the Ascot estate alone employs four housekeepers, two house managers, three security guards and 14 gardening staff, according to a 2008 building permit. And that isn’t counting the minions who tend to Aleksandra’s glamorous looks.

By Mary-Ann Russon September 12, 2016 18:40 BST Boeing and Nasa have high hopes of being able to commercialise a super-efficient subsonic aircraft featuring blended wing body technology within the next decadeBoeing Aerospace manufacturer Boeing and Nasa are currently testing a plane model featuring an advanced concept called Blended Wing Body (BWB), in the hopes of being able to make conventional subsonic aircraft much more efficient within the next 10 years. The BWB concept is revolutionary because it features a triangular tailless design – similar to a stingray, that smoothly merges the plane's wings into its body – which is a huge departure from the conventional tube and wing design that commercial airliners use today. Aerospace engineers have been theorising about fixed-wing BWB planes since the 1990s, because the shape of the plane should enable it to be ultra-efficient in the air because it can generate a greater amount of "lift", which is the force a plane generates as it moves through the air, perpendicular to the oncoming air flow direction. In theory, a BWB plane should have a much greater lift-to-drag ratio than a conventional aircraft, and lift reduces the size and drag of the wings, which reduces the amount of fuel needed to propel the plane forwards. Boeing wants to use BWB to build super-efficient subsonic planes that would initially be used by the military and for refuelling other aircraft in mid-air, and to this end has been experimenting since 1997 with various iterations of a full-scale unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) called Boeing X-48 that features BWB characteristics. The latest tests by Boeing and Nasa at the Nasa Langley Research Center use a BWB aircraft model that is only 6% scale with a 13ft wingspan, as the researchers are trying to prove how well the BWB concept works by testing the model in a 14 by 22ft subsonic wind tunnel with a technique called particle imagery velocimetry (PIV), whereby the researchers map airflow over the aeroplane using lasers and smoke. Eventually, Nasa and Boeing want to create a manned prototype aircraft and they think the technology can be commercialised by 2030 to be used by the US Air Force. "We believe our body of work, both in design, test and engineering, is technically superior when compared to other designs in the marketplace," said Boeing's vice president for aeromechanics technology Naveed Hussain. "The BWB is showing great potential to offer structural, aerodynamic and operating efficiencies as well as the capability to be more fuel efficient and quieter over more traditional aircraft designs."

  Subscribe! | Login | Search Aerospace and Defense Catch Up on RFID For years, adoption in these sectors was limited. But now, requirements by Airbus, Boeing and the U.S. Department of Defense have led suppliers to deploy the technology. By Mark Roberti Tags: Aerospace, Asset Tracking, Defense, Manufacturing, Sensors, Supply Chain PDFEmailPrintDefinitionsSave Article Sep 12, 2016— I'm not sure if it's just the positive news articles that have been written about radio frequency identification, or a natural process of evolution, but it's clear to me that aerospace and defense companies that had previously been simply complying with requests from customers—namely, Airbus, Boeing and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)—by tagging shipments or parts are now beginning to use the technology for their own benefits. And this is the reason we are holding an RFID in Aerospace and Defense event in Long Beach, Calif., on Oct. 20 (with RFID certification training taking place on Oct. 19). BAE Systems is a good example of a company that has gone beyond tagging for customers and is using the technology to achieve internal benefits. BAE's Electronic Systems division, which supplies mission-critical electronic systems, including flight and engine controls, surveillance and reconnaissance sensors, and power- and energy-management systems, to commercial and defense companies, is using RFID to automate the tracking of tools and equipment. This reduces search times, streamlines equipment maintenance and improves equipment utilization. Joshua Landry, the company's program-engineering manager, will be speaking at the event. Orbital ATK is another company using RFID for its own benefit. Its Aircraft Commercial Center of Excellence (ACCE) manufactures composite structures for the Airbus A350 XWB and Boeing 787 Dreamliner programs. The ACCE has created a "visual factory," in which each step of the composite-manufacturing process is monitored automatically, from raw material receipt through component production and eventual shipment to customers (see ATK Tracks Composite Airc). Jim Morgan, who helped set up the system for Orbital ATK, will speak at RFID in Aerospace and Defense to explain why RFID is a critical enabler for ramping up production for the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) contracts. It's not just suppliers to Airbus, Boeing and the DOD that are taking advantage of RFID. Because planes are now being delivered with tags on some parts, customers are beginning to employ the technology as well. Delta Air Lines, which operates more than 5,000 flights daily across an extensive domestic and international network, is using RFID in its maintenance operations, tagging onboard aircraft equipment that must be managed for both presence and expiration date (see RFID Reduces Oxygen-Generator Waste for Delta Air Lines). New aircraft come with tagged items, and Delta has installed more than 240,000 RFID tags on oxygen generators, life vests and cabin emergency equipment on all of its existing owned and leased aircraft. As a result, the airline can now check the expiration dates on oxygen generators aboard a 757 in less than two minutes, compared to approximately eight man-hours without RFID. Rick Lewis, a business analyst for aircraft maintenance at Delta, will speak at the event, explaining how this saves Delta money and helps it plan more effectively. In addition to learning from these speakers and hearing other great case studies, event attendees will be able to meet the RFID companies that have developed solutions specifically designed for the aerospace and defense sectors. I hope to see you at the event on Oct. 20 in Long Beach. Mark Roberti is the founder and editor of RFID Journal. If you would like to comment on this article, click on the link below.

With a price tag around $1.5 trillion, the F-35 is the most expensive weapons system in history. (Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) Not Much Bang for the Buck From the July 2016 Trumpet Print Edition » America has the most expensive military in the world. That doesn’t necessarily mean it has the strongest. Here’s why. By Richard Palmer   Print Font size Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google+ Read comments (#) Images Sidebars $6 Billion for Faulty Submarines U.S. Marine Corps Not Combat Ready Related subjects Military/Defense United States Recently featured ‘The Shaping of the World Is Part of the Christian Mission’ New Zealand Hit by Severe Earthquake Marijuana Wins Big on Election Night Migrant Gangs Rule German Streets Pope Francis’s Lutheran Reconciliation on Reformation Anniversary How safe is the United States? Could it be defeated by a foreign nation? Many would immediately answer “No.” The world’s top military spender, America accounts for over a third of global military expenditure—spending more than the next seven nations combined. But does big spending buy invincibility? America is great at throwing money at problems, from health care to education. The question is, how is that money being spent? A shocking amount of it is simply wasted. Exactly how much is unknown because the Pentagon has never been audited, but it is at least tens of billions. However, the amount of money squandered is not the most dangerous part of the story. Instead, it is what this huge waste reveals about the people in charge of America’s security. A study of this waste reveals that a casual reliance on America’s massive defense establishment is dangerously flawed. ‘The System Is Broken’ The U.S. 7th Fleet is the most powerful naval group at sea. Its 50 to 70 ships and submarines, 140 aircraft and 20,000 Navy and Marine personnel protect America’s interests in the Pacific. It was also all but hijacked by one foreign national. That man is Leonard Glenn Francis, known as “Fat Leonard.” He ran Glenn Defense Marine Asia, and used it to steal tens of millions from the U.S. Navy. gdma has supplied husbanding services to the 7th Fleet for years. When warships dock, they need fuel, supplies and maintenance; they often need towing into dock and have to pay for the parking space. gdma provided these services—at vastly inflated prices. In just five port visits in Thailand by U.S. ships, Francis overbilled the Navy $3 million for fuel alone. The worst part of the “Fat Leonard scandal,” as it is known, is how Francis evaded detection. He bribed the commander of a destroyer and the deputy logistics officer for the fleet with gifts, money and prostitutes. They passed on classified information on U.S. ship movements. They even rerouted ships to stop at ports where Francis could overcharge the Navy. Francis bribed a supervisory agent at the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, who helped thwart any investigations into his dealings. If Francis had been working for a foreign power, instead of merely for money, this could have been not only a financial disaster but also a deadly tactical one. Francis was arrested in September 2013, but the scandal’s fallout continues. Both the director of Naval Intelligence and the director of Intelligence Operations have had their access to classified material suspended. This has left America in the farcical situation where the man running the Navy’s secret operations isn’t trusted to read any secret material. In 2015, three other admirals were censured and retired. “Managing the command structure at the top of the Navy has become a nightmare since the Justice Department began the investigation,” wrote Matthew Gault, cohost of Reuters’ military podcasts. “No one knows who will stay, who will retire, and who will go to jail” (April 13, 2015). This affair is just one of several scandals the U.S. military has suffered in the past decade. “For generations the Pentagon has run the world’s mightiest armed forces with inadequate budgetary oversight. The system is broken,” Gault wrote in 2013. “Something needs to change, and it needs to change yesterday. If it doesn’t, the Fat Leonard debacle—with its self-serving commanders, misspent millions and compromised military secrets—could become the norm” (Nov. 18, 2013). Investigations and lawsuits are ongoing regarding Fat Leonard-like cases in the 5th and 6th Fleets (responsible for the Middle East and Europe). In 2013, the U.S. government began investigating three Navy intelligence officers who charged $1.6 million for silencers that should have cost $8,000. Twin sisters reportedly collected $20 million over the course of six years, largely by fraud and abusing the system, through their company, c&D Distributors, which in one case charged half a million dollars to ship three screws to marines in Iraq. This goes further than a few dodgy individuals: Giants of the U.S. defense establishment are involved. In 2003, an Air Force undersecretary overpaid Boeing for a set of tanker planes. She soon quit her job and went to Boeing, with a six-figure salary. The company had already given jobs to her daughter and her daughter’s fiancé. She pleaded guilty to corruption and was sentenced to nine months in jail. Boeing’s chief financial officer at the time also went to jail. Beyond the money wasted, what does it mean that the U.S. military’s procurement system is “broken”? What else about the military is “broken”? If “self-serving commanders” could become the norm, how else will America be harmed? ‘We’re Going About This All Wrong’ The U.S. spent a vast amount of money in Iraq and Afghanistan—the Congressional Research Service estimated $1.6 trillion. Time magazine estimated the long-term cost between $4 and $6 trillion. In these two countries, America was spending $20 billion a year just on air conditioning. That is larger than Italy’s entire defense budget for 2015. The fact that Afghanistan is sliding back toward the Taliban and Iran is taking over Iraq raises the overarching question of just what those trillions of dollars purchased. But the figures on just the straight-up waste are also huge. The bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan reported in 2011 that “[a]t least $31 billion, and possibly as much as $60 billion, has been lost to contract waste and fraud”—just one narrow type of waste—in Afghanistan and Iraq. One of the most notorious examples of waste was $36 million spent on a command facility in Afghanistan for 1,500 personnel that was never used. Three generals requested the project to be canceled, saying it was unnecessary, but they were overruled. When investigators looked into it, commanders told subordinates to obstruct the inquiry. There’s plenty of Fat Leonard-style corruption too. Authorities identified $1 million in overpayments for fuel in a two-month period in Afghanistan. In 2014, $45.5 million went missing from salaries meant to be paid to Afghan police. Besides the money spent directly on the invasion, the U.S. poured $100 billion into reconstructing Afghanistan. That’s more than America spent on the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe after World War ii. Propublica estimated that $17 billion of that was wasted. This includes a base that was never used, roads that quickly fell apart, and payments to nonexistent soldiers. Half a billion dollars went to cargo planes that were hardly used and then scrapped; $8 billion was spent on combating the drug trade, with no result. In Iraq, the U.S. spent $50 billion on reconstruction. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction estimated at least $8 billion of it was wasted. John F. Sopko has worked hard to expose waste of these funds as the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (sigar). In a speech last September, he talked about schools built with American money that were “literally crumbling and falling apart” and hospitals that “actually became unsafe because their electrical and water supply systems failed.” One problem was investing in projects that would have been great in America but just didn’t work in Afghanistan. The U.S. spent millions on hospitals that were too expensive for the Afghans to keep running. “This sort of thing happens in Afghanistan all the time,” he said. “You would think after 13 years of these types of occurrences, and hundreds of cases of sigar pointing these problems out, that someone would wake up, look around, and say ‘You know what, folks? Maybe we’re going about this all wrong,’” Sopko continued. He described how he had to work hard to persuade one military official not to build high-tech solar-powered lighting at bus stops. How’s that for a metaphor for Afghanistan: America’s generals want to build high-tech lighting for bus stops while the Taliban retake the country. “[A]ll I am seeing is a modus operandi that is woefully out of touch at best, and delusional at worst,” Sopko warned. “We simply must be smarter.” Again there is a hint of a deeper problem. If America’s chain of command is “delusional” about money, how effective is its decision-making in other areas? ‘Made-up Numbers’ The Defense Logistics Agency is responsible for buying and distributing food, fuel, uniform apparel, medical supplies and equipment and weapons system repair parts. The dla was recently exposed spending $7 billion on things it did not need. “How do you buy $7 billion of stuff you don’t need?” asked Maj. Gen. Arnold Punaro (Ret.), who oversees a special task force on logistics for the Pentagon. “If a company did that, they’d be out of business. Even Walmart.” Punaro said this wastage is common. “It has no sense of value or time,” he said. “No one in the Pentagon is looking for a bargain on most days. It’s a cultural thing. These are people that will ship a pallet of water on a C-17.” Waste is epidemic in the military’s central bureaucracy. Between 2003 and 2011, for example, it managed to lose track of $6 billion worth of supplies. A 2013 Reuters special report stated, “Reuters has found that the Pentagon is largely incapable of keeping track of its vast stores of weapons, ammunition and other supplies; thus it continues to spend money on new supplies it doesn’t need and on storing others long out of date. It has amassed a backlog of more than half a trillion dollars in unaudited contracts with outside vendors; how much of that money paid for actual goods and services delivered isn’t known. And it repeatedly falls prey to fraud and theft that can go undiscovered for years, often eventually detected by external law enforcement agencies” (Nov. 18, 2013). In a private company, the Department of Defense method of accounting would be illegal. “Former military service officials say record keeping at the operational level throughout the services is rife with made-up numbers to cover lost or missing information,” wrote Reuters. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in May 2011, “My staff and I learned that it was nearly impossible to get accurate information and answers to questions such as ‘How much money did you spend?’ and ‘How many people do you have?’” In February this year, the Center for International Policy published a report by William D. Hartung outlining more than $33 billion in waste in just 27 instances since President Barack Obama took office. The report is focused narrowly on waste. It doesn’t include expenses like the $360 million spent on weight-loss surgery for servicemen’s families, which would hardly seem to enhance the nation’s fighting ability. Contract Killers The U.S. military has major problems with the way it pays for weapons. For example, the government will often pay companies to fix their own manufacturing defects. As the Government Accountability Office put it, in one investigation into naval contracts, the Navy is “essentially rewarding the shipbuilder for delivering a ship that needed additional work.” David W. Wise wrote on War Is Boring, “The Navy, like the other services, has proven itself incapable of running an effective weapons acquisition program in recent decades. Instead, the services pay increasingly more money for progressively fewer units that often fail to meet original specifications” (May 27). In just about every project, costs rise while capabilities decrease. One notorious example is the Littoral Combat Ship. It was meant to cost $220 million per ship. The first cost triple that. The ships have almost universally bad reviews. They are lightly armored and lose to Chinese ships in just about every simulation. Meanwhile, other firms are building useless weapons. For example, the Army spends around $200 million a year on M1 Abrams tanks that it doesn’t need and that go straight into storage. Why? The tank factory is in the district of the chairman of a key congressional subcommittee. This isn’t an isolated example. Last December, the New York Times wrote that “[l]anguage inserted into the federal budget … directed the Coast Guard to build a $640 million national security cutter in Mississippi that the Coast Guard says it does not need” (Dec. 20, 2015). “I guess that is how it goes,” a spokesman for the Coast Guard said. “But we are good [without it].” One senator wanted the cutter built in his state. In the same budget, another senator pushed for the Navy to be given $1 billion for a destroyer it didn’t ask for because the vessel was likely to be built in her state. Worse, there is strong evidence that America’s weapons are designed primarily to be job creators, not war winners. Franklin C. Spinney is famed for his criticism of U.S. defense procurement. In an essay written back in 1990, he forecast, “The power politics practiced by the Pentagon and Congress continue to drag our nation deeper into a quagmire of spiraling weapons costs, shrinking forces, and high defense budgets.” Now that his predictions have come to pass, it’s clear he is worth listening to. Spinney warned that “the needs of a coherent defense policy have been preempted by the selfish desires of its individual components.” This selfishness is at the heart of his critique. The Pentagon and defense companies engage in what he calls “political engineering.” “Political engineering is the strategy of spreading dollars, jobs and profits to as many important congressional districts as possible,” he wrote. “By designing overly complex weapons, then spreading subcontracts, jobs and profits all over the country, the political engineers in the Defense Department deliberately magnify the power of these forces to punish Congress should it subsequently try to reduce defense spending by terminating major procurement programs.” This seems to explain the problems with the F-35 fighter jet. With a price tag around $1.5 trillion, it is the most expensive weapons system in history. It is also the future of U.S. airpower: If all goes to plan, the majority of the U.S. military’s planes will be F-35s. Yet the F-35 is commonly criticized for being overly complex. A single unnecessary system—one designed to make it easier to order spare parts—leaves the entire program so vulnerable to hacking that a cyberattack could ground the whole fleet. Meanwhile, experts say Congress is unlikely to kill the program because politicians are worried about the jobs that would be lost in key districts. There may be legitimate reasons for not canceling the F-35 program. But that decision should revolve around military consequences, not jobs. These tactics also seem to prevail for America’s newest stealth bomber, the B-21. “By publicly announcing some of the program’s subcontractors, officials have tied the program to specific congressional districts, making it difficult for members of Congress with plants in their districts to oppose or criticize the program for legitimate military and budget reasons without also seeming to act against their districts’ interests,” reported the Project for Government Oversight in March. The wastage and incompetence in America’s defense contracts represent more than merely a financial problem. Yes, America may have spent billions on useless roads or crumbling hospitals—but the same forces behind those purchases could have pushed the U.S. into spending $1.5 trillion, and betting its future, on a flawed plane. A Deadly Weakness When decisions about the military are being made with jobs, Congressional seats and career advancements as the top priority, America’s security is dramatically undermined. Defense wastage exposes a rot at the heart of the military. Who knows the exact reason each military official signed off on billions of useless projects in Afghanistan or bought equipment that is not needed. But the same factors that lead to these decisions—lack of thought, lack of interest, bureaucratic red tape, the inability of different departments to talk to each other—are undoubtedly behind other bad decisions. Misspending is a quantifiable symptom that points to a much deeper sickness. American military decision-makers around the world, from Afghanistan to Congress, have taken their eye off the ball. For some, their goal is personal gain. For others, it’s not rocking the boat. For others, it’s reelection. Too few have defending America from potential enemies as their top priority. This is the biggest reason why the shocking military waste matters. America used to produce cutting-edge military technology at good prices. God blessed America, but no longer. In fact, the curse described in Leviticus 26:20—directed to the ungodly and disobedient modern-day descendants of ancient Israel, of whom America is chief—well applies: “And your strength shall be spent in vain.” We see this in many ways—the fruitless military missions in Afghanistan and Iraq, for example. This massive waste is both a natural result of failed leadership and also a result of this curse. The preceding verse says God “will break the pride of your power.” These verses describe a nation with ample “strength” and “power,” but it is incapable of using it effectively. When America was blessed, God said He made it so that “ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword” (verse 7). One way He did that was by blessing the nation with skilled innovators and manufacturers, allowing the nation to have its technological edge. America still has an edge here. But too few in the military take the potential for a major war seriously. The result is a bloated system that hemorrhages money and leaves this apparently invincible nation dangerously insecure. ▪ More about United States: What Donald Trump Means for Asia A staggering restructuring of power is coming to this volatile region.

The planemaker projects demand in China for 6,810 aircraft valued at $1.025 trillion, making the nation the first trillion-dollar aviation market in its forecast, Boeing said in a statement distributed in Beijing Tuesday. The aircraft maker last year predicted China would need 6,330 new planes worth USD950 billion in the next two decades. In China, “we continue to see very strong passenger traffic growth. We’ve seen a very strong consumer segment of the market,” Randy Tinseth, vice president of marketing at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said at a briefing in Beijing. “The good news for aviation is that is the segment of the economy that services the aircraft market.” Carriers across Asia are expanding their fleets as economic growth makes air travel affordable to more people, lifting orders for Boeing and Airbus Group SE. The more-optimistic outlook from Boeing, which last year announced a plan to build an aircraft-completion center in China, comes after it delivered a record number of planes to China in 2015. The planemaker won more orders from Chinese carriers including China Southern Airlines Co.’s Xiamen Airlines unit this year. Passenger traffic will expand 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years, Boeing said. About 71 percent of the new aircraft demand in China will be for growth, the planemaker said. Including a retained fleet of 910 planes, China will have 7,720 aircraft by 2035, the company said in presentation materials. The depreciation of the yuan has improved profitability of Chinese airlines and hasn’t damped orders at Boeing, Tinseth said. The Chinese currency has weakened 4.6 percent against the dollar in the past 12 months, the worst performer among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The aircraft-maker predicted China will need 5,110 new single-aisle jets with a market value of $535 billion through 2035, or 75 percent of total new deliveries. The widebody fleet will triple in size, requiring 1,560 new airplanes. China’s narrowbody and widebody fleet account for about 18 percent and 5 percent respectively of the global figures, Boeing said. In September last year, Boeing said it will open a facility in China with Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd. to paint, complete interiors of and deliver the single-aisle 737 aircraft to Chinese companies. The U.S. company is still working closely with Chinese partners on the details and will issue a statement at a later date, Tinseth said. The planemaker said it expects 39,620 new aircraft valued at $5.9 trillion to be delivered worldwide in the next 20 years.

(WKRN) – The Pleasant View Volunteer Fire Department has a unique and even fun way to teach kids about fire safety. They have their very own Fire Safety House, and it’s kind of a playhouse for learning set up inside a trailer. “So what we do with this is we visit every single elementary school in our district,” said Abbie Boeing. (Photo: WKRN) “It has your living room area and your kitchen areas. So we can talk about safety in your living rooms, safety in your kitchens, cooking safety, things like that,” she explained. Boeing said there’s also an upstairs so they can teach children what to do if a fire breaks out while they’re sleeping and how to get out. There’s even a fireplace to teach kids not to put toys and objects too close to the heat. Tennesseans in need of a smoke alarm can request one free of charge at TN.gov/fire. This is through the State Fire Marshal’s Office (SFMO) “Get Alarmed” program. Since the Get Alarmed program’s inception in 2012, the SFMO has distributed over 122,000 smoke alarms statewide to 475 partnering organizations. Smoke alarms installed through the program are credited with saving 147 Tennesseans from fire danger so far and helped lower Tennessee’s fire fatality rate to an all-time low in 2015.

A Delta Air Lines jet skidded off a snowy runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport last year because the pilot used too much reverse thrust and lost control of the plane's direction, federal investigators said Tuesday. There were no serious injuries aboard the airliner arriving from Atlanta on March 5, 2015, but the National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart said it was "a very close call." The report found that the captain and first officer were unprepared for the amount of snow that was on the LaGuardia runway because the information that had been provided to them was not current. The Boeing MC-88 veered left, hit a fence with its left wing and came to rest with its nose on leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy Flushing Bay. My day so far. #crashland pic.twitter.com/dpNnGP5oQk — Steve (@steveblaze98) March 5, 2015 The investigators said the captain initiated reverse thrust—one of several braking mechanisms on the aircraft—before the plane's nose wheel hit the runway, which was not proper procedure, according to Delta or Boeing. The report found that overuse of reverse thrust on a slippery surface rendered the rudder useless. The investigators said the first officer told the captain to come out of reverse three times before he finally did, but by then it was too late. The NTSB also faulted the cabin and flight crew for failing to promptly evacuate the 127 passengers from the plane, which began leaking fuel after the wing hit the fence. Investigator Emily Gibson said it took 12 minutes before the first passengers stepped off the aircraft and 17 minutes before all passengers had been evacuated. Reasons for the delay included a lack of decisiveness on the part of the captain, who "did not convey a sense of urgency to evacuate the cabin," she said. Laguardia Airport: 131 passengers/crew on plane. 24 non-life-threatening injuries, 3 of whom transported at this time pic.twitter.com/UlvDtcuHUF — FDNY (@FDNY) March 5, 2015 She said the captain's inaction was compounded by the lead flight attendant's decision to tell passengers they had time to take their coats out of the overhead compartments. Investigators also said the accident disabled the plane's public address and intercom systems, and the crew's training had not addressed handling an emergency landing with no working PA system. Gibson said it was initially not clear to first responders whether there were 125 or 127 passengers on the plane. The crew provided the lower number, which didn't include two lap infants. The transportation board, meeting in Washington, D.C., voted 4-0 to accept the report and recommend policy changes to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident. Atlanta-based Delta said Tuesday in a statement that its top priority "is always the safety of our customers and employees." "We cooperated with the National Transportation Safety Board during the course of the investigation and we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations," the airline said. "Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation."

Because aircraft sizes and utilization will rise, the carriers’ fleets will not need to grow quite as fast, Boeing said, forecasting that aircraft numbers will expand at 5.1% per year. The fleet growth forecast is slower than the 5.3% figure that Boeing issued in 2015 for the 20 years through 2034. The difference appears ...

The world’s largest aerospace company faces a dogfight with Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Raytheon Co. for the contract to produce 351 jets through the T-X advanced trainer program. The winning entry would replace the aging T-38 fleet on which U.S. military pilots have honed their flying skills since 1961. The new T-X fighter by Boeing. Source: Boeing With lights pulsing and booming music, Boeing and Sweden’s Saab AB unveiled their entry Tuesday in St. Louis for the competition that kicks off late this year. Their jet melds a twin tail reminiscent of Boeing’s Super Hornets with a General Electric Co. engine and systems honed through Saab’s Gripen jets. But the real innovation comes through new technology and production processes the companies say will slash manufacturing costs, Darryl Davis, president of Boeing’s Phantom Works research and development organization, told reporters. “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come,” said Leanne Caret, chief executive officer of Boeing’s defense unit. Boeing is the last of the major defense contractors to reveal its concept after plane spotters glimpsed Northrop Grumman’s entry making a test flight last month. And there’s more than a little symbolism to the site Boeing chose to debut the first proposed trainer model: the St. Louis manufacturing center where the company churns out F/A-18 Super Hornets and F-15 fighter jets. “This is their last chance to provide a next-generation dedicated military aircraft for the company and St. Louis,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace and defense analyst with Teal Group. “The Super Hornet can go on for another five years easily, and ditto for the F-15. But the bridge to a sixth-generation fighter would depend on some kind of combat version of this.” Boeing fell 1.2 percent to $128.53 at 3:01 p.m. in New York, leaving the stock down 11 percent this year. Few Contests Military aircraft contests are few and far between in an era of budget constraints, and the Chicago-based planemaker needs new orders to preserve the Missouri industrial base and engineering acumen gained with the 1997 acquisition of McDonnell Douglas Corp. Boeing’s military arm has been eclipsed by the rapid growth of the commercial-jet unit this decade. The defense division accounted for 31 percent of sales last year, down from 50 percent in 2010. The manufacturer has suffered high-profile losses: last year’s stealth-bomber competition to Northrop Grumman, and the joint strike fighter contest to Lockheed’s F-35 in 2001.  Boeing’s largest recent contract win, valued at $51 billion, is for an aerial refueler derived from the 767 jetliner, which is manufactured outside Seattle. The winning T-X design may go on to claim hundreds of overseas orders and spare parts stretching over decades as the Pentagon program spurs other countries to upgrade their trainer fleets. Teal Group forecasts a global market for 2,737 turbine trainers valued at $32.3 billion over the next decade, up from the $19.9 billion of the aircraft delivered from 2006 through 2015, according to a June research report.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter The U.S. Air Force isn’t expected to release final contest criteria until December, picking a winner next year who would begin production in fiscal 2018. The new trainer isn’t slated to begin preparing a new generation of pilots for combat for another eight years. The gap could be longer if funding is squeezed by programs like the F-35 fighter, the KC-46A tanker and a new stealth bomber, the Congressional Research Service said in a report last year. It’s uncertain how the Air Force will weigh an aircraft’s performance against its production costs. Boeing and Northrop Grumman may be at a disadvantage since they are bidding clean-sheet designs against supposedly less expensive, in-service models: the T-50A offered by Lockheed and Korea Aerospace Industries, and Raytheon’s T-100, based on Leonardo’s M-346 trainer. Aboulafia thinks the Lockheed aircraft has an edge “as the only off-the-shelf, supersonic design. We don’t know to what extent Boeing and Northrop Grumman will exceed expectations.” Next Model Boeing already is assembling its second production trainer in St. Louis, employing some of the advanced manufacturing techniques developed over the past five years through its secretive “Black Diamond” initiative. They range from using 3D printing for the plane’s ductwork to a canopy developed with injection molding that shaves a six-week process down to eight days. But the company wants to make sure that work counts in the upcoming competition. Boeing has urged Air Force planners to hold to current criteria “if they are serious about the cost curve,” rather than tilting judging so that planes that exceed threshold requirements will have an advantage, said Davis, the Phantom Works president. By teaming with Sweden’s Saab, Boeing gained a way to tamp down costs and jump-start sales in international markets, said George Ferguson, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “There’s a reason why a number of these teams teamed up with foreign participants,” he said.

For three years, Boeing has been secretive about its proposal to manufacture the new twin-engine, supersonic jet trainer. The Chicago-based company, collaborating with Saab, is directly competing with Northrop Grumman Corp. for a new “clean sheet” design. The Air Force wants a replacement for its T-38 Talon trainer aircraft, first produced by Northrop in 1959. The Talon is used to prep pilots for “front-line fighter and bomber aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, F-15C Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, B-1B Lancer, A-10 Thunderbolt and F-22 Raptor,” according to the service. The service hopes to buy 350 new trainer jets. Photos surfaced last month on social media showing the Northrop version of the aircraft. Northrop spokeswoman Katherine Thompson confirmed to Defense News that the photos were of its trainer, which was conducting taxi testing in Mojave, California. Northrop is partnering with BAE Systems, L-3 and Rolls-Royce on the project. Promo videos of Boeing’s version were posted on the company’s site days after Northrop’s flightline tests. The official Twitter account for Boeing on Sept. 1 also posted, “Mark your calendars: #NewBoeingTX will be revealed in St. Louis on September 13” with a link to the sneak peek videos. Other vendor teams such as Lockheed Martin Corp. and Korea Aerospace Industries, and Raytheon Co., Leonardo-Finmeccanica and CAE Inc. are offering modification designs to current aircraft, but are not competing in clean sheet designs. At the upcoming AFA conference, Boeing will have five exhibit booths on the technology show floor, more than any other defense company presenting at the exposition.

 How Emirates found success with the most controversial jet in the world Benjamin Zhang Sep. 13, 2016, 2:32 PM 73,458 facebook linkedin twitter email print Airbus A380. Airbus More than a decade after its maiden flight, the Airbus A380 superjumbo remains a major point of interest and curiosity for passengers and airline industry insiders alike. As impressive and attention grabbing as the aircraft may be, it hasn't had the same paradigm-shifting effect that the Boeing 747 had upon its debut decades earlier.  Most of the airlines around the world who either operate the A380 or are thinking about investing in the plane have struggled to figure out a way to maximize its revenue generating potential. As a result, Airbus has struggled mightily over the past few years to find new customers for its flagship airliner.  However, the double-decker jet has no bigger supporter than Emirates Airlines. Of the 319 orders Airbus has won for the super jumbo, 140 of them have come from the Dubai-based airline. In comparison, Singapore Airlines has the second largest order with 24 A380s. Why does Emirates love the A380 so much? "Airport congestion around the world is getting worse," Emirates President Sir Tim Clark told Business Insider. "And up-gauging aircraft is a solution for this." Emirates' business strategy involves funneling large masses of people to its palatial home base in Dubai and dispatching them to various destinations around the world. Often times, those destinations are either well-developed first world cities or under developed third-world cities, that are both plagued by airports bursting at the seams with people and planes.  Emirates Airbus A380. REUTERS/Phil Noble According to Sir Tim Clark, the A380 allows Emirates to get ahead of congestion issues at major airport around the world. With infrastructure struggling to keep up with demand for landing slots and airport gates, the superjumbo allows the airline to increase passenger volume with fewer aircraft and fewer flights. "It works great for our network structure's long-haul to long-haul connections," Emirates senior vice president for operations Hubert Frach told Business Insider in an interview. "It allows us to offer efficient connections between developing economies with well established economies." As a result, Emirates and its centrally located-Dubai base has become a gateway — connecting Europe and North America with Africa and Asia.  While other carriers operating the A380 have concerns over filling the double decker's cavernous cabin, Emirates does not seem to have that concern. "Although you can't operate each and every destination with the aircraft, we do see the demand pull of the A380," Frach said. "Take London for example. We operate nine A380 flights into London every day and, believe me, they are all full." And the strategy seems to be working. In May, Emirates announced a record $1.93 billion profit for the last fiscal year with a margin of 8.4%. Although it should be noted that Emirates, along with the rest of the airline industry, has benefited greatly from plummeting fuel costs. In addition, the rapid growth of Emirates and its fellow Middle Eastern carriers Etihad and Qatar have come under criticism from American, United, and Delta Air Lines. The US3 allege that the ME3's stellar performance and service are unfairly augmented by as much as $42 billion in subsidies over the past 10 years. The ME3 have denied these allegations. Emirates president, Sir Tim Clark. REUTERS/Ahmed Jadallah In addition to the operational benefits of the A380, it's also a great marketing piece. "At the Berlin Air Show, we usually bring a brand new A380 that's just been delivered from the Airbus factory in Hamburg and the line to see the plane usually a mile long," Sir Tim Clark told us while in New York for the US Open tennis tournament for which his airline is a major sponsor.  It's a sentiment echoed by Frach. "Every time I'm on an A380, I still see people taking selfies and photos of the plane," the executive added. "It's iconic and it's a customer magnet." Emirates isn't the only airline that understands the marketing power of the superjumbo. In May, Qatar Airways launched its inaugural flight to Atlanta — the home fortress for Delta, arguably the Middle Eastern airlines' staunchest critic. Although the flight is normally operated by a smaller Boeing 777, Qatar decided to make a splash by rolling into town with a superjumbo — an aircraft Delta does not possess in its 800-plane fleet. Etihad operates its glamour routes to London and New York using its A380s as well. Why don't more airlines buy the A380? If the A380 works so well for Emirates, why don't more airlines around the world commit to the plane? "Since the great recession, airlines around the world are run by risk averse boards who don't want to spend $400 million on a single plane,"  Clark said. "Here, we don't have that, it's just me and my boss (Emirates Group chairman H.H. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum)." Qatar Airbus A380 in Atlanta. Qatar Airways Due to geography, Emirates operates only international flights and boasts a fleet of roughly 250 wide-body long haul jets. In addition to the world's largest fleet of A380s, it also boasts the world's largest fleet of Boeing 777s with more than 150 of the twin-engined jets.  However, the reality of the A380 is that it is the largest and most expensive airliner in the world at $428 million a plane. Boeing's 777-9X is second at $400 million. Even though it's capable of offering its operators the lowest per-seat cost of any airliner in the world, its four-massive turbo fan engines are far from economical. As a result, even Emirates' well-financed neighbor Etihad have limited its fleet of A380s to just 10 planes.  "No, we're done," Etihad Aviation Group CEO James Hogan told Business Insider last year when asked whether he'd buy more A380s. "We just believe in two-engine technology — they are much more efficient."  But for now, the Airbus A380 is alive and moving forward with its most important customer.   "We are taking another 50 or so A380s," Clark said. "So we're keeping the production line going."

Read more Russian-Chinese passenger jet to take on Boeing & Airbus It estimates 6,810 new aircraft purchases by China in the next twenty years, up 7.6 percent from its previous demand prediction until 2034. "As China transitions to a more consumer-based economy, aviation will play a key role in its economic development," said Randy Tinseth, Vice President of Marketing, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. "Because travel and transportation are key services, we expect to see passenger traffic grow 6.4 percent annually in China over the next 20 years," he added. According to Tinseth, the country's growing middle class and new visa policies "gives every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market.” READ MORE Russia developing aircraft engine for joint passenger jet with China Boeing predicts that three-quarters of new deliveries will be single-aisle aircraft that carry between 90 and 230 passengers. Demand for wide-body planes will also increase, with 1,560 new planes expected to triple the country's fleet over 20 years. Read more China plans to produce its own aircraft engines The report said that air cargo is expected to become a key driver for the continuous growth of aviation in China supported by the country’s growing e-commerce business which is already the largest in the world. Boeing has played a major role in developing China's aviation industry and infrastructure, making up more than 50 percent of commercial jetliners operating in the country. China, however, wants to develop its own aircraft manufacturing capability. Two years ago Beijing signed a deal with Russia to create a long-range wide-body aircraft. The project is part of a $13 billion aviation cooperation deal between the two countries. The new 250-280 seat aircraft will have a range of 12,000 kilometers. In June, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin announced the start of construction work on a heavy-lift aircraft engine for the jet. The first airplanes are expected to be completed by 2023 and to go on sale in 2025.

The latest estimate of 6,810 planes is 7.6 percent higher than the 6,330 aircraft predicted last year. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, said in a statement. He also said that he expects passenger traffic to grow 6.4 percent in China annually over the next 20 years. Boeing has stayed bullish on China even as other U.S. companies have expressed concern over the country's slower economic growth. A senior Boeing executive said in August that the plane maker was not seeing any softness in demand in China. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

But the Canadian aviation landscape makes it hard for new airlines to survive—and the two dominant airlines are sure to respond. Justin Bachman justinbachman September 12, 2016 — 6:00 AM EDT Updated on September 12, 2016 — 3:54 PM EDT Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Travel nearly anywhere in the world, and you'll find cheap airlines offering no-frills service, from European giant Ryanair Holdings Plc to Peach Aviation Ltd. in Japan, Flynas in Saudi Arabia, and Spirit Airlines Inc. in the U.S. But head north of the border, and the aviation landscape is untouched by ultralow-cost airlines. Canada ranks among the world’s most expensive countries to fly in, due in part to high airport and security fees and limited competition, and service is meager in many small and midsize cities. More than 60 percent of Canada’s 36 million people live within 100 miles of the border, and many head south to fly; about 5 million cross the border each year for cheaper flights. “Griping about the cost of air travel in this country is as endemic as bitching about the weather—it’s as if nothing can be done about either of them,” a columnist for Canada’s National Post wrote in June. Some cheaper fares may be en route. Three companies are working to bring the ultralow-cost model to the country, where air travel is dominated by two national airlines, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. But higher operating costs make it hard for new airlines to survive, and the dominant airlines are sure to respond to upstarts offering lower fares. WestJet, for example, has already begun new nonstop service on two routes flown by the first of these newcomers. Canada is one of just two nations in the Group of 20 largest economies without any ultralow-cost carriers, or ULCCs. The other, Argentina, may see one next year as Irelandia Aviation Ltd.—the Dublin-based investment firm that has established such ULCCs as Ryanair in Europe and Allegiant Travel Co. in the U.S.—aims to expand its low-cost airline group Grupo Viva Aerobus there. Canada also charges higher security fees than most other nations—up to $25 per passenger—and its 26 largest airports must make annual payments to their municipalities in lieu of local taxes. A 2015 report (pdf) to the Canadian transport minister, reviewing the nation's transportation system, found air travel in Canada “marked by weak accountability constraints on fees and charges; high costs for users and operators; aggressive capital expenditure programs at airports; modest traffic volumes; and limited competition.” It recommended that the government reform airport ownership structure and offer the aviation sector more federal financial aid, as the U.S. does. “There is no room for complacency,” it added. Canadians are eager for the expanded service and lower fares that ULCCs could provide, said Jim Young, chief executive of NewLeaf Travel Co., a “virtual” airline in its sixth week of operations, with three Boeing 737s flying to secondary airports in 11 cities nationwide. NewLeaf, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, itself has no air certificates or airplanes. It sells tickets on an established carrier, Flair Airlines—a “wet lease” arrangement that lets NewLeaf escape many of the costly aspects of being an airline. Flair staffs and maintains the fleet and sells capacity to NewLeaf. Canadians “understand the business model—they understand the fees, they understand that you pay for what you consume,” Young said in a telephone interview.  Canada is among the most expensive places for air travel—No. 70 out of 75 nations in the average cost to fly 100 kilometers, at $38.71, according to data released last week by the online travel agency Kiwi.com. (Only Japan, the Netherlands, Qatar, Finland, and the United Arab Emirates had more expensive fares, according to Kiwi; the U.S. was No. 17, with India the cheapest place to fly.) The country's high airport fees limit the traffic-stimulating effect that lower fares can have for low-cost airlines elsewhere, but flying to smaller, cheaper airports increases the odds of success, said NewLeaf’s chairman, Ben Baldanza, calling the company “the only ULCC option that I have seen in Canada that makes sense to me.” Baldanza, who was previously chief executive at Spirit, is also a “small investor” in the Canadian startup and serves on the board of Iceland's low-cost carrier WOW Air. NewLeaf eschews Canada’s primary, higher-cost airports such as Toronto Pearson and Vancouver International, just as Allegiant Travel Co. avoids larger U.S. airports. In Canada, secondary airport fees are generally far lower than those at major airports, which is why a low-cost airline such as NewLeaf prefers such towns as Hamilton over Toronto or Abbotsford instead of Vancouver, Baldanza said. Price is the prime selling point in the ULCC model: Fares begin at less than $40, and in many cases much less than $40. In China, for example, Spring Airlines sells tickets for as little as 99 yuan ($14.82). The U.S. has three such carriers—Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc.—and all have been expanding voraciously. Because of Canada’s higher costs, fares there won’t be as low as other nations enjoy. But executives at all three of Canada’s fledgling ULCCs say they aim to underprice Air Canada and WestJet by 25 percent to 35 percent. Calgary-based Enerjet is a charter operator that flies oil-and-gas field workers in northern Alberta and does contract work for Air Transat, another Canadian charter carrier. Now it is shifting to the ultra-low-cost model1. Enerjet has been “hunkered down” for more than a year amid the collapse in oil prices and western Canada’s depressed economy, said Darcy Morgan, the company’s chief commercial officer; his brother Tim, a WestJet co-founder, is its CEO. The company leases three Boeing 737-700s and wants to begin a new ULCC tentatively called Flytoo. (It was first called Jet Naked2 for its knack for drawing publicity, but that name was abandoned.) Enerjet is working to raise C$80 million ($61 million) and hopes to begin Flytoo service by year’s end. Source: Boeing A third company, Calgary-based Canada Jetlines Ltd., is trying to raise C$50 million ($38 million) and begin flying from major Canadian cities to U.S. sun destinations, such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, and Los Angeles this year or next. Jetlines has ordered five new Boeing 737 Max aircraft for its future expansion, with options for 16 more. Initially, Jetlines plans to expand to a half dozen 737-700s in its first year and to list shares publicly. The airline plans to offer fares 30 percent cheaper than Air Canada and WestJet but also to avoid direct competition with both, said Jim Scott, Jetlines’ president and chief executive officer. “The passengers that we [will] move are not the passengers that Air Canada and WestJet want, anyway,” Scott said. “The focus in Canada is on the business traveler or the frequent flier. I always say everyone who gets boarded before I get boarded is the [passenger] they’re interested in.” During the winter, all three low-cost airlines will look south to Mexico, the U.S., and the Caribbean, as Canadians seek warmer-weather respites. Southern California and Phoenix are likely to be among the winter U.S. destinations, Scott and Young said. “I think there’s a chance to make more money in the winter than [NewLeaf does] in the summer,” Baldanza said of NewLeaf's focus on smaller cities. “The reality is that people who live in Moncton want to get warm just like people who live in Toronto want to get warm in the winter.” As with nearly any airline startup, financing has been lean for all three companies so far. Scott attributes that to Canada’s conservative investment climate—where preventing losses is paramount, dwarfing a focus on the upside potential, and where realism outweighs the dream of a huge payday. And in a nation with near-duopoly air service, airline upstarts have had a spotty record, as well as some high-profile failures in the last 15 years—including low-cost operator Jetsgo and smaller leisure-oriented carrier Harmony Airways. To help their funding efforts, both Enerjet and Jetlines have asked to be exempted from Canada’s 25 percent cap on foreign investment in airlines, in the hope of selling as much as a 49 percent stake to non-Canadian investors. Those exemption requests are opposed by South Beach Capital Partners, an investment group formed by Manitoba First Nations indigenous peoples that took a financial stake in NewLeaf Travel in June; Canada’s transport minister is expected to decide on the requests later this year. That foreign ownership cap was one of the aspects of Canadian air travel that last year's federal transportation report pointed to, advocating for raising it. “In contrast to larger markets like the U.S., there may not be enough capital in Canada to finance 75 percent of a new national carrier,” said the report, which was overseen by David Emerson, a former Cabinet minister, Vancouver airport executive, and member of Parliament. The report also recommended sweeping changes in airport funding, airport capital spending programs, security, and visa systems. Tim Morgan, the Enerjet CEO, thinks the Canadian market, once properly stimulated with low fares, could support “more than 50” planes flying in the ultralow-cost model—“and maybe even 100, or more than 100,” he said in a telephone interview. “And that’s without affecting the major carriers.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

There is a proposal to launch commercial satellites from international waters just outside Kiribati's Christmas Island EEZ. 46,000 tons of 1980s kerosene and LOX-fueled Russian rockets will crash back into the Pacific with each launch, producing 36 tons of carbon monoxide in the lower troposphere on the way up and a kerosene slick several kilometers wide as about 4.5 tons of kerosene fall unburned on the way down. The Environmental Assessment (EA) is now open for comment. The closing date for comments (by mail) is May 26. A source who gave us this information has the draft EA but says there are huge holes in it. But the U.S. Federal Aviation Authority's Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation who has set a thirty day comment period, ending on May 26, proposes a finding of no significant impact. This means there will be no official impacts investigation - ESI. Briefing notes as follows: It is a U.S./Russian/Ukraine/Norwegian venture. They are using 1980s ZENIT Russian rockets. The launch pad is a modified North Sea oil rig. The service ships are being custom-built by Kvaerner Maritime, a Norwegian company. Sea Launch itself is based in the Cayman Islands, and also has a 15-acre site at Long Beach on the U.S. West Coast. They propose to launch the satellites on top of the Russian rockets from the launch pad. The ships will retire 5 kilometers before any launch. Only the satellite will make it to space. The rest of the rockets will crash back into the ocean. Each rocket is 440 feet long with a 46 thousand ton displacement. They are made of aluminum and graphite epoxy. The draft EIA says historically approximately 3,489 kg and 1,060 kg of kerosene falls unburned in the rocket's fuel tanks. Sea Launch's overhead said the fuels being used are "environmentally friendly." When questioned they said the overhead was wrong. It should say "environmentally friendlier." The rocket is fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene -- more than half of that being kerosene. The draft EIA says approximately 44,700 kg of liquid oxygen (LOX) and 17,000 kg of kerosene would be burned below 2,000m. Approximately 36,100 kg of carbon monoxide (CO) would be produced into the troposphere near sea level. The draft EIA also says the nitrogen produced would cause a "substantial, temporary reduction" of stratospheric ozone. Viola Brady, a Sea Launch legal officer, said "If it weren't for the obvious environmental and safety and other issues we could launch right on the beach (Long Beach)." Marc Nance: "Why are we using the boat rather than renting an island? Launching from sea greatly reduces the close proximity of environmental effects you get on land. In Australia, for example, off Cape York, you get a lot of crocodiles. In the ocean you tend to have less of those life forms." He said that they wanted to launch from the equator, partly because there's less pull from the earth at the equator so it's more efficient, "and it's away from land mass and peoples and away from environmentally sensitive areas." He went on to say "The launch area ecosystem is resilient and relatively low in biological productivity, and far removed from sensitive coastal margins....All the research we've done suggests there are not a lot of higher forms of life there. Fish tend to be in waters that are shallower." He said the Pacific Ocean waters and atmospheric processes would overwhelm the Sea Launch material and heat inputs to the environment. The draft EIA contains no discussion of the possible impacts on life forms like whales, other marine mammals and fish, or birds, any of which could conceivably be in the ocean or flying overhead. The rockets will be traveling through major flight paths for migratory birds. The draft EIA does discuss the effects on plankton of the 4,500 kg of kerosene sprayed out of the fuel tanks as they descend and crash into the ocean. Each launch would result in a kerosene slick several millimeters deep in the center and several square kilometers wide. Overall, the report says, the effect on plankton would be minimal since population densities are at a maximum density at around 30 meters below the surface. It does not consider the noise of the launch would damage life forms in the oceans. This noise would be 150 decibels at 378 meters, and a predicted 75 decibels in the water at the same distance. "Little to no impact to the environment is expected from these levels due to the small number of launches per year and the relative absence of the higher trophic level organisms that would typically suffer injury from a loud sound."

Last June, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted a launch site license to the airport, allowing Ellington to be used as launch site for reusable launch vehicles. Last year, the Houston Airport System spent 6.9 million U.S. dollars to purchase a 53,000-square-foot office building that will house new spaceport tenants. The building, located near NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, had been solely occupied by Boeing until the company relocated part of its operations on July 31. Boeing now operates from a six-story building to serve the aerospace and defense sectors. Now, Houston aerospace officials are turning up the volume on efforts to land new tenants that will help usher in Houston's ascent into all things space. "We are developing infrastructure of the future and we're just getting it started," said Arturo Machuca, general manager of Ellington Airport and Houston Spaceport. "We still have plenty of good challenges in development ahead of us." The spaceport's first aerospace tenant, Intuitive Machines, moved into the mega-office complex on August 11 where it is building unmanned aerial systems, or drones, for commercial use. "It's a great opportunity and experience for us," said Health Mooney, director of production facilities management at Intuitive Machines. "We're the first ones (tenants) here. This is a burgeoning industry and this place will only grow and we want to be a part of it." Spaceport officials are working to include more aerospace entities into the fold. "We have ongoing conversations with other companies, including the Russian engineering company Progresstech," Machuca said. "They want to set up an operations facility that would be used to serve their U.S. based clientele." Houston officials also have letters of intent from Sierra Nevada Corporation, which plans to transport cargo to the International Space Station, and from Catapult Satellite Applications to lease space at the office complex. Houston officials are also in talks with the Japanese Government Space Industry and South Korean airport officials who have expressed interest in partnering. Another potential tenant is California-based SpaceX, which designs, manufacturers and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft, Machuca said. "We haven't had conversations with them (SpaceX) as of yet," he said. "They could come, but not now. Currently they've been taking off from the Kennedy Space Center. Eventually they want to build a launch site in South Texas." Ellington's spaceport will be a hub for a new generation of space planes that will take off horizontally from Ellington, and once over the Gulf of Mexico will ascend into the lower reaches of space. "The possibilities are limited only by our imaginations," said Michael Wagoner, an inspector with the Houston Airport System. "A lot of what we're looking at is the same thing we had with the space shuttle, which is that you can take off from this airport and you can land at this airport. We're open to all possibilities." Bob Mitchell, president of the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, said that development of the Houston Spaceport is moving smoothly. "We're working on a number of agreements that work perfectly into the commercial space model we're trying to create," he said. "We have three confidential projects that are close to decision, and if we land even one of them we are on our way to achieve our goal. It will drive the future innovation and technology for this region and for America."

From Thursday, bigger aircraft like Airbus-320 and Boeing-747 can take off and land from the extended runway at Jaipur airport. Senior officers of Airport Authority of India (AAI), Jaipur, on Monday said that after the completion of runway extension from 9,174 feet to 11,500 feet, the Director General Civil Aviation (DGCA) too has commissioned the new runway. "From Thursday morning, our new runway would be operational. I hope various operators will now come to Jaipur to start a direct flight to international destinations," said B K Tailang, director, AAI, Jaipur on Monday. Tailang has also left for China where he is going to meet international airline operators to pursue them to bring flights to Jaipur. "I will tell them about international facilities in Jaipur," Tailang added. The runway extension and CAT-IIIB light work was already over and now Jaipur airport is geared up for the landing of bigger aircraft. "Earlier, our runway's length was 9,174 feet which was not sufficient for the landing of big aircraft like Boeing 747 and Airbus 320," said an officer. Though, Jaipur airport was given the international status in 2006 and was equipped with a new terminal building and traffic control, it failed to function fully as an international airport as the runway's length was not 11,500 feet, as required. Initially, the airlines flying to destinations, including Abu Dhabi and Dubai would be allowed to take the extended runway to replace their aircraft with the bigger aircraft and October 2 onwards Jaipur would be directly connected to Singapore. "Scoot airlines has already got permission to fly from Singapore to Jaipur and Jaipur to Singapore from October 2. By the end of December, we hope to have direct flight from Jaipur to other international destinations like Bangkok and Malaysia," said an officer. When asked about the countries which are likely to get connected to Jaipur after the completion of whole work, a senior officer said, "We are looking at Kuala Lumpur-Bangkok-Thailand sector and then there would also be increase in flights to the Gulf countries including Muscat and Oman. It will also bring more flights from UAE." He added, "At a later stage, Jaipur would directly be connected with European countries as well."

By Andrea Marks on September 9, 2016 The Starship Enterprise on display at the Air and Space Museum. Photo by Eric Long, courtesy of Air and Space Museum Tweet Share A major DC institution is being invaded by Klingon speakers and cosplayers in Vulcan ears. As NASA begins its latest real-life mission to scoop up asteroid dust, sci-fi fans are celebrating their own extraterrestrial milestone at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum this week: the 50th anniversary of Star Trek’s 1966 television premiere. As the museum’s curator of social and cultural dimensions of spaceflight—in other words, the pop-culture curator—Margaret Weitekamp headed the effort to restore the original 11-foot model of the Starship Enterprise used in Star Trek shoots, now on permanent display in Air & Space’s newly renovated Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall, alongside John Glenn’s Friendship 7 capsule and the X-1 aircraft Chuck Yeager flew to smash the sound barrier. A Trekkie herself, Weitekamp completed a research fellowship at NASA and worked as a professor of women’s studies (she taught a course on the history of space travel) before coming to the Smithsonian in 2004. She helped organize the museum’s three days of events commemorating Star Trek’s launch, from Thursday’s showing of the pilot episode to Friday’s free “Boldly Go 50” celebration and costume contest, with guest speakers and documentary screenings (screenings are now full but the museum is offering standby tickets). It wraps up on Saturday with a sold-out cocktail party in the Smithsonian’s gardens surrounded by otherwordly botanicals. Washingtonian spoke to Weitekamp on what Star Trek tells us about the history of space travel. So you are the curator of the social and cultural dimensions of spaceflight. What role does space travel have in our, well, society and culture? It’s something that Americans have been fascinated with since it was just the realm of fiction. Space flight taps into fundamental ideas about who Americans believe we are, our sense of national identity as explorers, inventors, people with the ingenuity to solve problems. It has been an important part of Americans’ identity in the world, too. In the ’70s and ’80s, after space flights, there would be a world tour of the spacecraft and the astronauts to demonstrate what the US had done. In the documentary Building Star Trek, which will be shown Friday, you say that the Starship Enterprise model deserves to be in the Smithsonian alongside other—real—spaceships and aircraft. Why? I spend my job thinking about what real space flight has meant for American culture and the world, how we have remembered that through physical things, and how we have imagined how space flight could be through television, books, and movies. Some of the really important stories the Air and Space Museum has always told are not only the stories of these technologies and the people who built them and flew them but the inspiration and imagination that goes into making those real things happen. If you talk to earlier astronauts, they say as kids they wanted to fly. They built model airplanes out of balsa wood and were often fans of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. And if you talk to folks who work at NASA now, many are fans of space science-fiction, because it’s a vision of the kind of things they’d like to be doing. There are crossovers of influence between fiction and reality. If we were going to put one signature piece to bring out themes of imagination and inspiration, the Enterprise is a great example. Whether they’re coming as Star Trek fans or just everyday museumgoers, what do you hope viewers take away from the exhibits? Part of what we are trying to do when we put objects on display is create a juxtaposition that gets you to look at them in a slightly different way. Hopefully entering the Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall makes you think about the connections between the way space flight has been imagined and what’s going on in that hall. Compare the Enterprise to the Apollo Lunar Module. Those were things that were on the drawing board at the same time. Creators of the fictional piece and the real piece threw out everything that had been known about what a spaceship would look like, the assumptions that it would need to be streamlined or a pointy rocket or a gumdrop-shaped thing. They thought about how you would you design something for a specific mission. If it would never fly in an atmosphere, it would never need to be streamlined. What can attendees expect from special guest speakers at this week’s events? For example, Bjo and John Trimble, billed as two of Star Trek’s founding fans? I am really excited that we have Bjo and John Trimble. These are the folks who, back in the 1960s, organized the write-in campaign that got Star Trek its third season. So really it’s thanks to them that we’re here celebrating this anniversary, because without the third season, you don’t have enough episodes to go into syndication, and that’s where the series really took off—being shown in syndication and reruns. And in another example of the link between imagined and the real, the Trimbles later led the write-in campaign to NASA to name its first space shuttle test vehicle Enterprise instead of Constitution. People wrote in to the Ford White House and NASA and they ended up renaming the space shuttle. If you were to enter the costume contest, who would you go as? That’s hard. You go back and forth between wanting to do a classic Uhura or Nurse Chapel in a ’60s mod, funky dress, and wanting to go Captain Janeway, and get something from that. I will probably not be in costume. I tend to have an anthropologist’s perspective on this: it’s something I both participate in and study. I have a 50th anniversary Star Trek pin, though, that will definitely be on my lapel.

By Geoff Ziezulewicz   |   Sept. 12, 2016 at 1:20 PM Follow @upi Comments Sign up for our Security newsletter WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 (UPI) -- Argon ST, a Boeing company, has received a $10.2 million U.S. Navy contract modification for procurement of torpedo defense systems. The modification calls for the procurement of nine AN/SLQ-25A/C countermeasure decoy systems and spares that provide improved naval defense for current threat torpedoes in support of the Undersea Defensive Warfare program. The decoy, also known as "Nixie," is a modular, digitally controlled, electro-acoustic soft-kill countermeasure system. It uses an underwater towed body acoustic projector, deployed astern by a fiber optic tow cable. The system defends ships against wake homing, acoustic homing and wire-guided torpedoes. Work will be performed in Pennsylvania, with an estimated completion date of July 2018. Naval Sea Systems Command is the contracting activity.

Three companies are working to bring the ultra-low-cost model to the country. NewLeaf Travel avoids Canada’s primary, higher-cost airports like Toronto Pearson and Vancouver International, just as Allegiant Travel Co. does larger U.S. airports.  (John Woods / THE CANADIAN PRESS FILE PHOTO)   By Justin BachmanBloomberg Mon., Sept. 12, 2016 Travel nearly anywhere in the world, and you’ll find cheap airlines offering no-frills service, from European giant Ryanair Holdings to Peach Aviation in Japan, flynas in Saudi Arabia and Spirit Airlines in the U.S. But head north of the border, and the aviation landscape is untouched by ultra-low-cost airlines. Canada ranks among the world’s most expensive countries to fly, thanks in part to high airport and security fees and limited competition, and service is meagre in many small and medium-sized cities. More than 60 per cent of Canada’s 36 million people live within 160 kilometres of the border, and many head south to fly; about 5 million cross the border each year for cheaper flights. Some cheaper fares may be en route. Three companies are working to bring the ultra-low-cost model to the country, where air travel is dominated two national airlines, Air Canada and WestJet Airlines Ltd. But higher operating costs make it hard for new airlines to survive, and the dominant airlines are sure to respond to upstarts offering lower fares. WestJet, for example, has already begun new nonstop service on two routes flown by the first of these newcomers. Article Continued Below Canada is one of just two nations in the Group of 20 largest economies without any ultra-low-cost carriers, or ULCCs. The other, Argentina, may see one next year as Irelandia Aviation — the Dublin-based investment firm that has established ULCCs like Ryanair in Europe and Allegiant Travel Co. in the U.S. — aims to expand its low-cost airline group Grupo Viva Aerobus there. Canada also charges higher security fees than most other nations — up to $25 per passenger — and its 26 largest airports must make annual payments to their municipalities in lieu of local taxes. A 2015 report to the Canadian transport minister, reviewing the nation’s transportation system, found air travel in Canada “marked by weak accountability constraints on fees and charges; high costs for users and operators; aggressive capital expenditure programs at airports; modest traffic volumes; and limited competition.” It recommended the government reform airport ownership structure and offer the aviation sector more federal financial aid, as the U.S. does. “There is no room for complacency,” it added. Canadians are eager for the expanded service and lower fares that ULCCs could provide, said Jim Young, chief executive of NewLeaf Travel Co., a “virtual” airline in its sixth week of operations, with three Boeing 737s flying to secondary airports in 11 cities nationwide. NewLeaf, based in Winnipeg, itself has no air certificates or airplanes. It sells tickets on an established carrier, Flair Airlines — a “wet lease” arrangement that lets NewLeaf escape many of the costly aspects of being an airline. Flair staffs and maintains the fleet and sells capacity to NewLeaf. Canadians “understand the business model — they understand the fees, they understand that you pay for what you consume,” Young said in a telephone interview. Canada is among the most expensive places for air travel — 70th out of 75 nations, in terms of the average cost to fly 100 kilometres, at $38.71, according to data released last week by the online travel agency Kiwi.com. (Only Japan, the Netherlands, Qatar, Finland and the United Arab Emirates had more expensive fares, according to Kiwi; the U.S. was 17th, with India the cheapest place to fly.) The country’s high airport fees limit the traffic-stimulating effect that lower fares can have for low-cost airlines elsewhere, but flying to smaller, cheaper airports increases the odds of success, said NewLeaf’s chairman Ben Baldanza, calling the company the “the only ULCC option that I have seen in Canada that makes sense to me.” Baldanza, who was previously chief executive at Spirit, is also a “small investor” in the Canadian startup and serves on the board of Iceland-based low-cost carrier WOW Air. NewLeaf avoids Canada’s primary, higher-cost airports like Toronto Pearson and Vancouver International, just as Allegiant Travel Co. does larger U.S. airports. In Canada, secondary airport fees are generally far lower than those at major airports, which is why a low-cost airline such as NewLeaf looks to towns like Hamilton over Toronto, or Abbotsford instead of Vancouver, Baldanza said. Price is the prime selling point in the ULCC model: Fares begin under $40, and in many cases well under $40. In China, for example, Spring Airlines sells tickets for as little as 99 yuan ($14.82). The U.S. has three such carriers — Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc. — and all have been expanding voraciously. Because of Canada’s higher costs, fares there won’t be as low as other nations enjoy. But executives at all three of Canada’s fledgling ULCCs say they aim to underprice Air Canada and WestJet by 25 per cent to 35 per cent. Calgary-based Enerjet is a charter operator that flies oil- and gas-field workers in northern Alberta and does contract work for Air Transat, another Canadian charter carrier. Now, it is transitioning to the ultra-low-cost model. Enerjet has been “hunkered down” for more than a year amid the collapse in oil prices and western Canada’s depressed economy, said Darcy Morgan, the company’s chief commercial officer; his brother Tim, a WestJet co-founder, is its CEO. The company leases three Boeing 737-700s and wants to begin a new ULCC tentatively called Flytoo. (It was first called Jet Naked for its knack for drawing publicity, but that name was abandoned.) Enerjet is working to raise $80 million and hopes to begin Flytoo service by year’s end. A third company, Calgary-based Canada Jetlines Ltd., is trying to raise $50 million and begin flying from major Canadian cities to U.S. sun destinations like Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles this year or next. Jetlines has ordered five new Boeing 737 Max aircraft for its future expansion, with options for 16 more. Initially, Jetlines plans to expand to a half dozen 737-700s in its first year and to list shares publicly. The airline plans to offer fares 30 percent cheaper than Air Canada and WestJet but also to avoid direct competition with both, said Jim Scott, Jetlines’ president and chief executive officer. “The passengers that we [will] move are not the passengers that Air Canada and WestJet want, anyway,” Scott said. “The focus in Canada is on the business traveler or the frequent flier. I always say everyone who gets boarded before I get boarded is the [passenger] they’re interested in.” During the winter, all three low-cost airlines will look south to Mexico, the U.S. and the Caribbean, as Canadians seek warmer-weather respites. “I think there’s a chance to make more money in the winter than [NewLeaf does] in the summer,” Baldanza said of NewLeaf and its focus on smaller cities. “The reality is that people who live in Moncton want to get warm just like people who live in Toronto want to get warm in the winter.” As with nearly any airline startup, financing has been lean for all three companies so far. Scott attributes that to Canada’s conservative investment climate-where preventing losses is paramount, dwarfing a focus on the upside potential, and where realism outweighs the dream of a huge payday. And in a nation with near-duopoly air service, airline upstarts have had a spotty record, as well as some high-profile failures in the last 15 years — including low-cost operator Jetsgo and smaller leisure-oriented carrier Harmony Airways. To help their funding efforts, both Enerjet and Jetlines have asked to be exempted from Canada’s 25 per cent cap on foreign investment in airlines, in the hopes of selling as much as a 49 per cent stake to non-Canadian investors. Those exemption requests are opposed by South Beach Capital Partners, an investment group formed by Manitoba First Nations indigenous peoples that took a financial stake in NewLeaf Travel in June; Canada’s transport minister is expected to decide on the requests later this year. That foreign ownership cap was one of the aspects of Canadian air travel that last year’s federal transportation report pointed to, advocating for raising it. “In contrast to larger markets like the U.S., there may not be enough capital in Canada to finance 75 per cent of a new national carrier,” said the report, overseen by David Emerson, a former Cabinet minister, Vancouver airport executive and member of Parliament. The report also recommended sweeping changes in airport funding, airport capital spending programs, security and visa systems. Tim Morgan, the Enerjet CEO, thinks the Canadian market, once properly stimulated with low fares, could support “more than 50” planes flying in the ultra-low-cost model — “and maybe even 100, or more than 100,” he said in a telephone interview. “And that’s without affecting the major carriers.” Read more about: United States The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

The Veterans in Parks program, launched during the centennial year for both Boeing and the NPS, supports and expands opportunities for volunteer service and career development for post-9/11 veterans within the hundreds of National Park Service sites and programs nationwide. "Veterans have answered the call of duty time and again, and through our partnership with Boeing, we have the opportunity to give back to the incredible women and men who have sacrificed so much to protect our country by connecting them with our national parks," said Will Shafroth, president of the National Park Foundation, the official charity of America's national parks. "Not only can parks provide a career path, but they can also serve as settings for reflection and healing. We are grateful that, together with Boeing and The Mission Continues, we will connect more veterans to our national park community."  In 2014, Boeing connected NPF, the official nonprofit partner of NPS, and The Mission Continues, a non-profit focused on providing career and service opportunities to post-9/11 veterans, with a planning grant to develop a public-private partnership to help returning veterans build careers and engage in volunteer service protecting, restoring, and rebuilding America's natural and cultural resources. Built around a strong volunteer ethos towards service alongside communities, this programmatic partnership will help to significantly expand national park access and services to America's underserved young veteran population.   "Boeing and its employees are deeply committed to supporting our nation's military personnel, veterans and their families," said John Blazey, Boeing's vice president of Global Corporate Citizenship. "As we celebrate our centennial year, we recognize the service and sacrifice of our veteran workforce and the unique role this community has played in the success of our company over the past century. That's why we are proud to partner with the National Park Foundation and The Mission Continues – developing pathways for military personnel and veterans to build better lives for themselves, their families, and their communities." On Sunday, September 11, the Veterans in Parks program officially kicked off at a service event hosted by The Mission Continues at Fort Battery Ricketts Park in Washington, DC, a national park site. Fort Battery Ricketts, within the Civil War Defenses of Washington, was constructed after the Battle of First Manassas in a larger attempt to fortify the city.  Despite the park's rich history and prime location in the city, it has been underutilized by the surrounding community. Yesterday, more than 100 military veterans, supporters, and Boeing employees came together to beautify the park and to make it more accessible and attractive to local residents.  "I'm very proud that we have developed such a strong partnership with our veteran community. Veterans represent many of the ideals the National Park Service holds near and dear; serving our nation and preserving our country's resources," said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis. "We appreciate that the veterans supporting the Mission Continues have chosen national parks as one of their major focus areas. Their work will go a long way in ensuring these culturally and historically rich spaces will be accessible to generations of visitors." This year marks the 15 [th] anniversary of the September 11 attacks. The Mission Continues organized the event at Fort Battery Ricketts to honor Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) veterans who fought and sacrificed in the wake of 9/11 and who now continue to serve at home, strengthening our communities through service. Boeing funds The Mission Continues Service Platoon that led the 9/11 Project at Fort Battery Ricketts Park in Washington, DC. The event gathered multiple service platoons from The Mission Continues as well as Boeing, NPS, and NPF employees working toward a common objective: rehabilitation and beautification of the park to create a safe space for the community to play, learn, work, and serve. The project is a great example of how the Veterans in Parks program will engage veterans in service and careers with NPS. "Our nation's military veterans have joined with the National Park Service and, through our partnership with the National Park Foundation and Boeing, are now serving in national parks across the country.  We recognize the incredible value that the parks provide, both as a tremendous career opportunity, and as a national resource to be treasured and protected," said Mary Beth Bruggeman, Marine Corps veteran (OIF) and executive director for the southeast at The Mission Continues. "We also see the opportunity for veterans to ensure that the value of the national parks is visible and accessible to our most underserved urban communities. Through this partnership, we hope to continue our mission making a generational impact on communities."  ABOUT THE BOEING COMPANYBoeing is the world's largest aerospace company and leading manufacturer of commercial airplanes and defense, space and security systems.

Here are the first reviews of Hammond, Clarkson & May's 'Grand Tour' More than just beds: Airbnb Trips launches in Cape Town Famous Marilyn Monroe dress sells for over R70-million Sunday Times News By STEPHAN HOFSTATTER, 2016-09-11 00:00:00.0 Zuma's R500m backup Boeing is on its way The presidential jet Inkwazi according to aviation experts is in perfect working order despite reports to the contrary. Image: PLANESPOTTERSNET The air force plans to spend about R500-million on an 18-month lease of a second luxury jet for President Jacob Zuma that aviation experts say he doesn't need. This is a stop-gap measure while the South African Air Force buys a second presidential jet at an estimated additional cost to taxpayers of between R1-billion and R2.8-billion. Aviation experts and industry sources say all these expenses are unnecessary, that 21 Squadron at Air Force Base Waterkloof has enough smaller aircraft for local and regional VIP flights, and that the luxury presidential jet Inkwazi is in perfect working order despite reports to the contrary. They also describe a short-term lease for a long-range luxury jet as the "worst possible option" because the costs are prohibitive. Tender documents seen by the Sunday Times reveal the air force wants to lease an aircraft similar to Inkwazi, a Boeing Business Jet based on the 737-700, to start operating from Waterkloof on October 1. Is Zuma's plane being downed by a lack of trained engineers and mechanics? The tender, which was issued on August 18 and closed this week, is for a luxury intercontinental business jet capable of flying 10,000km without refuelling. It is understood that five companies put in bids. The presidential alcove must consist of "private sleeping accommodation (double bed) and wardrobe facilities for two people", a shower and toilet, and be "configured to provide total privacy". There must also be "a separate private conference area" for at least six people. This means Zuma will have two luxury intercontinental jets flying at the same time. Once the short-term lease on the second jet expires, the air force wants to buy the president an even fancier jet capable of flying 13,300km that will cost between R1-billion and R2.8-billion. Industry insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity said the short-term lease tender raised several red flags. The tender requires a so-called "wet lease", which means the owner provides the crew, maintenance and insurance. This will make costs rocket. There are no South African-owned Boeing Business Jets available, and the short-lease term means banks won't finance anyone wanting to buy one to lease it to the air force. This means the aircraft will be leased from a foreign company through a local partner or agent. The company will have to repaint the aircraft, register it in South Africa and employ a local crew. Three industry experts said that under these conditions, the 18-month lease would cost between $1.5-million and $2-million a month, which comes to a total of about R500-million at the current exchange rate. "It's ridiculous - you can buy an aircraft for that," said one. Several sources said Zuma's refusal to use smaller aircraft for short trips was the root cause of the air force's need to buy and lease big, luxury aircraft. Apart from Inkwazi, 21 Squadron has three Dassault Falcons and two Cessna Citations, but Zuma has insisted on using the Boeing Business Jet for short hops to Nkandla, Sun City or Harare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Inkwazi. This aircraft is in 100% condition and it's sitting there gathering dust "This is a spending spree and a waste of money," said another source. "There is no logical reason for not flying Inkwazi." Their concerns were echoed by aviation expert Darren Olivier and South African National Defence Union leader Pikkie Greeff. "All indications are that Inkwazi has flown fewer than 10,000 flight cycles and is accumulating them at far fewer than 1,000 a year. It can keep flying for decades before it becomes unsafe," said Olivier. The air force's main transport aircraft, refurbished Dakotas and C130s, are 50 to 70 years old. "Both types are in urgent need of replacement, yet it appears a VIP plane has priority." He calculated the air force had only about R840-million a year available from its R6.8-billion budget for operational costs. "A third of the operational budget might be sucked up by this lease." Greeff said maintenance staff had assured him "there is absolutely nothing wrong with Inkwazi. This aircraft is in 100% condition and it's sitting there gathering dust." It was a matter of great concern that paying for another presidential jet came out of the air force's operational budget, "which is already depleted". Zuma's spokesman, Bongani Ngqulunga, said the air force was responsible for providing a presidential aircraft. "The SAAF makes the determination regarding what's suitable for use. The Presidency does not have the expertise or mandate in this regard." South African National Defence Force spokesman Siphiwe Dlamini said Inkwazi's "many technical challenges" were well documented. Demand for flying VIPs had increased dramatically and was "in excess of approximately 600 hours per annum for the Presidency alone". He said 21 Squadron had to be able to fly the president and deputy president simultaneously. The squadron needed a jet on standby if the presidential jet was being serviced. He said Armscor was investigating buying an aircraft directly from SAA "as part of the many options that are currently under way for the capacitation of the SAAF 21 Squadron". stephanh@sundaytimes.co.za Don't miss out on this story Login, upgrade or subscribe to continue reading.

Debris was found off Mosambique in March this year. (Credit: ABC licensed)  New wreckage that may be from missing Malaysia Airlines flight 370 could be the first proof for the theory that the plane was exposed to intense heat or fire. Key points: New debris could prove there was a fire onboard the plane It has similar honeycomb pattern unique to Boeing's composite materials Victims relatives want Malaysia to hand the investigation over The debris was brought to Australia and handed to officials at the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in Canberra this morning. If the debris is confirmed to be from flight 370, it would support the theory that an onboard fire crippled the Boeing 777's systems, leaving pilots struggling to get back to safety before being overwhelmed by fumes or lack of oxygen. It was found on the coast of Madagascar, the huge island nation off the southeast coast of Africa where the majority of suspected debris has come ashore so far. Blaine Gibson, an American lawyer turned self-styled investigator into the mystery of flight 370, has brought more suspected and confirmed pieces of wreckage back from Africa than anyone else. "I am bringing these [new pieces of debris] over to ATSB, which will give the absolute best forensic analysis and investigation possible," he told the ABC. "There are two that have burned and singe marks on them, and if those are found to be from Malaysia 370 and if it is discovered that the fire took place before the crash, then this is a real game changer that could help identify what was the cause of the planes demise. External Link: MH370 Debris, Channel 7 Tweet "I'd add that of these five pieces, three of them are from the fuselage." While it remains too soon to know whether Mr Gibson's theory as to the provenance of the objects was correct, the new debris has the honeycomb pattern that was unique to Boeing's composite materials. And some strongly resemble panelling used in the Boeing 777. Mr Gibson has speculated that the panel with a scorched appearance could be from the avionics bay — which is located below and behind the cockpit under the main cabin floor. "One of the theories is that there was a fire on the plane," he said. He said that so far there was no evidence to support that theory, but if the new debris was determined to be from flight 370 and the heat exposure occurred before the crash, "then that's a very significant clue". Malaysia should step aside: relatives Relatives of the plane's passengers and crew have also been in Canberra to visit the ATSB. It was meant to be a private visit, initiated by Australian search officials who saw firsthand how the next of kin are sidelined in Malaysia. Audio: Listen to Peter Lloyd's story (The World Today) Grace Nathan's mother Anne was on the missing flight and on behalf of the next of kin she seized the moment to ask Australia's search officials to petition Malaysia to step aside from the investigation. "I think the topic will come up about whether it's possible for Malaysia to really push its authority over the search, its power over the search," she said. "And to hand it over to another nation that is willing and capable of taking over." Next of kin who were not in Canberra said they wanted it to be known that they stood united against the airline. K S Narendran, whose partner was on flight 370, said the families and the public at large were being "short-changed". He said he believed that for almost three months potential debris had been "languishing in Madagascar". "It boggles our mind as to why that country, which is in charge of the investigation, would simply not pick it up," he said.

Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) reportedly has been showing potential customers two designs for a stretch version of its new and yet-to-be-delivered 737 MAX 9 to compete with the Airbus A321neo and A321LR. This is not the first time since Airbus announced the A321LR nearly two years ago that Boeing has responded with a stretched version of its new 737. The company has also suggested a clean-sheet design, but that would delay first deliveries until at least 2024. Airbus expects to deliver its first A321neo in 2018 and the LR version by 2019. At stake here is the so-called middle-of-the-market (MoM), a space for which Airbus claims at least 1,000 new dual-engine, single-aisle planes are needed to fly long, thin routes (up to 5,000 nautical miles with 200 to 260 passengers). The A321LR in a basic configuration can fly 206 passengers about 4,000 nautical miles. The new airplane replaces the Boeing 757, which went out of production in 2005. Boeing cannot seem to come up with an answer. At first the company denied the market was as large as Airbus said it was. Then it considered reconfiguring the 767, a dual-engine, twin-aisle plane that is still available from the company as either a passenger jet at a list price of $197.1 million or a freighter costing $199.3 million. The 767 is also the base for the company’s new Air Force tanker, the KC-46A. Boeing’s September order book shows a new order for 19 767s to be fitted out as new tankers. The following chart from Boeing and Aviation Week magazine shows where Boeing thinks the MoM plane fits. Boeing now believes that between 2,000 and 5,000 planes could be required to replace both the aging 757s and 767s. Source: The Boeing Co.; Aviation Week If Boeing is right about the sweet spot, then most customers want to fly 4,800 to 5,000 nautical miles. That’s significantly longer than the 757’s range, and the 767-300 seats between 260 and 300 passengers, more than customers appear to require. The perfect MoM plane, it seems, is a little bit bigger than a current single-aisle but not quite as big as a 767, and with a longer range. Which apparently has brought Boeing back to a stretched 737 MAX 9 that has been called the 737 MAX 10. The problem with a stretched MAX 9 is that it would need new, larger engines that would, in turn, require Boeing to change the landing gear to accommodate the larger engine fans. Bloomberg reported that CFM International, the joint venture between the General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) and France’s Safran that builds the LEAP-1B engine for the 737 MAX, has “gained confidence that [CFM] can reap enough extra thrust from the existing LEAP-1B engines to speed to market a new, longer variant with relatively uncomplicated landing gear.” CFM declined to comment. Boeing apparently also is considering CFM’s LEAP-1A engines for the stretched MAX 9 that would require only “some modifications to the wing and tail, and taller landing gear that would mechanically shrink to fit into the same wheel well used on other 737s.” The biggest issue is timing. Can Boeing deliver a competitor to the A321LR close to the 2019 first delivery date for the Airbus plane? The Bloomberg report indicates that the company has projected a tentative date of 2021, but at least one potential customer, Air Lease Corp.

(NYSE: BA) unveiled its entry into the contract competition for a new training jet for the U.S. Air Force. Called the T-X for now, the new aircraft is a clean-sheet design from Boeing and its partner in the bidding, Sweden’s Saab, and would replace the current Air Force trainer, the T-38. Boeing first teased its design at the Air Force Association conference in September of last year and launched a website last month that offered a “sneak peek” at the design it has prepared with Saab. Boeing said Tuesday that it will use the two production aircraft that it and Saab have built “to show the U.S. Air Force the performance, affordability, and maintainability advantages” to their T-X. The Boeing website features a new video of a computer-generated T-X. In late August Northrop Grumman Corp. (NYSE: NOC) and its partners began runway testing of its clean-sheet design to replace the T-38. As the release of the U.S. Air Force request for proposal (RFP) for a new training jet, the four competitors have all now either shown a modified version of a real plane or drawings of an all-new, clean-sheet design. In addition to the clean-sheet design from Northrop Grumman and its partners, Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE: LMT) and Raytheon Corp. (NYSE: RTN) have also proposed modified versions of existing training jets. The Air Force released its final draft RFP last month and is expected to have the final document released late this year or early next. That will start the clock running on a one-year evaluation phase according to Aviation Week. A milestone decision is expected early in fiscal year 2018 and entry into service is currently set for 2024. The initial phase of the contract is worth about $8.4 billion, but the total could run much higher. The Air Force plans to buy 350 of the new planes. Boeing’s defense president and CEO Leanne Caret said, “Our T-X is real, ready and the right choice for training pilots for generations to come.” The following photo of the real thing is also available at Boeing’s website.

The Boeing MD-88 with 127 passengers and five crew members aboard veered left off runway 13, hit a fence and stopped with its left wing leaking fuel onto a berm overlooking Flushing Bay about 11 a.m. on March 5, 2015, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The investigation also found that the flight crew violated procedures, in allowing passengers to fetch their coats, and delaying the evacuation of the plane after the crash, though only 29 people had minor injuries and no one was seriously hurt. “Make no mistake: This was a very close call,” said Christopher Hart, the board’s chairman, after his four-member panel heard and approved the findings and recommendations of an 18-month investigation during a public hearing Tuesday. The pilots did not have timely information and did not expect to see a snowy runway when they approached La Guardia, investigators said. The captain and co-pilot knew they were flying into a challenging snowstorm on their route from Atlanta to New York. They had developed plans to go to an alternative airport if La Guardia did not report that other planes had landed with good braking conditions, Hart said. But the airport reported braking conditions were good and runway 13 had been cleared, sanded and de-iced, investigators said, though it had not been treated since dawn. “As the airplane descended through the clouds, the flight crew did not expect to see that the runway, which had recently been cleared, was covered with snow,” Hart said. “They are thinking this is a slippery snow-covered runway with water at the other end — very cold water by the way — so we need to stop right now,” Hart said. “So one of the first things they did was they landed sooner than they otherwise would . . . and immediately thrust reverse.” The captain applied too much reverse thrust too soon, before the nose wheel hit the runway, despite recommended procedure, investigators said. A reverse thrust, which blasts exhaust forward to slow the plane, can make the rudder ineffective in the control of the airplane. After the crash, it took two hours to get the correct passenger count, investigators said, because the manifest showed 125 passengers and omitted two lap-held children who didn’t have tickets — a potential problem for emergency responders. The investigators’ recommendations include more training for crews, a study to determine the best way to apply maximum reverse thrust and examining the use of technology to provide pilots with the quality of braking action on runways in real time. Delta Air Lines said in a statement that it cooperated with the investigation, respects its findings and will use the guidance to enhance the safety of its operation.

REUTERS/Mike SegarMore By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday faulted a Delta Air Lines pilot for a March 2015 incident in which a Boeing MD-88 veered off the runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport, resulting in minor injuries to 29 passengers. The report said the pilot's use of excessive reverse thrust during landing led to a loss of directional control and the jet’s departure from the snow-covered runway. The report also said the flight and cabin crews did not conduct a timely or effective evacuation for a number of reasons, including the fact that damage to the aircraft resulted in the loss of the interphone and public address system, which delayed an announcement to evacuate the aircraft. The evacuation of the plane with 127 passengers and crew took 17 minutes and did not start until six minutes after landing, the NTSB said. The plane struck a chain-link fence before coming to rest on a snow-covered embankment just feet from Flushing Bay with its left wing tank leaking fuel. "Make no mistake: This was a very close call," NTSB chairman Christopher Hart said on Tuesday. LaGuardia, the smallest of the New York area's three major airports, was temporarily closed after the mishap. The report said the captain faced situational stress at the time of landing, which prevented him from immediately recognizing the use of excessive reverse thrust. Delta said in a statement it had cooperated in the probe and "we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations. Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation." The NTSB report also raised concerns about the initial uncertainty about the number of passengers aboard the plane, which didn't include two lap-held children. The report also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration's airport winter safety guidance as "not sufficiently clear about the timing and need for updated runway condition reports."

Bezos said in an email Monday the orbital rocket, known as the New Glenn, will be ready for a test launch before the end of this decade. The rocket is named for John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. Here’s a look at New Glenn, alongside other rockets—past, present and in development: Blue Origin’s next step…meet New Glenn #NewGlenn #GradatimFerociter pic.twitter.com/p4gICKZRfi — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) September 12, 2016 New Glenn will measure 23 feet in diameter, with 3.85 million pounds of thrust. It will be powered by seven Blue Engine 4 rocket engines, which Blue Origin has spent more than four years developing, that burn liquefied natural gas and liquid oxygen. The same kind of engine will power the new Vulcan rocket from United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which is scheduled for test launch around 2019. The New Glenn family will include two variations. The two-stage version of the rocket will be 270 feet tall. The three-stage version will stand 313 feet high, with a “high specific impulse hydrogen upper stage” that will allow the rocket to fly further into space, beyond low-Earth orbit. The image Bezos shared on Twitter was meant to drive the point home—to both the public and his competitors—that the New Glenn will be huge. The rocket will also be powerful; with 3.85 million pounds of liftoff thrust, the New Glenn will surpass the United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV Heavy, the most powerful rocket in operation, at 1.6 million pounds. SpaceX, Elon Musk’s spaceflight company, seeks to surpass them both; its Falcon Heavy, whose first launch is scheduled for November, will generate 5.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. Here’s some more perspective on power, from Eric Berger at Ars Technica: By way of further comparison, the space shuttle’s main engines had an individual thrust of 470,000 pounds. Along with its solid-rocket boosters, the shuttle had 7 million pounds of thrust at launch. The Saturn V rocket, with five F1 engines, had about 7.5 million pounds of thrust. So Blue Origin’s very first orbital rocket will have slightly more than half the thrust of the rockets that carried humans to the Moon. Bezos said Monday his company’s reusable rocket, New Shepard, “has taught us so much about how to design for practical, operable reusability.” In November 2015, Blue Origin launched New Shepard—named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space—and returned it to Earth for a soft, vertical landing, becoming the first to successfully land a reusable rocket on the ground after launch. But observers—especially Bezos’s competitor, Musk—pointed out while New Shepard reached the boundary where outer space is understood to begin, it did not enter orbit.

More than 25 artistic people shared their creativity with community members at Art in Legion Park Sept. 10-11. The annual art show presented by Arlington Arts Council provided opportunities for local artists to share their work with the community - and that is the essence of art, for at least two of the participating artists. Jacques Drapeau and Marcello Cicchini both expressed appreciation for the opportunity to chat with people and get feedback about their art. Cicchini, who works by day at Boeing, said it is essential for artists to share their work other people. "Some artists fear critics," said Cicchini, a resident of Marysville who grew up in Argentina. "But it's important to show what you do or it means nothing." Another artist at the show, Jacques Drapeau agreed. For Drapeau, who is a member of several art groups including the Greater Marysville Art Guild and the Stanwood Camano Art Guild, the opportunity to show his art is the reason to join an art group. "It's important for artists to show their work to the public," said Drapeau, who also shows his fantasy dinosaur narrative paintings at the Arlington Library and in the AAC's Art along the Way project, where art is exhibited in 15 different businesses around town. Most of the artists seemed pleased with the results of the show, selling paintings, photography, jewelry, yard art, paper mache´sculptures and wooden bowls, among other things, to an assortment of visitors who walked through the park on Saturday and Sunday, while listing to the ring of live music along the way. Visitors included cyclists along the Centennial Trail, like Gary from Granite Falls, who parked near the cemetery and took a quick bike ride to town and stopped in to hear some music and have a glass of wine in the wine and beer garden. "I just felt like getting out of the house today," he said. Dawn Latimer sold kettlekorn at the art show on Sunday, after her parents were there on Saturday. "Yesterday was really busy, but today was good, too," Latimer said. "It's a family affair," she said of her business selling donuts and popcorn of various flavors. Roberta Baker, the coordinator of the show for AAC, was tired at the end of the day on Sunday but she felt rewarded for all the hard work by the positive feedback from the artists. "It seems like most of the artists were satisfied with their sales," Baker said. "I had a good day," said Vicki Johnson, a pastel artist. "I sold a few paintings," Cicchini said. "And got lots of interesting feedback." Visitors gathered enthusiastically every hour and a half to see if they had won a raffle prize or not, and in the Youth Engaged in Art tent, youth and adults painted plywood fish, to freshen up the fish pole in Legion Park. And the weather cooperated, too, with puffy white clouds providing periodic shade from the warm sun and a fresh, cool breeze wafting over the park both Saturday and Sunday. The Arlington Arts Council's next event is its annual Fall into Art Auction on Saturday, Oct. 15, at Gleneagle Country Club. Tickets are available at Flowers by George and by phone at 360-435-5866.

Blog Samsung Gets Kicked Off the Plane Steve Ohr, Consultant, Semiconductor Industry Analyst 9/13/2016 01:40 PM EDT  2 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Lithium-ion battery fires are infrequent but not rare. Incidents involving Samsung's latest smartphone may encourage mobile device makers to reexamine the integrity of their power trains. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an advisory Thursday (September 8th) effectively declaring the Samsung Galaxy Note 7  arguably the most feature-laden smartphone ever  a fire hazard. The FAA advisory asked airline passengers not to turn on or charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage. The advisory follows a much publicized incident in which a Samsung smartphone exploded while charging on a car console, sending the Jeep Cherokee up in flame. Samsung has already issued a recall for an estimated 2.5 million units. Major cell phone service providers like Sprint and AT&T Mobility acknowledged the problem, stopping the sale of Galaxies, and issuing refunds on purchased phones that varied across the ten countries where the affected smartphones were sold. The exploding phone could not have come at a worse time for the worlds largest handset maker, with a new Apple iPhone model fast on its heels. The latest battery fire will likely have every portable device maker  whether smartphone, tablet, laptop computer, or electric car  examining the integrity of their products power train. And its none-too-soon: lithium-ion (Li-Ion) batteries are the highest density mobile energy source that is commercially available. (There are lithium-polymer formulations that offer incremental improvements in battery density, but there is nothing ready to substitute for Li-Ion, in terms of light weight, high power density and accessible cost.) The key components of a lithium-ion battery are its anode, its cathode, and its electrolyte, whose behavior varies depending on whether the battery is being charged or discharged (i.e., in use, driving a load). During charging, lithium ions are ejected from the cathode (which typically includes cobalt, manganese, nickel and oxygen) toward the anode (which is made of graphite)  across an ion-filled electrolyte fluid. As the battery drains in use, the lithium ions return from the anode back into the cathode. The problem for these batteries is that the lithium is extremely reactive with oxygen and/or water vapor in the atmosphere  despite the neutralizing effects of the electrolyte. Packing a bomb Lithium batteries were used for military aircraft long before they were tweaked by battery-maker Sony for commercial use. The current solution partially neutralizes the lithium solution with lithium ion or lithium cobalt, and  most important  reducing the compounds exposure to the atmosphere, where it could first gulp down oxygen, raising its temperature in the process, and, then, within milliseconds bursting into flames. Ionized lithium provides a buffer, but its effectiveness is not 100%. The battery design requires the lithium material to be physically isolated from the atmosphere. It means protecting the battery from cracks or punctures. Heat, by itself, is not the cause of Lithium battery fires. Rather, too much heat can stress the battery seals, and its a broken seal that leads to an explosion. Battery fires have been reported in laptop computers, made by Dell, Hewlett Packard and Toshiba, and in the Chevy Volt and Tesla Model S electric cars, and even in Boeings most recent jetliner, the 787. In the case of the computer battery fires, their cause has been attributed to defects in the battery manufacturing process, in which microscopic metal filings were accidentally rolled into the electrolytic film, potentially puncturing the film, short-circuiting anode-to-cathode in that spot, and getting horrendously hot. Improvements in battery manufacturing have pretty much eliminated computer battery fires. In the case of the Tesla battery fire, the battery case on the underside of the car was ruptured by the car going up on a curb. In the case of the Boeing 787 fires, the company spent a lot of energy making the FAA  and potential 787 passengers  understand that the use of lithium batteries did not affect the planes ability to fly. Of the two lithium battery packs on board, one was used to start the jet engines when the plane was on the ground; the other was used to power up passenger comfort systems. And, just in case, Boeing redesigned the battery case seals to ensure there would be no additional exposure to oxygen (i.e., no explosion) in case of an internal short. While the U.S. Product Safety Commission recalled 35,000 laptop batteries as late as 2008, the tone of experts commenting on the possibility of future lithium fires is spread across a spectrum from oh, theyre safe go back to bed, to Be Afraid Be Very Afraid. The consensus seems to suggest that lithium ion batteries are safe; that catastrophic failure is rare. The caveat is that Lithium batteries need to be treated with respect  and thats a major role for the surrounding control circuitry. The batteries should never be fully depleted, never be overcharged (as that could cause overheating), never allowed to experience a reversal in polarity. With hundreds of millions of lithium ion batteries produced each year, the market for smart battery charging controllers (also called battery management ICs) is roughly $1.6-$1.8 billion with average selling prices (ASPs) considerably less than 50 cents in very high volumes  amazingly cheaper, considering the functions they perform. The market leaders are generally those with skill sets in precision signal conditioning and control.

However, manufacturing defects in the cell membrane can cause spectacular failures as shown by the SONY flaming laptops a few years ago.  In this case, Samsung only has problems with one of two suppliers which points to a weaker design or manufacturing defects.

If it tried to appear friendlier to the masses, it failed. It only proved that a select elite truly congregates behind closed doors to push a New World Order agenda. If you know anything about international politics or the plan for a New World Order, you surely know about the CFR. It was often deemed “the most influential foreign policy think tank in the world” by international journalists. The list of its members is astonishing, to say the least, as it includes gigantic names in the corporate, financial and political world. Some examples of corporations: ABC News, American Express, Boeing, Coca-Cola, Ford Motor, Google, Halliburton, Heinz, IBM, Nike, Sony Corporation America and Visa. Examples of members: Barack Obama, Zbigniew Brzezinski (Obama’s advisor), Hilary Clinton, Dick Cheney, John McCain and David Rockefeller. Researchers have observed that these figures are working towards a world government and members never truly denied this fact. Shortly after his election, Obama selected the president of the Council on Foreign Relations Richard Haass, along with senior CFR-members Richard Holbrooke and  Dennis Ross as special Foreign Envoys/ Foreign Policy Advisors. Here’s the promotional video posted by the CFR. The Council on Foreign Relations is a trusted and indispensable resource. Watch CFR members explain why:https://t.co/zAmqsBTIBM — CFR (@CFR_org) August 5, 2016 While this video attempts to put a friendly face on the CFR by using TV celebrities and movie stars, it only ultimately proves that this globalist organization (created by JP Morgan and john D. Rockefeller) is more powerful (and less democratic) than ever. The video basically says: “The world is complex and geared towards globalization…and we’re the only ones who can deal with this”. By showcasing its members, the video also showcases who and what the elite truly “owns”. Here are some of the people seen in the video. Juliette Kayyem CNN National Security Analyst, Robert Rubin Former Treasury Secretary , Co-Chair CFR Juju Chang, ABC News Anchor Dina Habib Powell, Global Head of Impact Investing, Goldman Sachs Condolezza Rice, Former Secretary of State Angelina Jolie, Actress Jon Meacham, CEO Random House Publishing Rev. Chloe Breyer, Interfaith Center of New York Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove, Park Avenue Synagogue Richard Plepler, CEO HBO Jared Cohen, President of Jigsaw Random House is the largest general-interest trade book publisher in the world. Goldman Sachs is one of the largest banking firms in the world (it was rescued as part of a massive U.S. government bailout). CNN, ABC and HBO are some of the largest TV stations in the world. This gives you an idea of the reach of the CFR. By including Rev. Chloe Breyer, who works at the Interfaith Center of New York, you get a glimpse of the “one world religion” agenda of the NWO. It was founded in 1997 by the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, former Dean of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine – a NWO-friendly “sinister site” I’ve previously analyzed in this article. Jared Cohen is the founder and President of Jigsaw (previously Google Ideas). He’s also an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Previously, he served as a member of the Secretary of State’s Policy Planning Staff and as a advisor to Condoleezza Rice and later Hillary Clinton.Initially brought in by Condoleezza Rice as a member of the Policy Planning Staff, he was one of a few staffers that stayed under Hillary Clinton. The video shows Henry Kissinger next to a pile of Foreign Affairs publications (published by the CFR). In case you didn’t know, Henry Kissinger basically shaped the world as we know by dictating the US foreign policy for decades. In short, this CFR video gives you a glimpse of the tentacular reach of this elite-created organization and how it is pushing towards a world government – despite its claims of not having agenda. Its founding members never shied away from the fact that they DID have an agenda. Proof of this can be found in this great short video about the CFR.

The upgrade of facilities is likely to benefit regional airlines such as AirAsia Bhd., Southeast Asia’s largest discount carrier, which are expanding their fleets and adding more routes as rising incomes and competitive fares encourage more Asians to fly. Boeing Co. is projecting 100 million new passengers annually in the region. Malaysia-based AirAsia, the biggest operator of Airbus Group SE’s single-aisle aircraft, signed a deal in July for 100 A321neos to help maintain its industry lead. The proposed investment is a fraction of Hong Kong International Airport’s estimated spending plan of HK$141.5 billion ($18 billion) to add a third runway. Singapore’s Changi Airport will have a fourth terminal by 2017 at a cost of S$1.28 billion ($941 million) to handle 16 million passengers annually. The Malaysian government will foot part of the planned $1-billion investment, with the rest coming from Malaysia Airports, Badlisham said in an interview in New Delhi on Sept. 7. Malaysia’s transport ministry didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Shares of Malaysia Airports Holdings have gained about 17 percent this year, compared with little change in the FTSE Malaysia KLCI Index in the same period. Kuala Lumpur’s new budget passenger terminal probably will hit its peak annual capacity of 45 million passengers much earlier than projected, although it won’t require much fresh investment as most facilities for planned capacity have already been built, Badlisham said. The terminal’s main user is AirAsia Bhd., Asia’s largest budget carrier, which last year criticized the facility over water-logging and taxiway cracks.

Friday’s hideous trading day aside, the market has fared somewhat better this year than in 2015, and some underweighted areas like utilities and telecoms have made big moves. It’s not unusual to see changes made in front of the final quarter of the year. The UBS Dividend Ruler portfolio continue to outperform the overall market, and we continue to think that the outperformance will stay in place for the rest of the year and beyond. The analysts focus on stocks with solid dividends that have consistently grown over time, and their performance this year is once again outstanding. Year to date, the portfolio is up 10.7% on a total return basis, versus the S&P 500’s 7.8%. The portfolio managers make a huge change, removing a venerable blue chip Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) and adding Praxair Inc. (NYSE: PX), a leader in the industrial gas business. Praxair’s debut in the portfolio could be very timely. This top company offers atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, argon and rare gases, and process gases such as carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases and acetylene. It also designs, engineers and builds equipment that produces industrial gases, as well as manufactures precious metal and ceramic sputtering targets used primarily in the production of semiconductors. In addition, the company supplies wear-resistant and high-temperature corrosion-resistant metallic and ceramic coatings and powders to the aircraft, energy, printing, primary metals, petrochemical, textile and other industries. UBS is bullish on Praxair as it is in a sector with a very high barrier to entry. The report said: In short, we believe Praxair is emerging from a challenging period and earnings are poised to begin to grow once again, bolstered by continued favorable trends in end-markets such as healthcare, food and beverages, and electronics. Underscoring the relatively defensive nature of the business, and aggressive cost controls, earnings have fallen by only 12% from the 2014 peak despite very difficult conditions. In addition, management has continued to increase the dividend over the last two years, which suggests confidence in the long term outlook. Boeing exits the Dividend Ruler portfolio with its shares still down over 10% since the beginning of the year. This top aerospace industrial designs, develops, manufactures, sells, services and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services worldwide. The stock has had a very up-and-down year and UBS mentioned this in its report: The commercial aerospace business is cyclical and there are some indications that airlines may have expanded their wide-body fleets too aggressively in recent years, suggesting a period of weaker demand going forward. In addition, the fall in oil prices reduces the incentive to upgrade to the most fuel-efficient planes. Finally, Boeing is launching refreshed versions of the 737 and the 777 in the next couple of years. New product introductions carry the risk of potential cost overruns. As a result, our confidence in the dividend growth outlook has waned and we are removing the shares from our list. Praxair shareholders receive a 2.53% dividend. The UBS price target for the stock is $130, and the Wall Street consensus target is $126.38. The shares closed Monday at $118.53. Boeing shareholders are paid a 3.35% dividend. Its shares are rated Neutral at UBS with a $128 target. The consensus target is higher at $149.27. The stock closed last Monday at $130.12.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) WABC Eyewitness News Tuesday, September 13, 2016 QUEENS, New York (WABC) -- NTSB investigators are blaming pilot error for a Delta Airlines jet skidding off the runway during a snowstorm at LaGuardia Airport in 2015. At a hearing Tuesday, investigators said the captain used too much engine power while trying to stop, which can cause a loss of steering on a slick runway. The plane's left wing struck a perimeter fence. Authorities also questioning the captain's decision to wait six minutes after the crash to order an evacuation. None of the 127 passengers and five crew members was seriously injured in the incident, which happened on March 5 and left Delta Flight 1086 dangerously close to ending up in Flushing Bay. Many said the jet went out of control almost as soon as it touched down, finally skidding to a stop midway down the runway after crashing through the fence. The runway had been plowed minutes before the incident, and two other pilots had reported good braking conditions. Passengers were told to exit over the broken right wing because the door out the back was too close to the water. They climbed off the plane dressed in their heavy winter coats and scarves and tromped through several inches of snow. The plane did not make contact with the water. "As we walked across the runway, it was covered with so much snow that I was wondering: Who decided it was safe to land here?" said passenger Jane Kaufman, of Gainesville, Florida. New York Giant tight end Larry Donnell was aboard, he reported on his Instagram page. When Donnell got off the plane, he posted a picture he took of the scene, captioning it, "Look at this s**t! Knew I shoulda stayed my a** at home." He later released a statement saying, "I'm blessed to be safe and sound after our plane skidded off the runway at LaGuardia airport today. I feel fine physically and hopefully all the other passengers did not have any significant injuries. We were all shocked and alarmed when the plane started to skid, but most importantly, as far as I know ,all of the passengers and flight crew were able to exit the plane safely." Delta released the following statement: "Delta Air Lines' top priority is always the safety of our customers and employees. We cooperated with the National Transportation Safety Board during the course of the investigation and we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations. Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation."

The one-day event will also feature fast-track RFID training on Oct. 19, provided by RFID4U. As news of RFID adoption continues to accelerate in these sectors, RFID in Aerospace and Defense aims to help companies comply with customer requirements and use the technology internally to achieve significant benefits. "RFID is delivering real value, not just to Boeing, Airbus and the U.S. Department of Defense, but to their suppliers as well," says Mark Roberti, RFID Journal's founder and editor. "This event offers a unique opportunity for companies being asked to tag parts and shipments to learn how they can benefit from RFID internally." Case studies presented by Delta Air Lines, the U.S. Air Force, Northrop Grumman and other companies already using RFID will help attendees determine the best technology for their needs and learn best practices from early adopters. The event will feature an advanced, one-day fast-track training course on Oct. 19, presented by RFID4U, which will combine lectures and hands-on lab exercises. The course will prepare participants for the RFID Professional Institute Certified Associate exam. An exam voucher to take one test online is included with the training.

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint New Delhi: Air India Ltd plans to reinstate pilots it sacked after they took part in a two-month strike that brought the airline’s international operations to a halt four years ago.  The airline hopes to use the seven pilots who were seen as key people in instigating the strike seeking exclusivity over flying a certain type of Air India planes to expand its operations. Air India’s executive director (operations) Arvind Kathpalia on 6 September wrote to chairman Ashwani Lohani seeking reinstatement of pilots who were involved in the 2012 strike organized by the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG). Within 48 hours, Lohani cleared the move, which Mint has reviewed. “We are in the receipt of applications from the following pilots who were terminated in IPG agitation in 2012, requesting to be reinstated in the airline,” Kathpalia wrote, naming the pilots in the letter and recommending that in view of plans to induct two more Boeing 777 planes “we may reinstate the above 7 pilots”. ‘We need to fly, not keep aircraft on ground. Please do by tomorrow,” Lohani wrote. Some 100 pilots took part in the 2012 strike; the seven pilots mentioned by Kathpalia weren’t taken back by the airline because they were seen as key instigator, but the others have already been reabsorbed. Lohani cleared the proposal days after another union, the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), on 1 September threatened labour action if its demands for pay raises and other service benefits weren’t met. Lohani had on 5 September written a letter warning of “exemplary disciplinary action” against any employee who resorted to such action. In the context of the tough stand he took, the decision to take back the seven pilots may send the wrong message, some analysts said.  “A disciplinary action issued one day is revoked next day. With this mindset you can never enforce discipline,” said Mohan Ranganathan, a Chennai-based aviation analyst. Also read: Air India wants to do a debt restructuring: Ashwani Lohani “Of late, there are examples like reinstatement of a pilot which had been kept in abeyance because of misconduct and a pilot promotion that has already been challenged in the courts,” Ranganthan said, “Air India has to not just pretend to be tough and but act tough.” Air India suffered a loss of Rs.600 crore in the 58-day strike by pilots in 2012, then civil aviation minister Ajit Singh told Parliament on 14 August 2012. The pilots started reporting sick from 7 May in 2012 in protest against management’s decision to train pilots of erstwhile Indian Airlines to fly long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft. The decision to take back the pilots comes at a time when many Air India pilots flying Boeing 777s are waiting to be promoted. “Ideally those people should have been given training and made commanders instead of taking pilots that caused the company so much harm,” said a person aware of the situation who declined to be named. “It has sent very wrong signals across the company.” Lohani defended the move. “There is no decision so far. We are only examining because we want to fly all Boeing 777s in the overall interest—extra frequencies to San Francisco and a new flight to Washington is on the cards,” Lohani said in a text message in reply to questions from Mint. Air India has 1,700 pilots of which nearly 300 have been recruited in the last one year alone. Boeing 777s are only scheduled to join fleet in the next financial year. All its existing Boeing 777s already operate flights globally.

David Ake A construction worker carries a ladder across the scaffolding on the U.S. Capitol Dome early in the morning, Tuesday, Sept. 6, 2016, in Washington on the day Congress returns to work after their summer holiday. (AP Photo/J. David Ake) WASHINGTON • It looks more and more like Congress will kick the can down the road on the 2017 budget, passing a continuing resolution to get beyond the Nov. 8 elections, and then leaving a resolution to a lame-duck Congress thereafter. How this will affect spending on issues important to the St. Louis region is still unclear. But Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., said Monday she was confident that any final budget and appropriations deal passed by Congress will include one of the biggest potential line items: The extra spending for an additional 14 or more Boeing F/A-18E Super Hornet jets for the Navy built in St. Louis. It may just take longer to get there. The reason: There is substantial momentum for the spending on the new planes, with the House and Senate both passing separate blueprints that include the additional planes earlier this year. There remain big differences over how to pay for the new planes. Democrats complain that House Republicans want to hide its funding by paying for it out of a separate budgetary line item on fighting wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere. But, McCaskill told the Post-Dispatch on Monday that “I think it’s important to realize that both sides have passed” an overall blueprint for the planes and she predicted it would pass in either a catch-all “omnibus” spending bill at year’s end, or in one of a series of smaller “mini-buses” passed late in the year. However, McCaskill signaled she may be a “no” vote if it comes in an omnibus, and even if it has the Super Hornets in it — in large part to protest Congress’s continuing use of such catch-all funding mechanism. “I just think it is a terrible way to spend public money,” she said, complaining that Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had promised to return the Senate to more regular order in the way it passed appropriations and budget bills. McCaskill also said she was confident that Congress would attach funding for additional spending to fight the Zika virus to a continuing resolution because Republicans don’t want to go home to campaign for re-election leaving that issue in the air before a voting public that knows the GOP controls Congress. That issue has become big in the Missouri Senate race between incumbent Republican Sen. Roy Blunt and Democratic Secretary of State Jason Kander. Blunt has been a lead negotiator on a $1.1 billion compromise that passed the Senate earlier this summer. But House Republicans attached riders on flying the Confederate flag at federal cemeteries and banning Planned Parenthood funding that Democrats could not swallow, and they blocked it in the Senate. Kander has accused Blunt of not being able to get the bill passed. Now, expect some finessing of the issue — attaching it to a continuing resolution, for instance — to get Zika funding passed before members of Congress go home to campaign for re-election. (Chuck Raasch) BY THE NUMBERS: $3 billion – estimated cost of the additional F/A-18E Super Hornet jets being contemplated by Congress 5,000 – Jobs in the St. Louis region connected with their construction by Boeing and suppliers, according to Rep. Ann Wagner, R-Ballwin. ON THE WEB: Account of June House passage of the funding for the additional Super Hornets. One account on the Senate’s 2016 work schedule saying it will be in session the fewest days of any of the last 60 years. SHE SAID IT: “Mitch McConnell came into Congress promising two things: We would work all week, and we would get back to regular order (of passing budget bills). Instead he is filling the tree (with extra spending) and he is doing omnibuses (giant, catch-all spending bills). And we have worked fewer days than we have in 60 years.” —Sen.

Noile estimări ale companiei americane sunt cu 7,6% mai mari faţă de prognozele de anul trecut care vizau vânzarea a 6.300 de aparate de zbor. Creşterea comenzilor pe care le vor face companiile aeriene din China va fi susţinută de dezvoltarea clasei de mijloc din statul asiatic şi de noile politici de acordare a vizelor. Potrivit Boeing, traficul de pasageri în China ar urma să avanseze, în fiecare an, cu 6,4%, în următoarele două decenii.

Rough cut only (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT ONLY - NO REPORTER NARRATION Europe's newest passenger plane, the Airbus A350, landed successfully after completing a four-hour maiden test flight on Friday (June 14). The next-generation passenger plane touched down back in Toulouse in southwestern France at 1405 local time (1205 GMT), after a fly-past over the planemaker's Toulouse production site. The flight, with two former fighter pilots at the controls, lasted about four hours and capped eight years of development estimated to have cost $15 billion. French co-pilot Guy Magrin took the controls for the take-off at 10:01 local time (0801 GMT), giving the plane air under its wings for the first time in front of a podium of airline chiefs who have ordered 613 aircraft. It was watched by more than 10,000 Airbus staff and spectators. The long-awaited flight was a milestone for Airbus as it battles against Boeing's 787 Dreamliner for sales of a generation of lightweight jets made from carbon-plastic material designed to save fuel and open up new long-distance routes. Boeing was quickest off the mark with the revolutionary carbon-composite technology and its Dreamliner has outsold the A350 with sales standing at 833 aircraft for 57 customers. Airbus hopes to catch up and also mount a challenge to the U.S. manufacturer's larger, metallic 777, using a later version of the A350. Competition for wide-bodied jets is expected to dominate the Paris Airshow, which begins on Monday (June 17).

It was not a pleasant experience. On Sept. 4, 1971, Alaska Airlines Flight 1866, en route from Anchorage to Seattle via Cordova, Yakutat, Juneau and Sitka, slammed into a mountainside while approaching Juneau International Airport. All 111 people aboard the aircraft were killed. It was – and remains – Alaska’s worst air disaster. “It’s like being on another planet,” wrote Mottram, the Juneau bureau chief for the Associated Press, at the time. At 2,500 feet above sea level, the accident site was enveloped in fog and mist. Instead of a junked aircraft, Mottram saw a junkyard littered with debris and gore. “There isn’t a piece of that 727 jet too big to hold in your hand. The only sound is the wind and the voices of the rescue workers. The clouds move in and out, and you stand on soft, spongy ground, uneasy,” he wrote. Mottram watched as Juneau National Guardsmen and Alaska State Troopers collected the remains of the victims, pieces of people. It would take more than a week to gather those remains and almost a month more to identify them. “You have difficulty even visualizing what it was . visualizing an airplane with smiling people aboard and the stewardess saying, `Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen,”’ Mottram wrote. “It is very quiet up there.” On the 45th anniversary of the accident, if you fly by helicopter to the crash site just as Mottram did, you will still find quiet. You will still find wreckage, too. Resting on stony ground are pieces of fuselage and structure clearly marked with the orange stripes Alaska Airlines used in the 1970s, reported the Juneau Empire. The wreckage has remained undisturbed, but flying hasn’t. In the past 45 years, commercial aviation – both in Juneau and across the nation – has become safer. In 1970, according to statistics kept by the U.S. Department of Transportation, crashes killed 146 people on scheduled commercial flights with more than 12 passengers. These crashes took place in a year when commercial flights scheduled fewer than 2.7 billion miles. In 2015, American commercial flights covered nearly 7.7 billion miles – with no fatalities. No large American airliner has crashed since 2009. That safety record is at least partially a result of lessons learned 45 years ago. Flight 1866 inspired changes in prevention and response that have saved thousands of lives. Forty-five years on, Flight 1866’s crash site is still quiet, but its impact resounds. Barlow inbound On the morning of Sept. 4, 1971, Flight 1866 took off from Anchorage under the command of an experienced crew headed by 41-year-old Dick Adams, a pilot with almost 14,000 hours of flying time. Adams had been with Alaska for more than 16 years and was one of the airline’s more experienced pilots. He was joined in the cockpit by two other experienced crewmen with ample training in the Boeing 727 they flew. In “Character and Characters,” an oral history of Alaska Airlines, author Robert Serling describes the people aboard as “a typical cross-section of passengers from every walk of life, every age group, every economic stratum.” Most were from Alaska. There were nine freshmen heading to class at Sheldon Jackson College and four going to Mount Edgecumbe school. The Anchorage Daily News published brief profiles of some of the others: – Harvey Golub, Alaska’s most experienced bridge engineer, was on his way home from a meeting in Anchorage where he was planning a bridge across the Yukon River. – Cathy Peak was married to a Coast Guardsman stationed in Cordova and was flying home to visit family in Missouri with her sister and daughter. – Judy Nichols was taking her infant son Stephen to meet her future husband in Juneau. – Clint Schilstra was an all-tournament basketball player for Kake at the Gold Medal tournament and taught at the town’s school. – With Schilstra was Kake’s schools superintendent and three other teachers; all were flying home with several hundred pounds of moose meat from a successful hunt in Yakutat. The weather on the day of the crash was typically bad – heavy clouds and fog that forced Adams and his crew to land using instruments instead of peering from their cockpit windows. Juneau’s surrounding mountains preclude the use of normal instrument approaches, but the Federal Aviation Administration has long operated a navigation aid called a “VHF omni-directional range” (VOR) beacon. This beacon, located on Sisters Island in Icy Strait, sends out a radio beam along a set course. It’s supposed to be a reliable landmark when murky clouds interfere with navigation. Another beam comes from the localizer, another beacon at the airport. By determining the angles of the beams reaching an aircraft, that plane’s pilot can determine the aircraft’s approximate location. On that day, however, the Sisters Island beam wasn’t reliable – unknown to anyone, it was almost 45 degrees off its correct direction. According to the official report compiled after the crash, the beacon was sending out a correct signal, but the plane’s instruments were receiving an incorrect one. As a result, when Flight 1866 began to descend toward Juneau, the plane’s crew thought they were eight miles east of the Chilkat Range, at Barlow Cove on Admiralty Island, not directly above the range’s peaks. The crew had ways to verify the plane’s location, but using them wasn’t required and wasn’t part of the normal landing procedure. Also, the crew had no reason to believe they were off course. In its report on the accident, published 13 months after the crash, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded, “the probable cause of this accident was a display of misleading navigational information. The origin or nature of the misleading navigational information could not be determined.” There were no signs the plane ever slowed down or realized it was about to strike a mountain. “This was a nonsurvivable accident,” the NTSB report stated. Responding in a fog That Sept. 4 was a Saturday, but Charlie Smith was in his office at the Alaska Department of Public Safety when word of the crash arrived. He’d spent some of the workweek in Anchorage and needed to catch up. “It was a Saturday, and ironically, I had a ticket to come back on the same plane, but I came back a day early,” he said, sharing his memories of the accident in an interview over coffee. He still lives in Juneau. In addition to working for the state, Smith was the National Guard lieutenant in charge of Juneau’s Guard detachment. When he learned about the accident, he began calling his superiors, asking for permission to mobilize his soldiers to help. When he couldn’t reach them – it was a holiday weekend, after all – he called them out on his own accord. “Granted, it was a recovery, but it started out as a search and rescue mission,” he said. The flight was due to land in Juneau shortly after noon, but when it didn’t arrive, everyone involved knew it was in trouble – they just didn’t know where. The crash wasn’t found until a hired helicopter with an Alaska State Trooper and an Alaska Airlines pilot aboard discovered it about 4:30 p.m. Troopers arrived by helicopter that night to secure the scene and look for survivors, according to an account drafted by the coroner’s office. The Guardsmen arrived the next morning, some of them carried by the Coast Guard cutter Sweetbriar, which was based in Juneau and stayed on scene while workers recovered bodies and debris deemed critical to the accident investigation. A base camp was established at sea level, and for almost a week, helicopters flew constant missions, flitting between base camp and the accident site, between base camp and the airport, and between base camp and the National Guard armory (today’s Juneau Arts and Culture Center), which became a morgue. Juneau’s National Guardsmen were combat engineers, not crash recovery experts. On training missions, they built radio stations and playgrounds. “These young folks really did one heck of a job even though they didn’t have any specific training,” Smith said. “The only training we had back in those days was riot control training because it was the late ’60s, early ’70s . We never had anything like this.” Dennis Egan, now state senator for Juneau, was in the National Guard at the time of the crash. “My wife and I were in Valdez when the crash happened, and lo and behold, we were activated,” he said. They drove to Anchorage and got onto a flight that took them back to Juneau, where Egan spent the following two weeks recovering remains and working at the morgue. “It was horrible. It was just horrible,” he said. “Guys on the plane were friends of mine. Everybody in this town, because it was small enough back then, knew somebody who was on that flight.” Three refrigerated container vans were kept operating 24 hours a day to store the remains while the FBI laboriously identified them through fingerprints, dental records and jewelry. It wasn’t until the end of September that all the remains were identified and left Juneau, according to the coroner’s report now kept in the Alaska State Archives. The process left the armory almost unusable, Smith recalled. All of the FBI and forensics experts were walking around with cigars, Egan said. When he asked why, one of the FBI men cryptically responded, “You’ll get it.” “Opening up those cooler vans – the stench stayed in there because there was so much formaldehyde and other stuff,” Egan said. Afterward, the armory’s floor was pulled up and replaced, and its walls were repainted to get rid of the smell. Fixing the problems that led to the accident would not be so easy. Repairing navigation It became apparent even before the official report that faulty navigation – whether on the part of the pilots or the FAA – was to blame for the accident. Flight 1866’s “black box” cockpit and ground-control recordings were almost immediately recovered and it was discovered that there were no flaws with the aircraft or crew, who believed themselves well east of the mountains. Even though the official investigation wasn’t complete until 13 months after the accident, Gov. Bill Egan wasted no time calling for better groundside navigation equipment. On Sept. 9, five days after the accident, he wrote a letter to the Secretary of Transportation urging him to upgrade the navigation equipment on Sisters Island. “It is my sincere hope that you will understand that because of the topography of the landscape approaching Juneau that extraordinary measures are warranted at once, simply to provide additional air safety that most air travelers take for granted as already being a part of the system,” he wrote. The FAA responded promptly. By year’s end, the agency installed distance-measuring equipment at Sisters Island that would have given the pilots of Flight 1866 a safeguard against the disaster and might have prevented it. The FAA also mandated new standards for planes flying into Juneau’s airport, which had to fly a steeper approach and hold to tougher weather standards. After the NTSB report failed to come up with an adequate explanation for the bent beam, Alaska Airlines employees found the Sisters Island beacon wasn’t set up according to the FAA’s own standards, Serling wrote in his book. Furthermore, while conducting their own experiments, the airline employees found that the beacon could send flawed signals on the rare days when Icy Strait was millpond-smooth. On those days, the beacon’s radio signals could suffer from interference and rotate the signal counter-clockwise, just as experienced by Flight 1866. The results of the airline employees’ experiments were not duplicated by the FAA’s own tests, and the federal agency continues to state in its own official history that “the origin or nature of the misleading navigational information could not be determined.” An FAA spokesman declined to answer questions about the accident. When lawsuits pertaining to the accident were settled in the mid-1970s, the FAA contributed millions of dollars to the final amount paid to the families of crash victims. The exact amount and the details of the settlement remain sealed from public view by court order. ‘Saved’ at the airport John Ladner is Alaska Airlines’ director of operations, the man responsible for training the company’s pilots and ensuring that the experience of Flight 1866 doesn’t happen again. “The navigation systems have evolved dramatically in the decades since 1971 when this accident happened,” Ladner said by phone from Seattle. The distance-measuring equipment added by the FAA “gives you a more clear depiction of where you are,” Ladner explained, but it wasn’t a perfect solution, particularly in Juneau. “Juneau is arguably one of the most difficult airports to fly into in the entire country,” said Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines. That difficulty led to more accidents like the one that claimed Flight 1866. In 1985, a LearJet crashed into the Chilkat Range, killing all four people aboard. In 1992, an Air National Guard aircraft crashed into the mountains, killing all eight aboard – including a brigadier general. Those accidents – each considered a “controlled flight into terrain” as Flight 1866 was – convinced Alaska Airlines and the City and Borough of Juneau (which owns the airport) that more improvements were needed. The solution was a system called “Required Navigation Performance,” which combines onboard navigation and the GPS satellite network to create precise landing paths. It improves safety and efficiency and is reliable even in fog or bad weather that obscures the runway. “I think that each of these sorts of accidents, and especially Flight 1866, was a big driver toward making a safer way to get in there,” Ladner said. In the 1990s, Alaska Airlines and Juneau officials – including Dennis Egan, who was the city’s deputy mayor at the time – lobbied Congress to make Alaska’s capital a testbed for RNP. When the system began operating in 1996, it was the first of its kind in the world. It was successful almost immediately. Alaska Airlines began keeping track of its “saves,” flights able to land under RNP that would have been stopped by bad weather otherwise. In 2011 alone, Alaska Airlines logged 831 “saves” at Juneau International Airport, the company’s then-chairman, Bill Ayer, said at the time. In 1998, following Juneau’s experience, the FAA certified standards that allow airlines to set up their own RNP landing approaches at airports across the country. Internationally, other countries have also set up similar programs. “The RNP has really been something that I think has been a great addition to flying safety,” Ladner said. “It’s really been able to make it safe and efficient.” ‘Terrain! Pull up!’ In the days after Flight 1866 crashed into the Chilkat Range, a small plane deliberately traced its path west of Juneau. Aboard the plane was a young engineer named Don Bateman, and in the plane was a warning device that he had invented. As Bateman’s small plane neared the fatal mountain, a warning sounded. His plane pulled up and flew to safety. Flight 1866 didn’t have that warning. “I was disappointed,” Bateman told Bloomberg reporter Alan Levin earlier this year, recalling the experience of flying over the site. “We needed to do better.” Bateman, now 84, is the inventor of the Ground Proximity Warning System, a device that warns pilots when their planes near mountains. In the 1960s and 1970s, when Flight 1866 crashed, the most common cause of airline disasters was what the National Transportation Safety Board calls “controlled flight into terrain” – hitting the ground without warning. “This (controlled flight into terrain) is something that really over the decades the industry has tried to reduce,” Ladner said. Since 2001, when the FAA began mandating that commercial airliners use an enhanced version of Bateman’s system, not a single commercial airliner has crashed due to a “controlled flight into terrain.” President Barack Obama awarded Bateman the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011, recognizing his achievement. Where the RNP system pioneered by Alaska Airlines is designed to keep planes on track, the equipment designed by Bateman gives pilots critical seconds of warning if something goes wrong. Three years after Flight 1866’s crash, the FAA began requiring large airliners to carry radar altimeters. These devices let pilots know if they were unexpectedly nearing the ground, but they didn’t give advance warning if a plane was approaching a mountain in front of it. After the end of the Cold War, improvements in computer technology and the availability of electronic terrain maps meant that planes could carry a nearly foolproof warning device. “A wonderful thing happened during the end of the Cold War . enlightened people on both sides decided to use the digitized terrain that was developed for military purposes for cruise missiles and so on … for the civil sector, and that’s been very, very good,” Bateman said in a 1998 hearing about the crash of a Boeing 747 on Guam. The newest versions of the warning system give as much as several minutes’ notice before a crash, allowing pilots to avoid problems before they become fatal. With a digital voice that shouts “Terrain! Pull up!” the warnings are impossible to miss. “It’s accidents around the world that drive us to find a better way to do things,” Ladner said. “Smart people start making better devices so we can continue to find a way to operate safely.” Improvements to response Even with these technological breakthroughs, the FAA does not require ground-proximity warning systems like Bateman’s on air taxi aircraft or private aircraft, which now make up the vast majority of fatal air disasters in Alaska. Recently, a pair of small aircraft collided in midair near the Yukon River town of Russian Mission, killing all five people aboard the two planes. As happened 45 years ago with Flight 1866, the Alaska State Troopers and Alaska National Guard were the first on the scene. The response, however, was very different, based on lessons learned in part from Flight 1866. Lt. Col. Tony Stratton of the National Guard is in charge of the Guard’s emergency response in Alaska. In 1971, a 32-year-old Juneau lieutenant called out the Guard to help. If the same thing were to happen today, a lieutenant wouldn’t be making that call. “Communications is probably the biggest difference from then to now,” he said by phone from Anchorage. The state and federal agencies operate a rescue coordination center and emergency operations centers as needed to coordinate agencies and help. “The RCC has a list of agencies that include the Air National Guard, Army National Guard, Civil Air Patrol, Alaska Mountain Rescue. It’s an extensive list, and they’ll go through that list to match needs and capabilities,” he said. Instead of Smith and Juneau troopers calling friends and neighbors to help, there’s a set procedure and process to call into action. There’s better training, too, said Lt. Bryan Barlow, aircraft section commander of the Alaska Department of Public Safety. “State troopers receive specific training in search and rescue and the Incident Response System in their academy curriculum as well as continuing and advanced education in the same topics once they are working in the field,” he wrote. That’s a marked difference from 1971, when Sgt. Harcourt Tew, an instructor at the Trooper academy, wrote in a memo, “I do not feel we were prepared, either with equipment or training, to handle a situation of this type.” Equipment is different and improved. In 1971, the National Guard and Troopers had to turn to Juneau’s sporting goods stores for the gear they needed to work in the Chilkat Range. Now, Troopers and Guardsmen have prepackaged disaster kits that can be delivered by helicopter or aircraft to the scene of an accident. In August, the National Guard tested one of those kits, a 25-person “Arctic Sustainment Package” in an exercise designed to simulate a sinking cruise ship in the Bering Sea. Both agencies say they are better-equipped to handle the human aftermath as well. “Some of my people had some problems with it,” Charlie Smith recalled. One man, who had served during the Vietnam War, said the scene in the Chilkat Range was worse than anything he saw on the battlefield. Overseas, he hadn’t had to cope with the body parts of friends and neighbors. He later asked Smith for a letter of support as he sought federal disability for post-traumatic stress disorder. “Back in those days, they probably didn’t get into drugs, but some of them got into alcohol and stuff like that,” Smith remembered. “Back then, maybe you visited the chaplain because you were having issues or because you were concerned,” Stratton said. Now, “we have (critical stress) instructors who are specifically trained in this arena. When they come back out of the field, they’ll be received by the same group.” A disaster, as it turns out, can affect even the uninjured. An unforgettable album Robert Mottram has retired from the Associated Press. Now living in Anacortes, Washington, he writes books – one about dogs, another about RV-ing across America. During our conversation, he said he distinctly remembers a photo album found by then-state Sen. Bill Ray, who visited the crash site during the recovery. “I stood and looked over his shoulder as he flipped through the pages,” Mottram said. “It soon became apparent that this album belonged to a little girl, a little Native girl who was in a lot of the pictures. It was full of family shots and as we proceeded through the pages, it became apparent who the little girl was,” he said. She was one of the students traveling to Mount Edgecumbe boarding school in Sitka from the North Slope. Mottram said he and Ray concluded that the girl had taken the album with her because she wanted to introduce her school friends to her family, “or, she was taking it because she was going to be homesick and she wanted to bring a part of her family with her.” Alaskans and the world have learned from Flight 1866. Aviation is demonstrably safer and more reliable. “Absolutely,” Egan said. “I’m no pilot, but I can guarantee it.” Mottram said he knows it too, but he also can’t help but think about the price of the lesson. “There were young people who would be alive,” he said. “Those people are still dead, and they probably wouldn’t be yet. When you think about the kids and you think about the potential there, that’s potential we are lacking now. We should still be benefiting now.” “Your mind absolutely refuses to compute,” Ray wrote in the Juneau Empire following the crash. “You breath deeply – again and again – trying to compose your stunned emotions and with an intense effort you barely manage to curb the insane desire to run away – blindly – anywhere, just away. You shudder, blink back the rapidly forming tears, and once again look downward in abject futility at the still and unmoving forms. Why, Dear Lord, why. “ Copyright 2016 Associated Press.

Saying China as a market continued to exceed expectations, Boeing estimated 6,810 aircraft purchases in the period to 2035, up 7.6 percent from its previous prediction of demand until 2034. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, said in a statement. He also said that he expects passenger traffic to grow 6.4 percent in China annually over the next 20 years. Boeing has stayed bullish on China even as other U.S. companies have expressed concern over the country's slower economic growth. A senior Boeing executive said in August that the plane maker was not seeing any softness in demand in China. Boeing and European rival Airbus have been jostling for market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country. Boeing said more than 50 percent of commercial jetliners operating in China are its planes. China, however, is also striving to develop its own aircraft manufacturing capability and aims for its long-delayed C919 jet to make its maiden flight by the end of the year. It hopes the C919 will compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320.

Full Site Menu Jeff Bezos unveils new rocket to compete with SpaceX 2 months ago / Reuters CAPE CANAVERAL – Jeff Bezos on Monday unveiled a heavy-lift reusable rocket expected to compete against Elon Musk’s SpaceX and other companies for commercial satellite launches before the end of the decade. Bezos’ Kent, Washington-based Blue Origin space company is designing two versions of the rocket, named New Glenn, a nod to John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth and the last surviving member of NASA’s original Mercury Seven astronauts. “New Glenn is designed to launch commercial satellites and to fly humans into space,” Bezos, also the founder and chief executive of Amazon.com Inc, said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday. Both versions of New Glenn will use a first stage powered by seven methane-burning BE-4 engines. The company is building a launch site and test facility at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and a rocket manufacturing plant at NASA’s adjacent Kennedy Space Centre. Blue Origin also intends to sell the BE-4 to United Launch Alliance for its new Vulcan rocket. ULA is a partnership of Lockheed Martin Corp and Boeing Co. Blue Origin intends to fly New Glenn’s first stage back to a landing pad so it can be refurbished and reflown, an approach that fellow tech billionaire entrepreneur Musk is taking with his Falcon rockets. SpaceX so far has successfully landed rockets six times, twice on the ground and four times on a platform floating in the ocean. SpaceX had expected to try a seventh landing on 3 September, but its rocket was destroyed during a routine prelaunch test two days before lift-off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The cause of the accident, which destroyed a $200 million Space Communication Ltd satellite, is under investigation. Blue Origin has been testing a smaller, reusable rocket and spaceship called New Shepard, which is intended to fly paying passengers to an altitude of about 62 miles (100km) so they can experience a few minutes of microgravity and see the limb of Earth set against the blackness of space. Blue Origin has not yet started selling tickets for rides. If test flights continue as expected, Blue Origin pilots could begin flying next year, with paying passengers to follow in 2018, Bezos told Reuters during an interview earlier this year.

An artistic rendition of the GiSAT. The satellite, carrying new digital payload technology, will provide satellite coverage over Sub-Saharan Africa to stream media and digital broadcast content. The image is courtesy of Boeing. Boeing (NYSE:BA) is the firm that has been contracted to build a 702 satellite that is being named GiSAT. The craft will offer a payload of twice the previous digital payload design capacity. The customer is Cayman Islands-based Global IP and they will use the satellite to offer coverage to 35 countries and 750 million people—GiSAT will deliver higher data rates at lower costs than previous satellites serving this part of the world. Scheduled to enter service in 2019, GiSAT is designed to operate with more than 10 gateways in Europe and multiple gateways within Africa. Privately owned Global IP was founded by three satellite industry veterans with 75 years of combined experience providing satellite products and services in emerging markets. The company CEO, Bahram Pourmand, was until recently Executive Vice President and General Manager, International Division of Hughes Network Systems LLC. The other two founders, Emil Youssefzadeh and Umar Javed, were founders and executives of STM, one of the VSAT industry pioneers with a 15 year track record in Africa before the sale of STM in 2013 in a private equity transaction. According to Bahram Pourmand, the CEO of Global IP, the company's vision for GiSAT is to provide end users with connectivity and services that are affordable, rich in local content and truly broadband in nature. With the ability to reconfigure the GiSAT on-board processor, the Boeing digital payload will allow the firm to broadcast different channels to different beams from different locations, providing better service to broadcasters, mobile operators and ISPs. www.boeing.com gip.io/ Topical Tags :  Events    Manufacturing    Business Moves    Satellite Operator          Regional Tags :  Middle East/Africa    North America                 FREE SUBSCRIPTIONS Today's Top News Thrusting Galileo Update: Thursday Evening's Status...ULA's Atlas V Gets Ready To GOES-R Better Satellite World Award Honorees Brought To Light By SSPI Core Concerns Regarding Cybersecurity For The Satellite Industry Voiced By SIA & GVF Pairing Up For Multi-Screen Goodness Are Broadpeak & Eutelsat Communications More News AST Involved In Weather Warning Implementation System In Malaysia Rock Seven Is Buoyed Up For Seafaring SATCOM Solutions The Rebirth Of A UK Satellite Broadcasting Group Care To Chip In To Project Blue?

Saying China as a market continued to exceed expectations, Boeing estimated 6,810 aircraft purchases in the period to 2035, up 7.6 per cent from its previous prediction of demand until 2034. "The continuing expansion of China's middle class, coupled with new visa policies and a wide range of widebody airplanes... gives us every reason to expect a very bright future for China's long-haul market," Randy Tinseth, Boeing Commercial Airplanes' vice president of marketing, said in a statement. He also said that he expects passenger traffic to grow 6.4 per cent in China annually over the next 20 years. Boeing has stayed bullish on China even as other US companies have expressed concern over the country's slower economic growth. A senior Boeing executive said in August that the plane maker was not seeing any softness in demand in China. Boeing and European rival Airbus have been jostling for market share in China, the world's fastest growing aviation market, with both opening assembly plants in the country. Boeing said more than 50 percent of commercial jetliners operating in China are its planes. China, however, is also striving to develop its own aircraft manufacturing capability and aims for its long-delayed C919 jet to make its maiden flight by the end of the year. It hopes the C919 will compete with Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320.  - Reuters/rw Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now A fan blade on a jet engine snapped off a Southwest Airlines Co. plane last month in a violent failure that sent debris slamming into the plane, according to a preliminary investigative report released Monday. Investigators with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board found evidence of a crack "consistent" with metal fatigue in the titanium-alloy blade, it said in a statement released on the agency's website. The Boeing Co. 737-700 was forced to make an emergency landing in Pensacola, Fla., Aug. 27 after parts of the left engine broke apart, damaging the fuselage, wing and tail. The plane lost cabin pressure and passengers Tweeted pictures of themselves with oxygen masks on. While no one was hurt on the flight from New Orleans to Orlando, Fla., some of the 99 passengers aboard reported on social media that the diversion was harrowing as they looked outside and saw the air intake known as a cowling had been ripped loose, exposing the front of the engine.  The CFM56 engine was built by CFM International Inc., a joint venture between General Electric Co. and Safran SA. The NTSB has not determined the cause of the failure. Lost Pressure An unidentified shard put a 5-by-16-inch gash in the side of the plane above the wing, according to investigators. The cabin leaked air and lost pressure after the failure, though the NTSB said no metal from the engine pierced the cabin and no debris was found within the plane. NTSB investigators view so-called uncontained failures seriously because they can fling heavy metal parts into fuel lines, electronics and the passenger compartment. And under requirements in the U.S. and other nations, it's never supposed to happen. Regulations hold that jet engines must be built with a strong enough exterior casing to prevent fan blades and other debris from breaking through in the event of a failure. Tests must be conducted simulating a fan-blade breakup to prove that the metal shards can't escape. Modern jet engines contain a series of spinning fans, and if one of them breaks apart, it can eject blades and other metal debris at high speeds. Checking for cracks Engine manufacturers and airlines conduct periodic inspections on planes designed to spot any evidence of cracks or weakening of the metal due to fatigue. Investigators did not say why they suspect the fan blade broke loose. "GE and Safran continue to assist the NTSB in its investigation," GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said. The last maintenance check on the Southwest plane was on Aug. 21, according to Brandy King, an airline spokeswoman. While increasingly rare, engine failures that propel shrapnel into the fuselage of a plane have proved fatal in the past. A mother and child seated in a Delta Air Lines Inc. plane were killed on July 6, 1996, in Pensacola when the left power plant on a Boeing MD-88 broke apart while accelerating for takeoff. After the front fan blade disintegrated, it sent metal shards flying into the plane where people were sitting, according to the NTSB. A manufacturing defect in the engine, made by United Technologies Corp. division Pratt & Whitney, should have been detected by airline maintenance workers performing routine inspections, the NTSB investigation concluded. Shrapnel damage The NTSB and other accident investigation agencies around the world occasionally probe other cases in which engines on airliners fail so violently that shrapnel escapes the hardened casing around the turbine and causes more damage. An Airbus Group SE A380 double-decker jet flying from Singapore to Sydney suffered extensive damage on Nov. 4, 2010, when high-velocity debris from one engine sprayed the plane and two other power plants. The Qantas Airways Ltd. pilots managed to land despite damage to the plane's hydraulics system, electronics and three out of the four engines, according to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The failure was traced back to pipes installed on the engine that were too thin and cracked, according to the ATSB. Overall, jet engine reliability has improved dramatically since the technology was introduced, and airliners now routinely fly across oceans with just two power plants because breakdowns are so rare. While far below the leading causes of accidents and death, engine failures ranked fourth in the decade from 2006 through 2015 with 165 fatalities, according to Boeing statistics. Southwest has begun repairs on the plane, the airline said in an e-mailed statement. The carrier deferred to the NTSB to release details of the investigation. — Alan Levin and Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg News View Comments Tags Airlines Southwest Airlines Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

In an update to its probe of the Boeing Co 737's rare engine failure, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a fan blade separated from the engine and was not recovered, except for the base of the blade that was still attached to the aircraft. The agency also said that during the accident engine debris impacted the plane's side to create the hole above the left wing. The debris did not penetrate into the cabin interior, the agency said. The plane, bound from New Orleans to Orlando with 99 passengers and five crew members aboard, lost cabin pressure and safely diverted to Pensacola. There were no injuries. The investigation update still leaves unanswered what exactly caused the "uncontained" engine failure, a rare and hazardous event in which components rapidly exit an engine and can collide with the aircraft. The NTSB said in a statement that it still must review the engine's maintenance records and examine blade surfaces for cracks. Representatives for Southwest and General Electric Co, which produced the engine with Safran SA in a joint venture known as CFM International, said the companies continue to work closely with the NTSB on the investigation. The aircraft has been released to Southwest, which has started the repair process, a spokeswoman for the airline said.

BUSINESS Blue Origin's new, more powerful rocket will compete with SpaceX Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket Blue Origin A rendering of Blue Origin's planned New Glenn rocket alongside rockets made by other companies. A rendering of Blue Origin's planned New Glenn rocket alongside rockets made by other companies. (Blue Origin) Samantha Masunaga Seattle-area Blue Origin released details Monday about its new orbital reusable rocket, further pitting Jeff Bezos’ space company against Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Named after astronaut John Glenn, who was the first American to orbit the Earth, the New Glenn rocket will lift off with 3.85 million pounds of thrust from seven engines and have a diameter of 23 feet. That makes it more powerful than SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket, but not quite as powerful as the Hawthorne company’s Falcon Heavy rocket, which has yet to launch, but will have more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. The Delta IV Heavy rocket, made by a joint venture of Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., has about 2 million pounds of thrust. Blue Origin’s rocket will come in two variants — a two-stage, 270-foot-tall rocket, and a three-stage, 313-foot-tall rocket that will be capable of flying beyond low-Earth orbit. In an email to followers, Bezos said the company plans to launch New Glenn for the first time “before the end of the decade” at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The rocket is designed to launch commercial satellites, as well as fly humans into space, he said. “Our vision is millions of people living and working in space,” Bezos said in the email. “New Glenn is a very important step.” Blue Origin has been testing its New Shepard suborbital launch vehicle at its West Texas facility. The vehicle is intended to take tourists into space, and the company has launched and re-landed the rocket booster four consecutive times.  The company said the lessons learned from New Shepard, especially about reusability, will be incorporated into New Glenn and its reusable rocket booster. The new rocket will be powered by Blue Origin’s BE-4 liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas engines, which the company has been developing for United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket. The engine is intended to replace the Russian rocket engines that have blasted U.S. government spy satellites into space. Blue Origin has said the low-cost availability of liquefied natural gas allows for an “extended engine development program.” Experts have also said methane is clean, meaning it is less likely to clog fuel lines and could reduce the amount of rigorous cleaning needed to clear particulates and make it easier to reuse rockets. Many rockets use liquid oxygen and kerosene as a propellant. The company did not release details on pricing, but an analyst said the company will likely try to leverage the cost savings from its reusable rocket booster to be competitive with SpaceX, the industry’s low-price leader. “It’s basically a declaration that they’re entering the market,” said Phil Smith, senior space analyst for the Tauri Group, a space and defense analytic consulting firm. He said it is “fairly clear” New Glenn will be a heavy-lift vehicle, capable of carrying huge satellites into high orbits. That means Blue Origin could be setting itself up to compete with United Launch Alliance and SpaceX for lucrative national security launch contracts. “These vehicles can tap any and all markets, so that gives maximum flexibility,” Smith said. Blue Origin has long been interested in ferrying tourists into space. The company has said its New Shepard will carry humans more than 62 miles above the Earth. But the company’s next project could be even more ambitious. “Up next on our drawing board: New Armstrong,” Bezos said in the email, a possible hint of the company’s plans to send the next launch vehicle to the moon. So far, Blue Origin has named each of its launch vehicles after the U.S. astronaut that first accomplished that feat. Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.

Russell Berman 4:50 AM ET Marina Koren Sep 12, 2016 News Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size NEWS BRIEF Blue Origin, the aerospace company founded by Jeff Bezos, has unveiled the design of a new rocket that will carry satellites and astronauts to space, fly back to land on Earth, and stand almost as tall as the rocket that launched Americans to the moon nearly 50 years ago. Bezos said in an email Monday that the orbital rocket, known as the New Glenn, will be ready for a test launch before the end of this decade. The rocket is named for John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth. Here’s a look at New Glenn, alongside other rockets—past, present, and in development: Blue Origin’s next step…meet New Glenn #NewGlenn #GradatimFerociter pic.twitter.com/p4gICKZRfi — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) September 12, 2016 New Glenn will measure 23 feet in diameter, with 3.85 million pounds of thrust. It will be powered by seven Blue Engine 4 rocket engines, which Blue Origin has spent more than four years developing, that burn liquefied natural gas and liquid oxygen. The same kind of engine will power the new Vulcan rocket (pictured above) from United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which is scheduled for test launch around 2019. The New Glenn family will include two variations. The two-stage version of the rocket will be 270 feet tall. The three-stage version will stand 313 feet high, with a “high specific impulse hydrogen upper stage” that will allow the rocket to fly further into space, beyond low-Earth orbit. The image Bezos shared on Twitter was meant to drive the point home—to both the public and his competitors—that the New Glenn will be huge. The rocket will also be powerful; with 3.85 million pounds of liftoff thrust, the New Glenn will surpass the United Launch Alliance’s Delta IV Heavy, the most powerful rocket in operation, at 1.6 million pounds. SpaceX, Elon Musk’s spaceflight company, seeks to surpass them both; its Falcon Heavy, whose first launch is scheduled for November, will generate 5.13 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. Here’s some more perspective on power, from Eric Berger at Ars Technica: By way of further comparison, the space shuttle’s main engines had an individual thrust of 470,000 pounds. Along with its solid-rocket boosters, the shuttle had 7 million pounds of thrust at launch. The Saturn V rocket, with five F1 engines, had about 7.5 million pounds of thrust. So Blue Origin’s very first orbital rocket will have slightly more than half the thrust of the rockets that carried humans to the Moon. Bezos said Monday his company’s reusable rocket, New Shepard, “has taught us so much about how to design for practical, operable reusability.” In November 2015, Blue Origin launched New Shepard—named for Alan Shepard, the first American in space—and returned it to Earth for a soft, vertical landing, becoming the first to successfully land a reusable rocket on the ground after launch.

Twitter previousIt's Not the Cough, It's the Cover-UpnextThe Truth About Undocumented Immigrants and Taxes Most Popular Presented by Mike Segar/ Reuters Donald Trump's Choice for National Security Adviser Has One Priority: Combatting 'Radical Islamic Terrorism' Krishnadev Calamur Michael Flynn is also known for his long military career and his unceremonious exit from the Defense Intelligence Agency. Michael Flynn, the retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) whom Donald Trump has reportedly picked to be his national security adviser, is known for his long and distinguished military career, his unceremonious exit from the DIA, and for his controversial views on Islam, torture, and Russia. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was an early and ardent supporter of Trump’s improbable presidential run, giving the Republican presidential hopeful a much-needed endorsement from the national-security establishment. He led crowds at Trump’s rallies to chant “Lock her up” about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent. “Donald Trump is about the future of this country and making sure that we take a direction … that puts us back on a track that we can continue to be the global leader around the world,” he told Fox Business Network in July. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty Progress Isn't Natural Joel Mokyr Humans invented it—and not that long ago. How and why did the modern world and its unprecedented prosperity begin? Many bookshelves are full of learned tomes by historians, economists, political philosophers and other erudite scholars with endless explanations. One way of looking at the question is by examining something basic, and arguably essential: the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress. Such a belief may seem self-evident today, but most people in the more-remote past believed that history moved in some kind of cycle or followed a path that was determined by higher powers. The idea that humans should and could work consciously to make the world a better place for themselves and for generations to come is by and large one that emerged in the two centuries between Christopher Columbus and Isaac Newton. Of course, just believing that progress could be brought about is not enough—one must bring it about. The modern world began when people resolved to do so.               Continue Reading Jacky Naegelen / Reuters The Problem With Abandoning the Paris Agreement Robinson Meyer Bill O’Reilly and Barack Obama agree: President-Elect Trump shouldn’t walk away from the first international climate treaty. If the Trump administration withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement, the country would face a massive global diplomatic backlash and permanently cede worldwide leadership on climate and renewable-energy issues to China, experts warn. Withdrawing from the treaty “would be a huge mistake, even forgetting about climate change,” said Todd Stern, the former U.S. special envoy on climate change. He added that it would have “radiating bad impacts with respect to U.S. standing” on all other international issues. We know very little for sure about the Trump administration’s foreign policy. So far, he has seemed to choose Russia-friendly advisors like General Michael Flynn, and he has not backed down from previous threats of a trade war with China. If the U.S. were to renege on its NATO commitments or enter a battle of tariffs with China, this could so remake global order that climate would slide off the international agenda. Continue Reading Mike Reddy Can America’s Companies Survive America’s Most Aggressive Investors? Alana Semuels So-called activist investors are increasingly gaining control of legacy corporations, forcing them to trim payrolls and downsize research operations—and, quite possibly, damaging the entire economy. WILMINGTON, Del.—Ron Ozer was thrilled to get a job with DuPont, the two-centuries-old chemical company, when he finished his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1990. It was the place to go for young, ambitious chemists; it offered salary and benefits so generous that some people called it “Uncle Dupey.” For 26 years, he invented things for DuPont, filing patent after patent, working on renewable plastic bottles and polymers from the company’s Experimental Station, a research lab where Kevlar, Neoprene, and nylon were all invented. Then, in January of this year, he was abruptly fired, along with hundreds of other employees at the Experimental Station, part of a company-wide wave of 1,700 layoffs, one-third of DuPont’s Delaware workforce. Globally, DuPont cut 10 percent of its workforce, or 5,000 people in early 2016. Continue Reading Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Will Trump Be Ready to Govern? Russell Berman The early days of his transition have looked like chaos, but veterans of the process say the president-elect has time to catch up. This was not exactly how the 2016 presidential transition was supposed to go. For years, legislators, civil servants, good-government advocates, and veterans of the last several administrations had been preparing for this very moment. Congress had passed two new laws allowing the two major-party nominees to begin planning earlier than ever, and the Obama administration was committed to handing off the baton of government in full stride. The singular goal was to make this transfer of presidential power the smoothest, most effective transition in U.S. history. Then came the unexpected victory of Donald Trump to blow it all to bits. The Trump transition has looked, from the outside, like a mess. Days after winning the presidency, the new president-elect abruptly replaced the man who for months had been running his transition efforts, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with the soon-to-be vice president, Mike Pence. Other departures quickly followed in what was described as “a purge” of people close to Christie. The leadership swap caused an important paperwork snafu, delaying by several days the point when Trump’s “landing teams” of potential appointees could begin on-the-job training at federal departments and agencies. A former national-security official in Republican administrations, Eliot Cohen, emerged from a single conversation with the transition team only to warn others to stay away. One of Trump’s first appointments, chief strategist Steve Bannon, prompted a firestorm of criticism over his website’s links to white nationalism. Leaks flowed out of Trump Tower faster than transition staff could plug them, while the president-elect himself sneaked away from his press corps for an evening out at the 21 Club in Manhattan. Continue Reading Adult Swim The Battle Over Adult Swim’s Alt-Right TV Show David Sims The future of the sketch series Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace has become a political flashpoint for the subversive network. At a glance, Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace seems like typical fare for Adult Swim, the alternative, late-night comedy channel that airs on the Cartoon Network after 9 p.m. One of a coterie of bizarre series on the channel, the show lurches from one surreal, sometimes violent, sketch to the next, and describes itself as being set in an “almost present-day, post-apocalyptic nightmare world.” But Million Dollar Extreme, which premiered in August, is also from the mind of Sam Hyde, an unapologetic member of the alt-right. Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young, liberal, Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to like-minded members of a white-nationalist movement that generally supports Donald Trump.

Official White House photographer Pete Souza spent those years by the president’s side, capturing more than two million moments, large and small. The resulting body of work documents the work and play that took place in the White House and beyond, with a number of iconic images that will live for years in history books. Below, I’ve gathered a collection of forty-four of Souza’s images of the 44th president.

What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar. Continue Reading Jean-Sebastien Evrard / AFP / Getty How Light Bulbs Watch You Buy Groceries Kaveh Waddell The same technology that helps stores track shoppers may one day replace Wi-Fi. In an enormous grocery store in northern France, the lights above the aisles aren’t all they seem to be. They look ordinary—more than a mile and a half of fixtures exuding bright light, folded into a grid overhead—but they’re actually flickering faster than the human eye can see. The unique patterns each individual section of lighting emits are a 21st-century twist on Morse code, meant not for people, but for the cameras on their phones. If shoppers grant the store’s app access to their smartphone’s front-facing lens, the phone can watch for the lights and use the pulses to pinpoint its location. Doing so allows the app to plot the best routes for shopping lists, tracking people as they travel through the store. (The guidance might come in especially handy for first-time visitors to the 84,000-square foot Carrefour “hypermarket,” the French equivalent of a Walmart.)

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website two  +   =  10 Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Updated Dec. 22, 2015: Eager investors want to know if SpaceX stock is any closer to hitting the market – possible IPO in 2016? – especially after today's news from Florida… Last night, the company accomplished a historic landing. Ten minutes after its Falcon 9 rocket launched to carry 11 satellites into space, the rocket's booster touched back down safely in a vertical, pinpoint landing in Cape Canaveral. That means the booster can be reused – greatly diminishing the cost of space travel. This third attempt at booster recovery came after two unsuccessful tries. The first time, the Falcon 9 booster crashed and exploded after running out of hydraulic fluid on return. The second time, it was slightly off kilter and tipped over. "The Falcon has landed," SpaceX's launch commentator said in a webcast of the event. Applause, cheers, and "U.S.A." chants erupted at SpaceX's California headquarters. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk took to Twitter: Musk's moonshot private space exploration company is situated like a key in the doorway to an entire new wave of tech. The young entrepreneur is working hard to make SpaceX the preeminent commercial space flight firm in the world… SpaceX Dragon launched into low-earth orbit atop SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Dec. 8, 2010. The company has booked nearly 50 launches through 2017, expected to bring in roughly $5 billion in sales. SpaceX was the first commercial company hired by NASA to ferry supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). And it won another contract, along with Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA), to fly astronauts to the station. SpaceX aims to send humans to Mars' surface within 10 to 20 years. In a July 2013 interview with The Guardian, Elon Musk said he'd like to fund a colony of 80,000 people on the red planet – and become a colonist himself. "The key thing for me is to develop the technology to transport large numbers of people and cargo to Mars. That's the ultimate awesome thing." At a forum last year, Musk noted "there are no runways on Mars." In other words, rockets would have to land using the thrust of their engines – like the Falcon 9 booster did today. On top of all that, SpaceX remains consistently cash-flow positive, and has venture backing. Imagine the returns if you owned a chunk of SpaceX stock the day the news breaks that alien life exists… Owning SpaceX stock would be like owning Google stock when the company unlocked a way to organize and search data on the web – shares went up 179% their first year on the market. Search rivals that sprung up later, like Yahoo and Bing, have never caught up (more than two-thirds of the world's Internet searches were made through Google in 2013, the most recent available data). But there's a big obstacle preventing investors from snapping up SpaceX shares: it is still privately held and hasn't made any announcements to change… When Can You Buy SpaceX Stock? Money Morning Defense & Tech Specialist Michael A. Robinson, a 34-year Silicon Valley veteran and one of the top tech financial analysts today, thinks eventually we will be able to invest in SpaceX stock. "[Musk] hasn't yet announced plans to take SpaceX public, but I believe that's what he'll do. I base that on what happened with Tesla," Robinson said on Oct. 14, 2014. We can piece together a few telling clues from Musk himself… Join the conversation.

Goodnight | April 22, 2015 I think the estimate is that it takes three light years to get to Mars. What would we do IF we ever got to Mars, –mess it up as is being done here? Let's clean up Planet Earth, there's plenty to do here. We can start with cleaning up the ocean. People running from one doctor to the next trying to find decent medical care but can't find it. We've spent billions on space when the money is needed right here. Come on people, let's use some common sense. Reply Serj | April 24, 2015 "I think the estimate is that it takes three light years to get to Mars." – Which grade are you? At closest range it's .00000589429108 light years, which is 34,649,589 miles. Reply Martin Cross | May 1, 2015 Mess up Mars? At its current state? There is nothing there to ruin. You assume athat because people invest in space that there is no money spent on Earth. Think Tesla Motors, Solar City, and the now battery for home storage, also fusion research if thats what you prefer. Also Desalination as energy becomes cheaper. Moreover, there will be money spent anywhere and circulated at least. People spending money on space also care about Earth, the environment. People (with jobs)get paid for it, marketers, suppliers, engineers, scientists, geologists, develepors, manufacturers whom they also donate money to good cause projects or organizations . Reply Bishop Goff | May 18, 2015 Whats a couple billion dollars for significant new scientific discoveries yet to be found with space exploration. Thats nothing we spent 600+ billion sending troops to protect democracy wink wink (protect oil wells). America would have trillions if GE, Google, OU Pont, verizon, and many more companies paid there taxes like we all do. They get to send there money to offshore accounts and pay ZERO in taxes. WERE NOT BROKE. Mars is step 1 Titan is step 2. If we go to Titan and bring just a little Helium3 from saturn we will be much closer to nuclear fusion..which is the key to energy and much cheaper space exploration. Reply drew | June 19, 2015 If the major corporations pay the taxes you suggest, you will pay a substantial premium for their products and the "trillions" you suggest we would have will be evaporated through a process called inflation. Corporations will not reduce their margins just because they now pay taxes. So, all you have achieved is an increase in the size of big government and a reduction of the purchasing power of the individual. Do you think the government can more appropriately spend your money than you can? I'm not even sure what your point is… that government should be funding space exploration? I think that SpaceX is a defining example that this is not necessary. Reply Neko | May 26, 2015 Light year is a unit of distance. It doesn't take 3 years at the speed of light to reach mars. If we don't leave Earth, we are eventually going to run into a planet killing asteroid, or other existential risk that would wipe out humanity. Hawking, Musk, Tyson, every forward thinking scientist says space is critical if we want humanity to be anything other than a blip on a cosmological timescale. Space or extinction. Reply james | June 10, 2015 no, not three light years to mars…4 light years to alpha centari the next nearest star (50,000 years with current technology) Mars takes 6-8 months, at the moment ; ) Reply David Zeiler | June 10, 2015 Just to be clear: a light-year is a measure of distance (how far light can travel in one year), not time. Reply Ryan | June 21, 2015 Umm might want to check your math again. It only takes months to get to Mars. That's using current tech. Odds are there'll be a boom in propulsion tech with the market going private from govt. Reply Not a fool | August 1, 2015 I have no idea where you're getting you're information, but you're wrong on so many levels. 1. A lightyear is a unit of distance, not time. It takes ~260 days to reach Mars. 2. Assuming you were talking distance: Mars is about one ten-thousandth of a lightyear away. Not 3. 3. The technology that comes out of investments in spaceflight technology significantly help Earth. They have for decades, and will continue to. Reply Morgan | September 12, 2016 One light year is a measure of distance, the distance light travels in a vacuum given one year. Reply H. Craig Bradley | April 23, 2015 CHASING MOONBEAMS SPACE X is a clear indication that the stock market is close to a top and peak in investor sentiment, as well. Only when such grandiose ideas are taken seriously can one spot an extreme in bullish sentiment, circa 1929. Pretty soon, they will be singing "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star…." like space scientists at JPL. Then, its back to earth in real time ( reentry). Reply Jerry Liebst | May 8, 2015 OK, Mars not so attractive short term!, maybe too far away for now; BUT the moon and all its' possibilities for use as a practical space station, future launching site to who knows where, not to mention mining its' vast resources, can literally be reached in days! Elon and SpaceX are the new Chris and his 3 boats. I don't want a seat on the boats but I would like to be waiting back on earth with the Queen of Spain. I'm in line, let me buy some stock ASAP! By the way, how did that made in a garage green screen calculator thingy workout? Reply Jeff | September 1, 2015 @V. Goodnight: You miss the entire point of why we should strive to reach Mars.

September 12, 2016 by Lorrie Lykins When it comes to developing and retaining talent, staying ahead of the competition requires raising the bar to an increasingly higher level. For learning leaders in high-performance organizations focused on transforming learning processes and improving leadership development practices, using diverse developmental activities, in particular, talent mobility, is a critical element. A September 2015 global study, “Talent Mobility Matters,” conducted by the Institute for Corporate Productivity found that talent mobility — defined by i4cp’s nearly 40-member Chief Learning and Talent Officer Board, as: rapidly and strategically identifying, developing, and deploying talent to meet business needs, customer requirements, and employee aspirations — is part of the learning and development strategy for high-performance organizations. The board collectively posited that companies should consider cutting or reducing classroom training budgets in favor of experiential learning activities that walk hand-in-hand with internal talent moves. This coincides with survey data, which indicates that high-performance organizations are two times more likely to prioritize talent mobility than lower-performing companies. Leaders in these high-performance organizations view talent development and retention as essential parts of a winning formula to fill key roles with internal talent. “Talent Mobility Matters” surveyed more than 650 respondents, and its data revealed that leaders in high-performance organizations should extend their gazes beyond their companies to collaborate with external partners to provide developmental opportunities for employees. Forming mutually beneficial partnerships with external stakeholders for employee development is not yet a widely adopted strategy, but it has a positive correlation to market performance, and is often employed by a relatively small group of top-performing organizations, including Boeing. Further, the survey results support much of what learning leaders know anecdotally to be true: The best companies build cultures of mobility. High-performance organizations are more than twice as likely to prioritize talent movement; low-performing companies are two-and-a-half times more likely to say that talent movement doesn’t matter — reinforcing the link between mobility and market performance. Among high-performance organizations, talent mobility is carefully planned and executed, rather than a reactive move. Leaders at global project management firm Schlumberger, which was featured in the study, promote a “borderless careers” philosophy. Essentially, they believe the best way to develop people for leadership roles is to give them exposure in three areas: cross-geography, cross-business, and cross-function. “The idea is to take risks on people,” said Career Planning and Leadership Development Manager Janice Hyslip. “If you take risk on one axis, that’s limited risk or reasonable risk. If you take risk on two axes, it’s bigger risk, where you have to wait it out and maybe support the person more. So we give people lots of different chances in lots of roles around the company.” FedEx Ground takes things a step further; the company has built a strategy around looking at the career ladder differently. No longer does it only go up; by emphasizing lateral, internal career moves the organization can meet business needs as well as employees’ career needs, provide cross-functional exposure and develop talent without losing them. Strong talent mobility programs are built on transparency and communication. High-performance organizations are more likely to define talent mobility broadly, to track their top talent, to reward managers for developing and moving their direct reports, and to communicate job openings across the enterprise. They are also 4½ times more likely to report that criterion for talent mobility is transparent to their entire organizations. See Figure 1. Leading organizations build cultures of mobility to retain top talent. True cultures of mobility encourage and enable employees to look at internal opportunities before they look externally. High-performance organizations say high-potential talent retention is the leading catalyst for investing in talent mobility; 30 percent of respondents said talent mobility demonstrates to employees that they have a future with the company. Only 10 percent of low-performing organizations agreed with this statement. But while the study found that having a formal talent mobility process correlates to high performance, only one-third of the survey respondents reported that their organizations have any kind of system or process in place to address talent mobility. To be effective as a growth and retention strategy, talent movement as well as assignment duration must be thoughtfully determined based on the employees’ developmental needs, the project and team needs the employee will be moved to, and ultimately business needs. See Figure 2. Further, organizations must start early. At Schlumberger, the employee population is considered the foundation for its next generation of leaders. Managers look deep into the organization to identify top talent early so that they receive the development they need and demand. This formal talent mobility strategy identifies employees as soon as they are hired, which helps high-performance organizations hang onto top talent, while ensuring their succession pipelines are well established. It’s important to provide incentives for managers to develop and move their people, but the following are also important considerations: Pre-movement assessment: Movement for movement’s sake makes no sense; employ assessments to ensure the right people are being moved into the right roles for the right reasons. Assessments can identify developmental needs that, if met, might aid time to productivity in the role. Orientation: Fully integrating employees into new teams and roles is critical for success. Offboarding/reboarding: Whether it’s returning from an assignment abroad, from an external partner, or a rotation on another team in the organization, having clear plans and processes to reassimilate people who return from developmental assignments is a practice that correlates with market performance. To build success with talent mobility, look closely at the organization’s current, likely long-standing structure and consider loosening up on policies that restrict talent movement. Create a clearly articulated talent mobility definition and process — most organizations have not done this — and ensure that all employees are aware of available job openings enterprisewide. When mobility isn’t an option for whatever reason, it’s incumbent on learning leaders to model creativity in thinking, expanding roles and responsibilities to actively engage high-potential employees. This can go a long way to sustain a culture in which employees are eager to take on new assignments and responsibilities. See Figure 3. A mobility program that enables strategic and planned talent movement helps meet the growing demand among all high-performing employees — not just the millennial generation — for greater control and flexibility such as variability in jobs and roles, as well as development opportunities. The value of connecting with external stakeholders is a strategy without parallel, and in addition to the opportunity such partnerings offer high-potential employees, the perspective leaders gain deepens exponentially. A leader who is able to lead beyond the figurative and literal confines of their organization to develop employees and create influence with critical stakeholders such as customers, partners and distributors is one who is positioning their organization — and themselves — for success now and well into the future.

The move is the latest by Chief Executive Warren East to rebuild Rolls-Royce in the wake of a series of profit warnings. The company, which is no longer affiliated with the luxury car maker, is bracing for a big ramp-up in production of its commercial aircraft engines to satisfy demand for Airbus Group SE and Boeing Co. long-range jets. Mr. Kirby, 51 years old, currently runs government-owned HS2 Ltd., the company charged with building a new high-speed rail system in the U.K. He will join Rolls-Royce in the newly created position in the coming months, the London-based company said Saturday. Mr. Kirby, who previously held jobs in the British defense industry, will be responsible for overseeing efforts to simplify Rolls-Royce's operations in a bid to boost returns, Rolls-Royce said. Rolls-Royce has been struggling with weak demand for some of its aircraft engines. The prolonged slump in oil prices also has damped sales of its marine and power-systems units. The London-based company this year announced the first cut in its dividend since 1992 to deal with falling earnings. Last year, it appointed Mr. East as its CEO. He has since been pushing the company to more quickly revamp its operations to recover from a series of earnings missteps. The company has cut thousands of jobs, including thinning out management ranks to become more responsive to volatile market conditions. Mr. East said the new chief operating officer, who won't be a board member, would play a "critical role" as Rolls-Royce boost aircraft engine output, grow the nuclear power unit, and implement efforts to cut costs at the company. Rolls-Royce in July said it made an underlying profit of only GBP77 million ($102 million) in the first six months of the year. The company suffered a GBP1.8 billion loss in the period after a mark-to-market noncash revaluation of U.S. currency hedges in the wake of the sharp fall in sterling after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Rolls-Royce also has seen U.S. activist investor ValueAct Capital Management LP become its largest shareholder with a stake of more than 10%. In March, Rolls-Royce appointed Bradley Singer, ValueAct's chief operating officer, to the board. Rolls-Royce chairman Ian Davis in May told shareholders the path to financial recovery would take time. The company expects a decline in sales and profit this year.

(AP Photo/Seth Perlman,File) How Obama has tilted the workplace for unions By Sean Higgins (@seanghiggins) • 9/12/16 12:01 AM Sean Higgins Senior Writer The Washington Examiner http://s3.amazonaws.com/content.washingtonexaminer.biz/images/static/authors/HeadshotHiggins_Sean.jpg Share Tweet Mail Print SMS More President Obama has been arguably the most pro-labor chief executive since Harry Truman. He has appointed staunch labor allies to the federal agencies that watch unions, and he has tilted the regulatory field in organized labor's favor through reintepreting old rules and implementing new ones. "I am proud and humbled to be your humble servant as labor secretary," Obama's first labor secretary, Hilda Solis, told the AFL-CIO labor federation at its 2009 convention in Pittsburgh. As far as labor leaders are concerned, Solis and her successor, Tom Perez, have delivered. "President Obama has been a good president for working people," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said at a Sept. 1 Christian Science Monitor breakfast. Since his days as a community organizer in Chicago, Obama has had close relations with labor unions, and organizations such as the Service Employees International Union were among his earliest and most vocal supporters when he ran for the White House in 2008.

Steve Bernstein, a management-side lawyer with the firm Fisher & Phillips, said Obama's approach has made a noticeable difference: Unions are emboldened and taking more cases to court rather than settling. "Legal precedents that stood for decades vanished overnight. It is increasingly difficult to advise clients," he said. Vincent Vernuccio, a labor policy analyst for the Michigan-based conservative nonprofit Mackinac Center, called the Obama administration "the most blatantly partisan" presidency toward unions in history. But he argued that unions may come to regret the administration's approach since it relied almost entirely on regulation rather than Congress. The next president will have the same expanded executive powers. "What should be worrying to unions is that federal agencies tend to swing like pendulums. A future president could send it in the opposite direction," he noted. Obama's first-term Labor Dept.: Slow start with Congress leads to regs Also from the Washington Examiner Heritage ready to wage Obamacare repeal battle again Heritage Action is insisting Republicans try to knock down all of the healthcare law. By Paige Winfield Cunningham • 11/10/16 5:57 PM The Obama administration did not start off well for unions as it failed to deliver on the issue that topped labor's wish list: "card check." The term refers to a proposal to change the rules for union workplace elections, eliminating the right of employers to call for a federally monitored secret ballot vote when a union claims to have the majority support of the workers. A union's claim of majority is typically shown through cards signed by the workers — hence, the term "card check." There is no mechanism to prevent the numerous cases of fraud and coercion in obtaining the signatures that have been found by federal regulators. The secret ballot vote verifies the union's claim. Unions win those votes about 68 percent of the time, according to federal data. Labor leaders instead wanted the government to grant union recognition immediately based on the signed cards. Labor's congressional allies gave the legislation the name "the Employee Free Choice Act." The legislation proved too radical, and despite an aggressive push during Obama's first term, Congress never took it up, even when the Democrats had the majority. Also from the Washington Examiner Sanders backs Minnesota congressman in looming fight for DNC chair Donna Brazile's interim term as DNC chair will end in March 2017. By Sarah Westwood • 11/10/16 5:41 PM After that, the administration decided to work exclusively through executive branch rulemaking, bypassing Congress entirely. Solis' gift to unions was to roll back transparency regulations put in place by the Bush administration to uncover fraud and embezzlement by union officials. The Obama administration said at the time that the rollback "promotes transparency" even though it drastically reduced the amount of disclosure required by unions. The Federal Register announcement for the change stated the rollback's purpose was "to avoid overburdening unions and their officials with unnecessary reporting requirements." The Bush rules prevented some serious corruption: Labor Department investigations recovered $93 million of stolen dues on behalf of union members during the previous administration. After rolling the rules back, the Obama administration stopped publishing the amount of money recovered from corruption investigations. Labor Dept. under Tom Perez: 'Props' from unions Current Labor Secretary Tom Perez has been more pro-union, with the department issuing several new rules under his watch. "We have to give him his props and the department its props," said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, during a Sept. 1 Labor Day webcast that had Perez as its guest. The department vastly expanded the number of workers who are eligible for overtime pay. It rewrote an old rule that allowed employers to exempt certain workers from receiving time and a half provided that the worker made at least $23,000 annually. The new rule put the cutoff at $47,000, expanding coverage to an estimated 4.2 million more workers. The department also has issued new rules regarding lawyers who advise employers on labor law. Previously, lawyers were required to financially disclose their work if they interacted with employees. That was known as the "persuader rule," since the lawyers typically made the case to employees against unionizing. Under new rules issued this year, lawyers must disclose the arrangements even if they never meet with employees and only advise management. The rule is expected to cause many smaller law firms to stop providing the advice. Obama also issued an executive order in 2014 requiring federal contractors to pay a minimum wage of at least $10.10, mostly a symbolic gesture since existing pay rules on federal contracting already put most contractors' wages well above that. More significantly, the Labor Department issued a rule this summer requiring all contractors bidding for projects of $500,000 or more to disclose any violations within the last three years of 14 federal labor and safety laws, as well as violations of any equivalent state laws. In effect, any contractor that has had a run-in with a union or federal agency gets put on a blacklist, even if they are still fighting any complaints in court. The department also has fostered labor's efforts to build support in immigrant communities. It has signed formal agreements with the embassies of Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Peru and the Philippines to teach immigrants from those nations about U.S. labor rights both before and after they arrive. The agreements make no distinction between legal and illegal immigrants. The National Labor Relations Board: Rewriting the rules Equally aggressive has been the National Labor Relations Board, the main federal labor law enforcement agency. In an unprecedented move, the board in 2011 charged airplane manufacturer Boeing with illegal retaliation against the union that represented its Washington state workers because it was opening a new factory in South Carolina, even though none of the West Coast workers were fired, laid off or otherwise harmed. The board said that expanding to a different state — South Carolina is right-to-work — was proof that the company was retaliating. Business groups were alarmed. The controversy fizzled out when Boeing settled with the union in late 2011, prompting the labor board to withdraw the complaint. When Obama took office, the five-member board had often lacked a working quorum. During the last year of President George W. Bush's administration, it had only two members because Senate Democrats refused to allow any votes on nominees to fill the vacancies. Appointing a full five-member pro-union board was a top priority for labor leaders. Obama used recess appointments to install three members in January 2012. Those included Richard Griffin, a former top lawyer with the International Union of Operating Engineers, and Sharon Block, a former Ted Kennedy staffer. The president didn't give the Senate an opportunity to hold hearings on his nominees, although Democrats had majority control at the time. The Supreme Court declared the appointments unconstitutional in the 2014 case National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning, retroactively voiding a year's worth of work by the board. After aggressive lobbying by the White House, the Senate agreed to vote on a slate of different nominees and approved Griffin as the board's general counsel. Republican lawmakers apparently thought that was a demotion for Griffin, but it gave him more authority. While the board has final say, the general counsel effectively runs the board and directs its investigations. Under Obama and particularly under Griffin, the labor board has become one of the most controversial federal agencies, with business groups and congressional Republicans calling for it to be reined in. Its potentially most far-reaching change came in 2014, when the board charged McDonald's Corp. as a "joint employer" in a series of unfair-labor-practice complaints against its franchised restaurants by a union branch, even though the franchises were mostly privately owned, and therefore legally separate, businesses. The labor board since then has charged several other businesses under the expanded joint employer definition. Previously, a joint employer charge could be brought only if a company had "direct control" over another company's workers. The new definition uses a vaguer "indirect control" standard that is a vast expansion of legal liability for corporations, which now could find themselves on the hook for fines incurred by any other business they have a connection to. The rule is a boon to unions, allowing them to focus organizing campaigns on the corporate parent rather than having to unionize each franchise individually. The labor board also has expanded the definition of "worker." Perhaps its most famous action under Obama came in 2014, when the director of its Chicago regional office said Northwestern University football players could form a union. The board overturned the decision on the grounds that it did not have jurisdiction. However, two years later, the board declared that teachers' assistants were eligible to form unions, which could send labor costs — and tuition — higher. Traditionally, organizing a workplace required unions to have the support of a majority of all workers. The board reversed that policy in 2011, allowing for the existence of so-called "micro-unions," small subsets of a workplace's employees such as those in the cosmetics section of a Macy's. The reversal made it easier for unions to gain a foothold in companies where they didn't have full worker support. The board also has worked to make unionizing easier. In 2014, it adopted what has become known as the "speedy election" rule, requiring most workplace unionization votes to be held about two weeks after the board authorizes them, a process that previously could take months. Labor leaders had long called for a change, complaining that the old standard gave employers too much time to make the case against forming a union. The new rule gives employers a week after a vote is authorized to raise any concerns, such as whether certain employees should be eligible to vote. If the employers miss the deadline, they forfeit the right to raise objections. The rule also limits the evidence employers may use in their objections and allows the board's regional directors to defer ruling on them until after the vote. That renders many of management's objections moot because the company is unionized by the time the board investigates them. The change has helped unions to win more elections, though the effect has been marginal. The speedy election rule has another notable provision: It requires employers to turn over all employee contact information to any union seeking to represent their workers, including private phone numbers and email addresses, whether workers agree or not. When a union lost a 2015 vote to represent a group of Connecticut hospital workers, the labor board ordered a re-vote because the hospital gave the union only 94 percent of the workers' phone numbers. The hospital said it didn't have up-to-date information for the rest. Like the Labor Department, the board has fostered unions' efforts to build support in immigrant communities. The board has signed formal agreements with the embassies of Mexico, Ecuador and the Philippines to teach immigrants from those nations about U.S. labor rights before and after they arrive. Last year, Griffin expanded on those agreements by announcing a new policy in which the labor board will help to facilitate temporary visas for illegal immigrants to testify in labor rights violations cases against their employers. The board was attempting to resolve, in its favor, a longstanding catch-22: The board and other agencies interpret federal worker protection laws to extend to all employees regardless of immigration status, but federal immigration law says employers must fire people who are not legally eligible to work in the U.S. Now employers who try to comply with the law by firing an illegal immigrant worker can find themselves facing charges from the labor board. The Justice Department even released a video in late August advising employers not to terminate immigrants after their employment authorization expires, warning that it was potentially a form of discrimination. No matter has been too small for the labor board. Last year it instituted new rules for writing employee manuals, expanding what counts as violations of workers' rights. The labor board decided, for example, that a company rule prohibiting "false or misleading representations about your credentials or your work" is illegal. The labor board hasn't won every battle. In 2011, it instituted a new rule requiring employers to prominently display a poster explaining union rights. The rule was struck down in court in 2013, and the board hasn't tried to revive it.

But the University of Missouri-St. Louis’ annual Study Abroad Fair on August 31 gave students a closely-packed, but culturally diverse, sampling of the study abroad opportunities available for UMSL students. From 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., students, faculty, and program directors had tables in the second floor rotunda of the Millennium Student Center, inviting curious students to explore just a few of UMSL’s study abroad options. Some of the tables at the Study Abroad Fair were people from non-UMSL umbrella companies that partner with many institutions to help students find a host university and program that fits their majors. One such company was CISabroad, which sent two representatives to the fair to explain their services: Director of University Relations Operations Heidi Bohn and Regional Director Aaron Fauchet. Bohn said, “We have 22 locations around the world and we have multiple universities at each location…We’re providing the partnership with the university, we’re providing the site directors on the ground, we’re providing airport transportation and housing. We’re packaging it so a student can go and…earn credits or intern abroad and come back with that international experience that they can then apply towards the future.” Fauchet added, “We also make it easier for students to really navigate the process of enrolling at a foreign institution. So there’s the consideration of maybe needing a visa to stay there and figuring out how to sign up for classes at a foreign institution. We have the inside knowledge for navigating that system.” Fauchet and Bohn talked about their own great experiences abroad—Bohn in an internship program in Ecuador and Fauchet in a study abroad program in France—and said that their travels made them want to, in Bohn’s words, “help students start their own journeys.” Two of the people that seemed most excited to tell students about their study abroad program were Nicole Shores, graduate, international business and Matthew Coker, graduate, information systems. Shores and Coker went on UMSL’s first trip abroad to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the last winter intersession. Both Shores and Coker were impressed with the program and its opportunities for business majors. Coker said, “I like all of the networking opportunities we had. We got to go visit a bunch of international companies to meet with some executives…Most of the ones we visited were St. Louis-based companies.” These executives, who came from such well-known companies as Boeing and Emerson, gave presentations to the students about their companies, and the students got the chance to ask about how to navigate the regulations of doing business and starting companies overseas. As Shores explained, this is particularly relevant in the UAE. “With the UAE they have free trade zones set up where you can start a business a little bit easier than you would have to within the country…They have laws where if you do set up business and it’s not in a free trade zone, you actually have to partner with an Emirati that lives there,” Shores said. The students were also able to learn about how to deal with the cultural differences of living in a place like the UAE, where only 20 percent of the people are natives and the rest are expatriates, immigrants, and tourists. In addition to learning some tips about international business, Coker and Shores got to experience some examples of the luxuriance and decadence of the UAE. They were treated to camel rides, belly dancers, a safari, and even an unexpected opportunity to meet Liam Neeson when he came to UAE for the premiere of “Taken 3.” And the companies they talked with pulled out all the stops to make them feel like royalty, even going so far as to pick students up for meetings in brand-new Lexuses and Mercedes. Shores said, “It’s definitely worth it. The country and the Emirates that we visited, they’re just as magnificent as they show on TV.” While most of the tables were UMSL students and faculty that were pitching their study abroad programs, a student at one of the tables spoke from a slightly different perspective. Justine Pieau, senior, business, is a new exchange student from France who was working at the French table. She said that so far her experience in St. Louis has been drastically different from her life in France. “This is a really huge place compared to France,” Pieau said. “In my school there is just one building, and here this is a really big campus. In my school maybe there are around 2,000, and here there are maybe 15,000 or 17,000.” Pieau is here at UMSL to complete her required semester of study or internship abroad as part of a five-year business program. She was drawn to UMSL because of its convenient location relative to the city and because of its top-rated business school. She also encouraged curious students to apply to be an exchange student, as the process is not overly complicated. “I think this is quite easy to do, just to complete some admissions papers [and] make contact with the department of languages.” She hopes to use the experience she gets from UMSL to work in accounting. Pieau said, “I would like to work in a big four, like auditing and that, and maybe create my own company, but we will see.” According to Study Abroad Coordinator Nate Daugherty, UMSL has over 100 study abroad options in 45 countries. Of these, about 20 are short-term programs, meaning that they are two to four-week programs in the summer or the winter intersession. The rest are long-term programs, which can be for a semester or an academic year. Daugherty said, “We send about 200 students abroad every year, but that keeps going up and we hope that it keeps going up. I actually have a goal of 250 by 2019, so we’re getting there.” He also advised students that studying abroad is not as expensive as people might think. “I’d like to make sure students know…that financial aid and scholarships are available for study abroad because most of our programs are actually earning UMSL credits and paying UMSL tuition rates, so you can use your UMSL financial aid typically [and] scholarships, too,” said Daugherty. Daugherty also said that there are a few new programs, including a political science course in Ghana, a criminology and criminal justice course in the Netherlands, and an art history and studio art course in India. The deadline to apply for most programs in winter and spring is September 23, and the deadline for most summer and fall programs is February 23.

"When you see the volatility, keep in mind that not all of it is based on the Fed. A lot of it's the election, the lack of common ground, and the fact that the polling has gotten tighter, all of which could make for a treacherous couple of months until we get to Nov. 8," the "Mad Money" host said. This was the revelation from Cramer after he attended a panel hosted by E Trade and TheStreet.com. He was taken aback by the lack of common ground discussed between the two candidates. Cramer broke down how he views each candidate's potential impact on the market if elected. John Sommers II | Reuters; Getty Images Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton The first pure uncertainty that could arise if Trump were to be elected is a potential for a trade war with China. "A Trump presidency means he is very hard to game, except that you should sell anything related to commodities if you believe Trump is going to win, because he seems eager to start a trade war with China," Cramer said. Investors may forget how much commerce the U.S. does with China, he added, especially the consumer packaged goods, technology and capital equipment needed to mine and build roads that are sold to China. That could impact Apple, Caterpillar and PepsiCo, among others. Cramer also thinks the railroads could be impacted, as much of U.S. coal goes to China. That business has been part of the major rebound for the group. Airlines and aircraft builders could also be crushed, including Boeing and United Technologies. "So many of our industrials would be impacted by this trade war," Cramer said. If Clinton wins the election, Cramer has concerns over the heath care sector. It was clear to him that Clinton intends to take her cue from Mylan, Teva and Valeant, and do everything she can to prevent drug companies from raising prices. The scrutiny could even extend beyond these companies to ones involved in research and development, too. Additionally, if Clinton was to win in a landslide and the Democrats take both houses of Congress, Cramer also expects Senator Elizabeth Warren to have a significant amount of influence. "Even though Hillary has taken a huge amount of money from Wall Street, you can only imagine what kind of damage a newly empowered Elizabeth Warren could do to the financial sector," Cramer said. However, as long as the Republicans keep the house, Cramer anticipates that a divided government under Clinton will look a lot like the divided government under President Obama. "You can't necessarily hide in the domestic companies because, let's face it, the nationwide minimum wage would go up with Hillary, and that means higher labor costs for the retailers and restaurants," Cramer said. The only real common ground that Cramer could find between the candidates is that more money will be spent on defense, and those stocks have all been elevated in pricing already. "Suffice it to say, unless you get a clear winner going into November, the uncertainty would be incredible and … uncertainty is the one thing we know above all, investors hate," Cramer said.

The Manchester-headquartered company, which broke ground on the construction of a new £1.3m manufacturing facility, said it is seeing the benefits of the vote to leave the EU. Managing director Tony Bermingham said business has had ‘excellent’ growth since the referendum and the main challenge now was managing this growth and maximising opportunities worldwide. He said: “The vote to leave the EU has had a positive effect on EDM. Due to the devaluation of sterling against the dollar it has made EDM’s products 12 per cent cheaper and therefore more attractive to overseas customers. “Similarly as our main competitors are German, the reduction of the pound against the Euro has made EDM more competitive.” Read More EDM invests £1.3m to expand 100,000 sq ft manufacturing facility He continues: “As 90 per cent of EDM’s business is export outside of the UK and the EU there was no slow down in orders. EDM has grown at a rate of 20 per cent year on year for the past three years and this is forecast to continue.” EDM works with many of the world’s leading airlines to provide training equipment and support for modern Crew Resource Management. To date, EDM is one of the only companies worldwide licenced by Boeing for B787 cabin crew training equipment. EDM reported revenues of £14.7m for 2015, and this is set to grow to £22m for 2016. It has recently invested in a new 18,000 sq ft manufacturing facility, which will house up to 40 employees across a range of disciplines and provide all the resources needed to enable the company to manufacture its full range of market-leading training simulators. Being built on land adjacent to EDM’s existing 100,000 sq ft facility, the new facility is expected to complete in March 2017. Sir Richard was invited to officially start the construction work on the new facility in a turf-cutting ceremony at the company’s headquarters in Newton Heath. EDM’s new 18,000 sq ft facility will be built on land adjacent to its current headquarters in Newton Heath, Manchester Read More M.E.N Business of the Year finalists revealed Sir Richard said: “Manchester has an ever growing number of cutting edge businesses demonstrating world-class innovation. The Council congratulates EDM on their success story and welcomes the jobs and expertise created.” Tony said the business continues to enter new markets and on the back of the growing aviation industry, there are future opportunities in South America, India, the ASEAN region, Middle East and Africa. As a result, there will be further investment in the business. He added: “EDM is currently in the process of investing around £2.5m on increased factory space, plant and machinery. The number of employees has doubled in the last 3 years and the company will move from being an SME to a large business in 2017/18.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @MENBusinessDesk Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On European Union Brexit Newton Newton Heath Manchester Economy business all Most Read Most Recent Manchester DevelopmentA Victorian inspired ‘secret street’ and roof terraces are coming to Ancoats - and a derelict pub is saved The people behind this project say they are keeping 'the original industrial features... fused with contemporary urban design' The ApprenticeThe Apprentice: Five Greater Manchester candidates who made it in business despite not winning The business survival of the fittest can only have one winner, but what are the others up to now?

(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) NEW YORK (AP) - A Delta Air Lines jet skidded off a snowy runway at LaGuardia Airport last year because the pilot used too much reverse thrust and lost control of the plane’s direction, federal investigators said Tuesday. There were no serious injuries aboard the airliner arriving from Atlanta on March 5, 2015, but National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Christopher Hart said it was “a very close call.” The report found that the captain and first officer were unprepared for the amount of snow that was on the runway because the information that had been provided to them was not current. The Boeing MD-88 veered left, hit a fence with its left wing and came to rest with its nose leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy Flushing Bay. The investigators said the captain overused the reverse thrust to brake, rendering the rudder useless. The NTSB also faulted the cabin and flight crew for failing to promptly evacuate the 127 passengers from the plane, which began leaking fuel after the wing hit the fence. It took 12 minutes before the first passengers stepped off the aircraft. The captain “did not convey a sense of urgency to evacuate the cabin,” the report said. That was compounded by the lead flight attendant’s telling passengers that they had time to take their coats out of the overhead compartments.

Shares closed 4.2 percent higher on Tuesday, erasing some of Monday's US$14 billion loss in market value. The Federal Aviation Administration's alert came in response to a small number of incident reports of the Galaxy Note7's lithium ion batteries catching fire, either in transit or while charging on board planes. Samsung previously had issued a voluntary recall of the devices due to some of their batteries overheating. Under the U.S. Product Exchange Program Samsung announced earlier this month, Galaxy Note7 owners can exchange their devices for a new Galaxy Note7, or for a Galaxy S7 or GalaxyS7 edge, with price differences refunded. When it issued the recall, Samsung said only a small number of isolated cases had been reported, and that the company had identified them and stopped sales and shipments. "Samsung continues to ensure that consumer safety remains our top priority," said Tim Baxter, president of Samsung Electronics of America. Aircraft Risk The FAA late last week issued its warning that passengers should not turn on or charge Galaxy Note7 phones on board aircraft or store them in checked luggage. Samsung over the weekend issued an update urging customers to stop using their Galaxy Note7s and exchange them immediately. Customers would receive new Galaxy Note7 devices, pending approval from the Consumer Product Safety Commission, along with accessory exchanges and $25 gift cards, the company said. The CPSC is working "as hard as we can" to issue a formal recall announcement in cooperation with Samsung, commission spokesperson Scott Wolfson told the E-Commerce Times. Amperex Technology reportedly will become the new supplier of Galaxy Note7 batteries. The FAA's warning centers on three issues that not directly related to the Samsung announcement, a U.S. government official who asked not to be identified told the E-Commerce Times. The first issue involves storing lithium ion batteries in aircraft cargo holds. Testing at the FAA's New Jersey facility indicated there were issues with suppressing fire in cargo holds, the official said. There also are concerns about bringing lithium ion batteries on board planes in carry-on bags. However, that presents less of a risk, as flight attendants could use extinguishers or oven mitts in the event of a battery fire. The third issue involves batteries installed in planes. A fire risk from batteries used to power Boeing aircraft was discovered back in 2012, but that problem has been solved. Hot Batteries Lithium-ion batteries have been under scrutiny for years, as overheating and fires have forced recalls in various mobile phones and laptops for more than a decade. Modern mobile devices demand batteries that are thinner and lighter, yet maintain enormous energy to charge faster, remain charged for hours longer, and run more powerful applications, explained Gartner Vice President Martin Reynolds. "This is an enormous amount of energy in a small package," he told the E-Commerce Times. Samsung has the overall lead in worldwide smartphone market share, accounting for 76.7 million shipments, or 22.3 percent of the market, at the end of the second quarter. That compares to 44.4 million shipments, or 12.9 percent for Apple, according to data from Gartner. It's still too early to determine whether the Galaxy Note7 battery crisis will have a major impact on market share for Samsung, said Tuong Nguyen, a principal analyst at Gartner, but it may be difficult for diehard Android users in mature markets to shift to Apple's iOS. "In places like the U.S., I think people have chosen their sides," he told the E-Commerce Times. The rolling disclosures about the Galaxy Note7's lithium-ion battery troubles are taking a toll on Samsung's reputation, said Jeff Kagan, an independent telecom analyst. "The battery issue is causing significant damage to the Samsung brand," he told the E-Commerce Times. "The only question is how much damage will occur."

Paramount’s latest armoured vehicle, the Mbombe 8, an 8x8 wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, will be unveiled for the first time on African soil during the show. Ivor Ichikowitz, the founder and executive chairman of Paramount Group, said: “Paramount’s success is remarkable because it’s an African story. In ten short years we have grown out of South Africa and into a global technology and manufacturing powerhouse. Our world-class platforms contribute to the stability of communities, the fight against terrorism and the protection of natural resources in more than 30 countries around the world.

Many technologies that are developed in the defence and aerospace sectors are beneficial to other industries and the general public. It is an industry that is characterised by highly skilled people and presents exciting career opportunities. We are proud to support the show and showcase Africa’s innovations that are admired globally,” Ichikowitz added.

Sep 8, 2016 Comments Dear President Obama, There is much commentary these days about your legacy and your continued strivings to further extend your administration’s reach in the remaining months of your second term of office. Your recent expansion of public land reserves and the large expansion of our country’s ocean sanctuaries in the regions surrounding Hawaii and Guam are described as part of your environmental legacy. I write once again to invite you to meet with the Washington-based, full-time nonprofit civic action and service community. On several occasions during your presidency, I have recommended that you speak to a thousand or more leaders of the national civic community in a downtown D.C. hotel ballroom or auditorium such as historic Constitution Hall. Nonprofit organizations have millions of dues-paying members throughout the country supporting the fundamental bulwarks and seed corns of our beleaguered democracy. They cover the important advocacy areas of peace, civil liberties and civil rights, antipoverty and health, consumer protection, environment, labor safety, access to justice, worker rights and many traditional secular and religious charities that minister to the needy. Yet there has been no response to these invitations except a reply by the office of Michelle Obama on July 17, 2011 saying the President was too busy. Of course, Presidents are very busy, but they find time, as you did to attend nearly 500 fundraisers around the country and to visit numerous factories and other corporate destinations. Even during a visit to India, you found time to extol Boeing Airplanes and Harley-Davidson Motorcycles. No President has explicitly reached out to the broad civic community since President-elect Jimmy Carter attended such a special mass convocation in Washington, D.C., late in 1976. He came to listen and to meet the constituency that he knew was crucial to enacting many of the substantive programs he was planning at the time. It was a grand, motivating success. Late in your second term, you could come to serve several other purposes. First, you can give necessary visibility to those committed people whose groups are left in the shadows during presidential election years despite their ability to enrich the content of such electoral activities with their exceptional hands-on knowledge and experience. Second, you can make recommendations regarding various facilities, checkoffs and new directions which can enlarge nonprofit membership and programs. Third, you can educate the public about the critical role this “voluntary sector” has played in American history. Fourth, you can herald the significant number of jobs and economic activity—millions of staff and tens of billions of dollars coursing through the economy—which can only expand with larger philanthropy by billionaires, mega-millionaires, and regular citizens you might inspire to contribute to nonprofit organizations. Your address can become a presidential marker for your successors and for future generations of Americans inspired by your concrete words and proposals. It is difficult to understand why you have not yet embraced this opportunity. Certainly you have mentioned civic duty, civic engagement and civic visions for posterity on a number of occasions. Especially now when all elections are behind you, isn’t it time to highlight the civic values and the civic heroes who reflect them in ways both dutiful and dramatic? Lastly, such a presentation will set a finer, higher stage for your successor to inherit. What say you, President Obama? Ralph Nader P.S.

There were no serious injuries aboard the airliner arriving from Atlanta on March 5, 2015, but the National Transportation Safety Board chairman Christopher Hart said it was "a very close call." The report found that the captain and first officer were unprepared for the amount of snow that was on the LaGuardia runway because the information that had been provided to them was not current. The Boeing MD-88 veered left, hit a fence with its left wing and came to rest with its nose on leaning perilously on a berm that separates the runway from icy Flushing Bay. The investigators said the captain initiated reverse thrust — one of several braking mechanisms on the aircraft — before the plane's nose wheel hit the runway, which was not proper procedure, according to Delta or Boeing. The report found that overuse of reverse thrust on a slippery surface rendered the rudder useless. The investigators said the first officer told the captain to come out of reverse three times before he finally did, but by then it was too late. The NTSB also faulted the cabin and flight crew for failing to promptly evacuate the 127 passengers from the plane, which began leaking fuel after the wing hit the fence. Investigator Emily Gibson said it took 12 minutes before the first passengers stepped off the aircraft and 17 minutes before all passengers had been evacuated. Reasons for the delay included a lack of decisiveness on the part of the captain, who "did not convey a sense of urgency to evacuate the cabin," she said. She said the captain's inaction was compounded by the lead flight attendant's decision to tell passengers they had time to take their coats out of the overhead compartments. Investigators also said the accident disabled the plane's public address and intercom systems, and the crew's training had not addressed handling an emergency landing with no working PA system. Gibson said it was initially not clear to first responders whether there were 125 or 127 passengers on the plane. The crew provided the lower number, which didn't include two lap infants. The transportation board, meeting in Washington, D.C., voted 4-0 to accept the report and recommend policy changes to reduce the likelihood of a similar incident. Atlanta-based Delta said Tuesday in a statement that its top priority "is always the safety of our customers and employees." "We cooperated with the National Transportation Safety Board during the course of the investigation and we respect their findings, conclusions and recommendations," the airline said. "Delta leaders will use this NTSB guidance to further enhance the safety of our global operation." ___ This story has been corrected to show the plane's model is MD-88, not MC-88.

It was the latest in a string of lithium-ion battery fires on products ranging from laptops to hoverboards to airliners -- and a reminder that pushing the technology envelope can sometimes be problematic. Here are some things to know about the recall and why batteries can be a fire hazard. How do these batteries work and why do they catch fire? A lithium-ion battery is a kind of rechargeable battery that uses different materials, one holding positive ions -- the cathode -- and the other holding negative ions -- the anode. These ions move one way when charging, and back again when discharging -- being used. These two layers -- or conductors -- are never supposed to touch, so manufacturers insert separators to keep them apart. Unfortunately, the chemical reaction that makes batteries work also creates heat. Overcharging the packs -- or charging them too fast -- can lead to fires. What is the issue with Samsung's batteries? We don't know exactly, but Samsung has given some clues. It said parts of the battery that should never touch came together due to a "very rare manufacturing process error". Samsung finds a hack to fix Galaxy Note 7 'exploding issues' Samsung plans to issue a software update for its recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones that will prevent them from overheating by limiting battery recharges to under 60%. Gadget makers weigh all sorts of factors like performance, cost and safety when rolling out their next-generation technology. And the race to push more battery life into their latest phone or tablet can lead to unexpected results. "Smartphone makers are trying to squeeze these batteries into a small, thin package," said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. "Since batteries generate energy through a chemical reaction, it's really hard to reduce the risk (of fire) to zero. "Sometimes convenience comes with a price." Has this happened before? Yes. Battery fires have been reported in products including Sony Vaio laptops, last-year's must-have toy the hoverboard, electric bikes and even Boeing's Dreamliner jet. In Samsung's case, faulty batteries caused some handsets to burst into flames during charging. Cases of exploding batteries continued to emerge following the recall announcement, as users claimed a burning device had damaged a hotel room in Australia or set a car on fire in the US. How extensive is the problem? Not very. Millions of lithium-ion batteries are produced annually with a tiny fraction of those catching fire or exploding. Samsung Galaxy Note 7 may go down as worst-phone ever: Analyst Investors had wiped 15.9 trillion won ($14.3 billion) off Samsung's market capitalization as of 0303 GMT, as a series of warnings from regulators and airlines around the world raised fears for the future of the flagship device. At the start of this month, Samsung had received reports of about 35 incidents involving the phone's batteries. "It's not easy to know if Samsung's problem is the same as others...at this point," Yasuda said. "If its battery suppliers sell these same ones to other producers,it could possibly affect them too." What does this mean for Samsung and other gadget makers that use these batteries? It will damage Samsung's reputation and likely hurt profits at a time when it is feeling the squeeze from Apple's iPhone and Chinese rivals in the lower-end category. The mobile business accounts for a major share of Samsung's profits. It will also put pressure on gadget makers to figure out how to make battery packs safe for ever-smaller devices. "We always want batteries to be safe but also to be more efficient," said Guy Marlair, a France-based safety expert. "The more that we boost the battery's performance, the higher the energy density in a small space and the tougher it is to manage security."

For instance, OMAX has developed a new software Intelli-CAM that helps to generate 2D and 3D paths of the tools. This helps to create the tool path and attributes of 3D cutting before it is fed to the waterjet cutting machine Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52735 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Based on end-user, the report categorizes the global waterjet cutting machine market into the following segments: Automotive Aerospace Metal fabrication shops Woodwork Others Global waterjet cutting machine market by end-user 2015 (%) Automotive 28.18% Aerospace 24.90% Metal fabrication shops 16.38% Woodwork 11.23% Others 19.31% Source: Technavio The top three revenue generating end-user segments for the global waterjet cutting machine market are discussed below: Global waterjet cutting machine by automotive sector "The automotive sector has been responsible for many of the innovations in waterjet cutting machine technology, especially in high-power waterjet applications. One of the reasons is the very stringent norms with regard to the quality and reliability of the final product in the automotive sector," says Gaurav. Waterjet cutting machines are used in cutting, drilling, and surface cleaning of the metal sheets that are used in the fabrication of automotive parts. Till now, the automotive industry has enjoyed relative stability in the post-recession period, which is reflected in the strong growth and profitability of the sector; the annual sales figures have even reached the pre-recession levels in some regions. But some uncertainty still persists regarding the future, mainly due to the uneven nature of the global market. Global waterjet cutting machine by aerospace sector The plunge in crude oil prices was a boon to the aviation sector. Passenger traffic increased while capacity additions saw a parallel increase in 2014. Low crude oil prices and other enhanced efficiency measures resulted in airline companies making a net profit of USD 20 billion in 2014. The aircraft manufacturing sector also profited from the high performance, with the number of jets ordered in 2015 reaching 3,680. It is expected that about 1,420 commercial aircraft will be manufactured in 2016, a growth of about 40% from 2011. The increased demand is expected to boost the aircraft manufacturing sector, and production is expected to increase to about 1,617 aircraft in 2020, a growth of 15.7% when compared with 2015. Airbus and Boeing are the key players in the market, which have received the highest number of orders. Global waterjet cutting machine by metal fabrication shops Metal fabrication is the method of creating metal structures by cutting, bending, and assembling. Metal fabrication is a value-added process that encompasses the construction of machines and structures from various raw materials. Large fabrication shops employ a multitude of value-added processes in one facility, including welding, cutting, forming, and machining. The overall metal fabrication industry is expected to grow from almost USD 68.76 billion to USD 94.52 billion during the forecast period, growing at a CAGR of 6.57%. The metal fabrication shops play a major role in every manufacturing segment. In the major developed countries, industries like automobile and heavy machinery manufacturers outsource their metal processing and part manufacturing work to separate players, which are classified under the metal fabrication sector.

The report presents the vendor landscape with an analysis of the significance of new innovations in the current market and how it might prove to be the game-changer in the future. Competitive vendor landscape The global solvent recycling market is a very fragmented market with numerous vendors operating at the multiple layers. This fragmentation is evident in the different supply chains of the overall system. There are two distinct layers to the current global solvent recycling market. The first layer consists of vendors that cater to the residential and small-scale commercial establishments, where the market is far more fragmented than its other counterpart. The supply chain model that is implemented in this segment generally pertains to the recycling of solvents at a facility that is off-site. Therefore, this particular model involves the costs of used solvent handling and transportation to the recycling facility and also the costs of transporting the cleaned solvents to the end users. The other segment consists of vendors that cater to the large-scale commercial and the industrial solvent users. The model of operation in this particular space is generally related to the onsite recycling facility. Due to huge batches of solvents involved in one particular operation, it is generally more feasible to set up a recycling facility at the site of solvent consumption. The vendors that operate in this space are generally large chemical companies that produce solvents in the first place, or specific vendors such as Veolia. Sayani Roy, a lead analyst at Technavio for research on water and waste management, says, “The market segment catering to residential and small-scale commercial consumers of solvents, which is also the first layer, is expected to see majority of the growth that is anticipated in the broader global solvent recycling market. A large factor in this expected growth is related to the introduction of environmental laws by different governments.” Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=52573 Technavio’s sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more.

Scott Gamm Sep 13, 2016 10:02 AM EDT U.S. stocks slipped in early trading Tuesday, after Monday's rally, as worries over a near-term rate hike continued to spook investors. Crude prices slipped 1.7 percent to $45.50 a barrel as the International Energy Agency downgraded its 2016 forecast for oil demand, which is expected to increase by 1.3 million barrels a day this year, compared to its previous forecast of 1.2 million. The agency said demand in China and India is 'wobbling.' Wells Fargo (WFC) is doing away with sales goals for its retail products, after the company paid a fine to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for opening fake bank accounts. Boeing (BA) shares were in focus after it raised its outlook for China, saying it expects to sell 6,810 jets in the region over the next two decades, a 7.6 percent increase from its forecast last year. TheStreet's Scott Gamm reports from Wall Street.

File photo Image by: REUTERS/KIM HONG-JI Samsung is warning consumers to stop using its flagship Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after a spate of battery explosions. Save & Share Tweet Email Print Samsung Video posted to YouTube by JerryRigEverything. It was the latest in a string of lithium-ion battery fires on products ranging from laptops to hoverboards to airliners -- and a reminder that pushing the technology envelope can sometimes be problematic. Samsung to suspend Galaxy Note 7 sales after battery explosions  Here are some things to know about the recall and why batteries can be a fire hazard. A lithium-ion battery is a kind of rechargeable battery that uses different materials, one holding positive ions -- the cathode -- and the other holding negative ions -- the anode. These ions move one way when charging, and back again when discharging -- being used. These two layers -- or conductors -- are never supposed to touch, so manufacturers insert separators to keep them apart. Unfortunately, the chemical reaction that makes batteries work also creates heat. Overcharging the packs -- or charging them too fast -- can lead to fires. We don't know exactly, but Samsung has given some clues. It said parts of the battery that should never touch came together due to a "very rare manufacturing process error". Gadget makers weigh all sorts of factors like performance, cost and safety when rolling out their next-generation technology. And the race to push more battery life into their latest phone or tablet can lead to unexpected results. "Smartphone makers are trying to squeeze these batteries into a small, thin package," said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. "Since batteries generate energy through a chemical reaction, it's really hard to reduce the risk (of fire) to zero. "Sometimes convenience comes with a price." Yes. Battery fires have been reported in products including Sony Vaio laptops, last-year's must-have toy the hoverboard, electric bikes and even Boeing's Dreamliner jet. In Samsung's case, faulty batteries caused some handsets to burst into flames during charging. Cases of exploding batteries continued to emerge following the recall announcement, as users claimed a burning device had damaged a hotel room in Australia or set a car on fire in the US. Not very. Millions of lithium-ion batteries are produced annually with a tiny fraction of those catching fire or exploding. At the start of this month, Samsung had received reports of about 35 incidents involving the phone's batteries. "It's not easy to know if Samsung's problem is the same as others...at this point," Yasuda said. "If its battery suppliers sell these same ones to other producers,it could possibly affect them too." It will damage Samsung's reputation and likely hurt profits at a time when it is feeling the squeeze from Apple's iPhone and Chinese rivals in the lower-end category. The mobile business accounts for a major share of Samsung's profits. It will also put pressure on gadget makers to figure out how to make battery packs safe for ever-smaller devices. "We always want batteries to be safe but also to be more efficient," said Guy Marlair, a France-based safety expert. "The more that we boost the battery's performance, the higher the energy density in a small space and the tougher it is to manage security."

A lithium-ion battery is a kind of rechargeable battery that uses different materials, one holding positive ions -- the cathode -- and the other holding negative ions -- the anode. These ions move one way when charging, and back again when discharging -- being used. These two layers -- or conductors -- are never supposed to touch, so manufacturers insert separators to keep them apart. Unfortunately, the chemical reaction that makes batteries work also creates heat. Overcharging the packs -- or charging them too fast -- can lead to fires. WHAT IS THE ISSUE WITH SAMSUNG'S BATTERIES? We don't know exactly, but Samsung has given some clues. It said parts of the battery that should never touch came together due to a "very rare manufacturing process error". Gadget makers weigh all sorts of factors like performance, cost and safety when rolling out their next-generation technology. And the race to push more battery life into their latest phone or tablet can lead to unexpected results. "Smartphone makers are trying to squeeze these batteries into a small, thin package," said Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo. "Since batteries generate energy through a chemical reaction, it's really hard to reduce the risk (of fire) to zero. "Sometimes convenience comes with a price." HAS THIS HAPPENED BEFORE? Yes. Battery fires have been reported in products including Sony Vaio laptops, last-year's must-have toy the hoverboard, electric bikes and even Boeing's Dreamliner jet. In Samsung's case, faulty batteries caused some handsets to burst into flames during charging. Cases of exploding batteries continued to emerge following the recall announcement, as users claimed a burning device had damaged a hotel room in Australia or set a car on fire in the US. HOW EXTENSIVE IS THE PROBLEM? Not very. Millions of lithium-ion batteries are produced annually with a tiny fraction of those catching fire or exploding. At the start of this month, Samsung had received reports of about 35 incidents involving the phone's batteries. "It's not easy to know if Samsung's problem is the same as others...at this point," Yasuda said. "If its battery suppliers sell these same ones to other producers,it could possibly affect them too." WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR SAMSUNG AND OTHER GADGET MAKERS THAT USE THESE BATTERIES? It will damage Samsung's reputation and likely hurt profits at a time when it is feeling the squeeze from Apple's iPhone and Chinese rivals in the lower-end category. The mobile business accounts for a major share of Samsung's profits. It will also put pressure on gadget makers to figure out how to make battery packs safe for ever-smaller devices. "We always want batteries to be safe but also to be more efficient," said Guy Marlair, a France-based safety expert. "The more that we boost the battery's performance, the higher the energy density in a small space and the tougher it is to manage security."
