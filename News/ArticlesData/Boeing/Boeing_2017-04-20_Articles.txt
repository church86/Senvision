(April 20, 2017) – Aerojet Rocketdyne, Inc., a subsidiary of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AJRD), has successfully completed hot-fire qualification tests of an engine that demonstrates the ability to meet reusability requirements for Boeing’s Crew Space Transportation (CST)-100 Starliner crew module propulsion system. The tests were conducted on Aerojet Rocketdyne’s MR-104J hydrazine monopropellant engine in Redmond, Washington. For NASA service missions to the International Space Station, Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft will carry up to four astronauts and time-critical scientific research. “Our engineers have incorporated a unique design that will allow the MR-104 engine to be used on multiple missions, providing the reliability, cost-efficiency and reusability our customer needs to be competitive in the current commercial space environment,” said Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake. “We look forward to delivering the engines for the crew module and continuing our proud heritage of enabling astronauts to fly to the International Space Station from U.S. soil.” The Starliner crew module propulsion system will use 12 MR-104J engines for reaction control to orient the vehicle during re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere. Prior to re-entry, attitude control is provided by the Service Module Engines, also provided by Aerojet Rocketdyne. The MR-104J, designed by Aerojet Rocketdyne, was developed and tested under the company’s Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) subcontract to Boeing. Similar to other reaction control system engines, the MR-104J includes additional features to increase redundancy that meet critical requirements and improved strength to withstand multiple shocks at operating temperatures. The engine upgrades also provide reusability for Boeing as it certifies Starliner crew modules for multiple missions. Under the CCtCap subcontract to Boeing, Aerojet Rocketdyne will provide propulsion system hardware that includes Crew Module Reaction Control engines; Launch Abort Engines, Orbital Maneuvering and Attitude Control thrusters, and Service Module Reaction Control System thrusters. Boeing will assemble propulsion hardware into the Starliner spacecraft at its Commercial Crew and Cargo Processing Facility at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Aerojet Rocketdyne is an innovative company delivering solutions that create value for its customers in the aerospace and defense markets. The company is a world-recognized aerospace and defense leader that provides propulsion and energetics to the space, missile defense and strategic systems, tactical systems and armaments areas, in support of domestic and international markets.

Given budget impasses on Capitol Hill, his big spending plans have been met with a healthy dose of skepticism. But to better understand how America's armed forces could truly undergo a "great rebuilding" as costs come down, look no further than the U.S. Air Force's Advanced Pilot Training competition, known as the T-X Trainer. The T-X Trainer is one of the biggest defense contracts currently up for grabs. With a $16.3 billion stated program of record, the Air Force plans to purchase 350 next-generation jet trainers that would be used to teach new pilots to fly fighters including the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the F-22 Raptor, and of course, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Air Force wants those future planes operational by 2024. The contract is, for now, expected to be awarded at the end of this year. The plan to replace the rapidly aging fleet of existing trainers has been a long time coming: the currently used T-38 Talons, made by Northrop Grumman, have been in service since the early 1960s, and experts say they won't last past 2030. "I think the public would be surprised to find out that the average age for a trainer today, the T-38, is nearly 50 years old, and that the mission-capable rate is around 62 percent," says Howard Rubel, a managing director at Jefferies, covering defense stocks. For most high-performance aircraft, the goal is a mission-capable rate above 75 percent. Every time a plane is grounded, costs from maintenance and delays are stacking up. After a dramatic shift in offerings that involved both Raytheon and Northrop Grumman recently dropping out, the T-X Trainer competition comes down to three main teams: Lockheed Martin, partnered with Korea Aerospace Industries; Boeing, partnered with Saab; and Italian contractor Leonardo, partnered with its own U.S. subsidiary DRS Technologies. Lockheed's offering is the T-50A, an upgraded version of the T-50 Golden Eagle that South Korean pilots currently train in. Boeing has built a "clean sheet" trainer from the ground up directly to the Air Force's contract specifications, spending what analysts estimate is $1 billion to $3 billion of its own money on development. Source: Lockheed Martin Lockheed Martin, along with Korea Aerospace Industries is proposing the T-50A for the Air Force's T-X Trainer competition. Leonardo is proposing its T-100, a trainer already teaching F-35 pilots how to fly in Israel and Italy. Amid budget constraints and a big focus on the financials within the Pentagon, industry insiders say the close competition is quickly devolving into a bidding dogfight — a price shootout to the, in military jargon, "lowest price technically acceptable." Leonardo, which parted ways with Raytheon earlier this year, believes it has the lowest cost bid for the program. It promises to build a new factory that will create new jobs. Boeing says its trainer went from concept to flight in 36 months, with a supply chain ready to go and that new design enabling it to employ more cutting-edge manufacturing techniques than its competitors. As for Lockheed, CNBC got a bird's-eye view from the T-50A cockpit earlier this week. Mike Griswold, director of T-50 business development, says Lockheed chose a more off-the-shelf strategy because building a brand new plane would have slowed down its own aggressive timetable. "We can deliver new trainer aircraft at least two years ahead of the Air Force's schedule. And the reason we can do that on a very predictable, low-risk, on-schedule, on-time, on-cost program is because we've done all the basic design and development and test work to show that everything is ready today," he said. "Lockheed has an edge because it doesn't have development costs, but Boeing has a nice design, and if they aggressively bid they could take this," explains Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Virginia-based industry consultancy Teal Group. But it isn't just planes. A key piece of the future program will be the accompanying simulator system. Lockheed, for example, is offering a multistage ground-based training system that includes a simulator with 360-degree enactment connected through software directly to the T-50As — meaning pilots on the ground can go on missions with more advanced pilots in the air. "With that training solution, we change the entire method of training students," says Lockheed chief test pilot, Mark "Red" Ward. Most recently, Ward test-flew F-35s for the company, which makes that fighter jet. A former Air Force pilot, Ward first learned to fly on the same T-38s used today. "Right now, all of that is done in the fourth- and fifth-generation planes, but now we can do it in this training system so that when they transition, we have a student that already knows … the tasks required so we can shorten the end-product training," explains Ward. "If he's going to an F-16, F-35, F-22, we can shorten that from maybe 6 to 8 months all the way to 4 to 6 weeks." show chapters Defense contractor showdown between Lockheed and Boeing    Wednesday, 19 Apr 2017 | 12:15 PM ET | 01:53 In other words, a new software-enabled system will shift the training risk away from expensive fighter jets to simulators, and since pilots wouldn't have to do so much training within the actual aircraft, that would also mean less wear and tear and thus less upkeep for that hardware. But there are unknowns — not the least of which is the budget. The federal government continues to operate under a Continuing Resolution, for now; most experts expect gridlock to plague the defense budget in fiscal year 2018 as well. Also in focus: a personnel shortage within the Pentagon. Many Defense Department positions remain vacant — or occupied by temporary holdovers from the Obama administration. That could mean delays in contract awards, even if posts get filled before year's end. Meantime, competitors are proceeding as if those challenges won't emerge, focusing on taking planes up to rack up the required flight hours and collect the required data. And of course, they are also pushing out big marketing pitches — pitches heavy on cost-cutting verbiage and job creation. "This is gonna be a hard-fought competition," says Griswold.

The aerospace manufacturer responded to the Belgian request for proposal with its F/A-18 Super Hornet, a multirole fighter marketed as a 4th-plus-generation aircraft. The plane has been viewed as a more cost-effective alternative to the 5th-generation Lockheed Martin F-35. Other competitors include Saab with the Gripen, Eurofighter with the Typhoon, and Dassault with the Rafale. Boeing announced its withdrawal from the competition on Wednesday. "Boeing informed the Belgian government that it will not participate in its bidders conference today, nor respond to the request for proposals for a new fighter aircraft," the company told UPI in an emailed statement. "We regret that after reviewing the request we do not see an opportunity to compete on a truly level playing field with the extremely capable and cost-effective F/A-18 Super Hornet." Boeing added its removal from the program will free up company time to focus on other customers. Recently, the contractor inked a $2.1 billion deal to produce 17 Poseidon aircraft for the U.S. Navy. The company also received a $41 million contract modification in early April to update Super Hornets and EA-18 Growlers operated by various U.S. foreign military sales customers. The modification includes work for the governments of Australia, Finland, Kuwait, Malaysia, Switzerland, Canada and Spain. The F/A-18 Super Hornet is a twin-engine air supremacy jet built for taking off from aircraft carriers. Updates for the aircraft include conformal fuel tanks, an enclosed weapons pod, a reduced radar signature and an enhanced engine.

Bush, Henry Kravis, Sheldon Adelson, White House, Air Force, Cantor Shares25 Thu, 20 Apr 2017-10:10pm , Reuters Large U.S. companies and their executives helped President Donald Trump raise a record-setting $106.7 million for inauguration festivities in January, according to a U.S. government filing released on Wednesday. That tally more than doubled the prior 2009 record of $53.2 million for President Barack Obama's first inauguration, which had topped the previous 2005 record of $42.3 million for President George W. Bush, government records showed. The biggest donor by far to Trump's inauguration was Sheldon Adelson, casino magnate and founder of Las Vegas Sands Corp . He gave $5 million, according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee's filing with the Federal Election Commission. Adelson declined comment. Many of the companies that donated to Trump, a Republican, have significant matters pending before the U.S. government or have been invited to White House events. Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Obama's prior inauguration. For example, aerospace and defence groups Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp each donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, the filing said. Boeing had donated $1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee falls into two categories, said Larry Sabato, political analyst at the University of Virginia. "It's either make-up money or it's a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump. You don't give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls," he said. Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration. In Twitter messages he said costs on Boeing's new Air Force One plane were "out of control" and urged the federal government to "Cancel order!" Trump in December sent a Twitter message saying the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet was also "out of control." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that inaugurations have "pretty much been a nonpartisan activity ... This is a time-honored tradition, and I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural." Financial services companies and executives were among the $1-million donors to Trump's big festivities, including Charles Schwab, chairman of the board of Charles Schwab Corp, Bank of America Corp, financier Henry Kravis and Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman Howard Lutnick. Their industry is eager for Trump to roll back regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Coal and oil companies were also prominent donors. Clifford Forrest, owner of the Rosebud Mining Co, gave $1 million. AT&T gave nearly $2.1 million in cash and services. It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner Inc. AT&T donated $4.6 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to OpenSecrets. "For many years, AT&T has contributed to our nation's presidential inaugural celebrations," said AT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment. Bank of America, Charles Schwab, Forrest and Lutnick did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: The Long-Term Trend That Makes Allegheny Technologies Incorporated an Awesome Buy Metal parts that can be 3D-printed are all the rage in high-performance applications, which bodes well for metal alloy powders manufacturers. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Apr 20, 2017 at 9:40AM It's been a busy April for additive manufacturing news, especially when it comes to metal printing technologies. NASA highlighted a new "space fabric" that looks a lot like medieval chain mail, except modern-day blacksmiths can use 3D printers to program varying functionality onto each side. Japanese conglomerate Sumitomo Heavy Industries announced the acquisition of Massachusetts-based Persimmon Technologies, a metal 3D-printing start-up specializing in hybrid motor parts that boast performance advantages over their traditionally machined counterparts. And Boeing (NYSE:BA) tapped Norsk Titanium to 3D-print structural parts for the 787 Dreamliner, which could reduce titanium costs by 17% for each plane.   Cost reductions on that level demonstrate why the aerospace and defense industries have been among the first to seriously explore using 3D printers to fabricate high-performance metal parts. While that has created fierce competition among titans such as Boeing, General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Airbus, investors have an easier way to profit from the increasingly popular trend: the comparatively tiny Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI). Image source: Getty Images. The trend is this stock's long-term friend If Boeing and Airbus are in a high-stakes gold rush to reduce costs and win lucrative multibillion-dollar aircraft contracts from airlines, and even entire countries, then Allegheny Technologies is selling them lunch on their way to the river. In other words, it doesn't matter much who in the aerospace industry wins market share or glory, only that companies are trying. That means the need will exist for specialty alloy powders that feed into 3D printers -- and the materials manufacturer is well positioned to capitalize. Allegheny Technologies generated 62% of its revenue last year from its high-performance materials and components segment, of which 75% came from aerospace and defense customers. That translates to 46.5% of total revenue, or $1.5 billion, from commercial aircraft manufacturers, their suppliers, and government-related defense needs. At the moment, sales of powders used in additive manufacturing processes account for only a fraction of the segment's top line, but it remains one of the fastest-growing components in the company's long-term strategy.   If recent capital expenditures and partner announcements are any guide, then Allegheny Technologies is poised to witness impressive growth in the area in the next few years. In fact, that growth may already be underway, as evidenced by its jet engine revenue growth last year. Metric 2016 2015 Change Jet engine revenue $823.3 million $709.6 million 16% Airframes revenue $367.8 million $379.5 million (3%) Government aerospace and defense revenue $248.1 million $276.8 million (10%) Data source: SEC filings. The company has made major investments in two families of metal alloy powders: titanium-based and nickel-based. Investors might yawn over the periodic-table soup in SEC filings, but that's an important hint at what's to come. Why? Because it coincides with the needs of two of its largest customers: General Electric and Boeing. General Electric and its partner Snecma have made headlines by 3D-printing metal parts for its jet engines. Specifically, fuel nozzles that are 25% lighter, five times more durable, and 18 times simpler than parts made with conventional manufacturing. GE Aviation expects to manufacture 100,000 such parts by the end of 2019. The raw materials used? Nickel-based and titanium-based alloy powders. A major supplier for General Electric and Snecma over the years? Allegheny Technologies.    It's actually difficult to overstate the importance of having the digital-industrial conglomerate as a customer. GE's researchers are looking to quickly expand the use of 3D-printed metal parts for its healthcare, appliance, and oil and gas businesses -- where Allegheny Technologies is already a major supplier. Meanwhile, the recent Boeing deal with Norsk Titanium could prove important for the materials manufacturer. The partnership will 3D-print titanium-alloy parts for the 787 Dreamliner's airframe and save between $2 million and $3 million per plane. That's a sharp reduction considering each plane requires $17 million of titanium parts when made through conventional means. And since every dollar counts when securing aircraft sales deals, the partnership could ratchet up pressure on Airbus to increase its use of additive manufacturing. The French aerospace giant similarly makes extensive use of titanium parts in its Dreamliner competitor, the A350. One of Boeing's major suppliers for airframe components is, you guessed it, Allegheny Technologies.  What does it mean for investors? It may be easy to overlook Allegheny Technologies, but it's about to emerge from a long and difficult restructuring process with the wind at its back. Revenue and profits have declined in recent years as the company sold off noncore assets and shifted its focus away from boring stainless steel products to slightly less boring high-performance metal alloys. The risky bet is quickly paying off. Last year, 62% of revenue came from the high-performance segment, with the balance from the flat rolled products segment. In 2014, the contributions were 48% and 52%, respectively.   Some of the revenue distribution changes are no doubt due to declining overall revenue, but the rumblings of growth in the commercial aerospace industry have certainly been a driving force. Importantly, the materials manufacturer is well positioned to capitalize on the industry's shift to additive manufacturing techniques for high-performance applications. The trend is just taking off -- and it could quickly trickle down to other industries and products -- which makes Allegheny Technologies stock an awesome buy for long-term investors.

Tickets on the new route will start at 179 pounds ($230) one-way, with “premium” seats priced from 699 pounds, Norwegian said in a statement Thursday. The service will commence Sept. 28 with four weekly flights from London’s Gatwick airport and will be operated with Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner aircraft seating as many as 344 passengers. “Our transatlantic flights have shown the huge demand for affordable long-haul travel, so we are delighted to expand into new markets,” Chief Executive Officer Bjorn Kos said in the statement. “Travel should be affordable for all.” The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Norwegian is betting denser seating and the lower operating costs of the 787 will allow it to steal passengers from costlier rivals and stimulate demand among price-sensitive travelers. The carrier has one of the industry’s most ambitious growth plans with more than 200 aircraft on order as it seeks to transfer the successful low-cost airline model to long-haul services. Norwegian will also fly Boeing’s latest narrow-body jet, the 737 Max, on routes across the North Atlantic starting this summer. Head-to-Head The new service between London and Singapore, a popular business route, puts Norwegian in head-to-head competition with IAG SA’s British Airways and Singapore Air -- the only two airlines currently offering non-stop flights between the cities. BA flies the route twice a day, and Singapore Air serves it four times daily. The carriers use larger Boeing 777 and Airbus A380 aircraft. Norwegian has so far connected London with destinations in the U.S. and the Caribbean, targeting mainly leisure travelers. Its only Asian destination so far is Bangkok, which it serves from Oslo, Stockholm and Copenhagen. The latest Singapore flight could be part of a broader expansion as the company canvases locations for potential bases around the world, including plans for an arm in Argentina. To serve Singapore, Norwegian will use its U.K. subsidiary, with planes and crews based at Gatwick airport. The unit can make use of traffic rights to destinations in Asia, Africa and South America, the company said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

That tally more than doubled the prior 2009 record of $53.2 million for President Barack Obama's first inauguration, which had topped the previous 2005 record of $42.3 million for President George W. Bush, government records showed. The biggest donor by far to Trump's inauguration was Sheldon Adelson, casino magnate and founder of Las Vegas Sands (lvs). He gave $5 million, according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee's filing with the Federal Election Commission. Adelson declined comment. Many of the companies that donated to Trump, a Republican, have significant matters pending before the U.S. government or have been invited to White House events. Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Obama's prior inauguration. For example, aerospace and defense groups Boeing (ba) and Lockheed Martin (lmt) each donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, the filing said. Boeing had donated $1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee falls into two categories, said Larry Sabato, political analyst at the University of Virginia. "It's either make-up money or it's a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump. You don't give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls," he said. Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration.

Clifford Forrest, owner of the Rosebud Mining, gave $1 million. AT&T (t) gave nearly $2.1 million in cash and services. It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner (twx). AT&T donated $4.6 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to OpenSecrets. "For many years, AT&T has contributed to our nation's presidential inaugural celebrations," said AT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment.

Chairman and CEO Sheldon Adelson testifies in court in Las Vegas. Adelson donated $5 million to President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities. (John Locher / Associated Press) By Rosalind S. Helderman and John Wagner Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS Casino magnate and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson donated $5 million to President Donald Trump’s inaugural festivities, as corporate interests and lobbyists lifted the inaugural committee’s fundraising to record levels. In all, more than 45 individuals and companies donated at least $1 million each to the effort as Trump broke with the practice of most recent inaugural committees and placed no limits on corporate or individual donors. Major donors included Robert Mercer, the hedge fund manager who has been one of Trump’s biggest donors, Dow Chemical, and Phillip Ruffin, a longtime Trump friend and business partner. Several owners of National Football League teams gave $1 million, including Washington Redskins owner Daniel Snyder, Los Angeles Rams owner Stanley Kroenke, Houston Texans owner Robert McNair and a Trump friend who owns the New England Patriots, Robert Kraft, whose team is visiting the White House on Wednesday. Trump’s inaugural committee, which raised money to fund a concert and other celebrations surrounding his inauguration in January, announced Tuesday that it has raised $107 million, doubling a previous record set by President Barack Obama in 2009. A 510-page filing with the Federal Election Commission made public Wednesday provided details of donations, though it provided no information about how the committee spent its money, including how much money remained after the festivities. The committee has said it would donate leftover funds to charities but has not identified which charities will receive money or how much. But the new filing provides a window into the flood of support from wealthy individuals and major corporations that helped support the event, despite Trump’s campaign promises to “drain the swamp” and limit the role of money in Washington. Presidential inaugural committees have traditionally been a way for major donors to express their support for a new administration – and for donors who backed a president’s rivals during the campaign to make amends. The filing showed that more than 1,500 people and companies gave money to the effort. But more than two-thirds of the money raised came from big-dollar donors who contributed at least $500,000. Other corporate donors that gave $1 million included AT&T, Bank of America, Pfizer and Boeing. Boeing’s donations came after Trump took a shot at the company on Twitter in early December, threatening to cancel a contract to build new presidential jets. Since then, the company has built strong ties to the Trump White House, and Trump has visited a Boeing facility. In a statement, a company spokesman noted that the $1 million contribution matched one given to support Obama’s inaugural committee in 2013, and that the company had given to many inaugural committees before then. Another $1 million came from Marlene Ricketts, a member of the family that owns the Chicago Cubs. Trump had nominated her son Todd Ricketts to be deputy commerce secretary, but the Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday that he was withdrawing from consideration from the post after being unable to disentangle himself from his financial holdings. During his daily briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked whether he was concerned about any real or perceived conflicts, given that many inaugural donors will be affected by actions taken by the Trump administration. “No,” Spicer responded, saying the situation is similar to that posed by campaign donations. “There’s disclosure on this for a reason, so you know what’s happening,” Spicer said. He added that helping fund inaugurals is “a time-honored tradition,” often done in a “bipartisan” fashion. The committee also pocketed money from one of Silicon Valley’s most controversial stars. Palmer Luckey, the 24-year-old co-founder of the Oculus Rift virtual-reality system, donated $100,000 on Jan. 4 through a shell company, Wings of Time, which itself was owned by another shell company named Fiendlord’s Keep that is wholly owned by Luckey, California business records show. Known for his breakout technology and a much-ridiculed 2015 Time magazine cover, Luckey became the face of virtual reality when Facebook bought Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion. Forbes last year called Luckey, a college dropout, one of America’s richest entrepreneurs under 40, estimating his net worth at $730 million. But Luckey was heavily criticized last year after he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump Internet group called Nimble America, which was infamous for its off-color memes about Hillary Clinton, including a Pennsylvania highway billboard that called her “too big to jail.” Trailed by the scandal and a series of separate lawsuits, Luckey left Facebook last month. Messages left with Luckey and his attorney were not returned. The committee had been chaired by longtime Trump friend Tom Barrack, with fundraising efforts led by vice chairmen Woody Johnson and Elliott Broidy. Adelson is one of the most prolific donors in Republican politics. He endorsed Trump in May, and he and his wife, Miriam, contributed a total of more than $21.2 million to Trump’s campaign effort, including contributions to Trump’s campaign, Republican committees and a pro-Trump super PAC, according to federal finance disclosures. Trump has lavished praised and personal attention on the casino owner ever since. He met with Adelson at Trump Tower in New York before taking office and then seated the couple in prime seats on the dais when he took the oath. The Adelsons also joined Trump at a lunch with congressional leaders at the U.S. Capitol and dined at the White House in February. Adelson is a major supporter of Israeli causes and has pushed for the United States to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a Trump campaign promise that remains unfulfilled. When Sean Spicer incorrectly recounted the history of the Holocaust at a White House briefing last week, he called Adelson personally to apologize.

ACORN FILE PHOTO U.S. Rep. Steve Knight is spear­­heading an effort to save the remaining rocket test stands and preserve the Chumash cave paintings at the Santa Susana Field Lab in the southern hills of Simi Valley, north of Oak Park. On March 21, Knight (R-Simi Valley) sent a letter to Robert Lightfoot, NASA’s acting administrator, urging the preservation of the test stands and cave paintings due to their “legacy and symbolic importance.” “This is a two-pronged effort to make sure that we do everything we can to preserve some of the historical value of . . . what we’ve done in the space industry and also to make sure the American Indian sacred sites are guarded,” Knight told the Simi Valley Acorn on Tuesday. “We don’t want those (stands) to just get mowed over, because then what protections would there be for the sacred sites? This is not just a part of space history, it’s part of Southern California’s history.” In the letter, Knight cites the field lab’s involvement in the first American-made rocket engine in 1950; in 33 Saturn and Apollo missions, including the first mission to land a man on the moon in 1969; and in the work with the Space Shuttle starting in 1981. The 2,850-acre field lab had also been used for decades as a nuclear test site and for research in the development of ballistic missiles. Today, Boeing Co. owns 80 percent of the property, including Area IV where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred in 1959. The federal government owns the remaining 20 percent, including Area II, where six remaining historic rocket test stands and cave paintings are located. A complex multi- agency cleanup effort by Boeing, NASA, the Department of Toxic Substances Control and U.S Department of Energy has been underway at SSFL for nearly a decade. Per cleanup agreements, NASA began demolishing buildings on the federal government’s portion of the site in 2014, although takedown of the test stands was deferred in 2015 after some activists began calling for preservation. ‘Very troubling’ Denise Duffield, who is lobbying for a cleanup of the entire field lab to background standards— meaning all materials unnatural to the site would be removed—said it is impossible to remove all contamination from SSFL and preserve the test stands. “Most of the contamination on NASA’s property is located under and near the test stands. We’re talking about very toxic materials and in very high quantities,” Duffield said. She said Knight’s letter is “very troubling” and she’s concerned it will be used by NASA and Boeing to push for weaker cleanup standards. Current agreements in place require NASA to clean up Area II to background standards, while certain portions of the field lab under Boeing’s charge must be remediated to suburban residential standards— meaning people could live on-site without getting sick from contamination. (Despite the standards, Boeing intends to preserve its portion as open space.) “From a public health perspective, the SSFL site must be fully cleaned up before there is even consideration of designating it a park or national monument,” Duffield said. “Otherwise, the polluters will use the park status to (leave) gross quantities of toxic materials on the site that will continue to migrate and impact local communities.” But Knight argues that preserving the stands will not impede remediation. “The cleanup is still one of our highest priorities, ensuring that it’s cleaned up to . . . where people can go enjoy a recreational-type of place,” the congressman said. ‘Preserve and protect’ In 2015, activist Christina Walsh started a petition on change.org asking President Barack Obama to designate the site as a national monument in an effort to preserve the test stands and the cave paintings. Although the petition is what caused NASA to defer demolition of the test stands two years ago, it seems to have stalled, as no updates have been posted since July 2015. Knight said his letter—which was signed by U.S. Reps. Julia Brownley (D-Thousand Oaks), Ted Lieu (D-Los Angeles), Tony Cardenas (D-Van Nuys), Adam Schiff (D-Burbank) and Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks)—is separate from Walsh’s effort. In a statement provided in an email to the Acorn, Brownley said everything should be done to “preserve and protect important cultural and historic features,” a task she believes can be accomplished while still meeting cleanup requirements. “The beautiful cave paintings . . . juxtaposed with the test stands from NASA’s Mercury and Apollo era create a unique and remarkable cultural and historic connection between this ancient Native American astronomical observatory and religious shrine and the site’s role in propelling us into the modern space age,” Brownley said. Jennifer Stanfield, a NASA spokesperson, confirmed the agency has received Knight’s letter but declined to answer specific questions about what happens next. The agency only provided a statement saying NASA is as “equally committed to preserving the cultural legacy of the site” as it is to protecting human health and the environment. “We appreciate the significant public interest in the site’s rich history and at this time plan to continue to defer demolition of the historic test stand structures, unless they pose risks to safety, health or the environment that cannot be mitigated,” the statement reads.

April 10, 2017 by Jessica Lovering 32 Comments Author and pro-nuclear activist Michael Shellenberger recently wrote that the nuclear sector, to survive, must embark on a radical new course: create one company, comparable to Airbus in the aircraft sector, that will develop a standardized, efficient reactor design.  Josh Freed and Todd Allen of think tank the Third Way and Ted Nordhaus and Jessica Lovering of think tank The Breakthrough Institute argue that this approach will not solve anything. They believe the nuclear industry needs innovation rather than standardization. Article courtesy The Third Way. In a February 17 article (republished on Energy Post on February 27, editor) our colleague Michael Shellenberger calls for a massive, state-directed consolidation of the nuclear sector in developed economies. A single state-sponsored nuclear behemoth, consolidating the nuclear divisions of Toshiba, Westinghouse, General Electric, Areva, and EDF would deploy a single standardized light-water reactor design in the United States, Japan, Great Britain, and western Europe and compete with Korea, China, and Russia for export markets abroad. To assure demand for the new conglomerate’s product, low-cost public loans would encourage utilities in developed economies to build the new standardized reactor. As we discussed in a previous post, Shellenberger’s analysis is based upon a mischaracterization of the drivers of nuclear costs around the world. His follow-up proposal is further problematized by a misreading of recent developments in both the aviation and nuclear industries. In this post we consider what might be learned from the aviation industry, the geopolitical reasons why consolidation is unlikely, and how US policies and institutions will need to change in order to revive the nuclear industry. A cautionary tale The explicit model for Shellenberger’s proposal is Airbus, which competes with Boeing to divide the global market for wide-bodied aircraft. But if anything, Airbus offers a cautionary tale for the kind of problems an international industrial nuclear consortium might face. Many of those problems began with the huge bet that Airbus and its member companies made on the A380. The A380 was designed and built to take well-established aviation technology and scale it up, in order to capture economies of scale associated with carrying more people around the world on fewer planes. But Airbus massively misread the changing aviation market, designing an aircraft a third larger than a 747 to serve the traditional hub and spoke design of international air travel at precisely the moment greater fuel efficiency and longer ranges for smaller aircraft were disrupting that model, allowing cheap point to point international air travel that had historically not been feasible. If anything, Airbus offers a cautionary tale for the kind of problems an international industrial nuclear consortium might face Boeing by contrast anticipated that market and designed a new aircraft from the ground up to take advantage of it. The 787 may not have broken with jet propulsion technology, a fact that Shellenberger invokes in order to claim that it represented an incremental evolution of jet airplane design. But in multiple ways, the 787 represents precisely the sort of radical break from traditional aviation technology that Shellenberger rejects. Where the A380 was a third larger than a 747, the 787 was a third smaller than Boeing’s flagship.[i] The jet engines for the 787 were radically redesigned, with a hybrid electric jet propulsion system that dramatically improved fuel efficiency. The chassis was entirely built from carbon composites, the first large aircraft ever to be built primarily of carbon, not aluminum. The 787 has sold well and is now widely accepted to represent the future of long distance air travel. The A380 has seen poor sales and has mostly been purchased by state sponsored airlines, most famously Emirates. It is difficult to say to what degree Airbus’ consortia ownership contributed to its failed bet on the A380. But if there is an aviation analog to the approach to nuclear deployment that Shellenberger is advocating, it is Airbus and the A380, not Boeing and the 787. That, if nothing else, should give nuclear advocates pause when considering the sort of centralized, state-led, multinational nuclear consortium that Shellenberger is calling for. The geopolitics of nuclear energy There are multiple further challenges that agitate against the sort of multinational nuclear consortium that Shellenberger advocates. The various geopolitical imperatives that have driven nations to invest in substantial nuclear energy capacities have also historically driven nations to endeavor to indigenize their nuclear industries and supply chains. Most reactor fleets around the world started with licensing established reactor designs. Almost all, one way or another, can be traced back to early US light-water reactor designs. Japan bought and built reactors from GE and Westinghouse, later leasing these designs. France’s large fleet of reactors trace their origins to a Westinghouse design. While Korea initially built Canadian heavy-water reactors and French pressurized water reactors, its standardized reactor fleet is based on a pressurized reactor from Combustion Engineering, an American firm. The primary focus in all of those nations was then to indigenize the designs they had licensed and develop domestic supply chains such that their energy security could not be compromised by geopolitical competitors — that, after all, was the reason that most nations went nuclear in the first place. Absent some meaningful technological innovation, it’s not clear what Airbus Nuclear would have to offer that its competitors didn’t Shellenberger argues that those imperatives no longer hold. Russia and now Korea are building and even operating reactors in other countries. China is an investor in the proposed European Pressurized Reactor in Great Britain and is clearly ramping up its domestic nuclear industry with one eye squarely on the export market. And Great Britain has decided to allow state-owned foreign companies to build planned new reactors rather than rebuild its domestic industry. But once a nation has relinquished those geopolitical imperatives, it is unclear what else would motivate the kind of consortium that Shellenberger envisions. If Korean or Chinese companies are already producing standardized reactors based upon well established technologies, mature supply chains, and experience gleaned from multiple previous builds, what reason is there for the United States, Great Britain, and France to make large public investments to reinvent that particular wheel? The only ostensible reasons — safety and jobs — could as easily be achieved without the creation of a new consortium. Any foreign firm would have to go through the same licensing process in Great Britain or the United States as would the new consortium and would be subject to the same regulatory oversight during construction and operations. And any deal to have foreign firms build new plants in developed nations could include domestic content or manufacturing requirements to assure that there are substantial local employment benefits. Moreover, it is not clear what comparative advantage such a consortium would bring in export markets. China, Korea, and Russia already have first mover advantage and aren’t burdened by the sorts of complications that a multinational Airbus style consortium would have to navigate among its members before negotiating with its export targets. Absent some meaningful technological innovation, it’s not clear what Airbus Nuclear would have to offer that its competitors didn’t. Radical nuclear innovation must be informed by markets, end users, and modern fabrication and manufacturing methods Shellenberger does suggest that the member nations would also make large shared investments in “alternate” reactors. But if one accepts the basic premise of Shellenberger’s argument, it is hard to imagine why they would. He argues that technological innovation in reactor designs impedes learning-by-doing and that alternatives to light water reactors are unlikely to bring significant cost benefits. Why then invest in research and development for alternative reactors? Innovate or Die If Shellenberger’s proposal doesn’t hold up very well under scrutiny, it does help clarify the choice that nuclear advocates and policy-makers today face. The industry is in crisis. That crisis, at bottom, is the result of the industry’s inability to adapt to changing economic, institutional, and technological realities. Shellenberger argues that we can turn back the clock on those realities. Our view is that we cannot. In a world in which fossil fuels are cheap and abundant, not costly and scarce, nuclear will need to be substantially cheaper to build than it has historically been even under better circumstances. That sort of cost decline will not be possible so long as reactors are water-cooled and operated at high atmospheric pressures, requiring enormous containment structures, multiply redundant back-up cooling systems, and water cooling towers and ponds, which account for much of the cost associated with building light-water reactors[ii]. Nor will it be possible so long as nuclear reactors must be constructed on site one gigawatt at a time. At one GW scale, the only way to get learning-by-doing is to basically commit a substantial share of national generation to a single reactor type and design, as France and Korea have done. And as we note above, there are few places, if any, where there is likely to be sufficient geopolitical reason to do so. At 10 MW or 100 MW, by contrast, there is ample opportunity for learning by doing and economies of multiples for several reactor classes and designs, even in the absence of rapid demand growth or geopolitical imperatives. A radical break from the light water regime that would enable this sort of innovation is not a small undertaking and will require a major reorganization of the nuclear sector. State-led development of advanced designs, bringing together large incumbent firms and scientists from national laboratories failed in United States, France, Britain, Japan, and Germany in the 60’s and 70’s. It will likely fail as well in Korea, China, France, and Russia today. There is a growing advanced nuclear sector in United States that is ready to transform the nuclear industry if we are willing to give it the chance What will be necessary is not new physics. The basic physics of virtually all nuclear fission technologies has been well understood and demonstrated by America’s national laboratories since the late 1950’s. Rather, radical nuclear innovation must be informed by markets, end users, and modern fabrication and manufacturing methods. This is centrally a job for entrepreneurial engineers, not scientists at national laboratories, technocrats at the Department of Energy, or division heads at Westinghouse or General Electric. Public policy that empowers nuclear innovation and entrepreneurship will need to support engineers and start-ups, not direct them. Such a shift would be major, but not unprecedented. The era of cheap genetic decoding became a reality when decades of federal research and development was handed off to Craig Ventor, an entrepreneur who used technologies and basic science pioneered by federal scientists to develop a better and cheaper way to decode the human genome. This made possible the modern biotech sector, which was further enabled by important changes in the way that the FDA licensed and tested new drugs, and by changes to the federal tax code and to patent law that incentivized public institutions to get research out of their laboratories and into the hands of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. NASA over the last two decades has undergone a similar transformation, creating policies and incentives to support a diverse and growing commercial space industry where space flight was once the sole province of NASA and its large contractors. A strong federal program will support early innovation at universities to spawn new entrepreneurs, open up the national laboratories to provide start-ups with technical advice, test facilities, and test beds, reform NRC licensing for advanced reactors, and provide advanced market commitments and other competitive grants for companies that demonstrate that they can build reactors at economically competitive costs. None of these measures, individually or in sum, are any guarantee that we will develop cheap, economically competitive advanced nuclear reactors. But there is little reason to think that large light-water reactors have much future outside of a few rapidly growing state-led economies in Asia or that continuing, incremental innovation in light-water design is likely to change that. Today, there is a growing advanced nuclear sector in United States that is ready to transform the nuclear industry if we are willing to give it the chance. Innovation, in nuclear technology, business models, and the underlying structure of the sector, not revanchism, is what will be required to save America’s nuclear industry.

Sort by:   newest | oldest | most voted Member Bentvels April 11, 2017 12:30 Such advanced new nuclear won’t arrive at the market before 2030. Then it meets an environment in which: – new utility scale PV-solar and Wind are offered for 1 – 3 cnt/KWh; – high efficient Power-to-Gas reached economy of scale. Covering longer (seasonal) dips in wind & solar production; – battery costs are decreased a factor X and more users disconnected from the grid as that became cheaper. etc. So that advanced new nuclear will have to deliver then at prices below 3cnts/KWh, which is ~5 times less than present new nuclear. Consider new designs such as the Molten Salt Reactor. Those imply: – very (corrosion) aggressive fluoride salt at temperatures of 650-700°C, so fast wear of the steel, etc. The proposed solution to deliver every 4 yrs a new reactor vessel doesn’t decrease the cost price. – two heat exchangers behind each other (radio-active molten salt => ‘normal’ molten salt => water). Heat exchangers are notorious vulnerable (killed a.o. SONGS). So, though MSR solves the high pressure reactor vessel problem, one gets other (possible more costly) problems back… Don’t see how MSR’s can produce 5 times cheaper than present new LWR/PWR’s. But may be HTGR offers more chance. Didn’t study it yet. Don’t see other serious candidates. -3  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 11, 2017 17:18 Bas – as usual, you combine the rosiest of predictions for renewables with the most pessimistic ones for nuclear. Neither you nor I know for certain what will happen, but a safe assumption would be neither of your outlier predictions are realistic. They’re based on what you want, not what is viable. A safe assumption would be that both renewables technology and nuclear technology make modest improvements by 2030. That leaves renewables still wildly deficient in meeting the goals necessary to replace fossil fuels by 2100. We can thus either base our efforts on half-baked hopes, or what will likely happen. Is there really any decision to be made? 2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Bentvels April 11, 2017 22:17 To much honor for me. Essentially it are not my predictions but those of scientific studies, think-tank Agora, etc. Only my question: I don’t see how in 2030 new MSR’s can produce 5 times cheaper than present new LWR/PWR’s. Especially considering the extra difficulties such as: – the steel wear due to the aggressive salt at 700°C; – the double heat exchangers needed with ~650°C molten salt*); – the potential instabilities of the fuel containing molten salt (major cause of explosions in the process industry even the small ORNLE was not free of such instabilities; – the cleaning of the radio-active molten salt after 4yrs. ?? comes from me. But may be you can explain how? Or explain another design that may reach that lower cost level? _________ *) Even with the low temperatures (450°C) of LWR/PWR’s non-aggressive water, heat exchangers are already vulnerable and have to be replaced rather often early. An expensive operation that ended the life of NPP’s, such as that of twin reactor SONGS. -4  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member John Oneill April 12, 2017 12:24 Gas cooled reactors can work, but because gas is an inherently less efficient carrier of heat than liquids, they need much larger cores than other reactors for the same power output, and those must be engineered for high pressure. The British CO2-cooled reactors were thus rather expensive to build, although eventually the bugs were sorted out and they are still working well, but none were ever exported. For similar reasons, molten salt or metal cooled reactors should be much smaller than light water reactors – running at low pressure, they don’t need a huge containment building in case the water all boils. ( Some used a massive store of ice instead, but that has increased maintenance costs.) They should also all be far safer – cesium and iodine, the most problematic radioisotopes at Chernobyl and Fukushima, were problematic because of their low elemental boiling points, but they both bond chemically to lead, sodium, or fluorides, and so are stable to much higher temperatures. So, no forged pressure vessel with steel thirty centimetres thick. No huge dome with reinforced concrete a metre thick. Steam turbines half the size, the same as are used in thousands of supercritical coal plants. A reactor about the size of the tower base of an 8 MW windmill, but that makes 800 MW – and not just when the wind blows. There’s got to be savings there somewhere. 4  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 12, 2017 15:44 John, I think you’ll find containment requirements are not significantly reduced with low-pressure cooling systems – in the U.S. at least, nuclear containment must withstand the impact of a fully-loaded commercial airliner. 0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Mark Heslep April 12, 2017 19:05 I would think a design i) without high pressure steam in the primary, ii) with a subterranean reactor, iii) with walk away safe decay heat, would make aircraft impact moot. 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member EngineerPoet April 12, 2017 20:17 The containment is a steel vessel designed to hold anything that leaks out of the reactor.  The shield building goes around the containment; that is what has to handle impacts. 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 11, 2017 16:12 Jessica, Josh, Ted, and Todd – In the creation of a theoretical, ideal business model to foster the development of safe and inexpensive nuclear energy (which, I think, all agree is the goal here) Shellenberger’s model of Airbus reflects more accurately what is taking place in China. That model is working. First, government must remain intimately involved in both the design and regulation of new nuclear. Unlike genetic research, nuclear energy can’t be simply “handed off” to private investment when the materials it uses are highly toxic. Even if they aren’t easily weaponized, when released into the environment accidentally (or maliciously) they create big problems for society. And that private investors make horrible guardians of public interest has been demonstrated since time immemorial. Second, the Chinese are proving groundbreaking new designs are unnecessary. And in the U.S., the idea those designs are “just around the corner” is both inhibiting development of improved PWR designs and hastening the demise of perfectly-functional plants already in existence. Nuclear engineers worldwide have decades of experience and are now building designs which work, and work well. If it’s true that That sort of cost decline will not be possible so long as reactors are water-cooled and operated at high atmospheric pressures, requiring enormous containment structures, multiply redundant back-up cooling systems, and water cooling towers and ponds, which account for much of the cost associated with building light-water reactors. how are the Chinese able to build light-water reactors at one-fourth the cost of American ones? There’s no evidence – to date – that Chinese designs are unsafe, and it might be argued that “multiply redundant back-up cooling systems” are, from an engineering perspective, less safe than simple, durable, predictable ones. China’s publicly-financed and -run State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation, formed by the Chinese government in 2007, now partners with two private nuclear corporations. It’s succeeding spectacularly in its goal of building out nuclear quickly and inexpensively, and is similar to the Atomic Energy Commission/Westinghouse consortium which produced America’s first exclusively-commercial plant at Shippingport. So with the imperative of climate change we need to focus on what’s already been proven to work, not what we hope will work. That strategy is failing miserably with renewables/efficiency/storage, and we can learn from it. What’s wrong with the American business of nuclear energy has nothing to do with technology but with public misperceptions – ones shaped by fossil-fuel interests to guarantee their polluting fuel a profitable future. We can either base policy on those misperceptions or on science – sound familiar? 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Bentvels April 11, 2017 22:35 Since Fukushima and the associated improved safety requirements, major part of China’s reactor construction projects now also suffer from delays & costs overruns. They won’t reach the 5-years plan 2020 target of 58GW nuclear operational. Will probably be ~52GW. -1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 12, 2017 00:19 Bas, 2-1GW units at Sanmen will cost $3 billion each. Those are 1980s prices for U.S. nuclear, and with no basis for your claim they “suffer from delays & cost overruns”, I’m left to believe you’re making it up. Their cost would have to be 300% higher to compare to U.S. plants. 30% of wind in China is curtailed because of intermittency issues and a crappy infrastructure, making wind (CNY .49 – .61kWh), with a marginal operating cost of exactly nothing, even more expensive than nuclear (CNY .43/kWh). 3  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Bentvels April 12, 2017 07:04 Check this interactive nuclear database. -2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 12, 2017 15:46 Bas, you check it.

The French have already tried this solution, and while they pulled off the illusion of cheap, centralized, standardized nuclear for quite a long time, we’re finally getting a sense of what that model is actually costing the French taxpayer, including the now-apparent fact that only a miniscule fraction of the likely cost of decommissioning the existing fleet has been accrued. Not long ago (within the past 15 years) the Japanese model of a utility-government partnership in the construction and oversight of Japanese nuclear was being touted by US advocates as the blueprint for the future of nuclear. The failure to address even the simplest system vulnerabilities at Fukushima, vulnerabilities that had been identified for years but were swept under the carpet in the interest of cost and ensuring public confidence, blew that illusion wide open. Things may be different in China, but all of our experience tells us otherwise. Jessica et al. are dead right – while government has always and will always play a critical role in whatever future nuclear has, that role needs to put the failed paradigm of the past 50 year behind us and focus on a real future, one that has a chance of succeeding. How many times must Charlie Brown be duped by Lucy before he draws the inescapable conclusion that the football just ain’t going to be there? -1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 13, 2017 18:17 Michael, if you think nuclear of the past 50 years has been a “failed paradigm”, I have to ask: what have you been smoking? Nuclear energy is estimated to have saved 1.8 million lives since 1971, and is in 2014 the safest method of generating dispatchable electricity, hands-down. Possibly you were frightened by overblown media accounts of the Fukushima non-disaster which neither killed nor injured anyone. So I really have no idea how to respond to your alternative reality, and my interest in doing so (and to that of like-minded others) declines by the day. 0  |   -   Share          Member Sean April 16, 2017 03:02 It might be the safest because of all the regulations, however I doubt it is the cheapest. Or else we wouldn’t be seeing a massive switch to NG. 0  |   -   Share          Member BobMeinetz April 17, 2017 17:14 Sean, I’m continually amazed at this “cheapest” argument, because it has no relevance to American utilities whatsoever. Utilities are permitted, by public utility commissions, to charge ratepayers based on a cost-plus arrangement which varies by state. They are all regulated – otherwise, as natural monopolies, they could charge the public whatever exhorbitant fees they liked. So it makes no difference to utilities how much it costs to generate electricity – they pass the cost on to customers. In California, San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) was closed permanently in 2013 and replaced by supposedly “cheap” natural gas. Yet electricity rates in SONGS’s service area skyrocketed 56% within three years. Why? Sempra Energy, the owner of San Diego Gas & Electric, “sells itself” the natural gas it uses to generate electricity, and now bills its customers on a cost-plus arrangement for the gas as well as the electricity. See how this scam works? It’s permitted Sempra to recognize $17 billion in annual revenue, and PG&E is about to do exactly the same thing with Diablo Canyon (nuclear) Power Plant in Central California. 0  |   -   Share          Member Bentvels April 17, 2017 08:21 Bob, The estimation that nuclear is safest, is only made by fanatic pro-nuclear, using unrealistic figures such as 43 deaths due to Chernobyl*). etc. Nuclear is the most dangerous method, as the Germans also concluded. So they are removing all nuclear power plants with highest priority (done in 2022). _____ *) James Hansen etal., while an 2009 issue of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences concluded 825,000 deaths before 2006, and we know that most deaths still have to come, as increased low level radiation has a latency period of 10 – 60 years before the health damage shows! Shown by a.o. the RERF studies regarding the Atomic bombs on Japan and similar as with smoking, asbestos, etc. Even the WHO now admits 16,000deaths while stating that no real estimation can be made. -3  |   -   Share          Member EngineerPoet April 14, 2017 20:34 I see lots of assertions here with no supporting evidence. we’re finally getting a sense of what that model is actually costing the French taxpayer, including the now-apparent fact that only a miniscule fraction of the likely cost of decommissioning the existing fleet has been accrued. If so, they’ve obviously not set aside funds like the American model. But so what.  If decommissioning is too expensive… refurbish instead.  Neutron embrittlement of the reactor vessel is the key limit on the plant’s life.  However, neutron damage can be annealed out.  This would require what amounts to the construction of a furnace inside the containment building, heating of the vessel to the annealing temperature, and cooling again at a controlled rate.  With the number of identical units built by France, engineering and construction of such a portable, segmented (to fit through small doors) furnace should be quite affordable. And then France would have another 40+ years of service from the same reactors, during which they would STILL put “Green” Germany and Denmark to shame for CO2 emissions. The failure to address even the simplest system vulnerabilities at Fukushima, vulnerabilities that had been identified for years but were swept under the carpet in the interest of cost and ensuring public confidence, blew that illusion wide open. It’s sad to see someone who is so ignorant, he can’t identify this as a Japanese cultural problem.  The head of TEPCO could not admit that seawalls had to be raised because it meant that somebody had made a mistake.  The mistake was actually 40-odd years ago, when the potential tsunami height had not been properly determined and the American designers of the original plant called for the bluff to be cut down many meters to reduce the power demands of pumping condenser cooling water uphill. The Onagawa plant, which received harder shaking and a bigger wave than Futaba, came through in fine shape.  Its hill wasn’t shaved down, and it served as a refugee center for townspeople in the aftermath. Then there’s the radiophobia of the Hiroshima Syndrome, which manifests today as bullying of Fukushima evacuees (who should have gone home long since and most never evacuated at all).  A cultural pathology… which you transmit and exacerbate here. Jessica et al. are dead right – while government has always and will always play a critical role in whatever future nuclear has, that role needs to put the failed paradigm of the past 50 year behind us and focus on a real future, one that has a chance of succeeding. When you get to hand-waving in terms like this, I know you’re lying… and projecting. We know “renewables” have no chance of succeeding.  People have known their fatal weaknesses for hundreds of years, which is why coal, oil and natural gas were adopted so quickly.  The only reason to push “Green” stuff is to maintain the markets for the sellers of coal, oil and natural gas.  So the planet burns; they’ll have their money. 1  |   -   Share          Member Bentvels April 17, 2017 09:38 EP, A few corrections of your wrong statements: Onagawa nuclear plant was only saved because a persistent engineer, Yanosoku Hirai, put huge efforts in his idea that the plant needed an high dike. When the tsunami came the 14.8meter high dike was just high enough…. Otherwise the plant probably had undergone the same fate as Fukushima as it’s not on a hill as you assume. Bullying Fukushima evacuees? Research found a 15% highly significant (P=0.001) increase of perinatal deaths in prefectures (areas up to 300km away) that were not evacuated despite the radio-active contamination (the (wrong) idea; little radiation increase, hence no harm). That increase was less in areas with less contamination and no increase was found in areas without contamination. So the Fukushima emitted radio-active material is the only viable explanation. Note that the increase won’t go away soon as the most important fall-out stuff has a half-life of ~30years. Your assumption: “We know “renewables” have no chance of succeeding.” is contradicted by many scientific studies. ‘Nuclear’ France govt institute ADEME concluded after simulation studies that for 2050 a renewable share of 80% regarding electricity generation would be the cheapest solution, while 100% renewable and 40% renewable would cost slightly more. So France installed in 2015 two laws: – One targets the reduction of nuclear from 75% now towards 50% in 2025 (a much faster reduction path than Germany followed); – One targets to increase the share of renewable fast. -3  |   -   Share          Member Jesper Antonsson April 17, 2017 20:39 Your junk-science on radiation isn’t worth commenting. With regards to France, president Hollande hasn’t been able to shut a single reactor during his term, which is now coming to an end. There’s very little chance this law will stay on the books. 1  |   -   Share          Member EngineerPoet April 18, 2017 01:06 So, Bas, between France and “green” Denmark, which country has lower per-kWh carbon emissions? Which one is the model for true environmental protection? And you’re laundering your links to Scherb again.  You need to come up with new tricks.  I’d suggest telling the truth, but you seem to have an anaphylactic reaction to it. 1  |   -   Share          Member John Oneill April 12, 2017 11:50 ‘ What’s wrong with the American business of nuclear energy has nothing to do with technology but with public misperceptions ‘ I would have agreed with you, Bob – until Vietnam shelved its nuclear programme and reverted to coal, citing cost. ( My cousin lives in Ho Chi Minh City and is doing engineering on one of the coal plants. ) The Vietnamese government isn’t swayed by public misperceptions: it tells people what to think and makes sure they do. China, South Korea, and the UAE – the countries with the strongest LWR growth – are middle rank to wealthy countries. To head off climate change, we need the poor countries to be able to afford energy, and the rich ones to get their industrial heat and their transport fossil free, not just their electricity. So even though a French style government-directed buildout of light water reactors would be a good thing, I think we really do need a radically cheaper alternative. 2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member BobMeinetz April 12, 2017 16:13 John, I’m hoping small modular reactors will fill an important void in CO2-free electricity generation in smaller economies. But for perspective, Vietnam’s total GHG emissions are less than 2% of the U.S.A.’s, and their per-capita emissions are 11% of ours. So it seems, to me, incumbent upon wealthier nations to get their act together and lead the way – to take some responsibility for the wealth they’ve (we’ve) amassed over the past two centuries as they’ve (we’ve) spewed carbon into everyone’s atmosphere. Highly-underrecognized is China’s recent conversion of a coal plant to a high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) nuclear plant. If streamlined and cost-optimized, the process could not only bring nuclear electricity to smaller nations around the globe but realize the potential of synfuel production, using the HTGR’s high temperatures to create elemental hydrogen from water. 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Kgothier April 13, 2017 17:15 Both Michael and Jessica’s perspectives are valid, and relevant to the vital discussion Thomas Friedman advocates in his latest book, and we are all avoiding… Having practiced Community Development for decades, it has been my experience that all communities must first come to agreement about what they are, and want to be, before developing a clear, achievable path forward: (and that discussion can not be focused solely on our physical environment). For example, here is what California must discuss, in order to finally identify a clear path towards timely compliance with adopted State Emission Mandates: http://docketpublic.energy.ca.gov/PublicDocuments/15-IEPR-11/TN205398_20150719T170914_Kirk_Gothier_Comments_Kirk_Gothier_Comments_on_Climate_Adaptati.pdf. 2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member nwdiver April 13, 2017 17:19 At what point do we stop chasing the nuclear albatross? Solar PPAs are regularly going for <$0.07/kWh. Wind <$0.04/kWh The really great thing about solar projects is that since costs are still falling fast nearly all projects finish on time AND under budget. Wind, Solar, Storage and Demand Response. How is that not more viable than nuclear? Why do we keep chasing fission instead of deploying technology that is far more cost effective? It's been 40 years and nuclear has only gotten more expensive while the cost of solar has fallen 99% and it's projected to decline another 50% in 5 years. When do mercy rules kick in? -3  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member EngineerPoet April 14, 2017 20:44 Solar PPAs are regularly going for <$0.07/kWh. Wind <$0.04/kWh And what does it cost to get when the wind ISN’T blowing and the sun ISN’T shining? Wind, Solar, Storage and Demand Response. How is that not more viable than nuclear? Why don’t you tell me how much it costs to “demand respond” to zero on calm nights, and have sewers backing up because the lift pumps are down, food going bad, people dying in hospitals because respirators don’t work, crashes because traffic signals are out, looting everywhere… You know, compared to immediate health and welfare crises and social breakdown, nuclear power starts looking pretty damn good! 0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member nwdiver April 16, 2017 02:53 ??? We already have more than enough capacity. Nuclear is mostly added in an attempt to reduce cost with more supply and lower emissions. Gas Turbines are cheap at ~$1/w. Turbines, Solar and Wind are much cheaper and just as reliable as nuclear with lower emissions. It’s a win-win-win. Demand Response takes advantage of surplus wind and solar. As storage gets cheaper more wind/solar will be used and less gas. 0  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Mark Heslep April 16, 2017 04:39 Above the answer was “Wind, Solar, Storage and Demand Response”. A moment later, the answer to a challenge is “Turbines, Solar and Wind “ 1  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member EngineerPoet April 16, 2017 06:15 Yes, don’t they ALWAYS fall back to fossil fuels, instead of eliminating them?  They could just as easily put a floor under “demand response” so that essential functions are served by non-emitting nuclear base load.  But they won’t. That’s because their goal is not the elimination of emissions.  It is the elimination of nuclear power, no matter the other consequences (like climate disaster). 1  |   -   Share          Member Mark Heslep April 16, 2017 23:27 Don’t look behind the renewable curtain. Wait! Somebody grab that little dog. 1  |   -   Share          Member Bentvels April 17, 2017 08:05 Solar and Wind are more reliable than nuclear (not just as reliable). Nuclear Power Plants can and do fail unforeseen within a few seconds which doesn’t occur with wind and solar produced electricity as that involves thousands of physical distributed small generators, whose production is accurately predicted with the weather prediction. So Nuclear Power Plants need expensive spinning reserve and grid adaptations accordingly. Still, experience show that renewable countries, such as Germany and Denmark, have an ~10 time more reliable electricity supply than USA (4times better than France & UK). Germany experienced significant reliability improvements when solar and wind became significant! -2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ Member Lewis Larsen April 13, 2017 18:07 Ultralow energy neutron reactions (LENRs) represent new early-stage innovation in nuclear power. Unlike few-body fission and fusion processes, LENRs heavily utilize the weak interaction and many-body collective quantum effects in condensed matter. Importantly, LENRs are vastly safer and less costly vs. fission or D+T fusion and can scale downward to enable small portable systems as well as upward for stationary power generation. Moreover, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toyota, Nissan, and Renault (indirectly via Renault-Nissan Alliance) — that altogether account for a sizeable percentage of global motor vehicle production — are presently involved in R&D programs aimed at developing LENR technology for power generation. Japanese government is also now funding some of this R&D effort via NEDO. One can only conclude that, even though these companies are unwilling to admit it publicly, their long-term goal must be to replace the internal combustion engine; see public PowerPoint on SlideShare: https://www.slideshare.net/lewisglarsen/lattice-energy-llc-lenr-technologys-compelling-value-proposition-for-oil-and-gas-companies-april-12-2017 -2  |   -   Share         Hide Replies ∧ The Energy Collective Columns More coming soon...

That tally more than doubled the prior 2009 record of $53.2 million for President Barack Obama's first inauguration, which had topped the previous 2005 record of $42.3 million for President George W. Bush, government records showed. The biggest donor by far to Trump's inauguration was Sheldon Adelson, casino magnate and founder of Las Vegas Sands Corp <LVS.N>. He gave $5 million, according to the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee's filing with the Federal Election Commission. Adelson declined comment. Many of the companies that donated to Trump, a Republican, have significant matters pending before the U.S. government or have been invited to White House events. Many of the companies which made donations to the 2017 event also donated to Obama's prior inauguration. For example, aerospace and defence groups Boeing Co <BA.N> and Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N> each donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund, the filing said. Boeing had donated $1 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to the OpenSecrets website run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Money donated to the Trump inaugural committee falls into two categories, said Larry Sabato, political analyst at the University of Virginia. "It's either make-up money or it's a continuation of support by people who are invested in Trump. You don't give this kind of money to get a few tickets to inaugural balls," he said. Trump publicly criticized both Boeing and Lockheed Martin before his inauguration. In Twitter messages he said costs on Boeing's new Air Force One plane were "out of control" and urged the federal government to "Cancel order!" Trump in December sent a Twitter message saying the cost of Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jet was also "out of control." White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that inaugurations have "pretty much been a nonpartisan activity ... This is a time-honoured tradition, and I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural." Financial services companies and executives were among the $1-million donors to Trump's big festivities, including Charles Schwab Corp <SCHW.N>, Bank of America Corp <BAC.N>, financier Henry Kravis and Cantor Fitzgerald Chairman Howard Lutnick. Their industry is eager for Trump to roll back regulatory reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Coal and oil companies were also prominent donors. Clifford Forrest, owner of the Rosebud Mining Co, gave $1 million. AT&T <T.N> gave nearly $2.1 million in cash and services. It is seeking approval from the Trump administration to acquire Time Warner Inc <TWX.N>. AT&T donated $4.6 million to the 2013 Obama inauguration, according to OpenSecrets. "For many years, AT&T has contributed to our nation's presidential inaugural celebrations," said AT&T spokesman Mike Balmoris. Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Kravis declined comment.

(Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Boeing honors top suppliers, three are from Washington Dan Catchpole Wed Apr 19th, 2017 3:51pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Three Washington-based companies were among 13 recipients of Boeing’s 2016 Supplier of the Year awards this month. The companies beat out thousands of competitors for top honors from the aerospace giant. Last year, the Boeing Co. spent nearly $60 billion for parts and services from more than 13,000 vendors in all 50 states and 48 countries. Boeing’s success depends on having the “best team, and our supply chain is absolutely vital to those efforts,” the company’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said in announcing the winners. Orion Industries won the Supplier of the Year award in the community engagement category. Orion is a supplier with a social mission. The non-profit organization aims to help people who often struggle to find long-term jobs. Working with the state, Orion seeks to get clients away from relying on jobs that are often short term and pay low wages. The non-profit provides training and other services to help clients launch higher paying and more stable careers, such as machining and manufacturing for the aerospace industry. Orion bids for work like any other supplier. It provides parts for every Boeing commercial jet. It has plants in Auburn and Mukilteo. Boeing honored Orion for making “strategic investments, engagements and advocacy to strengthen the communities where we live and work.” It is Orion’s third Supplier of the Year award. It won the outside manufacturing category in 2011 and corporate citizenship in 2015. Seattle-based Hoffman Construction Co. won the safety category. Hoffman built two new sprawling factory buildings at Boeing’s Everett plant. Both buildings are tied to Boeing’s new 777X jetliner. One is the Composite Wing Center, where Boeing is already making early production parts of the new jetliner’s advanced technology wing. The other houses Boeing’s new, highly-automated system for assembling fuselages for the 777 and 777X programs. GMN Aerospace, also based in Seattle, received the award for the alliance category. The company helps Boeing succeed by “sharing risk and through long-term relationships that support and advance Boeing’s strategic objectives,” Boeing said. The other category winners were: Environment: Nabtesco Corp., Gifu, Japan Collaboration: NIPPI Corp., Yokohama, Japan Support and Services: Victory Solutions, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama Production and Design: The EnCore Group, Huntington Beach, California Outstanding Performance: AVIC Xi’an Aircraft Industry (Group) Co., Xi’an, China Global Supplier Diversity: Gary Jet Center, Gary, Indiana Pathfinder: American Semiconductor, Boise, Idaho Technology: Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Canberra, Australia Advantage: AT&T, Dallas, Texas Innovation: University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, Rotherham, United Kingdom   Most Read All-out brawl follows after woman tells children to behave LAKE STEVENS — A brawl at the Lake Stevens Buzz Inn last… Apr 19th, 2017 by Rikki King Marysville’s Qwuloolt trail opens this weekend MARYSVILLE — At 10 a.m. Saturday, Marysville’s waterfront will grow from 900… Apr 19th, 2017 by Chris Winters Possible sale of Longfellow building moves forward EVERETT — A plan to sell the historic Longfellow school building to… Apr 19th, 2017 by Chris Winters Chronic Snohomish County cat-hoarder is arrested in Oregon WARRENTON, Ore. — A psychologist predicted last year that Kathryn St. Clare… Apr 20th, 2017 by Diana Hefley Man dies in Monroe while working under parked van MONROE — A 20-year-old Sultan man died Tuesday night when his van… Apr 19th, 2017 by Herald Staff © 2017, Everett Herald and Sound Publishing, Inc.

Calgary-headquartered WestJet aims to kick off the service late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing Co 737-800s planes. Bob Cummings, WestJet's executive vice president, commercial, told Reuters the new offering would feature an "a la carte model" of a base fare plus specific fees for services like checked baggage, only taken one step further. While other low-cost carriers have failed in Canada, WestJet's strategy would work by winning market share from competitors such as Rouge and Sunwing Airlines while cannibalizing some of its own traffic, Cummings said. "Between taking share from others and, quite frankly, taking some share from us, the math makes sense." Cummings declined to give specifics about the new fares, but said the cost structure would not be comparable to the deeply discounted fares offered by European ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryan Air. "We are not likely to be at the Ryan Air end of the spectrum," he said in a phone interview. WestJet, which started life as a low-cost airline, has added premium services in a bid to increase revenue, but is planning the ultra-low-cost structure to service the other end. In planning the new service, Cummings said WestJet considered both the comparatively high-cost structure of operating flights in Canada and examples from abroad, including low-cost Australian carrier Tigerair Australia, which is operated by Virgin Australia Holdings, and Jetstar by Qantas Airways. Consumer advocates have long complained that limited competition, high fares and airport fees make Canada a comparatively expensive country for air travel. Canada in November lifted foreign investment limits for Canadian airlines to 49 percent from 25 percent, a change spurring competition and lower fares by encouraging the launch of low-cost airlines. "We're trying to create a climate where passengers are offered lower costs and greater choice," Transport Minister Marc Garneau said by phone following WestJet's announcement. A spokesman for Air Canada was not available for comment. Cummings said the new carrier would focus on domestic and sun destinations served by WestJet's B737s. The new carrier appears to be avoiding short-haul domestic routes. "As you travel further, the percentage of taxes and fees becomes less of a burden," Cummings said. "We have a big country here."

It is one of the newest airplanes, as this Dreamliner was built in August of 2016 and has been in operation since October 2016. Who could be travelling on board this imposing plane? As Bertalan Havasi, Head of the Press Office of the Prime Minister, told kormany.hu, on Monday in Hungary’s Parliament Building Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met the Chairwoman of Vietnam’s National Assembly, H.E. Nguyễn Thị Kim Ngân, primarily to discuss economic issues; most likely, she arrived in Hungary aboard the Dreamliner. Why is this plane so interesting? It is a brand new type of Boeing. “The industry-leading technology of the 787 Dreamliner is creating remarkable opportunities for airlines around the world and dramatically improving the air travel experience. We call it the Dreamliner effect.

San Francisco-based Virgin America, a subsidiary of Seattle-based Alaska Air Group, is leasing the A321neo from GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). It took delivery of the aircraft, powered by CFM International LEAP-1A engines, at an April 20 ceremony in Hamburg. Virgin America president Peter Hunt said the A321neo “will allow us to further reduce our unit costs and enable us to further reduce our carbon emissions.” The A321neo joins Virgin America’s fleet of 53 A320ceos and 10 A319ceos. Configured with 184 seats, the A321neo is expected to enter service May 31 on Virgin America’s San Francisco-Washington National transcontinental route. Virgin America was acquired by Alaska Air Group in December 2016 and is in the process of being merged with Alaska Airlines. The Virgin America brand is slated to be retired in 2019. Virgin America has 10 A321neos on order, all to be leased from GECAS. The airline will take delivery of five A321neos this year, according to Alaska Air Group CFO Brandon Pedersen. Virgin America’s A321neo arrives as Alaska, which operates an all-Boeing 737 mainline fleet, is undertaking a review to determine whether it will continue to operate Virgin America’s A320 family fleet long term alongside its 737 fleet. Pedersen recently told ATW that Alaska is in talks with GECAS regarding the five A321neos Virgin America is expected to receive next year. “We’re working with the lessor on what the right answer is for those airplanes,” he said. “Our reluctance is to bring more Airbus airplanes in on a long-term lease arrangement before we make a long-term fleet decision.” “We’ll make a decision by the end of 2017” on whether to operate a dual mainline fleet long term, Alaska Air Group CEO Brad Tilden told ATW, adding, “I think we’re the only airline in the world that has ‘proudly all-Boeing’ on the nose of every single [Alaska Airlines] airplane. My dad was a Boeing guy, he was there for 32 years. We could not be more proud of our relationship with Boeing. Airbus is a good manufacturer. A320s are good airplanes. What we need to do now is just take our time, cool our jets, spend some time and make the best decision for the long-term future of the company. To be really clear, it’s not Boeing vs. Airbus. That’s not the decision we’re going to make. The decision we’re going to make is whether we operate one fleet type or two fleet types.” Regardless, Pedersen said Alaska, which has 37 737 MAX aircraft on order, will likely operate most of Virgin America’s A320 family fleet until 2023-2024, when most of the leases on Virgin America’s aircraft expire—though the aircraft will be retrofitted with a standard Alaska Airlines interior by mid-2019. The fate of a Virgin America order on the books for 30 A320neos to be delivered from 2020 to 2022 “is entirely dependent on what we decide this year” regarding the long-term fleet, Pedersen said. If those 30 A320neos are canceled, Alaska would likely add more 737 MAXs to its order book. “To the extent that we decide to go a different route on those 30 Airbuses, we’ll have to flex the Boeing order,” Pedersen said.

The plane was part of the Flying Tigers Line, a cargo carrier that started doing business in Charlotte in 1978. “From now on, you can put ‘International’ into the airport’s name,” said Flying Tigers’ regional manager at the time. Read on to learn how the carrier came to be, then click through the slideshow for some great aircraft photos. (The airline was bought by Federal Express in 1988.) + + + + + + + March 4, 1978 Tigers To Begin Serving City Tuesday By Don Bedwell, Observer Staff Writer An idea born high above a war-torn Asia during World War II comes to Charlotte shortly after midnight Tuesday morning with the first arrival of a Flying Tigers Line cargo jet. California-based “Tigers,” grown into the nation’s largest all-cargo airline, plans to offer inbound and outbound service twice daily, five days a week. Its stretched DC8s will link Charlotte shippers and receivers with Chicago and from there to the rest of a cargo network that stretches from the East Coast all the way back to Asia, where the idea of an all-cargo carrier was conceived by Robert W. Prescott. Prescott, now the company’s president, piloted P40s for the American Volunteer Group, the so-called Flying Tigers whose menacingly painted fighter planes first challenged Japanese pilots in the Asian theater. Many of the AVG pilots later moved to flying cargo transports over the Burma-India “Hump” of providing fighter escort for that cargo supply line. It was over the Hump that Prescott decided he wanted to start his own cargo line, a company the 32-year-old ace launched in June 1945 with surplus Budd Conestoga transports. Flying Tigers, one of the few lines to survive of more than 300 begun after the war, today occupies a $9 million base at Los Angeles International Airport. It claims the largest all-cargo fleet in the Free World, 16 stretched DC8s and three jumbo Boeing 747s. Three more 747s are to join the fleet this year. The company links cities ranging from New York and Boston in the East to Cleveland, Detroit and Chicago in the Midwest and on to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle in the West. Its routes also stretch across the Pacific to Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Phillipines. The door was opened to new route authority when President Carter signed into law a bill giving cargo carriers far greater leeway in introducing new service, weakening the Civil Aeronautics Board’s right to deny such applications. Washington sources credit Flying Tigers lobbyists with leading the successful effort to break the industry free from the CAB’s sometimes ponderous regulator bureaucracy. Flying Tigers and other cargo carriers, for instance, had sought for years to introduce service to Charlotte. But the board had refused to act on those petitions, even after passenger airlines withdrew their all-cargo flights during the fuel crisis. (Passenger airlines continue to offer cargo space in the bellies of their jets. Some forwarders have tried to fill the gap in nocturnal freight service by chartering their own transports.) Another all-cargo airline that had sought Charlotte authority for years, Airlift International, said Friday it has decided to operate into Greensboro instead. Executives of the Miami-based carrier said it probably would begin its Greensboro operations in late summer or fall. “Flying Tigers jet lands in Charlotte. Flying Tigers, which began service here this spring, is one of the companies involved in air freight terminal talks.” 1978 The Charlotte Observer “Initial Flight: This Flying Tigers jet was the first Boeing 747 ever to make a scheduled landing at the then - Douglas Municipal Airport. The flight from Zurich, Switzerland, which was Charlotte's first regular international fight, was on April 4, 1981.” Davie Hinshaw The Charlotte Observer Flying Tigers aircraft takes on cargo in 1980. The Charlotte Observer “The first B-747 Jumbo Jet ever to make a scheduled landing at Douglas Municipal Airport” was a Flying Tigers cargo plane. April, 1981 Davie Hinshaw The Charlotte Observer “The first B-747 Jumbo Jet ever to make a scheduled landing at Douglas Municipal Airport seems to be opening wide and saying ‘aaah’ as crews prepare to unload its 200,000-pound cargo hold. The Flying Tigers’ non-stop flight from Zurich, Switzerland - the city's first regular international flight - arrived here last night. The weekly cargo flight, linking the Carolinas with Europe, is scheduled to arrive here each Sunday at 10:25 p.m.” April, 1981 Davie Hinshaw The Charlotte Observer 1 of 5 LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 7 months ago Park n Shop letters come down 2:18 7 months ago Park n Shop letters come down 0:47 44 minutes ago Charlotte Checker 4, Chicago Wolves 0 1:13 7 hours ago Chris Mumma on Mark Carver's bid for new trial View More Video Retro Charlotte CMPD’s Lost and Found: a ham and a tombstone Cleveland County’s Bigfoot Jr. 1935: Southern Railway train smashes into hotel Murder at the Alamo Plaza Motel Dilworth homes, then and now Retro Charlotte Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-edition Newsletters RSS Feeds Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store News in Education Published Corrections Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Get News Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping CLT Digital More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Scott GarrettScott GarrettBusiness groups silent on Trump's Ex-Im nominee Trump should work with Congress to kill the Export-Import Bank THE MEMO: Has Trump gone Washington? MORE.  The New Jersey Republican voted to close the bank while in Congress, raising questions about how he would run the agency, which has been hobbled by partisan bickering.  The 57-year-old Garrett, who failed to win reelection in November after seven terms on Capitol Hill, is a founder of the House Freedom Caucus and has called the Ex-Im Bank "crony capitalism." “For the sake of the American taxpayer and the preservation of the free enterprise system, Congress should put the Export-Import Bank out of business,” he said in a House floor speech in October 2015, around the time he voted against a reauthorization of the bank.  The Ex-Im Bank lends money to foreign buyers to promote U.S. exports, with Boeing and General Electric the two biggest beneficiaries of the financing.  Garrett isn’t the first Trump nominee to have previously backed eliminating the agency he was chosen to lead, but the sequence of events that led to his nomination is unusual.  Trump opposed the Ex-Im Bank during the campaign but abruptly shifted his stance last week, saying the bank helps small businesses. “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing?’” the president said of the bank. “But actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” Two days after that comment was published by The Wall Street Journal, Trump nominated Garrett to lead the Ex-Im Bank.  While in Congress, Garrett was never shy about taking his own path. In addition to opposing the Ex-Im Bank, he voted against another term for John BoehnerJohn BoehnerK Street bouncing back under Trump Business groups silent on Trump's Ex-Im nominee Chaffetz won't run for reelection MORE (R-Ohio) as Speaker in 2015 and argued for new House leadership. If confirmed as Ex-Im Bank president, Garrett would serve a four-year term. Most of the industry groups and corporate giants that support the bank have yet to comment on Garrett’s selection. The silence is unusual, as many of the groups routinely put out statements on Trump’s staffing selections. The Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), a longtime supporter of the Ex-Im Bank, praised Trump’s statement in support of the bank but didn’t specifically discuss Garrett’s nomination. “The aerospace and defense industry is grateful for President Trump’s support to level the playing field for U.S. companies against foreign government export financing and let American products compete on their merits,” said Dave Melcher, AIA's president and CEO.   “We look forward to working with the administration and Congress to realize our industry’s full potential to grow American exports and create thousands of high-skill, high wage American jobs,” Melcher said in the statement.   Conservative opponents of Ex-Im, meanwhile, have praised Trump’s choice while expressing some trepidation.   Doug Sachtleben, a spokesman for Club for Growth, said that Garrett's nomination is a signal that the White House understands the need for reforms at the bank. “Boeing and GE may have succeeded in keeping Ex-Im alive, but Scott Garrett’s nomination indicates that the Trump administration is well aware of the many problems that have plagued the agency, and wants someone in charge who won’t toleration corruption,” Sachtleben told The Hill.  “We’re interested in seeing what reforms a true economic conservative proposes for Ex-Im, but not optimistic that its core mission of picking winners and losers can be fundamentally changed,” he said.              In addition to Garrett, Trump on Friday said he would nominate former Republican Rep. Spencer BachusSpencer BachusBusiness groups silent on Trump's Ex-Im nominee Trump picks critic of Ex-Im Bank to lead it Spencer Bachus: True leadership MORE (Ala.) for a seat on the Ex-Im Bank board. The Bachus nomination is critical, as the bank’s five-person board needs three members to have a quorum. Without a quorum, the bank cannot approve deals worth more than $10 million. There are about $30 billion worth of deals stuck in the pipeline at the Ex-Im Bank, which has been without a quorum since 2015. A quorum is also needed to implement a series of reforms that Congress approved in December 2015.   House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), who has led efforts to shut down the Ex-Im Bank, expressed support for the nominations of Garrett and Bachus (Ala.), saying they would “steer the institution towards reform.” “Having worked with both of these gentlemen closely on the Financial Services Committee, I am hopeful they will safeguard taxpayer dollars and put an end to the bank's well-documented management failures,” Hensarling said. “With Ex-Im so captured by special interests, the president was right to choose principled leaders like these to safeguard the agency against further mission creep, fraud, waste and abuse,” he said. Democrats who back Ex-Im, meanwhile, have expressed concern about Garrett’s nomination. Sen. Heidi HeitkampHeidi HeitkampBusiness groups silent on Trump's Ex-Im nominee Sanders supporter to run against red-state Democrat GOP lays out regulatory reform wish list MORE (D-N.D.), a leading proponent of the bank who has worked across the aisle on Ex-Im Bank legislation, called Trump’s nominations a “positive step.”  “While I have reservations about [Trump’s] nominations and believe they need to be thoroughly vetted, this is a positive step toward helping the bank do its job of delivering funds back to the taxpayers while supporting American businesses and workers,” Heitkamp said in a statement.  But House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (Md.), who has previously led bipartisan efforts to keep the bank alive, called on the Senate to reject Garrett outright. “Once again, President Trump has selected a nominee to lead an agency that individual believes should not exist and has tried to destroy,” Hoyer said. “If former Rep. Garrett is confirmed to lead the Bank, it would be the ultimate act of sabotage.” Tags Spencer Bachus Heidi Heitkamp Scott Garrett John Boehner Boehner   View the discussion thread.

Bigger image and details here (PDF) 21 Apr 2017 at 04:20, Simon Sharwood Australian scientists have released a new analysis of debris from missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and again asserted that the search for the Boeing 777 was conducted in the wrong place. Scientists from Australia's Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) penned the new report, The search for MH370 and ocean surface drift – Part II (PDF) which explores how a part of MH370's wing called a “flaperon” came to wash up on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The search zone picked by analysis of seven brief handshakes from MH370's satellite transponders does not have currents and winds that suggest the flaperon could have washed up in Reunion. Later analysis of the satellite handshakes and drift patterns led to a new theory that the plane came down hard and fast, rather than glided into the ocean, and that the search zone should therefore be moved north. That theory was ratified by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which has carriage of the search under Australia's maritime search obligations. The ATSB therefore recommended searching an extra 25,000km2 of ocean. But that recommendation was ignored and the search “suspended” in January 2017. The new report is based on tests using an actual 777 flaperon that the ATSB obtained, trimmed to match the damage found on the unit found in Reunion, and then used in a number of flotation tests. Those tests showed “fairly strong evidence” that the modified flaperon “drifts at a non-zero angle to the wind (between 0 and 30° left), in broad agreement with numerical predictions (18° or 28° depending on orientation) … and in contrast with earlier testing of replica flaperons.” Combining the observed drift patterns and previous models lead the authors to suggest their work is “very consistent with the July 2015 arrival time of the flaperon at La Reunion.” The authors therefore back their previous estimates that the search for MH370 should have been conducted to the north of the designated search area, especially near 35°S. Families of those who disappeared along with MH370 remain keen to learn of their loved ones' fate. Boeing, too, wants to know what caused the plane to vanish in case the 777 has a problem. Yet the search was called off in part because funding had run out. Remember, however, that the search was “suspended”, not cancelled outright. Indeed, the joint Australian/Malaysian/Chinese Communiqué announcing the suspension ended by saying “We remain hopeful that new information will come to light and that at some point in the future the aircraft will be located.” Whether this new report is new enough to spark a renewed search remains to be seen. Don't hold your breath, because this new report doesn't offer a completely new theory. The authors also hedge a little, saying “In summary, our conclusions with respect to the location of the aircraft are unchanged. The only thing that our recent work changes is our confidence in the accuracy of the estimated location”. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Australia mh370 More from The Register MH370 hunters call for new search of extra 25,000km2 Drift experiments and new modelling suggests we've been looking in the wrong places 53 Comments Search for MH370 called off after new theory about resting place is ruled out Australia, Malaysia and China say no new information on plane's location has been found 34 Comments New MH370 handshake and wing debris analysis suggests rapid descent If plane came down fast and steep, might it have crashed to the North of the search zone? 38 Comments Aviation regulator flies in face of UK.gov ban, says electronics should be stowed in cabin.

And while the space agency is hoping to induct U.S.-made spacecraft into service, the manufacturers need to build them with some very specific safety features. SpaceX and Boeing are both working on their own spacecraft — Crew Dragon and CST-100 Starliner respectively — for crewed flight. And according to NASA, the vehicles would need to be capable of both serving as an emergency shelter, as well as a quick getaway “lifeboat.” Kathy Lueders, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, said in a statement Thursday: “Some systems will take longer to bring online, but the idea is to have spacecraft that astronauts can get into quickly for survival and then use to pull away from the station and come home if that is needed. Defining exactly what that means, and what the companies can do to make it real was the hard part. That's why we took a teamwork approach from the start and why we've treated this as a partnership.” An illustration to show NASA's safety requirements from private commercial crewed spacecraft, manufactured by Boeing and SpaceX. Photo: NASA There hasn’t been a single instance yet on the ISS that has required emergency protocol of this nature to kick in, but when you are that far away from the closest hospital, it helps to be prepared. For example, an electrical issue or an ammonia leak could necessitate astronauts stay inside the commercial spacecraft while they work on fixing the problem. And in the event a bigger problem requires emergency evacuation, the spacecraft should be able to depart quickly. In discussion with designers from SpaceX and Boeing, NASA said the spacecraft must be capable of being “powered on quickly while docked to the station, even if it has been dormant for weeks or a couple of months. From air circulation fans to life support systems to thrusters, the spacecraft's systems will be designed to engage in minutes,” according to the statement.

Woodville-raised Mitchell has been at the world's biggest long-haul carrier for nearly 15 years. The ex-RNZAF Skyhawk pilot said the sessions in Auckland on April 28 and Christchurch on April 30 weren't formal recruiting days but were more about "spreading the word and sharing the information". Worldwide there is a shortage pilots and the New Zealand Airline Pilots Association says it is concerned New Zealand's own airlines are not investing enough in the ongoing training of local pilots. Mitchell said Kiwi pilots were sought after. ''We're looking for as many pilots as we can get at the moment - particularly given the level in which New Zealand-based training is held in high regard." Emirates pilots typically work 85 hours a month. At entry level a first officer is paid up to 44,450 Dirham ($17,031) a month including a housing allowance. That can be tax free depending on accounting arrangements. A captain with 7000 hours command time is hired on 58,770 Dirham a month, including an accommodation allowance. Staff also get other benefits, including insurance and free travel. Mitchell said Emirates flies to 155 destination in 83 countries and its 4227 pilots were busy. Continued below. Related Content Lessons from the United Airlines debacle Emirates cuts US flights, blaming Trump administration curbs Video Watch: Emirates celebrates first year connecting Dubai and Auckland ''It's a bit like the old Navy adverts - join Emirates and you'll see the world." Pilots would be flying the biggest passenger plane in the world, the Airbus A380 or Boeing 777s, ''which is no slug either". While average flying times are about six hours, the airline flies some of the longest routes in the world - up to 17 hours - and pilots can bid for the sectors that they want to do. From a pilot's satisfaction point of view it's horses for courses. Some don't adjust to different time zones and others only like ultra long haul. It really is a personal thing. ''They put in preferences to try and massage their rosters for them and the company - even the most junior pilot gets the chance to be at the top end of the bidding priority," he said. The airline was not targeting any particular group and was now able to hire those with a multi engine turbo prop background as well multi engine jets meaning some Air New Zealand link pilots would be eligible if they had sufficient hours. ''We've had great success with turbo prop pilots - those who fly the smaller aircraft often have more challenging roles flying lower altitudes close to icing levels and into smaller airports with limited facilities ." Pilots of 20 tonne aircraft with 2000 hours' experience would be eligible and those who had flown 10 tonne to 20 tonne planes needed 3000 hours. ''Its harder to get pilots - particularly experienced pilots - we have high standards and that's what we're after, the selection process is no cakewalk - Air New Zealand and all the good airlines do it." Trainees work in flight simulators then go out on the line with a training captain and build up their experience with up to 30 to 40 sectors of line flying, often more for those without jet experience. Emirates is also looking for freighter pilots, although the pay is lower they work on a 28-day on and 13 day off roster and on flights that take them to an even greater range of destinations than those flying passenger jets. Mitchell's father was an airman attached to the RAF. ''We grew up with this legend in our house." Mitchell spent 10 years with the RNZAF flying in its aerobatics squad and Skyhawks. He didn't follow the standard route from the Air Force into Air New Zealand. ''Around about that time they decided the Skyhawk pilots were a bit too much trouble and didn't have the right sort of background with too many bullets and bombs and not enough of getting on with people. So guys like me had to go abroad and get their experience." He taught in Saudi Arabia's air force for four years before flying for British Midlands. ''With 9/11 things got a bit tough and we decided to seek a bit of job security in the Middle East. It may seem a bit paradoxical that you would go to the Middle East for job security but from an airline industry perspective it is one of the best places to get a job as a pilot." He joined Emirates as a first officer in the A330, went on to be captain of A340s and in 2008 was appointed chief flying instructor for those aircraft. He's recently upguaged to A380s which he flies regularly - twice a month on average - together with his head office job in Dubai where nearly all Emirates' staff are based. Emirates is competing in a tough market for pilots. By Boeing's calculations there will be 617,000 new pilots needed within the next 20 years. The New Zealand Air Line Pilots Association says together with government and industry financial barriers must be lowered to entry in order to retain New Zealand's best talent. "Global demand for pilots are at an all time high and we must preserve New Zealand's expertise by ensuring working terms and conditions in New Zealand are attractive enough to provide a secure career path, thus delivering a safe and experienced piloting workforce in New Zealand," said the association's president Tim Robinson. - NZ Herald Read more by Grant Bradley Email Grant Bradley Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Calgary-headquartered WestJet aims to kick off the service late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing Co <BA.N> 737-800s planes. Bob Cummings, WestJet’s executive vice president, commercial, told Reuters the new offering would feature an “a la carte model” of a base fare plus specific fees for services like checked baggage, only taken one step further. While other low-cost carriers have failed in Canada, WestJet’s strategy would work by winning market share from competitors such as Rouge and Sunwing Airlines while cannibalizing some of its own traffic, Cummings said. “Between taking share from others and, quite frankly, taking some share from us, the math makes sense.” Cummings declined to give specifics about the new fares, but said the cost structure would not be comparable to the deeply discounted fares offered by European ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryan Air <RYA.I>. “We are not likely to be at the Ryan Air end of the spectrum,” he said in a phone interview. WestJet, which started life as a low-cost airline, has added premium services in a bid to increase revenue, but is planning the ultra-low-cost structure to service the other end. In planning the new service, Cummings said WestJet considered both the comparatively high-cost structure of operating flights in Canada and examples from abroad, including low-cost Australian carrier Tigerair Australia, which is operated by Virgin Australia Holdings <VAH.AX>, and Jetstar by Qantas Airways <QAN.AX>. Consumer advocates have long complained that limited competition, high fares and airport fees make Canada a comparatively expensive country for air travel. Canada in November lifted foreign investment limits for Canadian airlines to 49 percent from 25 percent, a change spurring competition and lower fares by encouraging the launch of low-cost airlines. “We’re trying to create a climate where passengers are offered lower costs and greater choice,” Transport Minister Marc Garneau said by phone following WestJet’s announcement. A spokesman for Air Canada was not available for comment. Cummings said the new carrier would focus on domestic and sun destinations served by WestJet’s B737s. The new carrier appears to be avoiding short-haul domestic routes. “As you travel further, the percentage of taxes and fees becomes less of a burden,” Cummings said. “We have a big country here.” (Reporting by Allison Lampert; Additional reporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Will Dunham and Leslie Adler) Share this article: euronews provides breaking news articles from reuters as a service to its readers, but does not edit the articles it publishes.

Live Watch Interest groups donated to Trump's record-breaking inauguration fund By MARIAM KHAN Close Follow on Twitter More from Mariam Apr 20, 2017, 5:29 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star PlayGetty Images WATCH Inauguration of Brand New Administration 0 Shares Email A record-breaking $107 million poured in for President Trump’s inauguration celebration from corporate giants, business titans and a roster of NFL owners, raising new questions about the influence of money in politics. On Tuesday, the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC), an organization appointed by the President-elect to plan and coordinate all inauguration activities, filed a 510-page report with the Federal Election Committee (FEC) to disclose that they had raised a staggering $106.7 million in donations -- the most ever raised for a president’s inauguration. In a statement, the inaugural committee said Trump's inauguration "was one of the most accessible and affordable inaugurations for the public in recent history." The release of the contribution records reveals that Trump’s top inaugural donors included business leaders and corporations, including several from the financial, energy, and technology sector that have business dealings with the U.S. government. "This is the complete opposite of what candidate Trump campaigned on, where he attacked these huge corporations, made clear they could buy politicians because he had done so, and is the political equivalent of overflowing the swamp not draining it," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy21, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that works on money in politics and government reform issues. He added that the report shows that Trump appears to have raised "influence money," despite his campaign promises to avoid special interests. The White House did not immediately return ABC News' request for comment Businesses that donated at least $1 million included Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Bank of America. Other financial companies like JPMorgan Chase and American Financial Group gave $500,000 each. Energy companies also contributed heavily. Chevron Products, Exxon and Citgo each donated more than $500,000. The owners of NFL teams the New England Patriots, the Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams, Houston Texans and the Washington Redskins all wrote $1 million checks for Trump’s inauguration. Trump’s largest donor was gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. The FEC requires reporting of individual donations, in money or items, with a value of $200 or more made to inaugural committees. However, where the money was spent and how it was used is still a mystery since the FEC does not require that information to be reported. The big-money donations appear to counter Trump's own statements. In August of last year, Trump railed against big-money donors who seek to curry favor with elected politicians. "Look, I know the people that want something. I’ve been doing this all my life. I’ve been a very big contributor to many, many people on all sides for many, many years," Trump stated on CBS’s "Face the Nation." "I don’t want lobbyists. I don’t want special interests.” According to a brochure obtained by the Center For Public Integrity last year, those who donated more than $1 million received exclusive access to Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership; an invite to an "intimate dinner" with Vice President Mike Pence and Mrs. Pence and tickets to other exclusive events with appearances by the First Family. Trump’s inaugural committee raised nearly double the $53 million President Obama’s inaugural committee raised in 2009. "The amount of funds raised for the inaugural celebration allowed the President to give the American people, those both at home and visiting Washington, a chance to experience the incredible moment in our democracy where we witness the peaceful transition of power, a cornerstone of American democracy," said PIC Chairman Tom Barrack in a press release Tuesday. On Wednesday during the White House press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer called record-smashing donating “nonpartisan activity.” "I think a lot of Americans and companies and entities are proud to support the inaugural," he said. "And I think that you’ve seen that over time, the people who have been -- there are a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." The committee said that any leftover money will be donated to charities to be decided upon and announced at a later date. Wertheimer said the undisclosed amount of funds could be a "pot of secret money for President Trump to play with," if the total is taxed. "There are no rules that apply to what can happen to this money," Wertheimer said.

He held his talk in Kenosha, Wisconsin, at Snap-on Tools, a firm that buys Chinese and hires Chinese, Argentinian, Brazilian, and Swedish. Seventy per cent of Snap-on’s sales are in the U.S., but many of its plants are in other countries. There is nothing wrong with Snap-on putting its factories overseas, it just makes it an odd place to hold a Buy American announcement. It’s reminiscent of President Trump’s celebration of jobs at a Boeing plant while the company was laying off workers. The executive order itself is even more puzzling. It’s not clear what, if anything, it will change. The order states that “it shall be the policy of the executive branch to maximize, consistent with law . . . the use of goods, products, and materials produced in the United States” without setting any measurable definition of “maximize.” This is followed by a confusing timeline—in sixty days, the Secretary of Commerce will lead a team, advised by the Secretary of State and others, that will issue guidance. Then, within a hundred and fifty days, the heads of agencies will explain what they are doing in keeping with that guidance. Sometime in mid-September, we will (or we won’t) hear what the hundreds of agencies in the federal government are doing to meet a confusing mandate, with no obvious targets, that will (or won’t) mean that more Americans have jobs. Snap-on Tools is actually a good example of why Buy American is a fairly meaningless phrase. It is no easy feat to find a product manufactured entirely of material from the U.S., produced by people in the U.S., using tools made in the U.S. In this sense, the executive order recognizes that no blanket order to buy only American will work. The products we buy are made of raw materials transformed into intermediate goods that are then assembled into a finished product. It’s not possible, nor even advisable, to insure that an entire production chain will occur in one country. So a politician who wants to increase the percentage of American-made content in the products that are sold here needs to dig deeper. How will the U.S.-made content of a good be defined? Will it be by weight, by dollar value, by labor hours involved? Each metric would have different findings. A car’s bulk, for example, is primarily made up of steel, aluminum, and glass produced by huge machines with not much labor. However, some of the smaller, fussier bits are made by hand in the U.S. Gas tanks, for example, because of strict emissions laws, are surprisingly complex and require a lot of engineering and manual assembly and are often made in the U.S. A gas tank might be relatively cheap and light, but for American workers it’s worth a lot more than many tons of steel. Very quickly, any discussion of the U.S.-made content of any product will turn to the value of intellectual versus physical content. The U.S. does very well in the intellectual work—the engineering, industrial design, marketing, and distribution—that goes into creating, manufacturing, and selling products. Our Chinese-made iPhones and apparel return much higher profit margins to American designers than to Chinese manufacturers. Many firms now run their design, marketing, and engineering work in the U.S. and move the manufacturing abroad. This makes perfect economic sense, but it adds to the core challenge of the U.S. economy: there are increasing opportunities for people with the kinds of education and skill that lead to new ideas, but there are diminished opportunities for those who turn those ideas into physical products. Trump focussed on two types of jobs in his executive order: U.S. manufacturing jobs and computer professionals. It was an odd pairing, but both fell, in his logic, under the broad umbrella of increasing work for Americans. The order calls for a review of America’s H-1B visa program, under which eighty-five thousand foreigners, each year—most of them computer professionals of one sort or another—are permitted to work in the U.S. The question of H-1B visas has rhetorical importance far beyond its actual economic relevance. The unemployment rate for computer and mathematical occupations is, currently, 2.1 per cent. This is what economists consider full employment, meaning that pretty much everyone who wants a job has a job or is in a brief hiatus between positions. The number of jobs in those fields is growing fast—by about twelve per cent a year—and the number of qualified workers is not growing enough to catch up. In short, the plight of computer professionals is on few people’s list of urgent concerns. Yes, there have been rough times in the past, when basic computer-programming work was outsourced to India, Ireland, and Eastern Europe, and Americans with those skills lost work. But, on balance, it is a great time to have a computer-science background. Many American businesses are in the process of transferring their data to the cloud and embracing mobile applications, and we are in the very early stages of the “Internet of Things,” and all these developments require lots of computing expertise. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ten thousand computer professionals start a new job every working day. In this context, the eighty-five thousand foreigners given H-1B visas each year represent little more than statistical noise. Though, of course, the issue was surely chosen not because of statistical analysis but because it offered a shorthand way of saying, “foreigners are stealing your jobs and I am going to stop it.” There is a real problem in the American economy. For much of the twentieth century, there was a wind at the back of working people—a steady increase in jobs, wages, and opportunity for those with basic education and a willingness to put in a hard day’s work. We have shifted from the era of good work for many to the age of the hustle, where those with luck, good connections, education, and ambition can do far better than their grandparents could have dreamt, while those without see their incomes stagnate or fall and face a future filled with doubt. A sober and serious look at the U.S. economy leads, inevitably, to the conclusion that we haven’t cracked this problem yet. In place of serious consideration from the White House, we have absurdist, self-contradicting theatrics. Adam Davidson is a staff writer at The New Yorker.

The newest customers of Vela, a cannabis shop in Sodo, stand in a circle in the corner of the store, eagerly poring over their purchases. "I got the cream," says one. "I got the weed!" says another giddily. It's a special day. These senior citizens are part of a field trip organized by Village Concepts, an assisted-living facility in Gig Harbor. They have previously toured a farm in Skagit Valley, various museums, and a manufacturing plant where Boeing parts are made. Going on tours helps them earn "credits" for a program called Village Concepts University. "The goal," explains Tracy Willis, the director of corporate development at Village Concepts, "is to keep seniors engaged in the greater community, learning about pop culture or current events, so that they don't feel like they're isolated from new information." But this is their first time at a marijuana store. Are they excited to be here? "Excited to be here? We're enchanted," says Maria Scott, 91. "I didn't even know this existed." According to state rules, marijuana growers and retailers must be separate companies. But there is a grow lab right next door to Vela called Field Day, and there is a window in the wall between Vela and Field Day where Vela's customers can see the indoor grow. Scott is gazing with wonder into Field Day's grow room, its windows displaying hydroponic setups for strains like Green Crack and Acapulco Gold. "It's wonderful!" she adds. "We're so old-fashioned, you know," says Marta Knifton, 71. "We just didn't know that things like this went on, and that there are so many different types of marijuana!" If recent trends continue, they won't be the only senior citizens discovering the joys of Jah. A December 2016 research report published by the Society for the Study of Addiction shows that "between the years of 2006–2007 and 2012–2013, the number of people in the age group 65 and older who admit to using cannabis has increased by no less than 250%." And a recent article in the New York Times cited a rising number of nursing and retirement-home residents who are turning to cannabis to relieve their aches and pains. Senior citizens are not just warming up to the idea of cannabis, they're welcoming it in spades, despite the stigma that existed in years past. "I mean, we've always kind of thought of marijuana as a bad drug," says Barbara Krause, 83 (who says she's never tried weed but would "just always have a cocktail or two"). "I lived in Berkeley for a little while, and when I was walking down the street, you could really smell the stuff," adds Scott. "And half of us didn't know what it was; we weren't educated that way. I just knew it was something that we weren't even supposed to smell." The catalyst that sparked these seniors' cannabis curiosity was a viral video about a man with Parkinson's disease, who used CBD for the first time in his life (under a doctor's care). "Our residents watched the video in our activity," explains Willis, "and they saw that his tremors were gone and he could speak again. And they started saying, 'Wait, what? What's this all about?'" For the seniors, learning about CBD was a big deal, says Willis. Finding out that CBD wasn't psychoactive but could help with their symptoms was a game changer. "At this stage of our lives," explains Ilene Cohn, 84, lifting herself out of her chair and into her walker, "we all have pain. So there's nobody here that came with us that is free of pain." "I mean, we need it! We need some help sometimes," says Verna Gregg, 88, who suffered from a stroke a few years ago and also has arthritis. "And it means less drugs, you're taking less medication, it's not a pill that has side effects," says Knifton. "But doctors aren't recommending things like this." "Why did they keep it so quiet!?" Cohn asks. "I think it's about time! Why did they wait so long?" "Yeah, why wait?" Knifton says, shaking her head. "All the kids knew about it!" "But it's okay now!" Scott says. Then she adds enthusiastically, "So now it's our turn!" 1 You might also be interested in these: The Booming World of $100,000 Bongs Who makes them? Who buys them?

We like this definition. The Avionics Maintenance Conference will be held May 1-4, 2017, at the Milwaukee Convention Center/Hilton Milwaukee City Center, in Milwaukee, Wisc. WARRENDALE, Pa. (PRWEB) April 20, 2017 The Avionics Maintenance Conference will be held May 1-4, 2017, at the Milwaukee Convention Center/Hilton Milwaukee City Center, in Milwaukee, Wisc. The event is expected to attract more than 650 technical and management professionals from more than 30 countries, representing 30 airlines, five airframe manufacturers and more than 170 avionics suppliers. The Avionics Maintenance Conference (AMC) is the foremost platform for the avionics and aviation electronics industry to learn, network and source new information, products, technologies and services at one distinctive annual event. The objectives of AMC are to promote reliability and to reduce operating and life cycle costs of air transport avionics by improving maintenance and support techniques through the exchange of technical information. Attendees will:     Keep up-to-date with the latest issues, challenges and discussions in avionics and aviation electronics     Gain insight into technical discussions and approaches for ideas and practical solutions     Meet and network with colleagues, peers and experienced professionals from the avionics and aviation electronics industry     Develop and forge relationships with potential airlines/suppliers/customers     Participate in problem-solving Q&A activities Symposium topics will include: Monday, May 1– 10:30 a.m. Global Aircraft Tracking Speakers:         Chuck Adler, The Boeing Company     Mike Garcia, Aireon Moderator:         Sven Biller, Lufthansa Technik     Jessie Turner, The Boeing Company Chuck Adler, Boeing, will discuss avionics and prime engineer for addressing the Aircraft Tracking mandates. Mike Garcia, Aireon, will address the Space-based ADS-B option/approach. Tuesday, May 2– 3:20 p.m. Chemicals Under Control Speakers:          Rachel Becker, GE Aviation     Nel Verstoep, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Moderator:         Marijan Jozic, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines Chemicals are used in avionics components: sometimes as coating of printed circuit boards, sometimes as heatsink contact layers, sometimes as paint or lubricant, and sometimes are just used for cleaning. Our CMMs are calling out many chemicals which are supposed to be used in the maintenance of avionics components. AMC (Avionics Maintenance Conference) recognizes the importance of chemicals. There are also issues. Therefore, the AMC Steering Committee decided to recognize numerous requests to organize a symposium about chemicals in the avionics environment. Chemistry is very broad area, but our need is to provide a symposium which can inform our audience about the following topics:     Latest regulation in USA, Europe, etc., which is restricting use of known and common chemicals due to environmental legislation (for example: REACH).     How to approach equivalency of chemicals. Sometimes CMMs call out certain chemicals which are not in our stock. We might have other similar chemicals in stock, but can we use them? The equivalent must be REACH compliant too.     Many of our chemicals originate from the automobile industry. Shelf life for the automobile industry is longer than in the aviation industry. How is the aviation industry establishing shelf life?     Many chemicals are delivered in huge packages while we need just a small portion in our yearly consumption. Many times, we have to scrap quantities of chemicals, which pollutes the environment. How do we deal with this?     Avionics engineers sometimes need a quick answer from chemical engineers about equivalency. Sometimes it takes weeks or months to get an answer (which is sometimes not satisfactory). Are there any tips or tricks to speed up the process? Is there a better way to formulate questions for chemical engineers so they can act more efficiently? Wednesday, May 3 – 3:20 p.m. Nuisance Fault Messages Speakers:         Rod Gates, American Airlines     Ron Parpart, Rockwell Collins     Dan Nguyen, The Boeing Company     Sven Biller, Lufthansa Technik Moderator:         Anand Moorthy, American Airlines This topic is considered an important one for most airlines; and it also is one that most larger suppliers and OEMs struggle with. This symposium will see three points of view on the panel:     An airline addressing the impacts: cost, delays, and safety.     A larger supplier offering insight on their causes, why they happen, and why they are so difficult to prevent and eliminate.     OEM(s) discussing the impact of increasingly complex systems comprised of boxes from multiple suppliers, faster data rates, connected aircraft, etc. This symposium might not solve the industry problem with nuisance fault messages, but it could help spread a greater understanding of the causes, effects, and impacts to help us all find a path to improvement. Cost to attend is $600. Members and Corporate Sponsors attend at no charge.

Español On Tuesday, the Federal Electoral Commission reported that Citgo Petroleum, the only remaning subsidiary in the United States of the Venezuelan state-owned oil company Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), donated half a million dollars for the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Citgo, is currently mortgaged as collateral for a loan from Russia. However, it is among 11 companies that donated more than half a million dollars to the committee that was responsible for organizing the Republican candidate’s inauguration ceremony this past January 20th.

The organizing committee for Donald Trump’s inauguration collected USD $106.7 million, which was double the amount raised for former President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009. “The funds raised for the inaugural celebration allowed President Donald Trump to give the American people the opportunity to experience an incredible moment in our democracy where we witnessed the peaceful transition of power, the cornerstone of American democracy,” said Tom Barrack, chairman of the inaugural committee, in a statement. While this information was made public, the US State Department issued an appeal to “stop violations and demand accountability in Venezuela‘s protests”, where over the past month seven people have already died and hundreds of people have been arrested for protesting against Nicolas Maduro’s dictatorial regime. Trump shows no signs of buddying up with Venezuelan dictator Maduro. He and Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently welcomed Lilian Tintori, wife of political prisoner Leopoldo Lopez, to the White House, and he has taken a hard stance against the South American regime.

On Wednesday, in his first hearing in Guatemalan courts, the former official stated that he will not oppose being extradited to Mexico, but will wait for Mexican authorities to formalize the petition for that procedure. Javier Duarte, who was notified by the Guatemalan prosecutor's office about the accusation against him, said: "I cannot approve my extradition until my defense evaluates the formal request, which has to arrive from Mexico."

The former governor, who acknowledged before Judge Adan García that he entered Guatemalan territory six months ago, was reminded that he will not be tried in Guatemala and that the procedure was part of the claim for his extradition to Mexico. googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1459522593195-0'); });     On the other hand, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) reported that on Wednesday Javier Nava Soria was arrested in Spain, who is "linked to the investigations carried out by Mexican authorities in connection with the alleged network of operations with illicit funds" under former governor Javier Duarte's control. This detention, as reported by the PGR, is the result of: "An arrest warrant issued by the District Judge Specialized in the Accusatory Criminal System of the Federal Criminal Justice Center in Mexico City, residing in the northern prison for the crimes of operations with illicit funds and organized crime." Javier Duarte's alleged accomplice was arrested "for purposes of extradition in the city of Cabrils, Barcelona" by agents of the General Directorate of Police of the Ministry of Interior of the Kingdom of Spain.

Our CMMs are calling out many chemicals which are supposed to be used in the maintenance of avionics components. AMC (Avionics Maintenance Conference) recognizes the importance of chemicals. There are also issues. Therefore, the AMC Steering Committee decided to recognize numerous requests to organize a symposium about chemicals in the avionics environment. Chemistry is very broad area, but our need is to provide a symposium which can inform our audience about the following topics:     Latest regulation in USA, Europe, etc., which is restricting use of known and common chemicals due to environmental legislation (for example: REACH).     How to approach equivalency of chemicals. Sometimes CMMs call out certain chemicals which are not in our stock. We might have other similar chemicals in stock, but can we use them? The equivalent must be REACH compliant too.     Many of our chemicals originate from the automobile industry. Shelf life for the automobile industry is longer than in the aviation industry. How is the aviation industry establishing shelf life?     Many chemicals are delivered in huge packages while we need just a small portion in our yearly consumption. Many times, we have to scrap quantities of chemicals, which pollutes the environment. How do we deal with this?     Avionics engineers sometimes need a quick answer from chemical engineers about equivalency. Sometimes it takes weeks or months to get an answer (which is sometimes not satisfactory). Are there any tips or tricks to speed up the process? Is there a better way to formulate questions for chemical engineers so they can act more efficiently? Wednesday, May 3 – 3:20 p.m. Nuisance Fault Messages Speakers:         Rod Gates, American Airlines     Ron Parpart, Rockwell Collins     Dan Nguyen, The Boeing Company     Sven Biller, Lufthansa Technik Moderator:         Anand Moorthy, American Airlines This topic is considered an important one for most airlines; and it also is one that most larger suppliers and OEMs struggle with. This symposium will see three points of view on the panel:     An airline addressing the impacts: cost, delays, and safety.     A larger supplier offering insight on their causes, why they happen, and why they are so difficult to prevent and eliminate.     OEM(s) discussing the impact of increasingly complex systems comprised of boxes from multiple suppliers, faster data rates, connected aircraft, etc. This symposium might not solve the industry problem with nuisance fault messages, but it could help spread a greater understanding of the causes, effects, and impacts to help us all find a path to improvement. Cost to attend is $600. Members and Corporate Sponsors attend at no charge.

Service is expected to begin late this year with a fleet of 10 Boeing Co. 737-800s in “high density” configuration, Calgary-based WestJet said in a statement Thursday. The venture will aim to offer “no frills, lower-cost travel options,” Canada’s No. 2 carrier said. Founded in 1996 to cater to leisure travelers, WestJet has been moving away from its original no-frills model -- patterned after U.S.-based Southwest Airlines Co. -- by adding premium economy seats, rolling out a short-haul unit and starting overseas flights to European destinations such as London. Its fleet, meanwhile, has expanded from single-aisle 737s to include turboprops and double-aisle jets. “This makes a lot of sense,” said AltaCorp Capital analyst Chris Murray. “This ULCC lets them use existing aircraft, fly to routes they already know, densify their network, plus it spreads their overhead costs better. It’s a lower-risk proposition than going to a wide-body strategy.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Canada Jetlines Ltd. and Enerjet Ltd. have announced plans to begin operating ultra-low-cost carriers to challenge WestJet and larger rival Air Canada. Jim Scott, chief executive officer of Canada Jetlines, dismissed WestJet’s plan as “nothing more than an ‘airline within an airline’ that will not increase competition and it remains to be seen whether it will be able to achieve the full benefits of a ULCC.” Complicates Plans WestJet’s new carrier “significantly complicates the plans of other participants,” Murray wrote in a note Thursday. The new service will also protect WestJet from “market erosion in the highly sensitive fare category of travelers.” The decision to move ahead with the new unit came after years of studying the market, Bob Cummings, WestJet’s executive vice president, said in a telephone interview. “The new entrants are a factor, but only one of five or six,” Cummings said. “We think the timing is right. Were the new entrants a tipping point? No.” Cummings declined to provide details on fares, routes or seating configurations, saying they will be announced later “for competitive reasons.” Not Available Canada is the only member of the Group of Seven industrialized nations that doesn’t have access to an ultra-low-cost carrier, Murray wrote. While the country probably would support an ultra-low-cost market of about 50 aircraft and 10 million passengers a year, “significant stimulation” through lower prices is “required to be effective in the space.” With its Encore short-haul unit and widebody jets to Europe, WestJet “already has a lot of initiatives underway and we question whether there are enough human resources to also launch an all-new ULCC,” Cameron Doerksen, a National Bank Financial analyst, said in a note. WestJet is continuing to weigh whether to add widebody jets to its own fleet on a permanent basis, Cummings said. The carrier now flies some leased Boeing 767 aircraft that are more than 20 years old. “We’re evaluating widebodies as a line of business,” Cummings said. “That includes being able to come to terms with a manufacturer on an order, but we’re not there yet. Widebody certainly isn’t on the shelf.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Calgary-headquartered WestJet aims to kick off the service late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing Co 737-800s planes. Bob Cummings, WestJet's executive vice president, commercial, told Reuters the new offering would feature an "a la carte model" of a base fare plus specific fees for services like checked baggage, only taken one step further. While other low-cost carriers have failed in Canada, WestJet's strategy would work by winning market share from competitors such as Rouge and Sunwing Airlines while cannibalizing some of its own traffic, Cummings said. "Between taking share from others and, quite frankly, taking some share from us, the math makes sense." Cummings declined to give specifics about the new fares, but said the cost structure would not be comparable to the deeply discounted fares offered by European ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryan Air. "We are not likely to be at the Ryan Air end of the spectrum," he said in a phone interview. WestJet, which started life as a low-cost airline, has added premium services in a bid to increase revenue, but is planning the ultra-low-cost structure to service the other end. In planning the new service, Cummings said WestJet considered both the comparatively high-cost structure of operating flights in Canada and examples from abroad, including low-cost Australian carrier Tigerair Australia, which is operated by Virgin Australia Holdings, and Jetstar by Qantas Airways. Consumer advocates have long complained that limited competition, high fares and airport fees make Canada a comparatively expensive country for air travel. Canada in November lifted foreign investment limits for Canadian airlines to 49 percent from 25 percent, a change spurring competition and lower fares by encouraging the launch of low-cost airlines. "We're trying to create a climate where passengers are offered lower costs and greater choice," Transport Minister Marc Garneau said by phone following WestJet's announcement. A spokesman for Air Canada was not available for comment. Cummings said the new carrier would focus on domestic and sun destinations served by WestJet's B737s. The new carrier appears to be avoiding short-haul domestic routes. "As you travel further, the percentage of taxes and fees becomes less of a burden," Cummings said. "We have a big country here."

(AAPL) Stock An Even Greater Buy Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) Stock Can’t Afford a Shootout View All Posts No one wants to pay for more than they have to. Logically, that extends to the markets as well. The old adage that every investor hears is “buy low, sell high.” If only it were that easy! That’s always the end goal, but as we know, for every winner, there is a loser. To avoid the latter, we tend to ignore overheated assets. This brings us to our discussion of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr For such a mainstay in the financial markets, AAPL stock is exceptionally spirited. Year-to-date, shares are up 21%. To put this into perspective, Apple stock leads all other companies listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It’s not even close. The next-best performer is Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), which has garnered a comparatively small 15%. Needless to say, life is grand for investors of AAPL stock. That’s wonderful news for those that stuck to their guns and ignored the naysayers. But for those that are late to the game, they have a quite a dilemma. Do they buy into the strength of Apple stock, hoping for further gains? Or do they decide that the opportunity is far too deep to offer anything meaningful? AAPL Stock Is Built for the Long Haul To help answer the first question, we have to forecast whether Apple stock will continue to be relevant. That’s fairly easy to determine. This is Apple, not some speculative start-up company. It would be the shock of the century to witness Apple stock crumble. The difficult question is the latter — can AAPL stock do something for me in the here and now? Time and again, we hear the same thing about the iconic consumer tech giant: Against a variety of metrics, Apple stock represents great value. This isn’t just based on fundamental granularity. As InvestorPlace contributor Will Ashworth points out, the stock is assessed strictly as a hardware manufacturer. However, “it’s very much a service business with iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, etc.” The best part is that this business diversity is paying real dividends. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, service revenue for AAPL totaled $7.2 billion. That represents an 18% growth rate compared to the year-ago quarter. Should the trend continue to move forward — and there’s no reason to doubt it — the allocation of service revenue against total revenue will easily hit strong double-digits. Because of this shifting dynamic, Mr. Ashworth argues that the flagship iPhone doesn’t have to break records all the time. So long as sales don’t crumble, Apple stock will remain the undisputed king of consumer tech. It also helps that the competition is constantly playing catch-up. Although Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF) and Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) are making strides, they can’t match the organic connectivity of AAPL. Seemingly, the dominance of Apple stock is assured.

The move, according to AEI, is driven by a need for greater capacity for its PTF conversion programs. It currently covers the Boeing 737-400SF, McDonnell Douglas MD80 and the Bombardier CRJ200, with plans to extend to the 737-800 aircraft type later this year. Work on the jets is carried out worldwide across four authorized conversion centers comprised of Commercial Jet in Miami, Commercial Jet Services in Dotham, Alabama, KF Aerospace in Kelowna, Canada and Boeing Shanghai Aviation Services in China. AEI said Flightstar was chosen due to its experience in PTF modifications. It now plans to establish one line of PTF conversions at its Jacksonville facility in May when it commences with a 737-400 freighter conversion for San Francisco-based owner Vx Capital Partners.

The team trained a deep learning algorithm to recognize illustrations by feeding it a data set of 6,468 pages from 223 books, by 24 artist. Once the AI had learned the characteristics of a specific artist, it transferred them to a new image that is sure to give children night terrors – it lit a smiling turtle on fire, engulfed a girl in flames and turned a snow covered scene bottom into an image of the apocalypse. Scroll down for videos  Once the AI had learned the defining characteristics of a specific artist, it transferred them to a new image that is sure to give children night terrors – it lit a smiling turtle on fire, engulfed a girl holding flowers in flames and turned a snow covered scene bottom into an image of the apocalypse HOW WAS IT DONE?  Researchers aimed to teach a deep deep learning algorithm to recognize patterns and used children's books illustrations. The team fed the AI a data set of 6,468 pages from 223 books, by 24 artist. Once the AI had learned the defining characteristics of a specific artist, it transferred them to a new image. It lit a smiling turtle on fire, engulfed a girl holding flowers in flames and turned a snow covered scene bottom into an image of the apocalypse. ‘Style transfer model combines the appearance of a style image, e.g. an artwork, with the content of another image, e.g. an arbitrary photograph, by minimizing the loss of content and style,’ researchers from at Hacettepe University and Middle East Technical University in Turkey wrote in the study shared on arXiv. 'In our case, style is learned from an illustration of a particular illustrator, and transferred to another image.’ ‘The target image could be a cartoon, a natural photograph, or another illustration from another artist. We expect the resulting image to contain the content of the target image drawn with the style of source illustration.’ For this project, the team used three CNN models in training: ALexNEt, VGG-19 and GoogLeNet. The team collected images from a range of artists including Dr. Seuss, Marc Brown, Maurice Sendak and more. During the experiments, researchers had discovered that the AI was able to find parts and objects in the illustrations such as ‘eyes, fish, car/wheel, house, plant, people and clothes, and even discriminate poses such as side views of humans and animals, as well as hair, fur or ears.’ However, as Motherboard reported, the AI was mainly transferring color from one image to the next, which has suggested that color is the main feature that it learned to decipher between different patterns.

Reben shared his nightmarish masterpiece on Vimeo, which he called ‘Deep Artificial Trees’. Google has brought the late artist Bob Ross back to life, but as a monster-faced figure in a ‘nightmare’ world.

The video shows a segment with Ross painting his iconic happy trees, but instead of seeing fluffy green bushels, viewers are presented with bug-eyed creatures on the canvas (pictured) 'Artificial Neural Networks have spurred remarkable recent progress in image classification and speech recognition,' wrote Alexander Mordvintsev, Christopher Olah and Mike Tyka of Google's AI team. 'But even though these are very useful tools based on well-known mathematical methods, we actually understand surprisingly little of why certain models work and others don't.' Google trained an artificial neural network by showing it millions of training examples and gradually adjusting the network parameters until it gives the classifications the team want. Then the clip takes viewers to a farm where he pets what is supposed to be cute animals, but instead of a fluffy gerbil in his hands, it appears as if he is holding a creature that morphs from a monkey, to a lizard, to an eight-legged spider. Google trained an artificial neural network by showing it millions of training examples The network typically consists of 10 to 30 stacked layers of artificial neurons and each image is fed into the input layer, which then talks to the next layer, until eventually the 'output' layer is reached.

Each time someone votes for an image as scary, the algorithms learn to consider the qualities of that image as fear-inducing qualities - and the same goes for non-scary' images. Every time a vote is cast, the AI learns more about what humans consider a scary image. With enough input from people around the world, the AI could generate the sum of human fears. TURN YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS INTO DEEP DREAM NIGHTMARES  Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognize photos. The results were a terrifying and fascinating mix of random animals, eyes and psychedelic shapes spotted in everyday images. And a few weeks later, developers created an app that lets you transform your own photos and GIFs into Deep Dream nightmares. Called Deep Dreamer, the tool was built by Realmac Software based in Brighton and is only available for Mac users. The company specialises in Mac software and has not revealed plans to roll it our for Windows user.  Any photo or GIF can be dragged into the tool, or opened from the File menu, and a series of tools lets users tweak how the finished photo, or ‘dream’ will look. These range from an impressionist painting style, to looking for eyes, animals and a dream described simply as ‘trippy’. The number of ‘dreams’ and iterations can be tweaked to dig deeper into the image and Google’s code, resulting in more obscure and surreal images. Once the refinements have been selected, users click ‘Start dreaming’ and the image begins to change on the screen. A progress bar sits at the top and a notification is sent when the ‘dream has finished’. Last year, Google gave a glimpse into how its Deep Dream networks learns to recognise photos. The results were a terrifying and fascinating mix of random animals, eyes and psychedelic shapes spotted in everyday images. And a few weeks later, developers created an app that lets you transform your own photos and GIFs into Deep Dream nightmares (pictured) more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Massive waterfall falls off the Nansen Ice Shelf into the ocean Watch video See through model rocket engine ignited in slow motion Watch video HTC tease fans with shots of 'HTC U' phone to be released in May Watch video Robot dog that recognises FACES could be future of elderly care Watch video Soyuz rocket lifts off to deliver two astronauts to ISS Watch video Ultrasonic clothes dryer uses VIBRATIONS to dry in half the time Watch video Animation shows how Earth would appear if dominated by oceans Watch video Lilium Aviation's first test flights for electric VTOL jet Watch video Robot cheetah in slow motion developed at University of Twente Watch video Horrific ISIS video shows child soldier handing knives to executioners Watch video Burglar caught on security camera robbing Dallas man's home Watch video Talented Frenchie shows off self-taught skateboarding skills   Read more: Nightmare Machine Nightmare Machine (@nightmare_machine) ¿ Instagram photos and videos Nightmare Machine: Help us create the most scary arxiv.org/pdf/17...

China opens military contracts worth billions of yuan to private companies Apr, 20 2017 Author: Thema Newsroom But lack of trust remains a problem, experts say Related North Korea tension: China ‘seriously concerned’ about nuclear threats China is about to launch its first home-built aircraft carrier Syria war: Russia and China veto sanctions Chinese set drone Guinness world record (video) China’s military further opened its research and development programmes to private companies, inviting them to take part in projects worth an estimated 6 billion yuan (US$870 million or HK$6.78 billion), state media reported on Wednesday. Analysts said the move was part of the government’s wider goal of creating a defence contract industry where private companies played a key role in supplying military technology that could also have civilian applications, similar to how Lockheed Martin and Boeing operated in the United States. The contracting is overseen by the PLA’s arms procurement wing, the Equipment Development Department, which released information for more than 2,000 projects on its website, according to the PLA Daily. Interested companies would have to put together a proposal that met the requirements listed on the website and submit it for evaluation, the report said. Some 531 of the requirements involved classified information, and their inclusion could help set clearer standards for bids, the report quoted an unnamed officer as saying. Beijing first began taking down the wall separating civilian and military technologies in the 1980s, but the PLA still relies on just a handful of state behemoths to supply most of its needs. The integration received a substantial push in 2015 when President Xi Jinping, who chairs the policymaking Central Military Commission, elevated it to a national priority. This past January, he authorised the creation of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development to coordinate policies and decisions towards that end. But obstacles remain, with a major one being trust, according to He Qisong, a defence policy specialist at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “When it comes to key technologies in the defence industry, private companies can hardly gain any trust from the army in matters involving secrecy,” He said. Retired PLA major general Xu Guangyu said new laws were needed to clarify obligations of businesses handling classified work, as well as to define the commercial benefits they could reap from cooperation with the military. Xu, a senior researcher at Beijing-based research group the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said although the PLA had previously invited companies to take part in R&D, the latest round of projects was announced in a high-profile way. “With this information, private companies can know what’s required to work with the army,” Xu said. “China has a large number of private companies with many that are industry leaders, and the military can make use of the private companies’ potential.” Source Tags With: chinaindustrymilitaryprivate contractorstenders ← Turkey’s Erdogan: Barack Obama deceived us over PKK Rex Tillerson declares end to ‘strategic patience’ with Iran, slams… → Apr, 21 2017 Octopus breaks out of sealed glass jar!

Forums Join   New Satellite Broadband Push Could Create Surge in 'Space Junk' by Karl Bode Thursday Apr 20 2017 07:40 EDT A new study from the University of Southampton claims that the latest rush to expand broadband access via constellations of lower-orbit satellites could result in a dramatic spike in "catastrophic" space accidents. Google, SpaceX, Boeing and Samsung are all contemplating using low-orbit satellite to provide broadband with slightly less of the crippling latency we've grown accustomed to. The problem is that if these launches aren't done in a controlled way, we'll see a notable spike in "space junk" leading to collisions with spacecraft and other satellite, Dr Hugh Lewis warns the Guardian. "The constellations that are due to be deployed from next year contain an unprecedented number of satellites, and a constellation launched without much thought will see a significant impact on the space environment because of the increased rate of collisions that might occur," said Lewis. Lewis ran a 200-year simulation to determine the end result of the expected rise in orbital traffic, and found it could create a 50% increase in the number of "catastrophic collisions" between satellites. And space junk was already a problem, with 750,000 objects larger than 1cm orbiting Earth -- and each traveling at speeds of 40,000 km/h -- resulting in the potential collision impact of a hand grenade. The European Space Agency, which funded Lewis’s research, is pushing to ensure that companies developing low-orbit broadband satellite constellations design them so they're able to move to lower altitudes and burn up in orbit once their mission is ended. Dr Holger Krag, in charge of monitoring space junk at the ESA, worries that private, inexperienced companies may be under financial pressure to cut corners in the way taxpayer-funded space ventures often don't have to, resulting in more problems. "They are companies so they have competitors, so they have pressure," Krag told the Guardian. "Under these conditions they would have to manufacture satellites that are reliable enough after five years of operations to reliably conduct this disposal maneuver.""Right now, under all the taxpayer-funded space flight we are doing today is only able to achieve 60% of success rate for that maneuver. How can they be better under commercial pressure and with cheaper satellites? That’s the worry we have." tags: satellite · competition · business · hardware · alternatives · world · wireless News Jump Verizon Sees a Net Loss of 13,000 FiOS TV CustomersVerizon Sees Record Wireless Subscriber Loss Thanks to T-MobileFacebook Sets New Records in Millimeter Wave Broadband SpeedsThursday Morning LinksForum Topic: New CenturyLink Broadband PricingFCC to Make Life Easier For Business Broadband MonopoliesDish Customers May Not See Return of Blacked Out Hearst StationsReview: TP-Link Powerline AC Wi-Fi Kit (TL-WPA8630 KIT)The T-Mobile SIM Card SnafuSprint, T-Mobile Merger Talks May Heat Up Next Week----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 15 comments jorcmg join:2002-10-24 USA jorcmg Member Yesterday 10:10 am Science Hmmm wonder how the flat earth people are taking the news. · actions · Yesterday 10:10 am · imanogre join:2005-11-29 Smyrna, GA imanogre Member Yesterday 7:52 am OMG The earth is Shrinking!!!!! · actions · Yesterday 7:52 am · How about ..

The management of the troubled carrier also said today it has commenced its own investigation of the incident, but commended the flight pilot for professionalism. There were 53 passengers, comprising of 52 adult passengers and a 7-month old child, on board the aircraft, a routine Port Harcourt-Lagos flight.A source close to NCAA told our correspondent that inspectors of the regulatory agency have commenced the investigation to find out what went wrong.  The aircraft had departed Port Harcourt at 4:08 pm local time, but smoke began to come fill the cabin 30 minutes into the flight. The NCAA source told our correspondent that the airline reported the incident to the agency’s Airworthiness Directorate today, adding that it is a serious incident that must be closely looked at. A statement by Simon Tumba, the media consultant to the airline, said that the management ordered the investigation. Tumba said preliminary reports indicated that at about 24,000 feet at about 1645 GMT, around 75 nautical miles to Lagos, the cabin crew observed that the cabin was misty.  That fact was reported to the flight captain, who briefed the passengers accordingly and assured them of a safe landing in Lagos in a couple of minutes. He said the company engineers had carried out the routine systems pre-flight checks during which everything was normal. He also disclosed that when the aircraft was descending, a passenger went into the lavatory, after which the lavatory smoke detector alarm came on. “The cabin crew again reported this incident to the Captain and by this time the smoke was getting denser in the cabin. Ready and armed with “Aft Cargo Smoke” indication in the flight deck, the crew carried out the smoke dispersal procedures and contacted air traffic control at 1655 GMT, requesting for emergency support services and proceeded to Lagos, which is the airport with the full complement of emergency support. “At this stage again, the cabin crew reassured the passengers and handed out wet towels to them as a precautionary measure for such incidents,” he added. The statement commended the pilot and the entire crew for the professionalism they displayed in handling the situation and regretted any inconveniences the incident might have caused the passengers.  It expressed the assurance the airline would get to the root cause of the matter. Aero Contractors, which has been under the receivership of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria for about five years, has seen its fortune nosedive from 18 aircraft in 2010 to just two Boeing 737s.

Analysts said the move was part of the government’s wider goal of creating a defence contract industry where private companies played a key role in supplying military technology that could also have civilian applications, similar to how Lockheed Martin and Boeing operated in the United States. The contracting is overseen by the PLA’s arms procurement wing, the Equipment Development Department, which released information for more than 2,000 projects on its website, according to the PLA Daily. How China’s defence industry can learn from its rival Japan: PLA veteran Interested companies would have to put together a proposal that met the requirements listed on the website and submit it for evaluation, the report said. Some 531 of the requirements involved classified information, and their inclusion could help set clearer standards for bids, the report quoted an unnamed officer as saying. Beijing first began taking down the wall separating civilian and military technologies in the 1980s, but the PLA still relies on just a handful of state behemoths to supply most of its needs. The integration received a substantial push in 2015 when President Xi Jinping, who chairs the policymaking Central Military Commission, elevated it to a national priority. This past January, he authorised the creation of the Central Commission for Integrated Military and Civilian Development to coordinate policies and decisions towards that end. But obstacles remain, with a major one being trust, according to He Qisong, a defence policy specialist at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. PLA allows civilian firms to supply kit “When it comes to key technologies in the defence industry, private companies can hardly gain any trust from the army in matters involving secrecy,” He said. Retired PLA major general Xu Guangyu said new laws were needed to clarify obligations of businesses handling classified work, as well as to define the commercial benefits they could reap from cooperation with the military. Xu, a senior researcher at Beijing-based research group the China Arms Control and Disarmament Association, said although the PLA had previously invited companies to take part in R&D, the latest round of projects was announced in a high-profile way. “With this information, private companies can know what’s required to work with the army,” Xu said. “China has a large number of private companies with many that are industry leaders, and the military can make use of the private companies’ potential.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon 2 Storm looms as Xi tries to clean up China’s financial industry 3 45 years of grappling with Vancouver unaffordability 4 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 5 Don’t mess with Kim, he thinks he’s his grandfather Shared 1 Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon 2 Interpol issues red notice for Chinese tycoon after corruption claim 3 Canto-pop’s Aaron Kwok weds model Moka Fang 4 Storm looms as Xi tries to clean up China’s financial industry 5 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 Commented 1 Artist Ai Weiwei takes to social media after HSBC rejects application 2 Notorious Hong Kong gangster Yip Kai-foon, who inspired hit film, dead at 55 3 US vice-president to North Korea: ‘The sword stands ready’ 4 Don’t mess with Kim, he thinks he’s his grandfather 5 Plug pulled on US interview with wanted Chinese tycoon Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2017 SCMP Invites you to Le French May “Paris Ballet Legend - A Night With The Stars”       You may also like Hong Kong Diamond design for future MTR station falls flat amid delays 18 Apr 2017 - 12:48pm 18 Zero Carbon Building reveals Hong Kong's eco-home potential In partnership with: HKT PREMIER China China launches revamped ‘green cards’ to lure foreign talent 18 Apr 2017 - 10:43pm 14 [SCMP Archive] Mothers’ love Sponsored by: Hong Kong International School Hong Kong Hong Kong hikers warned as deaths exceed 2016 total in four months 17 Apr 2017 - 10:53pm 19 Hong Kong Hong Kong pay TV firm i-Cable takes ‘important step’ to stay afloat 18 Apr 2017 - 10:55pm 3 China How students cheated in China’s imperial civil service exams 18 Apr 2017 - 11:35am 4 Hong Kong Yip Kai-foon, Hong Kong's ‘King of Thieves’ dies in hospital Apr 19th 2017, 5:10pm China More Chinese flocking back home after studying abroad 17 Apr 2017 - 8:27am 73 Hong Kong ‘Nano’ flats on the rise amid high property prices 17 Apr 2017 - 10:59pm 9 Insight & Opinion How culture shock means sure turbulence on US-China flights 18 Apr 2017 - 9:07am 26 China ‘Hong Kong separatism’ on Communist Party security agenda 16 Apr 2017 - 8:13am 34 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may have missed their chance in Congress. AP Listen Story audio 3min 47sec If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates." Moore, the Trump campaign adviser, says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to budget deficits. And for now, Moore says, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. "One of the lessons, hopefully, Republicans learned from the health care debate is, 'keep it simple, stupid,' " he says. "The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress." What would simple look like? According to Moore: • Allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of capital purchases, such as factories and equipment. • Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. • Have an even lower tax rate on money U.S. companies bring revenues back from overseas. • Require that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U.S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing these ideas, including publisher Steve Forbes and economists Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, say even some Democrats might support them.

The A321neo is the largest member of the A320neo family of single aisle aircraft, seating up to 240 passengers in a single class layout. Virgin America will operate it in a 185 seat configuration. The Virgin A321neos are powered by CFM International’s LEAP-1A engines and add to the airline’s existing 63 Airbus A320 family fleet. “After Virgin America having been the first customer signing for the A320neo back in December 2010, we are today delighted to deliver the first A321neo to them,” Airbus chief operating officer Fabrice Brégier said. The future of Virgin America’s Airbus aircraft is in doubt however after the carrier’s takeover in December by Alaska Air Group which operates an all Boeing fleet. Virgin is expected to take delivery of five A321neos this year, but a further five and an order for A320neos is in doubt as Alaska reviews its aircraft needs post merger. Alaska has already announced that it will drop the Virgin America brand in 2019 and rebadge the airline as Alaska Airlines. The new A321neo is expected to enter service on May 31 on the San Francisco to Washington Reagan National route.

This proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by sustaining the military capabilities of Canada, a NATO ally that has been, and continues to be, an important force for ensuring political stability and economic progress in the world, including through its involvement in military, peacekeeping, and humanitarian operations. The sustainment of Canada's C-17s will ensure the country's continued capability to rapidly deploy its forces, as well as the continued interoperability between the U.S. and Canadian Air Forces' C-17s. The proposed sale of defense articles and services is required to maintain the operational readiness of the Royal Canadian Air Force C-17 aircraft. Canada's current contract supporting its five (5) C-17s will expire on 20 September 2017. The Royal Canadian Air Force will have no difficulty absorbing this support. The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region. Sources of supply will award contracts when necessary to provide the defense articles ordered if items ordered are not available from U.S. stock or are considered lead-time away. The prime contractor will involve the following contractors: Boeing Company, Long Beach, California Boeing Company Training Systems, St. Louis, Missouri Lockheed Martin Corporation/MFC, Lexington, Kentucky There are no known offsets. Any offset agreements will be defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the contractor. Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor representatives to Canada. There is an on-going foreign military sales case providing C-17 sustainment services. There are currently 13 contractors from Boeing in-country providing contractor technical services support on a continuing basis. There will be no adverse impact to U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale. This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded. All questions regarding this proposed Foreign Military Sale should be directed to the State Department's Bureau of Political Military Affairs, Office of Congressional and Public Affairs, pm-cpa@state.gov. -30- NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

What Hope for Kaduna Airport after N3.2b Makeover? April 21, 2017 0 415 On Wednesday, the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport resumed operation, six weeks after it was shut down for the repair of its runway.  Kaduna Airport was used as alternative while the repair lasted. Industry sources put the cost of movement of flights to Kaduna, the preparation of the airport to serve as alternative, including associated projects and security at about N3.2 billion. The Kaduna airport witnessed flurry of activities during the given period when most of the domestic airlines and few international carriers operated at the airport. The temporary designation of the airport as alternative to Abuja galvanised economic activities, creating inevitable market around the airport, as businesses yearned to meet miscellaneous demands of passengers, from eateries to other services. But now that huge flight traffic has returned to the airport at the Federal Capital Territory, which has become beehive of activities since Wednesday as airlines, which battled with challenging logistics and initial low load factor and passengers that have to travel three hours from Abuja to Kaduna to board their flights, heaved a long sigh of relief. To effectively serve as alternative to Abuja, Kaduna airport was upgraded to Category 9 with improved fire cover, expanded and rehabilitated runway, improved instrument landing system and erection of the passenger terminal, which was literally abandoned when the airport remodeling progamme was terminated. The Voice Ominidirectional Radio Range (VOR) at the airport was repaired in addition to the repair of other navigational aids, air traffic personnel were deployed and airspace services and weather reports improved. The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) was toying with security and perimeter fencing at the height of the period the airport served its purpose. Before it served as alternative to Abuja, Kaduna airport was receiving about two commercial flights a day, so it was never a busy airport and that explained why there was no hurry to rebuild its terminal as the hajj terminal was put in use for the lean number of passengers that travel through the airport. However, now that the airport facilities have been upgraded, THISDAY learnt that Arik Air, Medview and Air Peace may operate to the airport. Arik had been operating to the airport in the past. Industry observers while acknowledging the upgrade of facilities at the airport lamented that they would become underutilised now that traffic has moved back to Abuja. “From the road reconstruction to the deployment of security operatives, the Kaduna airport projects must have cost over N3.2 billion. They spent billion because all the vehicles from Abuja to Kaduna and vice versa were escorted by security operatives in their pick-up vans. So you can estimate how much that cost the federal government. When I travelled from Abuja to Kaduna to board flight to Lagos we were escorted by two policemen in Hilux van until we arrived. All the vehicles that left were escorted. They would put road safety (Federal Road Safety Corp) at the back; they would put police escort in front. The money spent on these activities is crazy,” an inside source told THISDAY. THISDAY learnt that beyond serving as alternative to Abuja airport, there had been plans to upgrade the airport and make it a very active airport, operating international flights and also given it a prime place by government. To this end, there are indications that government will ensure that an international flight operates to the airport beyond Hajj flights, which operates at least twice every year. THISDAY authoritatively learnt that the Governor of Kaduna state, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai had written to the management of Ethiopia Airlines to continue its operation to Kaduna after it served as alternative to Abuja, promising to give it all the support it needs. Although Ethiopia Airlines has not replied the state government but it may give that request a serious consideration because of the good relationship between Nigeria and the airline. Indications show that although the state government made that request to the airline, it is tacitly supported by the federal government and the aviation agencies. “It has been part of the whole scheme when government announced that Kaduna would serve as alternative airport to Abuja while the runway in the later undergoes repairs. It was a scheme orchestrated to upgrade facilities at the airport, but what was done is not bad. We hope that government should show similar commitment to the upgrade of other airports. In case of emergency, Kaduna is the closest airport to Abuja, so a flight under distress after taking from Abuja has an alternative airport to land in. This is why we advised to ensure that all busy airports have airfield lighting and can operate in the night in case of emergency,” a source remarked to THISDAY. But this is the reality check. Ethiopia Airlines said that it would designate the latest aircraft to come out of Airbus, Airbus A350 to Abuja airport. It landed at Abuja airport with 265 passengers onboard on Tuesday afternoon, a day before the reopening of the airport. The aircraft has about 343 passenger capacity. Ethiopia Airlines operates Boeing B777 to Lagos with about 350-400 passenger capacity; it also operates to Kano with Boeing B737-800 with about 140 passenger capacity; it operates to Enugu with Boeing 737-800 with similar 140 passenger capacity, so where will the passenger for Kaduna airport come from, considering the airports proximity to Kano and Abuja? But besides this reality, which seems to stymie the plan to have Ethiopia Airlines or any international operation beyond Hajj services in Kaduna, the Kaduna airport has all the necessary facilities to function as international airport. It has the largest remote parking space among the Nigerian airports. Now it has the most upgraded landing aids and runway. Government should not allow these facilities to be idle, so it should tinker ways to make the airport more functional. Allowing it to be underutilised will not justify the huge resources spent on its upgrade.   Previous articleNCAA Moves to Strengthen Economic Regulation Next articleEthiopian Introduces Latest Airbus A350 to Abuja Route Online Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Business Internet Penetration in Nigeria Rises to 53% Business Microfinance Tool for Poverty Alleviation, Says Rwanda Envoy Business Union Bank Unveils Anniversary Promo 988,485FansLike 743,127FollowersFollow Latest News Fashion on the Street April 21, 2017 Edo Widows Get Felix King’s Business Grant April 21, 2017 Reckitt Benckiser’s ‘Clean Healthy Naija’ Initiative to Reduce Child Mortality April 21, 2017 Lite Gas Distributes Free Cooking Gas, Cylinders April 21, 2017 Honeywell Harps on Quality Control in Business April 21, 2017 THISDAY Today (Download) Download Thursday 20th April 2017 April 21, 2017 0 Recent Comments Steel on Fayose Questions Buhari’s Absence at State Functions AdeOne on Fayose Questions Buhari’s Absence at State Functions Daniel on Citing Double Standards, PDP Says SGF, NIA DG Should Have Been Arrested Daniel Obior on Naira Extends Gains as Dollar Glut Hits Market Zico on Citing Double Standards, PDP Says SGF, NIA DG Should Have Been Arrested MOST COMMENTED Nigeria WAEC Certificate: Buhari Files Appeal against Ruling Dismissing His Objection June 15, 2016 455 Davidson Iriekpen President Muhammadu Buhari has appealed the ruling of Justice Adeniyi Ademola of the Federal High Court in Abuja who on May 26, 2016...

(Photo: derek.simeone/flickr/cc) Companies seeking favor from the government wrote big checks for President Donald Trump's inauguration, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings (pdf) released this week. In one notable instance, the agrochemical giant Dow—which is trying to kill a federal risk study on its pesticides—gave $1 million for the festivities. Dow's chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris is a close adviser to Trump and heads a White House manufacturing working group. Last week, lawyers representing Dow and two other big chemical companies sent letters to the chiefs of three federal agencies asking them to ignore scientific findings that their pesticides cause damage to roughly 1,800 threatened or endangered species, the Associated Press reported Thursday. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion are "likely to adversely affect" 1,778 of the 1,835 animals and plants the agency examined, including endangered mammals, birds, and reptiles. Dow claimed the tests had been conducted unreliably and asked the heads of the EPA, the Natural Marine Fisheries Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service to "set aside" the scientific findings. (In March, EPA chief Scott Pruitt announced that he would lift a federal ban on chlorpyrifos, which is also known to cause brain damage in children.) Green groups were not surprised that Dow was attempting to cast doubt on the results. Brett Hartl, government affairs director for the Center for Biological Diversity, told the AP that the company was intentionally holding scientists to impossible standards. "You can't just take an endangered fish out of the wild, take it to the lab, and then expose it to enough pesticides until it dies to get that sort of data," Hartl said. "It's wrong morally, and it's illegal." Make a difference. Join us. Other companies shelling out for the inauguration were AT&T, which gave $2.1 million as it awaits federal approval of its proposed merger with Time Warner—a deal that opponents have slammed as "counter to the public good" and a threat to privacy. In March, Trump tapped Makan Delrahim, who once said the merger was no big deal, to serve as antitrust chief for the Department of Justice. The telecommunications giant Qualcomm, which is fighting an Obama-era anti-competitiveness complaint, gave $1 million. Defense contractor Boeing gave $1 million. Sheldon Adelson, the reclusive casino mogul and conservative super-donor, gave $5 million. In all, Politico noted, "more than 40 individuals and corporations each gave at least $1 million toward Trump's inauguration festivities, including Bank of America, Pfizer and Qualcomm, top executives from Cantor Fitzgerald and GoDaddy, and the owners of the National Football League's Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots, New York Jets, and Washington Redskins." Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen, said Wednesday, "The Trump administration did not wait to take office before embracing and deepening the pay-to-play, corrupting culture against which candidate Trump ran. Those who did attend the inauguration did so out of civic pride and a celebration of American democracy. For inaugural donors, it was all about buying access and influence, and corrupting American democracy." "If only all that money had bought a bigger crowd," Weissman said.

Unless you’ve been out of the country or traveling to another galaxy, you are well aware Columbia is positioned in the best location on the East Coast to witness a total solar eclipse. The eclipse, which will reach its apex at about 2:41 p.m. in this area, will be visible along a thin, roughly 100 mile-wide path that runs diagonally across America from Oregon to South Carolina. The planning part starts now. During the week of April 17- 23, the sun is following the same path that it will on August 21, therefore allowing people to find a good venue so they can view this once-in-lifetime spectacle. “If you want to be prepared for the eclipse, you will want to know where you can view it,” said University of South Carolina Astronomy Professor Steve Rodney. “ Think of this week as an eclipse dress rehearsal.” Rodney explained that since the earth is tilted at 23 degrees and it revolves, the placement of the sun will vary as to the season. Just because the sun is visible in January from a fixed location and time, it might not be visible there at the same time in August. Confusing to mere mortals? Yes. For those who want a real “science-y” explanation, Google this: Analemma figure diagram. Rodney said it’s very important for those who want to view the event safely to wear eclipse glasses during the event, except for the two or so minutes of totality. Columbia has been gearing up for the eclipse, which could bring an estimated one million people to the area for the August 21 weekend. Here are some of the highlights, provided by Tracie Broom of Flock and Rally: • “Sunblock” Total Eclipse Viewing Party and Eclipse Eve Drive-In Movie Night at Historic Columbia Speedway in Cayce. The city center of Columbia will experience two minutes and 30 seconds of darkness, while areas within 10-15 minutes of the S.C. State House can experience up to two minutes and 36 seconds of darkness. Two of our area’s most beautiful natural attractions, Lake Murray and Congaree National Park, are within or adjacent to the line of greatest totality. • Columbia Fireflies minor league baseball games all weekend and “Total Eclipse of the Park” game and viewing event during eclipse. • Solar 17 at Lake Murray viewing festival with tents, free water, and free eclipse glasses at Lake Murray dam and lakefront park sites, 25 minutes from downtown Columbia, S.C. • The Lexington County Blowfish baseball team is dedicating its entire 2017 season to the eclipse and will open the Lexington County Baseball Stadium for a free viewing event. University of South Carolina Astronomy Professor Steve Rodney • The S.C. State Museum ( home of the Boeing Observatory) will host ticketed events and educational programming all weekend, with a NASA exhibition and eclipse day viewing event with a personal appearance by S.C. NASA astronaut Charles Duke (one of 12 men to walk on the moon). • Astronomy workshops, exhibitions, and lectures at University of South Carolina department of Physics and Astronomy and at USC’s Irvin Department of Rare Books and Special Collections’ Robert B. Ariail collection of historical astronomy. • “Shadows and Science in the Wilderness” programs and ranger-led hikes to prime viewing locations at Congaree National Park. • Total eclipse viewing event at Sesquicentennial State Park Tent camping and eclipse viewing at Siesta Cove Marina & RV Park on Lake Murray. • Weekend and single day eclipse parking and RV parking at the S.C. State Fairgrounds.

Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may have missed their chance in Congress. AP Listen Story audio 3min 47sec If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates." Moore, the Trump campaign adviser, says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to budget deficits. And for now, Moore says, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. "One of the lessons, hopefully, Republicans learned from the health care debate is, 'keep it simple, stupid,' " he says. "The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress." What would simple look like? According to Moore: • Allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of capital purchases, such as factories and equipment. • Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. • Have an even lower tax rate on money U.S. companies bring revenues back from overseas. • Require that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U.S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing these ideas, including publisher Steve Forbes and economists Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, say even some Democrats might support them.

(M.O. Stevens/Creative Commons) Who gained the most in the immediate aftermath of Bill O'Reilly's fall from grace at Fox News? It wasn't Tucker Carlson, who took over his coveted primetime slot. It wasn't the hoard of liberal critics who had been demanding his head for decades. No, it was probably shareholders of O'Reilly Automotive, the auto parts chain that sells everything from quarts of engine oil to aftermarket exhaust systems. While the personal stock of the pundit was plummeting, the publicly traded stock of the auto parts company was rallying because of an unusual case of mistaken identity. When O'Reilly began trending on Twitter, computer trading algorithms may have picked up on that data and made hundreds of automatic trades on Wall Street. Michael Harris over at Price Action Lab first spotted the bump, noting that suddenly O'Reilly Automotive experienced a 3 percent rally. Of course, it's possible that O'Reilly's self-immolation was distinct from this sudden hot streak. Maybe investors saw it as bullish that O'Reilly Automotive was offering a great rebate on brake pads and rotors at the same time. More than that good deal though, computer algorithms seem like the culprit. After all, they're everywhere. More and more hedge funds and financial firms have started relying on social media to gain insights on stock sales. Instead of hiring an intern to watch a Twitter feed, they program computers to gather and interpret the nearly 500 million tweets sent daily. Fueled by social media, programs like Dataminr offer real-time analysis and sometimes even trade automatically. Sometimes humans even beat computers to the punch. For instance, a single negative tweet from President Trump about Boeing immediately sent the airplane manufacturer into a short tailspin, dropping 1 percent in one day. Flesh and blood traders got jittery and sold their shares before the digital counterparts. But are Twitter rants really reliable market signals? The recent O'Reilly episode would suggest otherwise. For instance, O'Reilly Automotive stock was increasing in value even as O'Reilly the entertainer was being bashed mercilessly online. Maybe investors should deploy their algorithms elsewhere.

US president received $106.7 million in inauguration donations, twice amount given to Obama Compartir en Facebook Compartir en Twitter Otros Cerrar Compartir en Linkedin Compartir en GooglePlus Compartir en Pinterest Ver comentarios Conéctate Conéctate Imprimir Joan Faus Twitter Corresponsal en Estados Unidos Washington 20 ABR 2017 - 16:58 CEST Donald Trump raised a record $106.7 million for his presidential inauguration festivities in January, more than double the amount collected by Barack Obama in 2009. The donor list disputes Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” of Washington, in allusion to the financial machine that influences US politics. Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20. Carolyn Kaster AP EN ESPAÑOL El Gobierno de Caracas donó medio millón de dólares para la investidura de Trump According to official data released on Wednesday, the most generous donor was casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a highly influential figure in Republican circles, who gave $5 million to Trump. Adelson’s plans to build Europe’s largest casino in Madrid were rejected by the Spanish government in 2013. Perhaps the least-expected donor was Citgo, the US affiliate of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA, which wrote out a check for $500,000 for Trump’s inauguration. Trump has criticized President Maduro for his handling of anti-government protests The donation overshadowed the amounts provided by Pepsi ($250,000) or Walmart ($150,000), matching JP Morgan Chase and Exxon’s contributions. Whatever Venezuela’s intentions in showing such generosity, it has done nothing to dampen Trump’s criticism of President Nicolás Maduro, who faces continued protests at home and international criticism for his handling of the political and economic crisis in the South American country. US presidents establish their own criteria for donations. Trump put no upper limit on checks. In 2009, Obama refused gifts from businesses and lobbyists, while limiting amounts to $50,000. But four years later, for his second inauguration, the Democrat accepted money from business (up to $1 million), as well as individual donations of up to $250,000. Many of the companies that donated to Trump had previously given to Obama. Now, as then, there are interests at stake that depend on a decision by the most powerful man on the planet. Among the most generous donors was telecoms operator AT&T, which gave $2.1 million For example, aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Lockheed Martin each gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, the same amount Boeing gave to Obama in 2013, according the Reuters news agency. Before his inauguration on January 20, Trump was scathing in his criticism of the cost of the planes both manufacturers sell to the US government. The financial sector, which will be hoping the president will relax some of the restrictions imposed on it by Obama following the crisis of 2008, was also generous with Trump: banking and brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Bank of America Corp each contributed $1 million. Among the most generous donors was telecoms operator AT&T, which gave $2.1 million. The company is awaiting the government’s approval of its merger with Time Warner. It contributed $4.6 million to Obama’s second inauguration. English version by Nick Lyne.

One extreme example came earlier this month, when a passenger was seriously injured while being forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight—but overall, the amount of control airlines have over their customers is the envy of other industries, the marketing expert Joseph Turow told me: “Irrespective of any individual fare, they have this overarching notion of who their valued customers are, and what their lifetime value is,” he said. “And because of the structure of the system, they can take advantage of it to the point of being mean to people.” Business travelers, who are less likely than leisure travelers to comparison-shop for airfare, reap the rewards of pricey, company-sponsored travel in the form of miles. They’re pampered, while passengers in the back, who are more likely to have simply searched for the best deal, are left without many frills. A reader emailed over the weekend to share her own harrowing experience with a major airline in the ’90s, which quickly escalated from a routine complaint to an emergency landing and a round of questioning with the FBI: I and my then-boyfriend were flying to Portland from NYC. His father, an executive with loads of mileage to spend, got my BF a business ticket and me a coach ticket for some reason. We were chatting at my BF’s seat, thinking it should be okay until the departure. A flight attendant approached us and as soon as he knew that I was a coach customer, he started to get very mean and raise his voice at me—even though we explained I was going back to my assigned spot before takeoff. We decided my BF would come to my seat later to watch a film together after a meal. When I was going to enter the business section to pick him up, the same flight attendant stopped me, saying my BF was asleep and I couldn’t get in the business area since I didn’t have a business ticket. He even said I shouldn’t bother my BF and shut a curtain in my face. So, I complained about this flight attendant’s rude attitude, but nobody was decent and I started to cry. My BF came and he also told them that the flight attendant was very mean to me. All of a sudden, an announcement was made to be seated, so we went back to our seats. Later I would learn that the captain decided to make an emergency stop to kick us out. We were handcuffed. Continue Reading We had to talk with an FBI agent. While waiting for the federal interview, my BF and I were separated. I told the two male officers who were watching me that I needed to use a bathroom, and one of them inspected me—I was fully clothed but it was seriously degrading and traumatic. In the meantime, my BF told me that when he asked for a cigarette break, they just uncuffed him and let him smoke outside. My BF’s father made some phone calls to the airline, and we learned that the airline claimed we had started a fight. That claim wasn’t accepted by the authorities, but we were charged for violating the federal regulation that says passengers have to be seated when the airline tells them so. I FedExed a letter denying the charge, but it was ignored and we were fined, although we never paid. It was a real nightmare. On the way back from Portland, we had to take the same airline because that’s what my BF’s father had got us. The same crew was working and when we were getting off in NY, a female crew member called me “dork.”   My BF told me that mean attendant guy was totally nice to him. Back then I was too naive to think the crew was just plain arrogant and mean, and I wondered if that flight attendant guy liked my BF and just hated me because I was his partner. Now I think that the crew and the airline were racially biased: My BF was a tall, blond, handsome, WASP-looking man and I was an Asian woman. Thanks for reading.  It still makes me nervous after all these years … Have you got an airline story that still makes you shudder? Send us a note: hello@theatlantic.com. Chris Bodenner 2:09 PM / August 9, 2016 Trying Times in Transit: Your Remaining Stories For the past week we’ve been compiling your worst travel experiences, from a creepy bus driver on the Romanian border to vengeful shellfish to a business trip gone bust to a descent into one of the most perilous airports to a near-death experience on the icy interstate to gang shooting on a Guatemalan bus to a hugging that turned mugging. Here’s a final roundup of reader stories. Gerry had a short but psychologically endless voyage at the Happiest Place on Earth: I have DEEP psychic scars from being stuck for an hour on the Disneyland “Small World” ride when it broke down … but the music did not. Thank god this next reader, Nick, wasn’t stranded on that ride: For three months back in 2007, a companion and I traveled dirt-cheap all around India. My Midwestern GI tract performed admirably well, save for one surreal moment on an overnight, long-haul, toilet-less sleeper bus that found me hanging my rear out the window performing my first “flying toilet.” Only problem was, the bag was too small for the task at hand, leaving me to assault the roadside (and, it turned out, the side of the bus) at god knows how many kilometers per hour. To my everlasting horror, I realized at the next rest stop that the occupant below me was fast asleep next to his open window. A flying toilet would have been much more difficult for this reader: I started feeling sick six hours before my flight was scheduled to leave Nairobi, but I convinced myself it was nothing serious. A half hour or so into the flight, I was hit with the worst-imaginable stomach cramps. A cramp would hit, and I’d curl up in a ball for a few seconds of relief. Then another cramp would hit, and I’d stretch as much as I could for a few seconds of relief, etc., etc. Continue Reading The steward saw I was in distress (I was lying on the floor by then) and announced in business class that there was a sick person in coach who needed more room and asked for a volunteer to trade seats. Miracle! A kind person swapped his/her large, comfortable, expensive seat for my tiny one. I don’t know how I would have survived the 12-hour flight to London if I hadn’t been able to stretch out. I was too out of it to ask who the person was, but I am eternally grateful for his/her compassion. I had an 18-hour layover in London, where the bedrest revived me enough to make it to Chicago and finally home to Portland, where I was diagnosed with typhoid fever.   Courtney had a helluva time meeting new family: In 2007 I was studying in Europe for graduate school. I had about a month off around Christmas to do whatever I please. My mom is from Germany originally and I, at 26, had never met my grandpa, aunts, and uncles. So when I randomly called my grandpa asking if I could visit for Christmas, I got more than an enthusiastic yes. As I was leaving Amsterdam to head to Munich, a snowstorm invaded and I missed my connecting flight in Copenhagen. But I was quickly booked on the next flight out to Munich, although my luggage didn’t make it. About an hour before landing the pilot made an announcement that the wheels were frozen in the aircraft and we were unable to land. We were descending and you could visibly feel the wheels try to force themselves out. The pilot, however, insisted we would make the landing in the second attempt. WOMP!—that's the sound the landing gear made as it sadly failed at trying to come out the second time. Whoosh!—the plane takes off again midair while I notice the mother to my right reading the emergency evacuation to her children. Then the pilot informs us it’s just too cold and we’re going to have to land in Stuttgart. We do. But then the whole plane has to board a bus and trek to Munich for four hours. I can’t call my grandpa—who, remind you, I am meeting for the first time—so I borrow a random phone to let him know what’s going on. In the end, I make it to Munich at 5am to a more-than-happy-to-meet-me grandpa. Talk about making a great first impression! But my luggage didn’t for another three days. Not as awkward as this first visit to meet German relatives: Here’s one last reader, Nicole, who ends on an uplifting note: I left town on a whim. No planning, no expectations—and most importantly, as always—no traveling companion. Just me, my thoughts, my desires, and my money. On Thursday afternoon during my lunch hour, I booked a room downtown in Montreal, just off Saint Catherine. On Friday after work, I headed north out of Vermont. Immediately upon my arrival, I noticed a wild party in the center square, Place Émilie-Gamelin. House music, flashing lights, half-dressed men in leather—Holy stroke of luck! Fierté Montréal! Gay Pride weekend! Just need to drop off my bags! A block to the hotel, and … The front desk attendant spoke only French. We flung incomprehensible words at each other until we landed on one we both understood: “Reservation?” “Yes! Yes, I have a reservation!” I replied. “Nom de famille?” she asked. I showed her my credit card to display my name. She looked at me and shook her head. “Un moment,” she said as she picked up the telephone. She spoke a few sentences in French to the person on the other line, and then handed me the phone. “Hello?” “Nicola?” said the masculine voice on the other line. “Yes?” “Sorry. We did not think you were coming. We cancel your reservation.” “What? Cancelled? WHY?” “Check-in is 3.” “So it’s MANDATORY check in at 3.” “Sorry, cancelled. If you would like to rebook, it’s $390.” “$390? My original reservation was for $265.” “Yes, but now this is late booking. Price increased.” I was decidedly irritated. But honestly, what could I do? I was in another country, it was Pride weekend, and I had no internet or cell phone. “Fine. $390.” “And you need to pay cash.” “Cash? I don’t HAVE cash. I only have a credit card on me. I barely just arrived in the country.” “You can use the cash machine to take money,” he said. “If you want to use credit card, there is an additional 10%, so it will be $429.” “Ok, no. Cash it is. I just need to find an ATM.” I walked a block away, found an ATM, withdrew $500, and returned to the hotel. “$395.” “$395? You just told me $390.” “$5 charge for the room key.” “I am alone, I don’t need an extra room key.” “Each key is $5.” “So the room comes with ZERO room keys? How would I get into the room I paid for without the key?” She shrugged her shoulders, “Sorry. No English.” Frustrated, I paid the $395, took the key and headed to my room. I put my bags down. The room was, not unsurprisingly, unkempt. Ok. Scam or not, I have no recourse for action. I have two choices here, and justice AIN’T one of them: So I can either let this ruin my trip, OR I can shake it off and just roll with it. “I choose the latter,” I thought. Many people would have argued persistently. Maybe they’d have won the room at the lower charge. Maybe not. Maybe they’d have told the front desk to get lost and tried to find another hotel. Maybe they’d have ended up spending even more money. Maybe they’d have just driven right back home. But the frustration and anger would settle on them and envelope them. And in that moment, I realized how lucky I actually am to be a person who CAN choose to shake things off. I CAN choose to be happy. And even in unjustified defeat, ultimately the ability to choose happiness is the greater reward in life. Chris Bodenner 5:15 PM / August 5, 2016 'The Interstates Turned Into a Skating Rink' A reader writes: In 1998 I drove from Austin to southern Illinois in my ‘89 Dodge Ramcharger truck. I started running into freezing rain outside of Dallas, going over Ray Hubbard Reservoir, and decided to keep going. Rather than getting better, it got worse—all the way through Texarkana and beyond. The interstates turned into a skating rink and still I kept going. The drive usually takes 15 hours, but by the time I made it 15 hours, I was only in central Arkansas. Traffic was going by at a crawl when a commercial truck passed everyone in the left lane at 35-40 mph, left the highway, and went nose-first—hard—into the median’s ravine. I stopped to check on the two guys in the truck, and one had hit his chest on the steering wheel and was not in good shape, shocky, and coughing blood. Of course nobody had cell phones, and nobody else stopped to help but me. Via sign language, I was finally able to get someone to call the state police as they drove by. The temps were in the teens and the wind was blowing at 30 mph, so I got the two guys in my truck, blasted the heater, and kept the one guy talking so he wouldn’t go unconscious. State troopers showed up, I had to fill out a statement, and I immediately went looking for a motel before they all filled up with other refugees from I-40. I stayed in a motel that wasn’t much more than a set of prefabs: a bed, a TV, a bathroom, a radio and some paneling. By that point, it was the best motel I had ever seen. The next day, when I got going again, there was a big rig in the median about every five miles. Worst driving conditions I ever traveled in.

Chris Bodenner 1:53 PM / August 4, 2016 Hug-Mugged in Ecuador A reader had a night in the capital city he’ll never forget: Back in 2008, after completing college, I went on a backpacking trip through South America. Best time I ever had. But it didn’t end well. I was in Quito, Ecuador, and I returned late to my youth hostel after getting lost. I’m a rather huge fellow, so I wasn’t much nervous about it. While standing outside the place waiting for the receptionist to wake up, two ladies approached me—and wrapped themselves around me. They did so not because of my immense allure, but rather to pickpocket me. After I felt my phone leave my pocket, I caught a hold of one of the señoras demanding it back. She took out a can of pepper spray and gave me a long extended blast to my face. So, I lost my phone. And my eyes were melting. I inhaled quite a bit of the spray, so my airway was burning. I was screaming. It didn’t end there. While stumbling around screaming and crying, I tripped over something and broke my ankle. And to cap it all, I had an allergic reaction and spent some time in a not-so-lovely hospital. As a result, I missed my flight home. And upon coming back, I discovered that my insurance claim was denied. My family still thought I was the one at fault. I still love Ecuador though. Been there twice since. Have you ever been mugged on vacation? Drop us a note and we’ll post. Update from Chris, whose terrible travel experience ended up being the best thing ever: Continue Reading I was traveling through Europe, with a plan to hang in Sevilla for a few years, or until the military junta in Burma collapsed under the strain of international sanctions and the Nobel Peach Prize that had just been awarded to Aung San Suu Kyi (this was 1991). I decided to stop in Barcelona for a few days en route to Sevilla, so I could get a sense of the city before moving on. My first night there, I was sitting on a bench on las Ramblas, watching people go by, when a guy tapped me on the shoulder and asked me if I knew where the statue of Columbus was. As it turned out, it was probably the only site I’d seen, so I pointed out where it was. Of course, while doing this, his accomplice was making off with my bag, which contained my passport and a journal I’d been keeping for several years while traveling. Shit. Next day, I went to the consulate to apply for a new passport, which I was told would take about a week. Since I’d be stuck in Barcelona for a week, I decided to call a guy whom I’d met in the Copper Canyon of Mexico several years earlier. We’d only hung out for an afternoon, but he’d given me his sister’s phone number and told me to give her a ring if I was ever in Barcelona, as she’d know where he was. I called and explained as best I could that I knew Marcos. She said, “He’s right here, hold on.” Long story short, Marcos took it upon himself to share all the best parts of Barcelona with me: his friends, his favorite spots, hikes in the Pyrenees. By the time my new passport arrived, someone had offered me a job, someone else rented me a room in his flat, and I had met a few women whom I definitely wanted to know better ... Twenty-five years later, I’m still based in Barcelona and am grateful to those thieves. Chris Bodenner 10:45 AM / August 3, 2016 Flying Into Teguci-Gulp-a Reader Adam recalls his worst travel experience: I was going back to Honduras after my honeymoon. I had a connecting flight in Miami. I went to get my bags to get through customs. They hadn’t made it yet. I couldn’t miss my flight, so off I went. Flying into Tegucigalpa was frightening, to say the least. We were all over the sky. I later found out it’s one of the worst airports to fly into. We landed safely on the ground once the pilot figured out how to pull this off. Once at the airport I came to the realization that my bags had been kept in Miami. Everything I bought on the honeymoon was lost. Here’s a bit more about Tegucigalpa’s Toncontin Airport, according to a Popular Mechanics list of the 10 most dangerous airports in the world: Aircraft have to skirt around the mountains of the interior highlands to land in a valley 3,294 feet above sea level. On approach, airliners as big as Boeing 757s make a 45-degree bank to effectively reach the 7000-foot runway with well above average rates of descent. Winds require pilots to compensate while hustling their aircraft in a zig-zag path over the terrain. Departures require high rates of climb to clear the nearby peaks. And the very worst airport to fly into? Conde Nast Traveler says it’s the one in Lukla, Nepal. That airport is featured several times in this long compilation of dicey landings: Have you ever had a harrowing landing, or an emergency situation on a plane? Drop us a note and we’ll post. *** Continue Reading Update from Paul Blackburn, who sends a great photo flying above Guatemala: Attached is a photo I took while on a medical transport in a Lear Jet Model 35, flown by REVA, an air ambulance/transport company based out of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and our branch base in Phoenix, Arizona. I was the physician on the flight, and we were banking onto final approach to the primary airport in Guatemala City, Guatemala. We were between a lower level of clouds and a higher scud layer of clouds. As we banked, I noted what I thought to be a mountain protruding through the clouds. On closer inspection, one can see that the “mountain” I briefly saw was actually a volcano, actively emitting steam and/or ash (this is apparently its usual baseline status): Chris Bodenner 6:00 PM / August 1, 2016 When Bad Weather Drowns a Business Deal Reader Greg recalls a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad work trip: Back in 1999 I’m in Zurich trying to get to Brussels for an extremely important seminar that I, as a self-employed consultant, had arranged with a Fortune 500 client. It’s my introduction to their senior management from all over Europe. A huge potential contract is in the balance. Gulp. It’s mid-August and I’m delayed three hours in a sweltering airport then two hours on a sweltering plane waiting on the tarmac for air travel in Western Europe to get over afternoon thunderstorms. I eventually fly to Amsterdam, then I’m driven to Brussels, in the heat and rain, in a full mid-size Mercedes, me middle front. Terrifying. No sleep possible. I arrived in a Brussels hotel at 4:30am. No reservation in my name. No mention of the company I was there for. No normal rooms. I rented an extended-stay suite (very nice) for 90 minutes—enough time to shower, change, and stare at the wall, thinking WTF. No one from the company is at breakfast. I don’t have anyone’s cell phone numbers. At 9am I finally contact a person in the Brussels office. “Oh, two days ago we moved the meetings to a hotel by the airport. Didn’t anyone tell you?" It was supposed to start at 8am. I arrived just after 10am, introduced myself, and started my spiel. I had to finish by noon, but my head was spinning so fast and I kept wanting to faint, so I had to lose another 15 minutes for breaks. Europe was not impressed. I was able to keep my existing work for them going, but I lost out on the huge contract. Ever have a work trip from hell? Drop us a note. Chris Bodenner 1:15 PM / August 1, 2016 'Oysters Are Still the Only Food I Won’t Eat' A reader tries to recall his worst travel experience: Let’s see, the 153AM out of Grand Central can be pretty lively, as can the first train in the morning on Sunday. Taking an overnight train in Vietnam was overrated, as it was dirty, uncomfortable, and sized for Vietnamese people. I’ve had my share of cancellations and so on, including get stuck in Denver overnight a few times, but that’s nothing unusual. My worst experience though, was flying from LA to Chicago when everyone on the plane got food poisoning, which incapacitated the pilots. It forced a fighter pilot turned taxi driver to conquer his fear of flying and save everyone on the plane. Surely he can’t be serious. This reader gets real: It’s about two weeks after 9/11 and I had been saving up for a year to travel through SE Asia to visit a friend who was working for a NGO in [Burma’s capital of] Yangon. Despite the security concerns over terrorism, I had already cleared off time at work, I was broke, and there was NO WAY I was canceling this trip. As expected, there are no “formal” travel restrictions in place, but the airports/border control are making damn sure that it’s really, really hard to travel. Essentially, it’s just a complete cluster and I’m already regretting my decision to save a little cash by flying out of Vancouver, BC instead of Seattle. Not only do I have trouble at the [Canadian border crossing in Blaine, Washington,] because the crappy Sanford & Son bus that picked us up from the sketchy part of downtown was over four hours late, but the (usually affable) Canadian agents are not happy with the quality of passengers on our bus. Many, many hours later (and a forfeited hotel room I secured for the previous evening), I made my way to the airport because it was too late to try to get a few hours of sleep. Surprisingly, I’m on a great flight to Hong Kong with no issues! Continue Reading Then I hopped a connection to Bangkok, where I would have to wait until the following morning for my flight to Yangon. Bangkok has a shiny new airport now, but in 2001, Don Mueang really wasn’t somewhere one would choose to spend time on purpose. There’s an on-site “hotel” so I figured I’d just stay there. Between the fighting/screaming from the couple in the next room (paper-thin walls), the random men who kept trying to ram their way into my room (the door barely locked), and the non-functioning lights (only light bulb in the room, about 20 watts), I may as well have just chained my bag to a chair and slept on the airport floor because I didn’t sleep a wink. I had a great time while I was in Burma (a scary-as-hell flight on Yangon Airways notwithstanding), but on the way home I reversed my route and spent some time in Bangkok at a friend-of-a-friend’s apartment while she was out of the country (nice!), and finished my trip back in Hong Kong. My NGO friend knew people in HK and one guy took me to dinner at the restaurant on top of Victoria Peak (touristy, but a great view). We decided to splurge and get some oysters because I was heading home soon, in four days. Do you know that feeling when you eat something and you know—right then and there—that it's bad? Well, that happened just as I was swallowing one of the oysters ... and it was too late. I figured I’d been building an iron constitution with all of the street cart food I’d been eating for the last couple weeks, so I wasn’t that worried. I went back to my hotel and right on cue: vomiting, chills, fever, that weird “I have food poisoning buzzing feeling,” and um ... spending some time in the bathroom. I took turns sweating out the sheets in the two single beds that were in my room, while each morning (like clockwork), a woman would bang on my door and yell: Day 1 Housekeeping: “MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. Day 2 Housekeeping: "MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. Please go away, thank you. Day 3 Housekeeping: "MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: NO. But do you have more toilet paper? Day 4 Housekeeping: “MRS (firstname)!!! PEOPLE SAY YOU VERY SICK!! WE COME CLEAN ROOM??" Me: ...... On Day 4, I had no choice but to drag my sorry butt out of the room and clamber on to a shuttle bus to the airport because my flight was leaving (for Vancouver, natch). The trip back to my apartment in Seattle was the most miserable multi-day journey I’ve ever taken. I don’t think I’ve ever cried so hard. Oysters are still the only food I won’t eat. If you also have a horror story from hors d’oeuvres, shoot us a note. In the meantime, bon appétit: I was in Barbados in a rural bar, hungry. I asked for food and they said they had one thing. And that’s how I had pickled chicken feet for dinner. It was sloshed out of a big bin. Update from Jacob, an “11th grader and avid fan of The Atlantic”: As a high school student, I haven’t had too many bad travel experiences, but this one’s a doozy, and when I saw your callout I immediately knew I had to submit. A few weeks ago, I traveled to South Korea for 10 days to present a collaborative science project with my Korean partners. My troubles started at around 5 o'clock the day before final presentations. We had just finished reviewing critique of our rehearsal when I suddenly began to feel sick to my stomach. Wanting to go back to my room, I went to notify Jeong-Minh, the director of the program, and was in the midst of a conversation with her in the hallway when a roiling wave of nausea hit me. I sprinted to the trash can, doubled over, and projectile vomited not one, not two, but three whole times in a spray of half-digested Korean food. Jeong-Minh just barely had the presence of mind to leap backward out of the splash zone. Hoping against hope this was just a one-and-done vomiting session, I fled back to my dormitory, only to spend the next day vomiting violently into a pink Hello-Kitty trash can with the worst case of food poisoning since the Borgias. I’m never going to be able to look at that damn cat again without a degree of horror. I would upchuck into the can, manage to fall back into a light sleep in that refractory period of relief just after a bout of vomiting, then wake up 30 minutes later to bend myself back over Hello Kitty and loose another wave. Eventually I was just dry heaving little trickles of bile. It was the sickest I’ve ever been in my life. I stopped vomiting after 24 hours, but my stomach was an achy mess for the rest of the trip, and I was holed up against my will in the dormitory for most of it, taking Buzzfeed quizzes to distract myself from the fact that it still felt like Kim Jong was conducting a nuclear weapons test in my intestines. I’m not sure why the universe saw fit to punish me that way. I have a sneaking suspicion that my weak little white stomach couldn’t handle the platters of traditional Korean food I'd been tucking away the entire trip. It must have been those “specialty” highland mushrooms. Chris Bodenner 8:45 AM / August 1, 2016 A Trip Through Eastern Europe Turns South A reader’s memory of a hellish trip to Istanbul still sounds fresh: In the early ‘90s, my young husband and I thrived on traveling as frugally as possible. We were traveling from Scandinavia and our goal was to make it to Istanbul. On a train from Poland to Romania, we were warned by a fellow tourist not to change money on the black market, because the undercover police “may arrest you.” Armed with that information, we arrived at the train station on a Sunday, eager to purchase our tickets to Istanbul and leave Romania as quickly as possible. The “Official Money Station" was manned when we approached to change our currency. “No money,” he shrugged and waved us away. With no Romanian currency, we had no money for food, lodging, or train tickets. A friendly young Romanian man approached offering to help us change money on the black market. He promised he was not a police officer. Continue Reading He told us he knew of a bus station that would take us from Bucharest to Istanbul. He led us out of the station and around a corner to a small bus ticket station, and, while he practiced English with my husband, I hand-signaled with an older woman enough for her to accept my $20 USD for our ride out. When we informed our friendly translator/guide that we no longer required his services, he kicked my husband in the shin (my husband was a towering 6'4”) and declared that he would “get his gun and come back to shoot us.” We were completely terror-stricken. The locals, who spoke no English, just looked at us and smiled while we ran to duck behind the ticket counter. The proprietor followed us back and said: “Me Turk. No problem.” Then he opened his top drawer to reveal a machete. We were relieved and willing when the un-air-conditioned, broken-down bus arrived to take us away, shuttling us to a standard-looking coach bus filled with Italian tourists. Everyone smoked cigarettes. Music blared. Not a word of English was spoken. There was no toilet on the bus. We made it as far as the border of Bulgaria. The bus stopped and turned off the engine in a long trail of cars and buses. Apparently everyone who was supposed to be working the border was preoccupied watching the World Cup Soccer Championship matches.   For nine hours, all traffic was halted while the games played. We exited the bus and wandered across streams of garbage and gypsy children playing on train tracks. Hours later on the bus, mosquitos buzzing, my husband finally fell asleep, but I was desperate to pee. The driver escorted me off the bus and watched me urinate. Then he put his arm around me and attempted to invite me to join him somewhere else. I elbowed him with all of my might and jumped back on the bus. I shook my husband out of his slumber and did not allow him to sleep after that. The border crossing finally reopened. They collected our passports and handed each passenger two cartons of cigarettes and eight bottles of alcohol to carry as contraband mules across the border. They stocked the back of the bus, and our passports were returned. Twenty-five hours later, I saw the minarets and knew we had arrived. I developed a migraine and threw up. But at least we made it to Istanbul. Bonus anecdote from another reader, in Ukraine: I’m 19 years old on train from Lviv to Kiev. It’s an overnighter and I’m booked in a 2nd class sleeper car which has four bunks on each side. I’m scared out of my mind when I realize I’m the only woman in the compartment. The men see that I’m freaking out and find a translator to explain (actual words): “We want to reassure you that your body is safe and we will not rape you as you sleep.” Thanks?   Chris Bodenner 2:45 PM / July 29, 2016 Tell Us: What's Your Worst Travel Experience? A bunch of Atlantic readers in this discussion group are exchanging their travel horror stories. (If you’d like to sharing your own, please send us a note: hello@theatlantic.com.) A short anecdote from the group: I caught bronchitis when I was in Germany for a business trip. Spent the plane ride home sitting next to a strange drunk man who kept talking at me. Intolerable Cruelty starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta-Jones was the in-flight movie. I wanted to die. Another reader shares that sentiment: I was stuck in the snowbound Omaha airport with a three year old, a chihuahua, and a small carryon bag, for TWO DAYS. That was the ninth circle of hell. I wanted to die. This next reader nearly did, for real: Peace Corps: On a bus in Guatemala. A group of three teens in MS-13 [a notorious gang] decide to rob our bus. Being the only American on the bus and having just gone to the bank, I took all the money I had hidden in my bra and put it in my pocket ready to be robbed. People would get shot if they tried to run, so I prepared to give everything and pulled my passport out of its hiding spot in my bag so I made sure they knew they were getting it. Then some dude decided to John Wayne and open fire on these robbers, which resulted in a firefight on a very crowded bus. I had actually been the next passenger to be robbed, so the perp standing next to me was actively shooting. I dove under the seat and stayed there until literally everyone else had gotten off the bus. Bonus trip: I got a lightly armored security escort back to the embassy. This reader’s experience is much more relatable: I travel for work, so I have A LOT of these stories. I have two that beat out all of the other minor upsets though: Continue Reading 1) I started a flight with a guy interrupting me while I was reading just so he could tell me that he “might grab my knee” because he’s “afraid of flying.” I replied, “the fuck you will.” Then he proceeded to vape for the entire flight. When I pointed out that it’s a federal crime to do that, he said he had really bad cravings. AND THEN, as he was deplaning, he hit his lady-friend square on her read end ... it was the cherry on top of a disturbing trip. 2) THE WORST was when I was flying from Chicago to Manchester last October. The man sitting next to me spread all over my seat, took off his shoes, AND unbuttoned his pants. And when I asked to get out to use the restroom, he suggested that I just “climb over my lap, baby.” Another reader, Nick, also had a creepy encounter: On a six-hour train ride in China, a man stared at me the entire fucking time. Like literally he didn’t move his eyes off me. I don’t know if that was worse than the time I was really sick on a transatlantic flight, but it was definitely the weirdest. This next reader thinks back to Memorial Day weekend in the late ‘90s: I’m living on Long Island and using what precious little vacation and holiday time I have to visit my LDR girlfriend in Rochester. I have my friend drop me off at JFK in the late afternoon with maybe an hour to spare before boarding (plenty of time, as this is pre-TSA). As I’m waiting, the delays start piling up on the info screen because of some freak storm over half of the country, though the local weather is fine. My flight gets delayed, of course. Over the next few hours, the delay gets pushed further and further back. Finally, it gets cancelled. But by then it’s way too late to call any of my friends to pick me up. So I can either spend the night in pre-renovated JFK, or take a two-hour train ride home so I can sleep in my own bed for a few hours before trying again in the morning. Both options suck, but I figure some sleep is better than none and head out to the train. Now we come to the actual bad part. I have to take a rail shuttle from the airport to the station, then take two different subway rides into Penn Station, where I can catch a LIRR train to take me home. The first ride is uneventful. On the second one, however, I’m joined by a couple of young women a few seats in front of me, a younger man who goes to the back, and another younger man who does not take a seat but quickly sets to trying to impress the two women. Also worth noting is that I’m the only person on board who isn’t black. The young hotshot starts sort-of-rapping about how tough and badass he is. The women seem unimpressed as far as I can tell, but really this whole time I’ve just been trying very hard to focus on the Robert Anton Wilson book I’m reading. Hotshot changes tactics and tries to impress them by provoking me into a fight. He gets in my face and taunts me for being in the wrong place or something, but I just shake my head and keep my eyes on my book. The train slows and starts to pull up to the next platform. He disappears behind me, and a few seconds later something hard hits me in the back of my head. At this point I’m exhausted, frustrated, and already very angry about the flight situation. I was running on fumes and adrenaline. So when I got hit, something in me just snapped. I remember folding the book and putting it down. Thoughts about my physical abilities versus his and the possibility that he may have a weapon immediately popped up. The angry animal part of my brain was in charge, though, so I disregarded them just as quickly. I stood up and turned around to face whatever this guy thought he was going to do to me. The doors are open and he is gone. At my feet is the small, depleted corn cob from a discarded KFC meal box. I wipe some bits of kernel from the back of my head and neck. The women and guy from the back all rush over to me to make sure I’m okay. After we’re all sure I’m fine, the guy says, “It’s too bad he ran off. I was going to hold him so you could kick his ass.” More Notes From The Atlantic Poem of the Day: ‘Barbara Frietchie’ by John Greenleaf Wh...

At the terminal you were going to be able to search tens of millions of books and read every page of any book you found.

Let the betting pools begin: What will be the next policy issue that Donald Trump suddenly discovers is way more complicated than “anyone” ever imagined? Already, the aggressively policy-ignorant president has marveled that dealing with touchy issues such as North Korea, China, the Ex-Im bank, Syria, and health care, requires more than trash talk and an itchy Twitter finger. And, while he has yet to break the bad news to the dying coal towns that backed him, Trump has been meeting with energy execs, some of whom have had to gently explain that, when it comes to saving the industry, there’s not all that much he can do. Because—all together now!—it’s complicated. As it turns out, no matter how much reality TV experience one brings to the table, one cannot simply snap one’s fingers and instantly solve the nation’s most vexing problems. Continue Reading Justin Fantl How Online Shopping Makes Suckers of Us All Jerry Useem Will you pay more for those shoes before 7 p.m.? Would the price tag be different if you lived in the suburbs? Standard prices and simple discounts are giving way to far more exotic strategies, designed to extract every last dollar from the consumer. As Christmas approached in 2015, the price of pumpkin-pie spice went wild. It didn’t soar, as an economics textbook might suggest. Nor did it crash. It just started vibrating between two quantum states. Amazon’s price for a one-ounce jar was either $4.49 or $8.99, depending on when you looked. Nearly a year later, as Thanksgiving 2016 approached, the price again began whipsawing between two different points, this time $3.36 and $4.69. We live in the age of the variable airfare, the surge-priced ride, the pay-what-you-want Radiohead album, and other novel price developments. But what was this? Some weird computer glitch? More like a deliberate glitch, it seems. “It’s most likely a strategy to get more data and test the right price,” Guru Hariharan explained, after I had sketched the pattern on a whiteboard.

You saw the pictures in science class—a profile view of the human brain, sectioned by function. The piece at the very front, right behind where a forehead would be if the brain were actually in someone’s head, is the pre-frontal cortex. It handles problem-solving, goal-setting, and task execution. And it works with the limbic system, which is connected and sits closer to the center of the brain. The limbic system processes emotions and triggers emotional responses, in part because of its storage of long-term memory. When a person lives in poverty, a growing body of research suggests the limbic system is constantly sending fear and stress messages to the prefrontal cortex, which overloads its ability to solve problems, set goals, and complete tasks in the most efficient ways. Continue Reading Mary Schwalm / Reuters Rifts Over Abortion and Economic Populism Threaten to Divide Democrats Clare Foran A debate over what it means to be a progressive is front-and-center as the party tries to rebuild. Democrats are facing their first high-profile tests of whether the party can win back seats in Congress in the Trump era. But rather than unifying in opposition to the new administration, the political left is riven by division over what it means to be progressive. The same debates that divided Democrats throughout the 2016 presidential primary—over how and when to prioritize economic populism and reproductive rights—threaten to make it more difficult for Democrats to rally around the very candidates who could help the party make inroads in conservative parts of the country. Controversy over those questions illustrates the challenge Democrats face as they decide which candidates to support, and what transgressions from liberal convictions to let slide, as the party tries to rebuild after being shut out of power in the White House and Congress.

Here are some of the things Bill O’Reilly has done, allegedly, to the women he has worked with throughout his two decades at the Fox News Channel: approaching an African American woman whose desk was near his, referring to her as “hot chocolate,” and grunting like a “wild boar” offering multiple unwanted sexual advances and lewd comments to a woman producer on his show, phoning her “when it sounded as if he was masturbating” and describing “various sexual fantasies” suggesting that she “buy a vibrator,” “engage in phone sex or a threesome with him,” and listen to “the details of his alleged sexual encounters with a cabana masseuse, airline stewardesses, and Thai sex-show workers” threatening to make any woman who dared to complain about his behavior “pay so dearly that she’ll wish she’d never been born” Continue Reading Eric Gay / AP The World’s Strangest Mammal Can Survive 18 Minutes Without Oxygen Ed Yong That’s just one of the naked mole-rat’s many bizarre abilities. Oxygen makes up around 20 percent of the air around you. If it fell to 5 percent, you’d pass out after 3 minutes or so. Then, your brain would start to die. To fuel itself, this gas-guzzling organ requires a constant supply of sugar and oxygen—even when you’re not doing anything. Without the vital gas, ions flood across the barriers of neurons, causing internal havoc, and forcing them to self-destruct. “There’s probably more than a hundred things that will kill brain cells if you turn off the oxygen,” says Thomas Park, from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Within minutes, you’d be dead. And hours after that, a naked mole-rat in the exact same conditions would be happily walking around—the picture of health. Imagine a disembodied index finger that’s been soaking in the bath for too long, and has teeth at the end. That’s a naked mole-rat. These weird rodents live in large underground colonies with nesting chambers the size of footballs. In these cramped subterranean quarters, oxygen levels often fall as low as 6 percent. And yet, these animals cope with this hypoxia.

There might be no getting around what Albert Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” With an experiment described this week in Physical Review Letters—a feat that involved harnessing starlight to control measurements of particles shot between buildings in Vienna—some of the world’s leading cosmologists and quantum physicists are closing the door on an intriguing alternative to “quantum entanglement.” “Technically, this experiment is truly impressive,” said Nicolas Gisin, a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva who has studied this loophole around entanglement. Continue Reading Oliver Munday Mexico’s Revenge Franklin Foer By antagonizing the U.S.’s neighbor to the south, Donald Trump has made the classic bully’s error: He has underestimated his victim. When Donald Trump first made sport of thumping Mexico—when he accused America’s neighbor of exporting rapists and “bad hombres,” when he deemed the country such a threat that it should be contained by a wall and so clueless that it could be suckered into paying for its own encasement—its president responded with strange equilibrium. Enrique Peña Nieto treated the humiliation like a meteorological disturbance. Relations with the United States would soon return to normal, if only he grinned his way through the painful episode. In August, Peña Nieto invited Trump to Mexico City, based on the then-contrarian notion that Trump might actually become president. Instead of branding Trump a toxic threat to Mexico’s well-being, he lavished the Republican nominee with legitimacy. Peña Nieto paid a severe, perhaps mortal, reputational cost for his magnanimity. Before the meeting, former President Vicente Fox had warned Peña Nieto that if he went soft on Trump, history would remember him as a “traitor.” In the months following the meeting, his approval rating plummeted, falling as low as 12 percent in one poll—which put his popularity on par with Trump’s own popularity among Mexicans. The political lesson was clear enough: No Mexican leader could abide Trump’s imprecations and hope to thrive. Since then, the Mexican political elite has begun to ponder retaliatory measures that would reassert the country’s dignity, and perhaps even cause the Trump administration to reverse its hostile course. With a presidential election in just over a year—and Peña Nieto prevented by term limits from running again—vehement responses to Trump are considered an electoral necessity. Memos outlining policies that could wound the United States have begun flying around Mexico City. These show that Trump has committed the bully’s error of underestimating the target of his gibes. As it turns out, Mexico could hurt the United States very badly. Continue Reading Justin Fantl Frank and Steven’s Excellent Corporate-Raiding Adventure Frank Partnoy and Steven Davidoff Solomon Two law professors tried to mimic big activist hedge funds, investing their retirement savings in a small, languishing public company and trying to shake it up. Here’s what happened. If we had showered or shaved or not been dressed in wrinkled shirts, we would have gotten out of our rented Hyundai to speak with the man in the blue blazer who was walking into the Balboa Bay Resort, a hotel and private club in Newport Beach, California. It was Gregory S. Bielli, the president and CEO of the Tejon Ranch Company. We’d met him once before, when we were in a better frame of mind. Tejon Ranch is a small public company headquartered in Lebec, about an hour north of Los Angeles, and its main asset is obvious from Interstate 5: real estate.

Books still in print you’d have to pay for, but everything else—a collection slated to grow larger than the holdings at the Library of Congress, Harvard, the University of Michigan, at any of the great national libraries of Europe—would have been available for free at terminals that were going to be placed in every local library that wanted one. At the terminal you were going to be able to search tens of millions of books and read every page of any book you found. You’d be able to highlight passages and make annotations and share them; for the first time, you’d be able to pinpoint an idea somewhere inside the vastness of the printed record, and send somebody straight to it with a link. Books would become as instantly available, searchable, copy-pasteable—as alive in the digital world—as web pages. Continue Reading Kevin Lamarque / Reuters Trump Realizes Being President Is Hard Michelle Cottle The 45th president’s journey of discovery could be a public service, if it helps bring his supporters to greater understanding of the complexities of governing. Let the betting pools begin: What will be the next policy issue that Donald Trump suddenly discovers is way more complicated than “anyone” ever imagined? Already, the aggressively policy-ignorant president has marveled that dealing with touchy issues such as North Korea, China, the Ex-Im bank, Syria, and health care, requires more than trash talk and an itchy Twitter finger. And, while he has yet to break the bad news to the dying coal towns that backed him, Trump has been meeting with energy execs, some of whom have had to gently explain that, when it comes to saving the industry, there’s not all that much he can do. Because—all together now!—it’s complicated. As it turns out, no matter how much reality TV experience one brings to the table, one cannot simply snap one’s fingers and instantly solve the nation’s most vexing problems. Continue Reading Justin Fantl How Online Shopping Makes Suckers of Us All Jerry Useem Will you pay more for those shoes before 7 p.m.? Would the price tag be different if you lived in the suburbs? Standard prices and simple discounts are giving way to far more exotic strategies, designed to extract every last dollar from the consumer. As Christmas approached in 2015, the price of pumpkin-pie spice went wild. It didn’t soar, as an economics textbook might suggest. Nor did it crash. It just started vibrating between two quantum states. Amazon’s price for a one-ounce jar was either $4.49 or $8.99, depending on when you looked. Nearly a year later, as Thanksgiving 2016 approached, the price again began whipsawing between two different points, this time $3.36 and $4.69. We live in the age of the variable airfare, the surge-priced ride, the pay-what-you-want Radiohead album, and other novel price developments. But what was this? Some weird computer glitch? More like a deliberate glitch, it seems. “It’s most likely a strategy to get more data and test the right price,” Guru Hariharan explained, after I had sketched the pattern on a whiteboard. Continue Reading Alastair Grant / AP How Poverty Changes the Brain Tara García Mathewson The early results out of a Boston nonprofit are positive. You saw the pictures in science class—a profile view of the human brain, sectioned by function. The piece at the very front, right behind where a forehead would be if the brain were actually in someone’s head, is the pre-frontal cortex. It handles problem-solving, goal-setting, and task execution. And it works with the limbic system, which is connected and sits closer to the center of the brain. The limbic system processes emotions and triggers emotional responses, in part because of its storage of long-term memory. When a person lives in poverty, a growing body of research suggests the limbic system is constantly sending fear and stress messages to the prefrontal cortex, which overloads its ability to solve problems, set goals, and complete tasks in the most efficient ways. Continue Reading Mary Schwalm / Reuters Rifts Over Abortion and Economic Populism Threaten to Divide Democrats Clare Foran A debate over what it means to be a progressive is front-and-center as the party tries to rebuild. Democrats are facing their first high-profile tests of whether the party can win back seats in Congress in the Trump era. But rather than unifying in opposition to the new administration, the political left is riven by division over what it means to be progressive. The same debates that divided Democrats throughout the 2016 presidential primary—over how and when to prioritize economic populism and reproductive rights—threaten to make it more difficult for Democrats to rally around the very candidates who could help the party make inroads in conservative parts of the country. Controversy over those questions illustrates the challenge Democrats face as they decide which candidates to support, and what transgressions from liberal convictions to let slide, as the party tries to rebuild after being shut out of power in the White House and Congress. Continue Reading Richard Drew / AP Why Was Bill O'Reilly Really Fired? Megan Garber The host’s ouster serves as an object lesson about what happens when morality and money come to a head. Here are some of the things Bill O’Reilly has done, allegedly, to the women he has worked with throughout his two decades at the Fox News Channel: approaching an African American woman whose desk was near his, referring to her as “hot chocolate,” and grunting like a “wild boar” offering multiple unwanted sexual advances and lewd comments to a woman producer on his show, phoning her “when it sounded as if he was masturbating” and describing “various sexual fantasies” suggesting that she “buy a vibrator,” “engage in phone sex or a threesome with him,” and listen to “the details of his alleged sexual encounters with a cabana masseuse, airline stewardesses, and Thai sex-show workers” threatening to make any woman who dared to complain about his behavior “pay so dearly that she’ll wish she’d never been born” Continue Reading Eric Gay / AP The World’s Strangest Mammal Can Survive 18 Minutes Without Oxygen Ed Yong That’s just one of the naked mole-rat’s many bizarre abilities. Oxygen makes up around 20 percent of the air around you. If it fell to 5 percent, you’d pass out after 3 minutes or so. Then, your brain would start to die. To fuel itself, this gas-guzzling organ requires a constant supply of sugar and oxygen—even when you’re not doing anything. Without the vital gas, ions flood across the barriers of neurons, causing internal havoc, and forcing them to self-destruct. “There’s probably more than a hundred things that will kill brain cells if you turn off the oxygen,” says Thomas Park, from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Within minutes, you’d be dead. And hours after that, a naked mole-rat in the exact same conditions would be happily walking around—the picture of health. Imagine a disembodied index finger that’s been soaking in the bath for too long, and has teeth at the end. That’s a naked mole-rat. These weird rodents live in large underground colonies with nesting chambers the size of footballs. In these cramped subterranean quarters, oxygen levels often fall as low as 6 percent. And yet, these animals cope with this hypoxia. Continue Reading Olena Shmahalo / Quanta Magazine The Universe Is as Spooky as Einstein Thought Natalie Wolchover In a brilliant new experiment, physicists have confirmed one of the most mysterious laws of the cosmos. There might be no getting around what Albert Einstein called “spooky action at a distance.” With an experiment described this week in Physical Review Letters—a feat that involved harnessing starlight to control measurements of particles shot between buildings in Vienna—some of the world’s leading cosmologists and quantum physicists are closing the door on an intriguing alternative to “quantum entanglement.” “Technically, this experiment is truly impressive,” said Nicolas Gisin, a quantum physicist at the University of Geneva who has studied this loophole around entanglement. Continue Reading Oliver Munday Mexico’s Revenge Franklin Foer By antagonizing the U.S.’s neighbor to the south, Donald Trump has made the classic bully’s error: He has underestimated his victim. When Donald Trump first made sport of thumping Mexico—when he accused America’s neighbor of exporting rapists and “bad hombres,” when he deemed the country such a threat that it should be contained by a wall and so clueless that it could be suckered into paying for its own encasement—its president responded with strange equilibrium. Enrique Peña Nieto treated the humiliation like a meteorological disturbance. Relations with the United States would soon return to normal, if only he grinned his way through the painful episode. In August, Peña Nieto invited Trump to Mexico City, based on the then-contrarian notion that Trump might actually become president. Instead of branding Trump a toxic threat to Mexico’s well-being, he lavished the Republican nominee with legitimacy. Peña Nieto paid a severe, perhaps mortal, reputational cost for his magnanimity. Before the meeting, former President Vicente Fox had warned Peña Nieto that if he went soft on Trump, history would remember him as a “traitor.” In the months following the meeting, his approval rating plummeted, falling as low as 12 percent in one poll—which put his popularity on par with Trump’s own popularity among Mexicans. The political lesson was clear enough: No Mexican leader could abide Trump’s imprecations and hope to thrive. Since then, the Mexican political elite has begun to ponder retaliatory measures that would reassert the country’s dignity, and perhaps even cause the Trump administration to reverse its hostile course. With a presidential election in just over a year—and Peña Nieto prevented by term limits from running again—vehement responses to Trump are considered an electoral necessity. Memos outlining policies that could wound the United States have begun flying around Mexico City. These show that Trump has committed the bully’s error of underestimating the target of his gibes. As it turns out, Mexico could hurt the United States very badly. Continue Reading Justin Fantl Frank and Steven’s Excellent Corporate-Raiding Adventure Frank Partnoy and Steven Davidoff Solomon Two law professors tried to mimic big activist hedge funds, investing their retirement savings in a small, languishing public company and trying to shake it up. Here’s what happened. If we had showered or shaved or not been dressed in wrinkled shirts, we would have gotten out of our rented Hyundai to speak with the man in the blue blazer who was walking into the Balboa Bay Resort, a hotel and private club in Newport Beach, California. It was Gregory S. Bielli, the president and CEO of the Tejon Ranch Company. We’d met him once before, when we were in a better frame of mind. Tejon Ranch is a small public company headquartered in Lebec, about an hour north of Los Angeles, and its main asset is obvious from Interstate 5: real estate. The company owns the largest continuous expanse of private land in California, a 270,000-acre parcel—about half the size of Rhode Island—wedged between two national forests, Los Padres and Sequoia.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print United headed for the T&I hot seat By Tanya Snyder and Brianna Gurciullo 04/20/17 10:00 AM EDT With help from Stephanie Beasley, Lauren Gardner and Kathryn A. Wolfe UNITED HEADING FOR THE T&I HOT SEAT: The House Transportation Committee will, “in the coming days,” set up a hearing on airline consumer issues. The hearing, announced Wednesday, is sure to provide an ample forum for airing grievances about a United Airlines customer being pulled off a plane this month. United will testify, Reuters reports. Story Continued Below QUITE A TRIO: As the Trump administration hustles to seize a big policy win, making changes to the tax code remains high on the GOP priority list. While Plan A would be a total tax code overhaul, Plan B would be tax cuts. Both, as Pro Tax’s Brian Faler reports, would be heavy lifts for Congress. And any movement on taxes will have implications for a potential infrastructure package. President Donald Trump has suggested that he would even be interested in tacking infrastructure onto a tax bill to help win over Democrats. Strategery: Stephen Moore, who advised the Trump campaign on tax issues, told Brian that GOP lawmakers should promote legislation that cuts small business and corporate taxes and maybe includes money for infrastructure as a job-making machine. “The big beneficiaries of business tax cuts will be workers,” Moore said. “We’re cutting taxes for employers so they can create more jobs — that’s the argument.” IT’S THURSDAY: Thanks for tuning in to POLITICO’s Morning Transportation, your daily tipsheet on all things trains, planes, automobiles and ports.

POLITICO Event — Rebuilding America: A New Infrastructure Agenda — Join POLITICO for a discussion on the prospects for a major national infrastructure push from the new administration and Congress. Speakers include: Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Building America’s Future President Marcia Hale, Club for Growth President David McIntosh, and Chamber of Commerce ED Transportation Infrastructure Ed Mortimer. Monday, April 24 — 5:30 p.m. — The Newseum. RSVP: here. EMIRATES CUTS BACK: The largest Middle Eastern airline announced Wednesday that it will cut back services to the United States, claiming reduced demand on the heels of the Trump administration issuing policies targeting airports and foreign nationals from the Middle East and North Africa. Emirates’ service cuts will affect five of 12 domestic destinations beginning in May, the Associated Press reports. The announcement comes after moves by the administration to impose a visa ban on people traveling from certain countries and to limit the use of larger electronics during nonstop flights from certain foreign airports to the United States. The latter policy affects a slew of Mideast carriers. But not Etihad: A spokesman for Etihad Airways said it hasn’t seen any “significant change in demand” for flights to U.S. markets, and that in fact demand “continues to remain strong … on all 45 weekly services between Abu Dhabi and its six U.S. gateways of New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Dallas.” This summer Etihad said it plans to upgrade its Abu Dhabi-to-New York service to an A380, demonstrating “our ongoing commitment to the US market regardless of recent developments.” World domination … just like cats: The Partnership for Open & Fair Skies was quick to jump on the Emirates news. “The fact is, market demand has never played a role when the Gulf carriers decide where to fly,” group spokeswoman Jill Zuckman said in a statement. “It is well known that the Gulf carriers, including Emirates, lose money on most of their flights to the United States and are propped up by billions of dollars in government cash. Their business model is based on growing their networks without regard to profitability in order to serve their governments’ goals to dominate global aviation.” Slice of PI: The partnership has retained Chesapeake Enterprises’ Scott Reed to lobby on issues related to Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways. Our friends at POLITICO Influence report: “The coalition spent more than $6 million with four firms — the Dewey Square Group, SKDKnickerbocker, the Messina Group and Beacon Global Strategies — in 2015, according to a previous tax filing, but none of the firms were registered to lobby for the group.” MAKING A LIST, CHECKING IT TWICE: The Trump administration must keep re-evaluating whether it needs a travel ban and visa restrictions aimed at majority-Muslim countries, former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said at the U.S. Travel Association’s Secure Tourism Summit on Wednesday in New York City. Johnson warned that indefinitely suspending refugees and visa grants could be detrimental to “a lot of innocent people,” as well as harmful to international travel and business. Johnson and BFF Kelly: Johnson said he hasn’t been in contact with the new administration regarding any recent security actions, but he is chummy with current DHS head John Kelly. As our Stephanie Beasley reports for Pros, one area where the two friends seem to disagree: messaging. Kelly said Tuesday that “we are under attack from criminals who think their greed justifies raping young girls at knife point” and other heinous acts. Johnson in essence rejected that approach, saying “I do not believe that a message like, ‘They’re coming to kill us,’ is particularly helpful.” PRIVATE EYES, THEY’RE WATCHING YOU: Beware when using non-secure wireless networks overseas — that was the message from Jay Kramer, a supervisory special agent at the FBI’s New York cyber division, when he spoke Wednesday at the Secure Tourism Summit. Stephanie reports that Kramer warned U.S. government officials and corporate executives are at an especially high risk of being targeted by foreign intelligence agents. “You should assume that your communications are monitored, depending on the sophistication of the host country,” he said. SMART CITIES COULD END ‘SOFT TARGETS’: One of the best ways cities can prevent people from becoming so-called soft targets for terrorists, as in the recent truck attack in Stockholm, is to keep them far away from vehicles, former DHS assistant policy secretary David Heyman said Wednesday. During the Secure Tourism Summit, he advised cities to not only redesign public landscaping to separate crowds from traffic, but to also install wireless light sensors and network probes known as “sniffers” at entry and exit points of buildings. He suggested funding for smart city security measures be part of a national infrastructure investment plan. As always, Stephanie has Pros covered. MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY: General Motors, Boeing and FedEx were among the companies that made donations to Trump’s inaugural committee, a Federal Election Commission filing shows. Here are contributions that caught our eye: Boeing, $1 million; FedEx, $502,320; GM, $498,650; Pilot Travel Centers LLC, $300,000; Ford, $250,000; Anheuser-Busch, $250,000; UPS, $250,000; and Florida East Coast Industries (the parent of All Aboard Florida), $25,000. Plus: Richard LeFrak, who is involved in the White House’s infrastructure plans, and his sons together donated $250,000 to the inauguration. Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.), the chairman of the House Transportation economic development subcommittee, gave $1,300. Barletta was a member of the Trump transition team’s executive committee and a candidate for Transportation and Labor secretary. START SPREADING THE NEWS: Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao got an invitation Wednesday to tour the New York / New Jersey infrastructure that would be affected by the Gateway Program. All four senators from the two states sent a letter to Chao asking her to “visit New York Penn Station and inspect the Hudson River tunnels and the Portal Bridge with us prior to unveiling the Trump administration’s $1 trillion infrastructure proposal.” Tanya has the full rundown for Pros. Chao WILL check it out: DOT told MT that Chao plans to “tour a number of the country’s nationally significant infrastructure projects, including the Gateway project.” The department added that “many” of its agencies are “actively engaged with the Gateway project including being on-site and participating in regular meetings with program officials.” Also of note: DOT said that Chao has chosen James Ray, who holds the recently established title of senior adviser to the secretary for infrastructure, to be DOT’s representative on the Gateway Program Development Corporation’s board. Some bipartisan support for Gateway: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie appeared with Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) at a Wednesday press conference that largely revolved around Gateway. POLITICO New Jersey’s Ryan Hutchins reports that Christie said: “I’ve already spoken to the president about this. The president is well aware of my point of view on this project, and I absolutely will continue to speak my mind on this — both publicly and privately.” WHAT'S BOXER UP TO? Former California Sen. Barbara Boxer, who led Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee, has taken a job helping a “lobbying effort to build a controversial desalination plant in Huntington Beach,” California Playbook reports. The project developer “will rely on the two Democrats to help blunt opposition from environmentalists, many of whom have raised objections to desalination for the energy it requires and the sea life it disrupts,” our California colleagues report. “Proponents say the project would provide another source of drinking water to a region where fresh water can be difficult to come by.” NLC TO CITIES: START PLANNING FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS: Widespread use of autonomous cars is closer than you think, the National League of Cities says, and the organization is urging municipalities to get planning, including asking citizens how they feel about the coming shift. In a new report, NLC suggests that cities lobby their states on policies related to testing and deployment, plus concerns such as insurance, among other issues.

The bone health-focused J&J unit has snapped up 3D printing tech from Tissue Regeneration Systems, Inc. (TRS). The platform is able to create implantable bone-like structures that have a special type of coating that helps the body absorb them and use them to help heal injuries and deformities. It can be used in bones throughout the body, including the face and skull. J&J didn't disclose the financial details for the deal. Click here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. "We are systematically investing in building a pipeline of 3D printed products," said DePuy company group chairman Ciro Römer in a statement. "The TRS technology, which will be added to the DePuy Synthes Trauma Platform, is the latest example of how we are working toward developing next-generation technologies that transform healthcare delivery with individualized solutions for patients." 3D printing has been shaking up industries ranging from car makers to airline manufacturers like Boeing. The technology has the potential to significantly reduce costs and prevent excess scrap materials. In medicine, it's particularly exciting because 3D-printed materials can be molded to fit individual patients—rather than rely on standardized implant sizes that may be a rough match for a person's body. There are still challenges ahead, though, as Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, explained during a panel at Fortune's first annual Brainstorm Health conference last November. For one, the technology needs to be able to be scaled up dramatically while still keeping its personalized advantages.

Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may hav Listen Listening... / Listen to the Story If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates." Moore, the Trump campaign adviser, says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to budget deficits. And for now, Moore says, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. "One of the lessons, hopefully, Republicans learned from the health care debate is, 'keep it simple, stupid,' " he says. "The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress." What would simple look like? According to Moore: Allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of capital purchases, such as factories and equipment. Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Have an even lower tax rate on money U.S. companies bring revenues back from overseas. Require that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U.S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing these ideas, including publisher Steve Forbes and economists Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, say even some Democrats might support them.

Hosted by the 8th Fighter Wing at Kunsan Air Base, Exercise Max Thunder involves U.S. Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Republic of Korea (ROK) personnel and is designed to help train allied forces to defend South Korea. The war games started on April 17 and will run through April 28. "Exercise Max Thunder serves as an invaluable opportunity for U.S. and ROKAF forces to train together shoulder-to-shoulder and sharpen tactical skills vital to the defense and security of the Korean Peninsula," Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Bergeson, Seventh Air Force commander, said in a statement. "This exercise will rigorously test our aerial combat capability and highlights the ironclad commitment between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea and the multifaceted capabilities we possess in this theater.” The focus of the exercise from the standpoint of F-16C units such as the 36th Fighter Squadron—which is based at Osan Air Base in South Korea—is to suppress or destroy enemy air defenses. In the case of North Korea, Pyongyang’s air defenses are not especially sophisticated—though they are more capable than many might imagine. But the North does have a huge volume of forces. Thus, training to suppress those air defenses is of paramount importance in the event of war. “Team Osan is the SEAD first responder,” Capt. Austin Buller, 36th Fighter Squadron (FS) operations flight commander, said in an Air Force release. “We are just about the only unit on [the Korean Peninsula] with that capability, so it will be good practice for us and will also help our integration.” A total of about 1,000 U.S. personnel will participate in the exercise. Participating in the war games are F-16s from 7th Air Force, Boeing AV-8Bs from the U. Marines’ 12th Marine Aircraft Group and EA-18Gs from the Navy’s Electronic Attack Squadron 132 (VAQ-132). All of the U.S. units will fly out of bases in Korea and Japan. Meanwhile, about 500 South Korean troops are also participating in Max Thunder. The South Koreans forces include the F-15K, F-16, F-5E, F-4E, KA-1, C-130, HH-60 and CN 235 aircraft. Training together with the Korean helps both sides better prepare for a potential on the peninsula where Washington and Seoul’s forces will have to work together closely. “During this exercise, we use different mission sets to enhance our tactical proficiency,” Buller said. “Working with the Koreans is especially important here, and during this exercise we can get that face-to-face encounter in an air combat training scenario.” It should be noted that Max Thunder is an annual exercise. The fact that the war games are being held during a time when tensions are running high is mostly a coincidence. Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may have missed their chance in Congress. Jacquelyn Martin/AP If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. Politics Republicans Eye 'Once In A Generation' Chance At Tax Overhaul U.S. What We Know About The Trump, House GOP Tax Plans So Far "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." It's All Politics Donald Trump's Tax Plan Could Be Huge(ly Expensive) Politics Trump's Populism Is Transforming GOP's Economics, Adviser Says If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates."

Trump takes the stage with his wife, Melania, during the Freedom Inaugural Ball on Jan. 20, following his inauguration. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email WASHINGTON— It was huge. Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave huge in-kind contributions of goods and services, including $2.1 million from AT&T for mobile equipment and software, nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors and $500,000 in equipment from Microsoft. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman’s Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn’s ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump’s campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump’s only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn’t operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn’t be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump’s inaugural committee has promised to “identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised.” © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Calgary-headquartered WestJet aims to kick off the service late this year with an initial fleet of 10 Boeing Co 737-800s planes. Bob Cummings, WestJet's executive vice president, commercial, told Reuters the new offering would feature an "a la carte model" of a base fare plus specific fees for services like checked baggage, only taken one step further. While other low-cost carriers have failed in Canada, WestJet's strategy would work by winning market share from competitors such as Rouge and Sunwing Airlines while cannibalizing some of its own traffic, Cummings said. "Between taking share from others and, quite frankly, taking some share from us, the math makes sense." Cummings declined to give specifics about the new fares, but said the cost structure would not be comparable to the deeply discounted fares offered by European ultra-low-cost carriers like Ryan Air. "We are not likely to be at the Ryan Air end of the spectrum," he said in a phone interview. WestJet, which started life as a low-cost airline, has added premium services in a bid to increase revenue, but is planning the ultra-low-cost structure to service the other end. In planning the new service, Cummings said WestJet considered both the comparatively high-cost structure of operating flights in Canada and examples from abroad, including low-cost Australian carrier Tigerair Australia, which is operated by Virgin Australia Holdings, and Jetstar by Qantas Airways. Consumer advocates have long complained that limited competition, high fares and airport fees make Canada a comparatively expensive country for air travel. Canada in November lifted foreign investment limits for Canadian airlines to 49 percent from 25 percent, a change spurring competition and lower fares by encouraging the launch of low-cost airlines. "We're trying to create a climate where passengers are offered lower costs and greater choice," Transport Minister Marc Garneau said by phone following WestJet's announcement. A spokesman for Air Canada was not available for comment. Cummings said the new carrier would focus on domestic and sun destinations served by WestJet's B737s. The new carrier appears to be avoiding short-haul domestic routes. "As you travel further, the percentage of taxes and fees becomes less of a burden," Cummings said. "We have a big country here."

By Ananya Roy Updated April 20, 2017 14:11 BST Close How the mega supermoon had people transfixed all over the world Reuters It has recently emerged that the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is working on a plan to extract energy from the moon that will help India to cut down on its oil imports. The plan involves mining Helium-3 rich lunar dust, generating energy from it and sending it back to the Earth. The plans were first revealed in February by Dr Sivathanu Pillai, a professor at the space agency. He had then told a conference in New Delhi that the lunar dust mining programme is a priority for Isro, Livemint reported. President Donald Trump-led administration in the US was also keen on extracting energy from the Moon. He had reportedly asked Nasa about mining the natural resources on the Moon for profit, to which, the space agency responded saying that they have already begun handing over low-Earth orbit explorations and tours to companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin. With the advancement in space technology in many countries across the world, there has been a surge in activities aimed at exploring the outer space and the natural resources of extra-terrestrial bodies, especially the Moon, given its close proximity to the Earth. Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is working on a plan to extract energy from the moonGetty Images/Dibyangshu Sarkar Here is a look at the some interesting activities that space agencies (state-funded and private) aspire to do on Moon in the near future: Aircraft company Boeing and Nasa have plans to develop a deep space habitat on the Moon. They released concept images earlier in April of a proposed docking station and a deep space transport vehicle that could send humans to Mars from a lunar base one day. A private company in Texas, called Shackleton Energy Company (SEC), was reported in 2015 to be planning to set up a "gas station in space" by mining on the moon. The plan involved mining reserves of water ice from the moon, convert them into rocket propellant in the form of hydrogen and oxygen, and sell the fuel to space partners in low Earth orbit. However, there is not enough information on the project's progress. Nasa has been working on plans to build homes on the Moon. The most recent media reports suggested that the American space agency is still drawing up the architecture of the proposed habitat. Private space exploration firm SpaceX is reportedly all set to fly two people to the Moon in 2018. The aspiration has been building on since many years now, with several private space exploration agencies claiming to be working on adventure vacations to the Moon.

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune staffContact Reporter Privacy Policy Welcome to Clout Street: Morning Spin, our weekday feature to catch you up with what's going on in government and politics from Chicago to Springfield. Subscribe here. Topspin A pair of city aldermen want Chicago police to consider using new technology to better determine if drivers in crashes had been texting. Ald. Ed Burke, 14th, and Ald. Anthony Beale, 9th, on Wednesday introduced a resolution calling on the Police Department to appear before a City Council committee “to address the use of emerging technology, such as a Textalyzer, in enforcing the city’s existing traffic laws or the investigation of vehicle accidents.” A Textalyzer — a device developed by Israeli company Cellebrite — can access a phone's operating system to check whether it was being used to text, email or perform other functions. Its name is a play on the Breathalyzer, which can help determine whether a driver is legally drunk. Use of such devices is being considered in Tennessee and New York, where the idea of suspending driver’s licenses for refusing to have a phone scanned has been debated. “Our nation is in the grips of a texting epidemic and drivers text with impunity because they think there is little chance of ever getting caught,” Burke said in a statement. “Such illegal activity not only poses a serious threat to other motorists, but also to the many cyclists who regularly use our network of bike lanes and to pedestrians at crosswalks.” Burke noted that statistics indicate fatal crashes caused by texting while driving are on the rise.

Activity should pick up for the remainder of 2017, predicts a new PwC report. Aerospace and defense industry deal value reached $13.8 billion in the first quarter, representing a decline of about 20 percent compared with the fourth quarter. Jeff Daniels | @jeffdanielsca 21 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Safran Engineers performing tests on an engine at French aerospace group Safran Defense and aerospace industry mergers slowed in the first three months of the year compared with the fourth quarter but activity should pick up for the remainder of 2017, predicts a new report. Aerospace and defense industry deal value reached $13.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017, representing a decline of about 20 percent compared with about $17.1 billion in M&A activity in the fourth quarter, according to a report released Thursday by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting and consulting services firm. "Despite a relatively soft start to the year, we are optimistic that deal activity will recover and return to prior year levels," the PwC report said. "Defense spending increases and geopolitical factors will certainly play a part in the prevalence and magnitude of dealmaking through the rest of 2017." Scott Thompson, national leader of PwC's aerospace and defense practice, said the 10-year pace of the industry is for M&A dollar volume of around $25 billion annually. "We will probably continue at a pace which is above the 10-year average," he said, adding that such a scenario would mean there's still probably about "$18 billion or more" worth of new deals still to come by year's end. Besides greater defense spending, PwC sees increased deliveries of large commercial aircraft helping to boost M&A volumes as the year progresses, too. According to Thompson, the commercial aircraft segment is "a very, very attractive place to be" given strong passenger growth by the global airline industry. That has resulted in more carriers replacing their aging fleets of jets or in ordering new planes to expand service. Overall, there were 10 M&A deals in aerospace and defense in the first quarter, down 47 percent from 19 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The report also said strategic investors continued to lead the deal activity and contributed about 90 percent of transaction volumes and 95 percent of deal value in the quarter. One deal in the first quarter — the $9.4 billion merger of French jet engine maker Safran with seats manufacturer Zodiac Aerospace — represented 68 percent of the quarter's total deal volume. The merged company will create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier in terms of revenue. The second-largest deal in the quarter was the announced $2.1 billion merger of Canadian satellite company MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates with DigitalGlobe, a Colorado-based satellite imaging company. North American deals represented 69 percent of the M&A volume in the first quarter but deal value for both North America and the Asia-Oceania region were substantially below the fourth quarter of 2016. The aircraft and parts category was the top M&A area in terms of deal value, accounting for 70 percent of total transaction value and 30 percent of transactions in the first quarter. Indeed, while the bulk of the money for aircraft orders flows to OEMs (or original equipment manufacturers) such as Boeing and Airbus, the other beneficiaries are parts suppliers, which includes suppliers of everything from engines and landing gear to cargo doors and seats. "We have seen OEMs put more margin pressure on the supply base," said Thompson. "So there is some reasonable impetus for the supply base to consolidate some to gain a little bit greater leverage on the margin side." Finally, the rush of big deals in the government services category of aerospace and defense slowed in the latest quarter but it followed large transactions last year, including U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin jettisoning its information technology and services businesses in a $4.6 billion deal with Leidos. "Everybody who is in government services has either done an acquisition or been acquired pretty much," said Thompson. Jeff DanielsCoordinating Producer

Unlike their traditional roles, rotorcrafts are being used as part of the comprehensive mission parameters, which calls for integration of advanced and multiple capabilities in rotorcrafts. As the existing helicopters are unable to fulfill these roles, countries are focusing on either developing or procuring helicopters with multiple mission modes, which is currently driving the demand for military helicopters across the world. Apart from this, growing disputes over maritime borders and offshore natural resources are the primary drivers of the growing demand for maritime helicopters with multi-mission capabilities. Despite facing financial constraints, major defense spenders are driven by the growing need for the helicopters with advanced capabilities and challenges from internal and external security threats. The primary forces driving large scale military modernization plans in this region are territorial disputes and the high threat of terrorism. A significant increase in Chinese defense spending has led other countries in the region to increase their defense budget in order to maintain a balance of military power in the region Request a sample @ http://www.orbisresearch.com/contacts/request-sample/266930 .

The Flight Safety Foundation, a non-profit funded by airlines and other groups to reduce the risk of accidents, on Friday issued a press release urging the industry to take steps not to “introduce another risk” from the highly flammable batteries powering the electronics. The concern is that passengers are being told to place electronic devices into cargo holds just as international safety agencies have begun barring bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium cells because of evidence that they can spontaneously catch fire and even explode. “It’s potentially a transfer of consequential risk,” Greg Marshall, vice president of Global Programs at the safety group, said in an interview. “We’re going to see large numbers of these devices carried in the cargo hold of aircraft that would otherwise have been in the cabin.” The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration logged 31 cases last year in which lithium-based batteries either caught fire or smoldered on airline flights. Three cargo aircraft have been destroyed by fires attributed at least in part to lithium batteries, two of which were fatal accidents, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. “We coordinated closely with the FAA and provided an information bulletin to the air carriers regarding the appropriate handling of electronics, including lithium batteries,” Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Jenny Burke said in an emailed response to the safety group’s warning. On March 21, the U.S. notified airlines that it wouldn’t permit passengers on flights headed to the U.S. from 10 Middle Eastern airports – including Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Cairo – to carry any electronic device larger than a smartphone. DHS said the action was the result of new intelligence that terrorists were planning to target airlines by “smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items.” The U.K. followed with a similar ban the same day. Representative John Katko, a New York Republican who is chairman of the House Transportation Security Subcommittee, said March 29 that the threat was real, and predicted other nations would broaden the ban. DHS Secretary John Kelly on Wednesday told Congress the action may be extended to other airports. However, the fears over terrorism are colliding with one of the biggest concerns in airline safety: the worry that highly volatile batteries may ignite and fuel deadly aircraft fires. United Nations The United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization last year concluded that lithium-ion cells were too risky to be carried in bulk on passenger flights after manufacturers Boeing Co. and Airbus SE advised airlines that existing fire suppression systems weren’t adequate to protect planes against lithium fires. While the terrorist threats may be real, the government should perform a risk analysis and take steps to reduce the potential for battery fires, said John Cox, a safety consultant who has written on the subject of aircraft fires. Some carriers have allowed passengers to keep their laptops and tablet computers with them until just before departure, before gathering them in a bin to be stowed in the cargo hold, Cox said. Placing the devices in such close proximity to each other increases the potential risks if one catches fire, he said. “If they are in the cargo hold and one overheats and goes into thermal runaway, you can’t deal with it,” he said. Pilots and flight attendants are trained to extinguish a battery fire in the cabin, but wouldn’t be able to reach a blaze in a cargo area, he said. Passengers should be reminded to switch off electronics if they pack them in checked bags, the Flight Safety Foundation’s Marshall said. They also shouldn’t assume it’s now permissible to stow spare batteries and e-cigarettes in luggage bound for the cargo hold. Those items are still prohibited in checked bags, he said.

Jacquelyn Martin/AP hide caption toggle caption Jacquelyn Martin/AP A statue of former Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin stands guard outside the Treasury Building in Washington. Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may have missed their chance in Congress. Jacquelyn Martin/AP If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. Politics Republicans Eye 'Once In A Generation' Chance At Tax Overhaul U.S. What We Know About The Trump, House GOP Tax Plans So Far "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." It's All Politics Donald Trump's Tax Plan Could Be Huge(ly Expensive) Politics Trump's Populism Is Transforming GOP's Economics, Adviser Says If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates." Moore, the Trump campaign adviser, says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to budget deficits. And for now, Moore says, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. "One of the lessons, hopefully, Republicans learned from the health care debate is, 'keep it simple, stupid,' " he says. "The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress." What would simple look like? According to Moore: Allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of capital purchases, such as factories and equipment. Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Have an even lower tax rate on money U.S. companies bring revenues back from overseas. Require that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U.S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing these ideas, including publisher Steve Forbes and economists Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, say even some Democrats might support them. corporate taxes federal taxes Donald Trump taxes Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPRPolitics There's More To It NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none" src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1" />

Trump's campaign plans for a total overhaul of the U.S. tax code — while maintaining the revenues flowing into the federal government — may have missed their chance in Congress. Jacquelyn Martin/AP If you filed for an extension on your taxes this week, you're right in step with the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress. They've put off voting on their promised tax overhaul until after they take another whack at repealing and replacing Obamacare. That's got some Republicans concerned, including Stephen Moore, who was an economic adviser to the Trump campaign. "You know, you've got a period when you're first elected where you've got to rush and get things done before that window slams shut," Moore says. But Moore says that as of mid-April, President Trump has no legislative victories, and his Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, says a tax cut will have to wait until the fall. Moore says Trump needs a win and should push a tax right now. Politics Republicans Eye 'Once In A Generation' Chance At Tax Overhaul U.S. What We Know About The Trump, House GOP Tax Plans So Far "Do something that's achievable," he says, pointing out that Trump ran on a corporate and business tax cut. "Get that done. This is taking too long and it's getting harder to do as each week goes by." Moore does have some skin in this game: He's co-author of the tax overhaul plan Trump ran on during the election. But nearly 100 days into his administration, Trump hasn't sent Congress that or any other tax plan. Moore says the lack of a tax bill already is having negative effects: Growth seems to be slowing, and the latest monthly jobs numbers for March were disappointing. When he talks to investors and businesses and asks why things seem to be slowing, they say they're getting nervous that Trump's tax cut may not happen. Jon Traub, a former Republican staff director at the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, says the outlines of a Trump tax bill are still unclear. "We're still waiting to figure out what President Trump is going to embrace," says Traub, who's now at the consulting firm Deloitte. The biggest question, he says, is whether Trump will get behind the controversial border adjustment tax. It's a key element of a dramatic plan supported by House Republican leaders to overhaul the tax code. The proposal, a 20 percent tax on all imports, is attractive because it would raise a huge amount of revenue. The plan would simultaneously eliminate taxes on American exports. The proposal has divided the U.S. business community. Not surprisingly, retailers like Wal-Mart that import products they sell, hate it. On the other hand, exporters like Boeing love it. "The president has given mixed signals on that issue," Traub says. "I think it's fair to say without his active support, that proposal probably cannot pass the House or Senate." It's All Politics Donald Trump's Tax Plan Could Be Huge(ly Expensive) Politics Trump's Populism Is Transforming GOP's Economics, Adviser Says If Trump doesn't support the border adjustment tax, he would need to find some other way to raise the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue needed to cut tax rates without adding to federal budget deficits. The White House has floated several ideas for getting that revenue, including a carbon tax and a value-added tax (VAT); neither previously has had much Republican support. Traub says that "shows how desperate" the administration is to find a large source of revenue, "other than the border adjustable tax, as a way to finance lower corporate tax rates." Moore, the Trump campaign adviser, says it's time to stop worrying about whether tax cuts will add to budget deficits. And for now, Moore says, Trump should forget about doing a big complicated tax overhaul. "One of the lessons, hopefully, Republicans learned from the health care debate is, 'keep it simple, stupid,' " he says. "The fewer movable parts, the easier it is to get it through Congress." What would simple look like? According to Moore: Allow businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of capital purchases, such as factories and equipment. Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. Have an even lower tax rate on money U.S. companies bring revenues back from overseas. Require that some of that repatriated money be used to improve U.S. infrastructure. Moore and other prominent Republicans pushing these ideas, including publisher Steve Forbes and economists Larry Kudlow and Arthur Laffer, say even some Democrats might support them. corporate taxes federal taxes Donald Trump taxes Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPRPolitics There's More To It NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only <img height="1" width="1" style="display:none" src="https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1621557368158968&ev=PageView&noscript=1" />

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump is getting hammered by critics for what they say is his dubious commitment to the `Buy American, Hire American' policy that he is promoting on faulty premise, even as his hardline nationalist supporters are in raptures that he is putting `America First'. From pointing out that the product line from his own companies are made abroad (including Made in India sports coats) to taunting that his properties, estates, and businesses employ a large number of immigrants, detractors eviscerated Trump for double standards after he went on a blue-collar roadshow to expound the `American First' vision. He promoted it with an executive diktat aimed, among other things, at reforming the H-1B visa programme that has helped grow the Indian IT industry . That vision is faulty, industry leaders both in manufacturing and services said, echoing views from Trump's political opponents and academics with expertise in the matter, all of whom argued that foreign workers actually contributed to the US economy and rejected the claim that they took over “American jobs“. While industry leaders said Trump's executive order to `Buy American' will simply bump up the cost of the $ 1 trillion infrastructure spending (or yield less from it) that he has proposed, analysts such as Linda Lim, a University of Michigan scholar who studies political economy , warned that it will also result in foreign governments enacting similar strictures against American products, throwing sand in the global trade engine. “Think Boeing airplanes and Microsoft software, both of which currently have large global market share,“ she cautioned. In fact, the United States Chamber of Commerce pointed out whenever the government has enacted domestic sourcing rules in the past, “the resulting experience has been higher overall construction co sts, increased compliance burdens, reduced competition, and disruption of supply chains without significant American job creation“. Trump's diktat to `Hire Americans' by demonising the H1B programme also met with a similarly measured response from NASSCOM, the Indian software industry body , which, while sounding sanguine about its effect on the Indian companies, said restrictions on guest worker visas would “hurt thousands of US businesses and their efforts to be more competitive by hindering access to needed talent“. But claiming that the “American people voted to end the theft of American prosperity ,“ Trump, threw out the red meat of `America First' to his base, even as reports suggested some of his more hardline supporters are starting to get disillusioned that he is not nationalistic enough.

That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft’s combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman’s Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn’s ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump’s campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump’s only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn’t operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn’t be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump’s inaugural committee has promised to “identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised.”   Source: AP   I found this interesting I didin't find this interesting Join the Conversation Most Read News Botswana permits former Presidents to work Football Just In: 30 Man U fans electrocuted in Calabar News Egypt, Sudan hold talks to douse tension News Piracy in Africa worries Nigeria Navy Entertainment Africa drum festival holds in Nigeria Latest LifeStyle World’s fattest woman sheds 250kg 7 mins ago News 30, 000 Militants from 100 nations join ISIS 41 mins ago Entertainment Movie: Okafor law maintains the lead 49 mins ago Entertainment Nigeria to host world tourism conference 2 hours ago News Chinese bombers position against N/Korea 5 hours ago News Nuclear Threat: China condemns North Korea 7 hours ago News WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange: U.S. most wanted? 8 hours ago Football Just In: 30 Man U fans electrocuted in Calabar 8 hours ago Football FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup: Supersand Eagles off to Bahamas 8 hours ago News Rural Electrification Agency gets new board, management 9 hours ago Load More Obioha, Nigerian hacker admits $6.5m fraud in US court Previous Did Hitler escape being jailed?

Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts – to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over – the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft’s combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman’s Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn’s ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-American businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 20 April 2017 by Maciej Heyman Military Rotorcraft Market size and CAGR Growth Analysis & 2017-2027 Forecasts Report Rapidly changing global security scenario and the growing importance of unconventional missions and urban warfare have resulted in change of roles for helicopters in the modern warfare strategies. Unlike their traditional roles, rotorcrafts are being used as part of the comprehensive mission parameters, which calls for integration of advanced and multiple capabilities in rotorcrafts. As the existing helicopters are unable to fulfill these roles, countries are focusing on either developing or procuring helicopters with multiple mission modes, which is currently driving the demand for military helicopters across the world. Apart from this, growing disputes over maritime borders and offshore natural resources are the primary drivers of the growing demand for maritime helicopters with multi-mission capabilities. Despite facing financial constraints, major defense spenders are driven by the growing need for the helicopters with advanced capabilities and challenges from internal and external security threats. Browse the full report @ www.orbisresearch.com/reports/index/the-global-military-r… . The primary forces driving large scale military modernization plans in this region are territorial disputes and the high threat of terrorism.

Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump's inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts - to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over - the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to "drain the swamp" of Washington. Contribution records from Trump's inaugural committee, released Wednesday by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump's total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump's top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump's swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft's donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets' Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is "a time-honored tradition" and there are "a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power." Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: "If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they're indebted to those big donors, there's certainly reason to question what donors to Trump's inaugural committee might expect in return." As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in "vehicle expenses" from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft's combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman's Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn's ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump's inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he's given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump's campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump's only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn't operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn't be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump's inaugural committee has promised to "identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised." ___ On Twitter follow Nancy Benac at: http://twitter.com/nbenac and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Where The Money Went Is Another Story By Danielle Kurtzleben • Apr 19, 2017 TweetShareGoogle+Email President Trump waves to supporters as he walks the parade route with first lady Melania Trump after being sworn in on Jan. 20. An inauguration is an expensive party to throw, and President Trump got plenty of help putting his on. Financial Election Commission disclosures released on Wednesday show that some uberwealthy donors helped Trump defray the cost: Million-dollar givers included investment firm founder Charles Schwab, mining entrepreneur Christopher Cline and Bank of America. Investor and casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson spent $5 million. Those megadonors contributed to Trump's monster inauguration haul of nearly $107 million, the FEC forms show. That sum doubles President Barack Obama's then-record inauguration donations in 2009, which totaled around $53 million. Though this report shows how much money Trump's inauguration brought in, it does not detail exactly how that money was spent. Presidential inauguration committees do not have to disclose that to the FEC. Donations to the inauguration may come after a victory, but they can still have the basic message of a campaign donation ("You are a politician I like, and I would like to support you with a few dollars"). But then, sometimes donations can fulfill another purpose. "It's also a way for those who stayed away from Trump early on — didn't give to his campaign or superPACs, didn't help fund the convention, maybe backed another horse — to get on board with the incoming administration," said Viveca Novak, spokesperson at the Center for Responsive Politics, in an email. In addition, big donors to Trump's inauguration received special inauguration-weekend treats: tickets to the swearing-in and their names printed on inauguration programs, for example, according to an inauguration brochure first published by the Center for Public Integrity. The money also bought time with the president and vice president — those donating more than $500,000 were treated to dinner with Vice President Pence and his wife, Karen. The highest donors — those spending $1 million or more — gained access to a "Leadership Luncheon," which was "an exclusive event with select Cabinet appointees and House and Senate leadership." It's not exactly new for a presidential inauguration committee to take in corporate money. Though Obama's 2009 inauguration didn't accept corporate donations, his 2013 inauguration brought in money from AT&T and Microsoft, among others. Some companies are bipartisan in their support: Boeing and Chevron, for example, both donated to Obama's 2013 inauguration and Trump's inauguration alike. Those kinds of large donations, as well as the fact that the committee doesn't have to tell the FEC how it spent the money, are part of what one expert considers a relatively loose system governing how inaugurations are financed. "Really, there's very limited rules on how an inaugural committee has to spend the money, much less report how they spend the money," said Brendan Fischer, director of the federal and FEC legal program at the Campaign Legal Center. There are also few restrictions on where any leftover money might go after an inauguration, Fischer said. As a 501(c)(4) — a type of nonprofit — an inaugural committee couldn't, for example, donate the money to a political campaign. However, as Colby College professor and campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado told NPR, it could potentially give the funds to another 501(c)(4) — perhaps one that promotes the president's agenda. Trump's committee has said that any leftover money from this year's inauguration will be given to charity, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. For his part, Fischer thinks the Inauguration Day donations should have some of the strictures of campaign donations. "There's no reason to think that a million-dollar contribution made after Election Day would be any less corrupting or pose any less risk of influence than a million-dollar contribution made before Election Day," he said. While the donors were high-profile, taxpayers can end up footing a large part of the inauguration bill. An inauguration can be a massively expensive affair — ahead of this year's, the New York Times estimated the cost at $200 million. The Trump inauguration committee would account for only part of that; the Washington Post estimated before the event that the committee would spend somewhere around $70 million. The federal government also pays for specific parts of the festivities. For example, as the Times reported, federal money covers security, which may have cost around $100 million. Copyright 2017 NPR.

WASHINGTON (AP) >> It was huge. Big money from billionaires, corporations and a roster of NFL owners poured into Donald Trump’s inaugural committee in record-shattering amounts — to pull off an event that was considerably lower-key than previous inaugural celebrations. That leaves a bit of a mystery: What the $107 million was spent for and how much was left over — the excess, if any, to go to charity. It also raises a new round of questions about the influence of money in politics, this time for a president who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington. Contribution records from Trump’s inaugural committee, released today by the Federal Election Commission, show the president who railed as a candidate against the corrupting influence of big-money donors was only too willing to accept top-dollar checks for his swearing-in festivities. Trump’s total take was about double the previous record set by Barack Obama, who collected $53 million in contributions in 2009, and had money left over to spend on the annual Easter egg roll and other White House events. Trump’s top inaugural donor was Las Vegas gambling billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who gave $5 million. He and his wife came away with prime seats for Trump’s swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20 and gained access to a private lunch with the new president and lawmakers at the Capitol. Phil Ruffin, another casino mogul and close friend of Trump, was among dozens of donors who gave $1 million each. At least eight NFL team owners kicked in big money for the inauguration. Seven of them, including Patriots owner Bob Kraft, whose team won the Super Bowl and visited the White House on Wednesday, gave $1 million apiece. Kraft’s donation came via his limited liability company. Trump plans to name the New York Jets’ Woody Johnson, one of those million-dollar donors, to be the country’s ambassador to the United Kingdom. Asked whether the president feels conflicted about his committee accepting so much corporate and wealthy donor money, spokesman Sean Spicer said Wednesday that financing the inaugural is “a time-honored tradition” and there are “a lot of people who really take pride in helping us show the world a peaceful transformation of power.” Brendan Fischer of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit pro-transparency group, countered: “If you take Trump at his word that when political figures accept large amounts of money from corporate interests or special interests that they’re indebted to those big donors, there’s certainly reason to question what donors to Trump’s inaugural committee might expect in return.” As is often the case with campaigns and inaugurations, some of the donations came from people doing business with the federal government. Billionaire Texan Kelcy Warren, whose company is building the Dakota Access Pipeline, gave the inaugural committee $250,000. Christopher Cline, a billionaire coal magnate who owns Foresight Energy Partners, gave $1 million. Trump has vowed to bring back coal jobs, and his administration quickly approved the Dakota pipeline. Businesses that donated at the $1 million level included Bank of America, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Pfizer and Qualcomm. Companies also gave big in-kind contributions of goods and services, including nearly $500,000 in “vehicle expenses” from General Motors. AT&T made combined in-kind and cash donations of $2.1 million, and Microsoft’s combined total was $500,000. Casino mogul Steve Wynn donated entertainers and production work valued at $729,000 for the Chairman’s Ball, where the band Alabama and Wynn’s ShowStoppers performed, according to Wynn spokesman Michael Weaver. Russian-America businessman Alexander Shustorovich also was among the $1 million donors to Trump’s inauguration committee. The Republican National Committee refused a contribution from the U.S. citizen in 2000, citing news reports at the time that cautioned about his ties to Russian business. In more recent years, he’s given money to the party, to 2012 candidate Mitt Romney, and to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, FEC records show. Donations from foreign nationals are banned. But the socialist administration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro made a $500,000 donation through Citgo Petroleum, a U.S. affiliate of Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA. PDVSA recently offered up a nearly 50 percent stake in Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan from Russian firm Rosneft. The deal drew criticism from Republicans who worry it sets the stage for Vladimir Putin to take control of American oil. The inauguration offered donors who had held back during the presidential campaign a chance to show belated support for the incoming president. Billionaire investor Paul Singer gave $1 million after long expressing skepticism about Trump. Like Singer, Chicago hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, conspicuously avoided giving money to Trump’s campaign during the general election. Griffin gave the Trump inaugural $100,000. While the government sets strict contribution limits on political campaigns, the only federal restrictions on donations to inaugural committees are a ban on foreign nationals, according to Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. Past presidents-elect have tended to set voluntary limits on their inaugural fundraising, but Trump’s only restriction was to ban money from lobbyists, he said. Obama in 2009 set a $50,000 cap on individual contributions and banned money from corporations, political action committees and lobbyists. He lifted those caps in 2013, when he raised about $43 million for a lower-key event. Inaugural committees have broad leeway in how they spend their money and what they do with the leftovers, although some limitations apply, according to Fischer. As a 501(c)(4) organization, for example, the committee could use some of the money to give bonuses to staff, but IRS rules say the committee couldn’t operate primarily to benefit a small group of individuals. Federal campaigns wouldn’t be able receive the money because it was raised outside contribution limits, he said. Trump’s inaugural committee has promised to “identify and evaluate charities that will receive contributions left from the excess monies raised.” Get the latest news by email Sign Up Share this: PREV NEXT Most Read Sessions’ diss of Hawaii as ‘an island in the Pacific’ draws fire Kahuku clinic pair help aid school’s athletic director Wind power raises Maui electric bills School tax plan’s problems pile up UH volleyball sweeps BYU, gets Long Beach next Comments () By participating in online discussions you acknowledge that you have agreed to the TERMS OF SERVICE.

A radical zero-emission electric plane capable of vertical take-off and landing has successfully completed flight tests. The two-seater Lilium Jet carried out a series of tests above Germany, including a mid-air maneuver in which it transitions from hover mode to forward flight, the firm has revealed. And, Lilium also revealed that it is working on a larger, five-seater version that the firm says could soon be used for ride-sharing services. Scroll down for video  The two-seater Lilium Jet carried out a series of tests above Germany, including a mid-air maneuver in which it transitions from hover mode to wing-borne forward flight, the firm has revealed HOW IT TAKES OFF  At take-off, the flaps are pointed downwards to provide vertical lift, according to Lilium. Then, once airborne, these flaps tilt into a horizontal position. This gives the craft forward thrust. Once the wing flaps are horizontal, the lift comes from the air passing over the wings, as with a conventional plane. The pod-like plane can achieve both vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), like a helicopter, and jet-powered flight. This allows it to fly for nearly 200 miles at a maximum cruising speed of over 180 miles per hour. Lilium Jet's 100 percent electric design means it is far more efficient than typical aircraft. ‘We have solved some of the toughest engineering challenges in aviation to get to this point,’ said Lilium co-founder and CEO Daniel Wiegand. ‘The successful test flight program shows that our ground-breaking technical dsign works exactly as we envisioned. ‘We can now turn our focus to designing the five-seater production aircraft.’ RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next US Army is considering resurrecting 'devastating' weapon...

It relies on 36 jet engines, which are mounted to the wings by 12 moveable flaps. As it can take-off and land vertically, it needs just a small open space or landing pad on a building, as opposed to a lengthy runway. Based on its efficiency and minimal infrastructure requirements, Lilium says this design could make for flights that are comparable in price to a typical car taxi. A trip on such a plane would be five times faster than it would by car – going from Manhattan to JFK Airport, for example, would take just 5 minutes, while the same journey would be about 55 minutes by car.

The aircraft is designed for flying in daylight, where the weather conditions are 'good.' Lilium has yet to reveal how much the craft will cost, but last spring, it was revealed it would be ready to purchase by 2018. At the time, the European Space Agency praised the energy-efficient design for its environmental and social benefits, stating that although the aircraft will primarily be using airfields for landing and take-off, 'the goal is for it to take off vertically from almost anywhere – even from back gardens.'  more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Massive waterfall falls off the Nansen Ice Shelf into the ocean Watch video See through model rocket engine ignited in slow motion Watch video HTC tease fans with shots of 'HTC U' phone to be released in May Watch video Robot dog that recognises FACES could be future of elderly care Watch video Soyuz rocket lifts off to deliver two astronauts to ISS Watch video Ultrasonic clothes dryer uses VIBRATIONS to dry in half the time Watch video Animation shows how Earth would appear if dominated by oceans Watch video Lilium Aviation's first test flights for electric VTOL jet Watch video Robot cheetah in slow motion developed at University of Twente Watch video Horrific ISIS video shows child soldier handing knives to executioners Watch video Burglar caught on security camera robbing Dallas man's home Watch video Moment twerking brunette causes road accident in Ukraine   Share or comment on this article e-mail 37 shares Most watched News videos Man shows 'incredible strength' to pull off one-armed push-ups Dramatic moment car smashes into four parked vehicles Terrifying footage shows moments after Paris shooting Putin reinforces his border with North Korea after rising tensions Angry woman gets escorted off plane by police 'I wish I f***ing did': Adam Johnson brags about schoolgirl CCTV footage shows parents staging baby's death on London bus Surveillance video of a passenger shoving a pilot at KCI Airport Former Patriot Aaron Hernandez found hanging in his prison cell Players in disbelief as sex noises halt tennis match Farmer gives very 'country' account of car crash and bee attack Gibbons go crazy when they discover rat inside their enclosure PICTURED: ISIS terrorist who killed an officer and...

There's nothing new about using a scantily clad model to push a relaunch It's a tired tactic, and the City wasn't impressed with it - or the lack of detail in CEO Sergio Bucher's shiny new strategy James Moore Chief Business Commentator @JimMooreJourno Thursday 20 April 2017 16:40 BST Click to follow Only one of the images sent round to accompany Debenhams' relaunch did not feature a model in swimwear So hello there, new Debenhams! And hello there (really) old PR tactic to get favourable coverage for the CEO’s big (and notably target free) announcement!  Yep, here’s a model in swimwear. And oh look, there she is in some more swimwear. What’s this? You've got it! Still more swimwear!  I’m assuming that you can buy all said garments from Debenhams, although there won’t likely be as many stores, or warehouses, to stock them as there once were. Read more Debenhams considering closing 10 UK stores Debenhams becomes first major department store to sell hijabs Debenhams names Amazon’s Sergio Bucher as new chief That’s the sting in the strategy’s tail. Sending around pics of scantily clad models when you’re announcing plans that will likely see people being relieved of their livelihoods strikes me as ever so slightly crass.  But let’s have a look at the strategy, shall we? It was the analyst Nick Bubb who made note of the lack of targets.  His consistently excellent Daily Retailer blog got straight to the point by noting that “Debenhams have failed to take the opportunity to offer shareholders any sales or profit targets against which the new programme should be judged, which is disappointing”.  Others similarly criticised the lack of detail even if it does all sound whizzy and wonderful. You can see Sergio Bucher, the CEO, getting every bit as excited as an old school picture editor at the pictures of the model when he delivers presentations about it.  The new strategy is entitled: “Debenhams Redesigned, to deliver Growth by becoming a Destination, Digital and Different” (sic). Amid the hyperbole, corporate speak and general rubbish, there is the germ of an idea in there.  Mr Bucher notes that leisure is increasing its share of consumer spending. He wants the company to lead in what he defines as “social shopping” by “offering exciting new products, services and experiences”.  I’m not sure anyone’s ever been excited about going to Debenhams anywhere other than in Mr Bucher’s fevered dreams. But sure, try it out. It might even work. If you’re not going to be Primark, which gives customers what they want at knock down prices, and has become hugely successful as a result, you’ve got to try something different. It's tough out there on planet retail.   Debenhams is managing to make money even though profits were down a bit (which was expected). Sales held up, mind, and mobile devices drove a 64 per cent increase in those made via the online channel, which explains the company’s decision to make mobile aa key part of its new strategy.  There were also promises to shift 2,000 people into customer facing roles (good), speed up the replacement of stock, reduce the number of lines by 10 per cent, and spruce up the stores. Things that might work to pep up the numbers, although (again) with no targets it will be hard to judge.

It has invested more than £2bn in projects such as offshore wind farms and waste management.

As a result of the US trade embargo and other inefficiencies of Cuba's economy, thousands of basic household items are inaccessible to Cubans meaning that sometimes a little creativity is required to get the job done. At El Canal, a winery in Havana, Orestes Estevez and his family fill glass jugs with grapes, ginger and hibiscus, before securing a condom over each glass jug Allowing Heathrow to expand will create “a serious obstacle” to meeting the UK’s commitments on climate change and reducing air pollution, a leading scientist has warned.

The oval-cut 59.6 carat jewel, discovered in a mine in Africa by De Beers in 1999, is the largest fancy vivid pink diamond, categorised as “flawless” or “internally flawless”, that the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) has ever graded. It sold after a five-minute bidding war, that started at $56m, to Hong Kong jewellery retailer Chow Tai Fook at Sotheby's. AP 10/32 Stopping climate change could boost the world economy by £15 trillion - Tuesday March 21 Efforts to slow climate change won’t just keep the planet habitable. They will also boost the world economy by $19 trillion (£15.2 trillion). Investments in renewable power and energy efficiency will add about 0.8 per cent to global gross domestic product by 2050, the International Renewable Energy Agency, or Irena, said Monday in a report produced for the German government. Governments are committing resources to green energy in a bid to keep warming within 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), of pre-industrial conditions, in accordance with the landmark Paris Agreement on global warming.

The theme park will be the first of its kind in the UK, and is being created by film company Paramount at a cost of £3.5 billion.

The partnership, which is owned by its employees, reduced the bonus to 6 per cent of salaries making it the lowest since 1954. It is the fourth year in a row that the payment has been cut. Pre-tax profits rose 21.2 per cent to £370.4m as overall sales rose 3.2 per cent but the group said it cut staff bonuses because of an “increasingly uncertain” market.

Getty 16/32 Plastics industry 'pressured UK Government to cut recycling targets' - Friday February 17 Recycling targets in the UK were cut last year after successful lobbying from the plastics industry, a freedom of information request by Greenpeace has revealed. The Government came under fire last year after it announced that targets for plastic recycling would be reduced from 57 per cent to a mere 49 per cent for 2016 and then increased by 2 per cent each year to 2020, to a maximum of 57 per cent by 2020. AFP/Getty 17/32 Inflation hits 1.8% as post-Brexit pound weakness feeds through to high street - Tuesday February 14 UK consumer price inflation jumped to 1.8 per cent in the year to January, from a rise of 1.6 per cent in the year to December, as the slump in the pound since the Brexit referendum continued to trickle through to the high street. According to data from the Office for National Statistics published on Tuesday, January’s rise was the biggest since June 2014. But the jump narrowly missed analyst expectations for a 1.9 per cent increase, just below the Bank of England’s official 2 per cent target.

Getty 20/32 Brexit: Bank of England upgrades growth forecasts but still expects UK economy to be hit - Thursday Ferbruary 2 The Bank of England has dramatically upgraded its growth forecast for this year but stressed that households will still experience a major squeeze on incomes due to rising inflation. In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

Hatton Garden was the centre of the world's diamond market, but traders are fighting to bring back the glory days, as they are squeezed by rising rents and the uncertainty created by the UK vote to leave the EU. Reuters Perhaps that was why the City’s initial verdict was, shall we say, less than favourable. Perhaps investors just didn't believe the hype. Perhaps they were just cross that they didn't get the pictures of the model. Whatever the reasons, they marked the already struggling shares down by more than 5 per cent.  Which leads me to question how the elephant in the room will respond. Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct became a hugely successful business by following the Primark approach until it was derailed by the ugly scandal of the way it treated its workers.  He's been buying up Debs shares like they've been going out of fashion (actually they went out of fashion a long time ago, but we'll park that). Perhaps he thinks he can pick up the pieces if it all goes pear shaped?

Architects say it offers residents an 'oasis-like residence' to get away from the concrete jungle. Scroll down for video The Garden Hill designs in Digbeth in Birmingham are composed of two 25-storey high wooden residential towers and architects say it offers residents an 'oasis-like residence' GARDEN HILL DESIGNS The flats would also have unusual shared facilities including recording studios and spaces to rent for start-ups. The total floor space would be 414,410 sq ft (38,500 sq m). Designs also include between 120 to 200 car parking spaces as well as retail space on street level. The towers would be very environmentally-friendly and both electricity and water would be supplied by solar panels. Architects would also use passive ventilation and high quality insulation to reduce energy waste.   London-based firm Architects of Invention drew up the designs for Digbeth in Birmingham which would house 500 residences and would be made entirely of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT).  The green designs include shared and private garden terraces at every level with a spacious roof garden to top it all off.  The flats would also have unusual shared facilities including recording studios and spaces to rent for start-ups. 'The shape of the building means that light is maximised - for the residents and for their neighbours', lead architect Niko Japaridze told MailOnline. 'It also means that the garden plants will thrive - so Garden Hill can be green year-round', he said.  The total floor space would be 414,410 sq ft (38,500 sq m).  Designs also include between 120 to 200 car parking spaces as well as retail space on street level, according to New Atlas.  The towers would be very environmentally-friendly and both electricity and water would be supplied by solar panels.

THE HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON: MYTH AND MYSTERY For centuries, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were thought to have been built in the ancient Iraqi city of Babylon, because of the name. This location led people to believe it was built by the Emperor Nebuchadnezzar who lived around 600 BC. Since this time, archaeologists and historians have scoured the location of the ancient city but have been unable to find any physical evidence they existed - leading some to believe the gardens are a myth. It is one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World and was called the Hanging Gardens because they were supposedly built high above the ground on split-level stone terraces. Some texts referred to the plants in the gardens as ‘floating’ but they were believed, instead, to have hung from these different terraces, giving them the appearance of being suspended in mid-air. A Greek historian named Diordorus Siculus described the gardens as being 400ft wide by 400ft long, with walls as high as 80ft. Due to this height, water was said to have been transported from a lake at the bottom using a similar principle as Archimedes’ screw – a pump that scoops up water in a spiral tube and carries it to the top. It was said to have been invented by Archimedes in the 3rd Century BC yet if a similar system was used in the gardens, this would predate it by around 350 years. Given the size, historians have estimated the gardens would have used 8,200 gallons of water a day to water the plants. Some historians and archaeologists believe that the gardens were destroyed by war and erosion, while others believe an earthquake destroyed them. The roof gardens boast 360 degree views. The design concept is inspired by The Hanging Gardens of Babylon which were thought to have been built in the ancient Iraqi city of Babylon Although there are no immediate plans to build the design the proposed budget is £70 million (roughly US$90 million). The practice is currently having pre-application discussions with Birmingham city council more videos 1 2 3 Watch video HTC tease fans with shots of 'HTC U' phone to be released in May Watch video Robot dog that recognises FACES could be future of elderly care Watch video Soyuz rocket lifts off to deliver two astronauts to ISS Watch video Ultrasonic clothes dryer uses VIBRATIONS to dry in half the time Watch video Animation shows how Earth would appear if dominated by oceans Watch video Massive waterfall falls off the Nansen Ice Shelf into the ocean Watch video See through model rocket engine ignited in slow motion Watch video Robot cheetah in slow motion developed at University of Twente Watch video Lilium Aviation's first test flights for electric VTOL jet Watch video Horrific ISIS video shows child soldier handing knives to executioners Watch video Burglar caught on security camera robbing Dallas man's home Watch video Talented Frenchie shows off self-taught skateboarding skills   Read more: The Hanging Gardens of ....

One Paris-based industrial company would consider moving its headquarters to London in the case of Mr Mélenchon winning, said its chief executive, who asked not to be identified. The boss of another company, one of the biggest in the benchmark CAC 40 Index, said managers are drawing up a Plan B should Ms Le Pen win, though he wouldn’t give details. Aramis Auto, a Paris-based car broker, has made sure it can withstand a retreat by banks. “We secured our credit lines with our banks a few weeks ago to continue financing the business,” said Guillaume Paoli, the chief executive of Aramis, which sells 32,000 cars a year in France with a team of about 30 multilingual buyers purchasing vehicles across the European Union. “It’s difficult to do a checklist of measures to be taken” in the case of Ms Le Pen’s or Mr Mélenchon’s victory, he said. Read more Marine Le Pen vows to suspend immigration to 'protect France' Polls have tightened before Sunday’s first round of voting, making a 7 May runoff between Ms Le Pen of the far-right Front National and the Communist-backed Mr Mélenchon a more plausible scenario than it’s ever been. A victory for either one could lead to a plunge in the euro and in French government bonds, hurting banks and insurers that are big owners of sovereign debt. While big French companies that sell internationally would benefit initially from the weaker currency, the prospect of growing protectionism or higher taxes could weigh on businesses and stock prices. While companies generally won’t talk publicly about preparations to avoid alienating customers and government officials, many are looking at ways to improve their cash positions by issuing more debt for longer terms, or increasing their hedges against currency swings, according to a person familiar with the matter. “The economic philosophy of the two candidates is very similar; they’re anti-business,” said Jean-François Buet, chairman of an industry group for residential property brokers. “We don’t dare think of a duel between Marine Le Pen and Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the second round because that would be a catastrophe in terms of the economy.” The campaign has turned into a four-way race, with Ms Le Pen and independent Emmanuel Macron running just ahead of François Fillon of the centre-right Les Républicains and Mr Mélenchon, according to Bloomberg’s composite poll of voting intention. Opinion surveys show that either of the more business-friendly candidates, Mr Macron or Mr Fillon, would beat Ms Le Pen in the second round, but they also flag that as many as 40 per cent of voters remain undecided. Read more Isis flag and wig found at home of French election terror plotters Le Pen denies role of France in deporting Jews to Nazi death camps Leaving the euro would not help France and Italy, says ECB economist Ms Le Pen proposes withdrawing France from the euro and erecting trade barriers. Mr Mélenchon wants to renegotiate European treaties to give France more economic control, with conditions attached to staying in the euro. He wants to raise the minimum wage and renationalise utility companies. The premium that France pays over Germany to borrow for 10 years has climbed this year as markets priced in Mr Mélenchon’s rise in the polls and Ms Le Pen’s persistent strength. The euro has dropped about 5.6 per cent against the dollar in the past year. “We will start total resistance; this Le Pen-Mélenchon second round can’t happen,” Pierre Gattaz, the head of Mouvement des Entreprises de France (Medef), France’s biggest business lobby, said last week. Medef will spend the remaining days before the vote explaining the dangers of Mr Mélenchon’s and Ms Le Pen’s programmes. Ms Le Pen’s programme would increase public spending by €102bn (£86bn) a year. Mr Mélenchon’s measures would add more than €200bn, compared with less than €20bn for both Mr Macron and Mr Fillon, according to estimates from Institut Montaigne, a Paris-based think tank. While France’s biggest companies generate much of their earnings in other countries, the economy relies on small businesses that have fewer or no options to adapt or move operations abroad. France has close to four million companies and 99 per cent of them have fewer than 250 employees, according to 2013 data from Insee, the national statistics office.

In its latest Inflation Report, the Bank upgraded its 2017 GDP growth forecast to 2 per cent, up from 1.4 per cent in November. The revision is certain to be seized upon by Brexiteers as evidence that the economy will not suffer from leaving the European Union and that previous economic warnings from the Bank have now been exposed as scaremongering. Yet the Bank’s forecasts continue to project a growth slowdown in 2018 and 2019, with GDP expected to expand by 1.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent in those years.

After Socialist François Mitterrand won office and nationalised banks almost four decades ago, an expected flood of exiles turned out to be a trickle. One who did leave: Bernard Arnault, now France’s richest man, moved to the US in 1981 to work in property development, and returned to France in 1984 to build his luxury-goods empire. “Some who would like to leave may, for instance, move their head office to the Netherlands, but it’s a major change and can’t be done in just a few weeks,” said Pierre de Lauzun, the head of the French Association of Financial Markets, which represents 140 broker dealers and securities firms. “A firm can’t rapidly change its real footprint, its plants, customers and providers.” Still, a Ms Le Pen or Mr Mélenchon win would have an immediate effect, said Mr Paoli, the car-brokerage chief. “We would immediately stop investing, stop nice-to-have expenses, stop salary increases and hiring,” he says. “We would put ourselves in wait-and-see attitude.” Bloomberg More about: Marine Le Pen Jean-Luc Mélenchon France Macron Fillon Melenchon Guillaume Paoli Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.
