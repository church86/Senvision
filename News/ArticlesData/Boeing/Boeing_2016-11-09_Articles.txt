John D. Simmons jsimmons@charlotteobserver.com i By Keith Bradsher New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SHANGHAI As a candidate, Donald Trump aimed some of his most blistering words at China, declaring that “we already have a trade war” and suggesting ominously that “we have the power over China, economic power.” As president of the United States, Trump can use trade – a cornerstone of his populist rise – as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world’s two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win. Cutting off trade will not bring back the bulk of U.S. manufacturing jobs lost to China in previous decades as it became the world’s factory floor. Already, some industries that left the United States years ago, such as garment making and some light manufacturing, are now leaving China for even cheaper places. An aggressive stance with China also risks antagonizing an authoritarian government with its own brand of economic nationalism. Yet the unsettling reality for Beijing is that Trump has a variety of ways to get back at China for trade practices that he, his supporters or people in the affected industries view as unfair. China sells a large array of goods to the United States that he can aim at for higher tariffs. The opportunities for China to retaliate would be more limited. In the most basic terms, China buys less from the United States. But China could make some strategic strikes at targets like Boeing, U.S. automakers and American farmers. Beijing exerts tight control over China’s airlines, for example, and sometimes steers contracts to Airbus, Boeing’s European rival, when officials feel that Washington is uncooperative. “Boeing complains, ‘We have been pretty good friends with China. Why are we always a target?’” said He Weiwen, a former Chinese commerce ministry official who is now the co-director of the China-U.S.-EU Study Center at the influential China Association of International Trade in Beijing. Or China could wreak havoc on the vast yet delicate supply chain behind a wide range of products like iPhones and auto parts. Six years ago, Chinese restrictions on exports of obscure yet vital minerals led to a global outcry by manufacturers. Early indications are that trade could take a more prominent place on the White House’s China agenda, which under President Barack Obama was dominated by Beijing’s territorial claims in East Asia and its influence over North Korea. In a strong signal, Trump has turned to Dan DiMicco, a longtime steel executive and trade critic, to oversee trade issues during his administration’s transition. DiMicco, former CEO of Charlotte-based Nucor, writes a personal blog, liberally sprinkled with exclamation points, that blames America’s industrial decline on cheating by trade partners, particularly China. “Hillary Clinton has claimed Trump’s trade policies will start a ‘Trade War’ but what she fails to recognize is we are already in one,” he wrote on his blog last summer. “Trump clearly sees it and he will work to put an end to China’s ‘Mercantilist Trade War’! A war it has been waging against us for nearly 2 decades!” On Thursday, Lu Kang, a spokesman for China’s Foreign Ministry, said, “It is in the common interests of both countries to develop a long-term, stable and prosperous trading relationship.” Trump’s views veer widely from the free-trade positions of the Republican Party in recent years and signal a return to the more hawkish positions of the Reagan administration, which repeatedly went after Japan on trade issues. Since President Ronald Reagan, Republican and Democratic administrations have been reluctant to confront countries that may be subsidizing or dumping exports, either because the evidence is unclear or because of a risk of damaging diplomatic or strategic relations. “This is the kind of stuff you learn in law school, and in the early days of your law career,” said Alan H. Price, a longtime lawyer for the American steel and aluminum industries at Wiley Rein. When used, the measures were sometimes deemed ineffective. In one rare example, Obama used his powers to impose tariffs of up to 35 percent on imports of Chinese tires soon after he took office. The tariffs prompted China to impose steep tariffs on U.S. chicken meat and automotive products. Both countries complained to the World Trade Organization, which mostly sided with the United States. The case resulted in the United States producing more tires, but imports from other countries rose even faster. And the Obama administration later became more cautious about challenging China with trade restrictions. Limits to trade actions Any trade actions by Trump would face limits. This year, he mentioned imposing a tariff of 45 percent on all imports from China. But he later avoided specifics – and he has limited power to do so anyway. The law allows him to impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent, and for as long as 150 days, on all imports, unless a national emergency is declared. Other laws allow him to impose tariffs on targeted goods. Should Trump want to signal an aggressive stance quickly, he could move against imports of steel and aluminum from China. The Obama administration has been preparing to file a World Trade Organization case against China over claims that it subsidized aluminum exports. And the United States, Japan and the European Union already complain that Chinese government subsidies have produced a bloated domestic steel industry that they say dumps millions of tons of excess goods on world markets each year. China is more vulnerable given the sheer amount of stuff it sells to America. For more than a decade, China has consistently exported about $4 worth of goods to the United States for each $1 of goods that it imports. Exports to the U.S. represent about 4 percent of the Chinese economy; U.S. exports to China are only about two-thirds of 1 percent of the U.S. economy. “We don’t have many things in the toolbox for retaliation, because we export more than we import,” said He, the former Chinese commerce ministry official. Still, China could inflict pain on sensitive areas that provide U.S. jobs, like Boeing’s jetliners. Boeing declined to comment except to say, “We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress and look forward to working with them to make sure we continue to grow the global economy and protect our people.” General Motors and Ford Motor Co., consider China a big contributor to sales. They mostly manufacture in China to supply the domestic market. But much of the design and engineering work is still done in the United States. China could hurt the automakers by adopting domestic policies that help their big European rivals, notably Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz. Other U.S. companies may be less opposed to trade limits than in the past. Some U.S. companies have been struggling to sell in China. Beijing has steered contracts to Chinese telecommunications companies after Edward Snowden’s revelations about U.S. intelligence gathering in China. And Chinese state-owned enterprises have shifted much of their investment banking business from Wall Street to homegrown rivals. U.S. farmers have welcomed Chinese purchases, but it is unclear how badly they could be hurt by any trade action. Chicken meat, soybeans, corn and other foodstuffs are commodities traded in world markets, and farmers are often able to sell elsewhere. Chinese goods have long helped keep prices down for Americans. But Chinese exports play a shrinking role in holding down prices as labor costs rise in China and as rivals like Indonesia, Vietnam and India expand manufacturing. China’s biggest potential weapon is to disrupt the supply chains of multinationals by halting exports of crucial materials or components. But that could damage China’s reputation as a reliable supplier. “I don’t think we will go that far at the moment, because there is a lot of room to negotiate,” He said. “If we are forced too much, nothing can be excluded.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Business Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:16 HB2: A timeline for North Carolina’s controversial law Pause 3:42 Cliff Barrows - A Singing Faith 1:58 Artist group claims responsibility for body-shaped installation hanged from trees at Winthrop University 2:32 Trump names Priebus chief of staff, other top advisors await appointments 1:40 Cam Newton following 20-17 loss to Chiefs 2:52 Dan DiMicco is Trump trade adviser 1:14 Firefighters having 'difficulty' containing South Mountains State Park wildfire in NC 5:14 McCrory: 'We're going to check everything' 1:49 Trump and Clinton made a combined total of almost 30 visits to North Carolina since June but did voters care? 2:10 Steve Clifford at shootaround Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 11 days ago Jesse Cureton introduces community coalition effort 2:37 11 days ago Jesse Cureton introduces community coalition effort 1:29 14 days ago PGA Championship preview 2:26 18 days ago Tour of the new 300 South Tryon project View more video Business Charlotte’s DiMicco could be in line for job influencing U.S. trade policies Bank of America top exec sees Trump win boosting revenue, cutting costs Activist investor pushing break-up proposal at Bank of America again Bank of America still lags peers on customer service poll Duke Energy agrees to $27 million settlement of shareholder claims Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-edition Newsletters RSS Feeds Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store News in Education Published Corrections Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Get News Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Advertising Information Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping CLT Digital Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-edition Newsletters RSS Feeds Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store News in Education Published Corrections Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Get News Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Advertising Information Place a Classified Find&Save Local Shopping CLT Digital More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration As Trump takes over, NASA considers alternatives to its Orion spacecraft In October the space agency quietly solicited ideas from Boeing, SpaceX, and others. by Eric Berger - Nov 10, 2016 4:47 pm UTC Login to bookmark 138 This image shows an Orion parachute test. NASA NASA has initiated a process that raises questions about the future of its Orion spacecraft. So far, this procedural effort has flown largely under the radar, because it came in the form of a subtle Request for Information (RFI) that nominally seeks to extend NASA’s contract to acquire future Orion vehicles after Exploration Mission-2, which likely will fly sometime between 2021 and 2023. Nevertheless, three sources familiar with the RFI, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, told Ars there is more to the request than a simple extension for Orion’s primary contractor, Lockheed Martin. Perhaps most radically, the RFI may even open the way for a competitor, such as Boeing or SpaceX, to substitute its own upgraded capsule for Orion in the mid-2020s. This RFI process, which originated in the Washington, DC-based office of the manager of NASA’s human spaceflight operations, Bill Gerstenmaier, appears to be an effort to keep the agency’s options open during a presidential transition. “This is NASA taking a breath and looking at alternatives,” one source told Ars. “Part of why they also did it is they are signaling to the next administration that they may be willing to look at alternatives.” Lockheed concerns In a heated competition a decade ago, Lockheed Martin won the initial contract to design and develop the deep-space Orion spacecraft, which was supposed to fly its first crewed mission in 2014. While the contractor has had to manage several significant change requests, there is nonetheless growing frustration with Lockheed inside NASA. The agency has spent nearly $10 billion so far on Orion, and although there was an uncrewed test flight in 2014, the first human mission won’t come for at least five more years. The new RFI states that Lockheed will continue with development of Orion through a second uncrewed flight set for late 2018 and Exploration Mission-2, the first crewed mission, as early as 2021. However, once this “base vehicle” configuration is established, the RFI signals NASA’s intent to find a less expensive path forward. “This RFI serves as an examination of the market, which is an initial step in pursuing any of the available acquisition strategies, including the exercising of existing options,” the document states. Unlike a more formal “Request for Proposals,” the RFI was written in a deliberately vague way, sources told Ars, in order to generate a wide variety of responses from industry. The most simple interpretation is that the RFI represents something of a “stalking horse” to drive down Lockheed’s bid to build subsequent Orions during the operational phase of the spacecraft, when NASA begins to fly crews into deep space, likely to a deep-space habitat. As part of this, the RFI anticipates moving from the existing cost-plus model to a fixed-price contract. "The NASA and Lockheed Martin team are approaching the end of Orion’s development phase having successfully tackled many of the toughest engineering challenges associated with deep space travel," Mike Hawes, Lockheed Martin's Orion Program Manager, said in a statement to Ars. "Now, as outlined in Lockheed Martin’s response to NASA’s RFI, we’ve identified savings that will reduce the recurring production costs of Orion by 50 percent – and we aren’t stopping there. We believe the cost savings we’ve defined in our response will enable decades of affordable human space exploration." The RFI clearly leaves the door open to other alternatives, however. The original structure of NASA’s contract with Lockheed Martin is such that NASA “owns” the design work when it is completed, so another contractor, if it could demonstrate a compelling cost advantage, could take over for Exploration Mission-3 and beyond. Enlarge / Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator for human exploration and operations, at the agency's headquarters in 2013. There are also hints of NASA expressing a willingness to consider other spacecraft to fulfill its needs in the 2020s and early 2030s, as it pushes crews into cislunar space, the area around the Moon. In contrast to a capsule designed for low-Earth orbit, a vehicle coming back from the Moon must have a more robust heat shield to tolerate higher temperatures during a return through the Earth’s atmosphere. Some members of Congress have quietly been asking NASA why it is now funding the development of three capsules. There is Orion for deep space, as well as Boeing’s Starliner and SpaceX’s Dragon for transport to the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit. It is possible one of these vehicles, or perhaps other concepts by companies such as Blue Origin or the Sierra Nevada Corporation, could be modified for a deep space return. “If a respondent wishes to provide a broader input beyond the topics described in this RFI or beyond the technical scope of the Orion spacecraft, then it is requested alternate responses be submitted separately,” the RFI states. It adds that these “alternate approaches” should include an analysis of their cost implications for NASA. Transition time The space agency posted the RFI in September and accepted responses through early October. NASA officials would not tell Ars how many companies responded. “This RFI was exploratory and intentionally open-ended and allowed industry the opportunity to provide feedback on a variety of areas, including interest in a potential future acquisition of Orion and perceived barriers to competition of Orion,” NASA spokeswoman Kathryn Hambleton told Ars. Sources said the timing coincided with the end of President Obama’s term in office, when NASA officials would begin meeting with transition team members of a new president. For the Trump administration the space effort is being led by Bob Walker, a former congressman, and Mark Albrecht, a long-time adviser to Republicans on space policy. Neither Walker nor Albrecht have been effusive in their praise of the Orion spacecraft or the Space Launch System rocket that will lift it into space. In October, during a forum at Rice University, Albrecht addressed the role transition teams play when a new president is preparing to take office. “The first thing a new administration will do is an independent review of the status of programs, and what they find will surprise no one,” Albrecht said. Inevitably, he added, an independent commission will discover an ever-growing NASA bureaucracy and underfunded, overambitious programs. Ars understands that there are also discussions in Gerstenmaier’s office about issuing a similar RFI for the Space Launch System rocket, which has Boeing as its primary contractor. This would not be too great of a surprise, because at least two companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, are privately developing heavy-lift alternatives that theoretically could offer significant savings to the large government rocket. NASA would not confirm whether an RFI for the Space Launch System rocket will actually be issued, however. “Due to the sensitivity of the procurement process, NASA doesn’t comment on future procurement strategy,” Hambleton said. “Any future procurement activity will be worked through the standard process.” A replacement? Entering into the transition period between presidents, NASA’s administrator, Charles Bolden, has encouraged the next White House administration to continue support for Orion and the Space Launch System rocket, which account for more than $3 billion annually. Congress, too, has expressed a strong interest in continuing work on these vehicles. However one source told Ars that it may become necessary to choose either the Orion capsule or NASA rocket in the coming years as the space agency looks to pare back its budget, and this might necessitate going to a less expensive, more privately developed vehicle. “Look,” this source said, “if you have to cancel a program, this is a responsible way of lining up a replacement.” Without knowing the responses NASA received to the Orion RFI, it is not possible to know what options the agency—and the incoming Trump administration—will have when it comes to NASA’s flagship spacecraft and potentially its rocket. But what seems plain is that Gerstenmaier—a cautious, highly regarded engineer expected to remain at the agency after Bolden leaves along with the Obama administration—believes it prudent to offer incoming officials a suite of possibilities.

The Saudi media group came with the Saudi Arabian Airlines (Saudia) to attend the receiving on Wednesday of Saudia’s first Boeing B777-300ER aircraft which is supplied with new and luxurious compartments for the first class passengers. Visitors were allowed into the factory to take a look at the Boeing 777 Worldliner and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, among other aircraftThe factory, located in Seattle, is regarded as one of the largest manufacturers of aircraft in the world with an area of more than 3 kilometers square, and more than 40,000 workers working on three shifts 24 hours a day to produce around 21 different aircraft a month. The media had the chance to have a general look of how several planes are produced, including assembled models 747 and 767 and 777 and 787 Dreamliner. Harber said the new Boeing B777-300ER aircraft has fuel efficiency of around 2 percent, luxurious special interior design that give the passengers comfort, and the capability to have more chairs compared to the old planes because of larger space. He added that the upcoming 777X jet is scheduled to have its first delivery in 2020. The new engine will be better than any other engines since the fuel efficiency would be around 5 percent. The plane is considered as a friendly environment aircraft. A published report said Boeing has invested $300 million so far in the new plant, which will have about 700 employees over the next few years and support the 777X assembly operations in Everett, Washington. Boeing is celebrating its 100th year this year.

Posted 10 Nov 2016 04:15 Updated 10 Nov 2016 05:35 U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks at election night rally in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar Enlarge Caption  Email More A A SEATTLE: U.S. aerospace companies and lobbying groups embraced Donald Trump's presidential victory on Wednesday, setting aside fears that his policies would depress sales, shatter global alliances and roll back trade agreements. Defense contractors in particular stand to benefit from a Trump presidency, given his pledges to beef up the U.S. military. Boeing Co , which is finalizing a deal to sell 100 jetliners to Iran, congratulated Trump and members of Congress and said it looked forward to working with them to promote global economic growth and protect workers. Trump has strongly criticized an Iran nuclear deal that made the sale possible. The warm response from the world's No. 1 plane maker echoed friendly overtures from other U.S. manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co , which endured sharp criticism from Trump during the campaign for its growing operations in Mexico. Manufacturers also pressed Trump on issues such as restoring the U.S. Export-Import Bank, increasing defense spending and pouring more investment into airport infrastructure. Shares of aerospace and defense companies rose on Wednesday. The Dow Jones U.S. aerospace and defense index was up 4 percent in afternoon trading. Boeing shares were up 2 percent at US$145.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Among other major arms makers, Raytheon Co was up 7.4 percent at US$146.56 and Lockheed Martin Corp was up 6 percent at US$253.50. NO "TREATY RIPPING" Trump had derided trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership as bad deals, and vowed to renegotiate them. He also threatened to upend global security alliances. But on Wednesday, industry trade groups said Trump had not created as much uncertainty for manufacturers as his rhetoric suggested, and offered policy prescriptions. "It would be hard for a brand new president to come in and say, 'I'm ripping up this treaty,'" David Melcher, chief executive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association, said in an interview. The organization, founded in 1919, represents more than 300 aerospace and defense companies. Requiring alliance partners to pay more for defense "is probably a neutral" for U.S. arms sales, he added. Boeing's defense and space businesses could get a boost from an expected increase in military spending under Trump. "We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress," Boeing said in a statement. We "look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers, as well as preserve American leadership in national security." There were signs of lingering concern about the negative tone of the campaign. The National Association of Manufacturers sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday, signed by more than 1,100 business leaders citing "an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions." Signers included the chief executives of Boeing, Honeywell International Inc , United Technologies Corp , Lockheed Martin Corp , Northrop Grumman Corp and Caterpillar Inc .

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 10, 2016 SEATTLE - U.S. aerospace companies and lobbying groups embraced Donald Trump's presidential victory on Wednesday, setting aside fears that his policies would depress sales, shatter global alliances and roll back trade agreements. Defense contractors in particular stand to benefit from a Trump presidency, given his pledges to beef up the U.S. military. Boeing Co <BA.N>, which is finalizing a deal to sell 100 jetliners to Iran, congratulated Trump and members of Congress and said it looked forward to working with them to promote global economic growth and protect workers. Trump has strongly criticized an Iran nuclear deal that made the sale possible. The warm response from the world's No. 1 plane maker echoed friendly overtures from other U.S. manufacturers such as Ford Motor Co <F.N>, which endured sharp criticism from Trump during the campaign for its growing operations in Mexico. Manufacturers also pressed Trump on issues such as restoring the U.S. Export-Import Bank, increasing defense spending and pouring more investment into airport infrastructure. Shares of aerospace and defense companies rose on Wednesday. The Dow Jones U.S. aerospace and defense index was up 4 percent in afternoon trading. Boeing shares were up 2 percent at $145.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. Among other major arms makers, Raytheon Co <RTN.N> was up 7.4 percent at $146.56 and Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N> was up 6 percent at $253.50. NO "TREATY RIPPING" Trump had derided trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership as bad deals, and vowed to renegotiate them. He also threatened to upend global security alliances. But on Wednesday, industry trade groups said Trump had not created as much uncertainty for manufacturers as his rhetoric suggested, and offered policy prescriptions. "It would be hard for a brand new president to come in and say, 'I'm ripping up this treaty,'" David Melcher, chief executive officer of the Aerospace Industries Association, said in an interview. The organization, founded in 1919, represents more than 300 aerospace and defense companies. Requiring alliance partners to pay more for defense "is probably a neutral" for U.S. arms sales, he added. Boeing's defense and space businesses could get a boost from an expected increase in military spending under Trump. "We congratulate President-elect Trump and newly elected members of Congress," Boeing said in a statement. We "look forward to working with them to ensure that U.S. companies can compete, win and grow our economy to provide good jobs to U.S. workers, as well as preserve American leadership in national security." There were signs of lingering concern about the negative tone of the campaign. The National Association of Manufacturers sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday, signed by more than 1,100 business leaders citing "an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions." Signers included the chief executives of Boeing, Honeywell International Inc <HON.N>, United Technologies Corp <UTX.N>, Lockheed Martin Corp <LMT.N>, Northrop Grumman Corp <NOC.N> and Caterpillar Inc <CAT.N>. U.S. businesses "cannot truly prosper ... in a country that is divided and distrustful," Jay Timmons, chief executive officer of the trade group, wrote in the letter, adding it is "time to mend the divisions in our country."

News Business Business News Donald Trump wins: Over 1,000 top CEOs write to President-elect urging him to end divisive rhetoric Bosses of Coke, Pfizer, Boeing and more warn of 'an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions', after the bitterest election campaign in history Ben Chapman Thursday 10 November 2016 12:49 BST Not a single chief executive of America's top 100 companies donated funds to Mr Trump's campaign Reuters Chief executives of more than 1,100 US companies, including Coca-Cola, Boeing and Pfizer have written an open letter to President-elect, Donald Trump urging him to end his divisive campaign rhetoric. “American families, businesses and our communities cannot truly prosper and reach their full potential in a country that is divided and distrustful,” the letter said, in an apparent reference to Trump’s often-inflammatory speeches. The Republican real-estate tycoon has called Mexicans living in the US rapists and made a string of derogatory remarks about women on the campaign trail and previously. Read more Donald Trump wins: Thousands of Americans take to streets to protest The letter urged him to work with businesses to “bring our country back together again”, after perhaps the most bitter election campaign in US history. Business leaders, including the chief of arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin, warned Mr Trump of “an urgent need to restore faith in our vital economic and government institutions,” after what they described as a “particularly difficult election”. A process of healing is required after the “harshness of the campaign season”, the leaders said. Businesses have expressed concern as Mr Trump has repeatedly pushed protectionist policies which many believe will stunt economic growth. Mr Trump railed against companies for relocating jobs to China and India at the expense of the US.  President Trump protests 20 show all President Trump protests 1/20 Patrons hold a sign as people march by while protesting the election of Republican Donald Trump as the president of the United States in downtown Los Angeles, California Reuters 2/20 Demonstrators rally following the election of Republican Donald Trump as President of the United States, in Oakland, California Reuters 3/20 Demonstrators march following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States Reuters 4/20 Thousands of protesters rallied across the United States expressing shock and anger over Donald Trump's election, vowing to oppose divisive views they say helped the Republican billionaire win the presidency AFP/Getty Images 5/20 Demonstrators protest outside the Chicago Theatre in Chicago, Illinois Getty 6/20 A police officer aims a launcher after demonstrators threw projectiles toward a line of officers during a demonstration in Oakland, California Reuters 7/20 An officer examines a vandalized police vehicle as demonstrators riot in Oakland, California Reuters 8/20 Demonstrators take over the Hollywood 101 Freeway just north of Los Angeles City Hall in protest against the election of Republican Donald Trump as President of the United States Reuters 9/20 A woman holds up a sign reading 'Trump you are an Idiot' as demonstrators gather during a protest against President-elect Donald Trump outside the City Hall building in Los Angeles, California EPA 10/20 A masked demonstrator gestures toward a police line during a demonstration in Oakland, California Reuters 11/20 Demonstrators protest against the election of Republican Donald Trump as President of the United States, near the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Las Vegas, Nevada Reuters 12/20 Musician Lagy Gaga stages a protest against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on a sanitation truck outside Trump Tower in New York City Getty 13/20 A woman yells as she takes part in a protest against President-elect Donald Trump in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood AP 14/20 A man dressed in red-white-and-blue sits on the curb during a protest against President-elect Donald Trump in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood AP 15/20 A protester sets off fireworks during a protest against President-elect Donald Trumpin Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood AP 16/20 University of California, Davis students protest on campus in Davis, California, U.S. following the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States Reuters 17/20 An Oakland police officer checks out damage after a window was broken by protesters at a car dealership in downtown Oakland, Calif AP 18/20 A protester faces a police line in downtown Oakland, Calif AP 19/20 President-elect Donald Trumpís victory set off multiple protests AP 20/20 A fire burns during protests in Oakland, Calif AP Not a single chief executive of America’s 100 largest companies donated money to Mr Trump's campaign, with many preferring Hillary Clinton as the establishment candidate. One policy that has pleased executives, however, is a proposed corporation tax cut from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, while banks are positive about his pledge to dismantle Wall Street regulation. Jay Timmons, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said: “When you have an economy that’s not working as it should, with people being displaced out of jobs, frustrated with their economic progress and with their families’ standing, then you’re going to have this kind of negative response and reaction… But the solution is what the business community offers."

This makes Emirates the first and only airline in the world to operate a fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft for its passenger flights. Emirates operates an all-A380 New Zealand service with five double-decker flights a day to Dubai and beyond - four from Auckland and one from Christchurch. Emirates recently retired the last of the 29 Airbus A330 aircraft that had been operating as part of its fleet. Aircraft A6-EAK joined Emirates in 2002 and had flown for over 60,000 hours, travelling close to 45 million kilometres in 14.5 years. That distance is equivalent to almost 60 return journeys between the Earth and the Moon. Emirates has also phased out A6-ERN, the last serving Airbus A340 in the fleet, which had joined the airline in 2004 and was originally manufactured in 1999. Since January 2015, Emirates has retired 18 A330 and five A340 aircraft from its fleet. The average age of the Airbus A330 and A340 aircraft phased out from the fleet is 16.5 years- a figure which is well below the industry standard retirement age of 25 years. In addition to the aircraft that have been retired from active service since January 2015, Emirates plans to further phase out some 25 aircraft over the course of 2017 and 2018 to ensure that the operating fleet remains modern and efficient while offering customers a higher level of comfort and safety. The retirement of older aircraft is balanced by the induction of younger, more modern aircraft into the fleet. This has resulted in Emirates operating one of the youngest fleets in the industry with an average age of 5.2 years. The two youngest aircraft in the fleet- Emirates’ 85th A380, the first of the new generation A380 aircraft delivered in October 2016, and Emirates’ 125th Boeing 777-300ER- are less than two weeks old. Emirates’ fleet of all Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft will also have a smaller environmental impact as both aircraft types have better fuel efficiency and emissions performance than the retired aircraft. For the calendar year 2016 Emirates will have taken delivery of 36 new aircraft - 20 Airbus A380s and 16 Boeing 777s. This also includes the next generation Boeing 777-300ER aircraft - with upgraded business class seats and other features including a lower fuel burn ratio - to be delivered from November 2016.

perks News provided by Alaska Airlines Nov 10, 2016, 14:30 ET Share this article SEATTLE, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Starting today Alaska Airlines fliers who want a little more legroom will have the option to purchase seats with up to four more inches of space between rows. The airline will debut its Premium Class section for travel on select routes beginning Jan. 5, 2017, as it continues a significant retrofit of its all-Boeing fleet. In addition to four extra inches of legroom, passengers seated in Premium Class will enjoy early boarding, snacks and complimentary drinks. Alaska Mileage Plan MVP, Gold and Gold 75K members will be eligible for complimentary upgrades into Premium Class at the time of booking, or up to 24 hours in advance of travel, depending on status and the fare purchased.  Continue Reading Alaska Airlines Premium Class on sale today With the addition of Premium Class, Alaska's most loyal customers who aren't able to upgrade into First Class will see a significantly increased likelihood of getting a seat with more legroom near the front of the cabin. "Premium Class is the most recent example of the on-going investment we are making to enhance the customer experience on our airplanes," said Andrew Harrison, executive vice president and chief commercial officer at Alaska Airlines. "We will continue to reward our loyal customers by offering one of the most generous upgrade policies in the industry with an average of 60 percent of the First Class cabin being occupied by upgraded elites." For more information around upgrades for elites see the Alaska Airlines blog: Treat yourself: Alaska Airlines launches new Premium Class Initial prices for Premium Class seats range from $15 to $79 in addition to base fares and are based on the length of the flight. Seats in the new section can be purchased at the time of booking through alaskaair.com or Alaska's mobile apps, during check-in, and at the airport. Premium Class seats are located in the front portion of the main cabin, allowing for faster boarding and deplaning. The new section offers an additional four inches of legroom, with 35 inches of space between rows, compared to the 31 to 32 inches between rows in the rest of the main cabin.  "As a businessman who flies at least 75,000 miles every year, the extra room allowed me to work more comfortably with my laptop and is almost like having a mini office in the air," said Frank Albano, an Alaska frequent flier who has logged more than a million miles and was recently seated in the new section on one of the reconfigured planes. First Class cabin enhancements The aircraft retrofits will also result in significantly expanded legroom in the First Class cabin, which will increase from 36 to 41 or 42 inches, and will be among the most spacious First Class cabins domestically. In addition to the increased legroom, First Class customers will continue to enjoy a seat that is four inches wider, free inflight entertainment tablets, a complimentary selection of fine wines and spirits, and chef-inspired, locally-sourced snacks and meals. It is expected that nearly half of the fleet will feature Premium Class by the end by the end of 2016, with the balance of planes being reconfigured in 2017. A decision on when the 737-700s will be retrofitted will be announced mid-2017. Alaska will retire its fleet of 737-400s in 2017. The upgrade option will also be available on the Embraer 175s operated by SkyWest Airlines and soon, Horizon Air. Plane Type Fleet count* Current Cabin (First Class/ Main Cabin) Reconfigured Cabin (First Class/Premium Class/Main Cabin) 737-800 61 16/147 12/30/117 737-900/900ER 77 16/165 16/24/138 737-700 11 12/112 More detail to come in 2017 E175 15 12/64 12/12/52 Premium Class is replacing Preferred Plus, which was only available in exit rows and bulkhead seats. Customers on flights that have yet to be retrofitted, can still can purchase extra legroom starting at $15, during booking, check-in, at the airport, or through the Alaska Airlines mobile app. Once an aircraft is upgraded, exit row seats will no longer be available for purchase. In the past two years, Alaska has made significant investments to improve the customer experience throughout the aircraft providing customers more of what they love, which includes outfitting nearly half of its fleet with larger overhead bins that increase room for carry-on baggage by 48 percent and providing personal power outlets at every seat. Also, customers can enjoy Pacific Northwest-inspired food from iconic Seattle chef Tom Douglas, local wine and spirits, custom-designed leather seats, and free and premium streaming entertainment on every flight.** To purchase a Premium Class upgrade, visit alaskaair.com, or call 1-800-ALASKAAIR (800-252-7522 or Hearing & Speech Impaired (TTY): Dial 711 for Relay Services).

Coming Thursday: the 2016 Defense One Summit, Nov. 17 in DC Yes, Big Data Did Triumph on Election Day White House: $11.6B More Needed for ISIS Fight, Afghanistan Will Trump Keep Obama’s Top Mideast General? Global Business Brief: Trump looks good for defense business; New faces at the Pentagon Sponsor Content How Cloud Will Affect the Future of Policing Defense One Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email → News Threats Politics Business Tech Ideas Trump looks good for defense business; New faces at the Pentagon; Want to buy an Army Humvee? By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio November 10, 2016 Topics The Global Business Brief Industry 2016 AA Font size + Print Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio November 10, 2016 Last year, Byron Callan was among the first to seriously examine what a President Trump would mean for Wall Street and the investment community. The Capital Alpha analyst opened his Dec. 13, 2015, note like this: “We don’t expect Donald Trump will be the next President. However we have some thoughts regarding defense if we are wrong.” The gist: we don’t know much about Trump’s defense plan other than some broad themes. A year later, we still don’t know the specifics, but it appears that defense spending could be one of this election’s biggest winners. Companies had been expecting a boost no matter who won; the question was how much. Now with a Republican heading to the White House in January and the GOP keeping control of both chambers of Congress, the consensus appears “higher than expected,” even though Trump has not yet laid out detailed detailed defense plans. “Overall we believe the outcome of the recent election will bolster what was already an improving demand environment for defense contractors, despite some uncertainties about spending levels and priorities,” said Christopher Denicolo, a credit analyst with S&P Global. Subscribe Get The Global Business Brief in your inbox: The must-read news, analysis and insights about the intersection of business and international security. The other big factor: The Budget Control Act — sometimes called sequestration — which caps federal spending. The BCA runs through 2021 and lawmakers must find a way to repeal it in order to spend more on defense. The other option is to pay use the war budget — know as Overseas Contingency Operations — to fund the increases. Where to watch. Defense stocks have performed well in recent years despite a slide in defense spending. They have cut jobs and factories to reduce overhead from less government work. Many have also looked for business overseas. Campaign donations from employees of defense firms ran 2-to-1 for Hillary Clinton. But in the wake of Trump’s upset victory, defense executives expressed a high level of optimism they they would see more Pentagon business heading their way. How will defense firms react? Keep an eye on key personnel in the government relations divisions of large defense firms, aka their internal lobbying shops. Lockheed Martin seems well positioned here with Robert Rangel — chief of staff to former Defense Secretaries Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates — leading its Washington operations. What sectors might see more investment? Aside from what’s been broadly mentioned by Trump — ships, aircraft and missile defense — we could look to the woman leading his Pentagon transition team for some clues. Mira Ricardel is a former Boeing executive and former acting assistant secretary of Defense for International Security Policy in the George W. Bush administration. Tony Bertuca over at Inside Defense confirmed her Trump assignment this week. She’s working for Keith Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who is in charge of the defense transition writ large, including the Defense and Veterans Affairs departments. In recent years, Ricardel has called for satellites to track missiles launched by rogue states and lasers to blast those rockets from the sky. At an August conference in Alabama, the head of the Pentagon’s Missile Defense agency talked about those two subjects, lasers and tracking satellites. Since Ricardel worked in Boeing’s Strategic Missile & Defense Systems, that could bode well for the Pentagon’s nuclear-weapons overhaul. While the Air Force’s new B-21 stealth bomber and Navy’s Columbia-class missile submarine appear to have backing inside the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, the wildcard has been the prospect of a new ICBM. Ricardel’s background suggests more emphasis on the effort, defense observers say. Where we might get some clues about Trump’s Pentagon? The conservative Heritage Foundation — which Trump has relied on for advice — is releasing its third annual “Index of U.S. Military Strength” today, the “latest assessments of global threats and the U.S. military.” A common theme in the two previous versions of the report are that the military is too small, in terms of people and equipment, to fight two wars simultaneously. Speakers at next week’s release event include Rep. Michael Turner, Ohio; Dakota Wood, senior research fellow, defense programs and editor, Index of U.S. Military Strength; and Thomas Spoehr, a retired Army lieutenant general and director of Heritage’s Center for National Defense. Welcome! You’ve reached Defense One’s Global Business Brief. With the dust still settling from Trump’s victory, we’ll be spending the next few months focused on the transition and what it means for the business of defense.

From Defense One Defense Stocks Soar on News of Trump Victory // Marcus Weisgerber In early trading, the new commander in chief’s promises to rebuild the American military are helping defense stocks buck the wider market plunge. Obama’s Final Arms-Export Tally More than Doubles Bush’s // Marcus Weisgerber and Caroline Houck Most of the $278 billion in approved sales have gone to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast allies. Yes, Big Data Did Triumph on Election Day // Patrick Tucker One computer forecasting system predicted Trump’s victory — the one with the least human input. New Faces at the Pentagon There has been widespread speculation in recent months about top Pentagon officials who wanted to remain their positions should Clinton be elected president. So who is might be in line for jobs in a Trump Pentagon? While there have been reports though that the Trump team has had difficulty filling national security seats, my pal Dan Lamothe at The Washington Post has a good write-up for some of the names being tossed around, Sen. Jeff Sessions, Rep. Duncan Hunter and Steven Hadley. Joseph Schmitz, a lawyer who served as the Pentagon’s inspector general during the George W. Bush administration, has advised Trump and could be in line for a security-related position. There had even been whispers — much earlier this year — that Defense Secretary Ash Carter was interested in sticking around. But it’s likely that the only Obama appointee who might stick around to help with the transition is Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work. Frank Kendall, the undersecretary for acquisition, technology and logistics, wanted to stay, but that’s highly unlikely now, sources say. And don’t forget the looming legislation from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that would eliminate Kendall’s undersecretary position entirely. Sierra Nevada Expanding Drone Business Now to some non-election news. Sierra Nevada, the privately held aerospace and defense firm, and its subsidiary Kutta Technologies plan to open an office in Huntsville, Alabama, near the Army’s Redstone Arsenal. Kutta specializes in drone technology, notably mobile ground controllers for soldiers on the battlefield. “Having a local presence near Redstone Arsenal is a tremendous opportunity to improve our ability to assist our customers and continue to advance new and existing programs,” said David Barnhard, Kutta’s director of business development. Want to Buy an Army Humvee? More than 400 of the AM General-made trucks are up for auction next week. “These specialty units are demilitarized and outfitted for sports and outdoor enthusiasts,” boasts IronPlanet, the online auction house brokering the sales. Bidding starts as low as $3,500 for damaged vehicles and $35,000 for ones in better shape. Many are painted in green camouflage. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to Fisher House Foundation, IronHouse said in a statement. With the Army buying more than 50,000 new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, more Humvees could hit the surplus market in the coming years. Check out more, here.

(NFLX) a Buy on the Pullback Recent Posts: Time to Grab Up Bargains in the Nasdaq Trade of the Day: Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) a Buy on the Pullback Small Caps Leading the Party in the Markets View All Posts Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) — Boeing is the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial jets and the second-largest maker of military weapons. Long-term government contracts and a solid cash position, as well as a solid backlog of business, encouraged Standard & Poor’s to maintain a four-star buy rating on the stock. S&P projects earnings of $7.42 this year, down from $7.44 in 2015. Orders from the new administration to replace an aging fleet of military aircraft, including the KC46 tanker, or a newer version of that aircraft, and backlogs of civilian orders for 737’s and 787’s remain high and could enable Boeing to return to a historically high stream of revenues. S&P has a target price of $172 following third-quarter earnings-per-share of $3.51, which beat their $2.25 estimate on stronger revenues than projected. Diluted public shares, due to an aggressive share buyback program, also contributed to the recent EPS increase. EPS of $9.56 is projected for 2017. 7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire Growth Boeing, like many blue chips, has spent most of 2016 in a rectangle (bullish consolidation pattern). The stock broke from that pattern when better-than-expected Q3 earnings were announced on Oct. 26. The breakout ran into resistance at about $145, pulled back to $140, and on yesterday’s election news jumped to a $145 close. Buy a partial position in BA at $145 and a full position at $140 with a target of $175, rendering a return of 25%-plus within six months. BA pays a dividend of $4.36 per share for a dividend yield around 3%.

The two-year grant will support a range of programs designed to provide diverse populations of students with meaningful arts education opportunities and increase overall arts participation by teachers and students across Edmonds and surrounding school districts. Specifically, the grant supports these ECA programs in both 2016 and 2017: annual Summer Arts Enrichment Camps, free Artist Residencies & Outreach programs for young people, and professional development opportunities for educators. The Boeing Company has supported education and outreach efforts at Edmonds Center for the Arts with a previous grant.  “In 2015-16, ECA was able to engage nearly 11,000 children, families, teachers and community members of all ages through Education & Outreach programming.  Summer Arts Enrichment Camps and Artist Residency & Outreach programs are critical areas of our ongoing engagement with the community. ECA is deeply grateful to The Boeing Company for this support and partnership,” said Gillian Jones, Director of Programming for ECA. ECA’s next Boeing-supported project is a free Teacher Workshop called Hocus Focus with internationally-renowned illusionist Kevin Spencer. OOSPI as an In-Service Education Agency, participants will be eligible to earn clock-hour credits.   Share this: Tweet SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleReminder: Draft Highway 99 area plan to be presented at Nov. 10 open house Next articleReminder: Edmonds businesses once again celebrate with Localvore shopping event Nov. 12 Emily Hill LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply Notify me of follow-up comments by email.

It is the first-ever service from Munich to that airport, and will be operated with an Air Atlanta Icelandic Boeing B747-400F. Bavaria, with its powerful industrial base and the many companies in the automotive, mechanical engineering, electrical and chemical sectors that rely on the import and export of goods, is a key region in Germany for Senator International. By launching a direct connection to Greenville/Spartanburg – initially with one flight per week – the company is now expanding the services offered to its customers. “With Munich, we now have our own optimal freight connection between the vital German and US markets for the first time. The hub in southern Germany was a very conscious choice for us. We see enormous potential here, and not only for this region,” said Tim-Oliver Kirschbaum, the managing director of Senator International. “Serving this new route with a B747-400F is a strong affirmation of Munich’s importance as an airfreight center. Every day, goods originating in Bavaria, other parts of southern Germany, Austria, eastern Europe and northern Italy are flown from our airport to destinations all over the world. We’re looking forward to working together in the coming years with companies like Senator International on the continuing development of Munich Airport as a cargo hub,” said Dr Michael Kerkloh, the CEO of Munich Airport.

Bombardier Advertisement Bombardier Inc. (IW 1000/220) surged the most in six months after forecasting annual profit at the high end of its previous outlook as the maker of the much-delayed C Series jetliner slowed the rate at which it had been burning through funds. Higher operating cash flow and reduced investment following certification of the CS100 and CS300 models of the marquee aircraft are driving the improvements, the Montreal-based company said in a statement Thursday. Earnings before interest, taxes and special items this year will be $350 million to $400 million, compared with a previous forecast of $200 million to $400 million, Bombardier said. “We are gaining confidence in Bombardier’s ability to meet its long-term margin targets,” Cam Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Montreal, said in a note to clients. Popular Now More 'Must Have' Metrics to Drive Continuous Improvement How to Reduce Costs through Supply Chain Network Optimization Trump is Right on Trade, But He Doesn’t Know Why The results suggested that Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare is finally making headway in overcoming cost overruns and a delay of more than two years on the all-new $6 billion C Series, a model intended to compete with planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profit, announced this year’s second round of major job cuts in October. The widely traded Class B shares climbed 5.6% to C$1.88 at 11:49 a.m. in Toronto Thursday after earlier advancing as much as 7.9%, the biggest intraday gain since April 28. Bombardier, which also makes trains, advanced 33% this year through Wednesday, more than twice the 13% gain of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index. Turnaround Plan Makes Progress Bellemare unveiled plans three weeks ago to cut 7,500 jobs, saying they were needed to ensure competitiveness and improve profit margins. Both rounds are likely to save $500 million to $600 million a year by the end of 2018, executives said on a conference call Thursday. The company is about 80% through its February drive to cut 7,000 jobs, Bellemare said. “We’re executing on every single piece of our turnaround plan,” Bellemare said Thursday in an interview. “We are largely done de-risking the company.” Related Shrinking Demand for Private Jets Adds to Bombardier's Challenges Bombardier Cuts 7,000 Jobs Now that the C Series is in service, Bombardier has one development program left, the Global 7000 business jet, he said. “And we are focused on that. We have this thing under control.” Bombardier will provide more details on its financial goals for 2017 at a Dec. 15 investor day in New York. “Management’s cost transformation initiatives are taking hold and we believe investor confidence will continue to improve as this management team executes and delivers on its targets,” Walter Spracklin, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to clients. This $73 million Bombardier jet just completed its first test flight https://t.co/omvDKiDnis pic.twitter.com/V0yqsBT6vO— CNN (@CNN) November 5, 2016 Bombardier expects to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter, meaning it’s likely to end the year with about $3.5 billion in cash on hand and available liquidity of about $4.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said in the interview with Bellemare. “We’ve improved our liquidity, and we are well-positioned for refinancing” debt that matures in 2018, he said. The company has $1.4 billion of bonds coming due that year. Bombardier had about $9 billion of long-term debt as of Sept. 30 and $4.4 billion of accessible liquidity, after Quebec injected $1 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series program. The manufacturer spent $320 million of its free cash in the third quarter, compared with $816 million a year earlier. Analysts watch the liquidity figure closely as Bombardier works through costs for programs such as the C Series and the Global 7000. Bombardier has predicted it will start generating free cash flow in 2018. ‘Future Profitability’ Bombardier posted an adjusted loss of $10 million in the third quarter, essentially breaking even on a per-share basis. Analysts had expected a 3 cent loss, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 9.7% to $3.74 billion, while analysts predicted $3.95 billion. The third-quarter performance “suggests Bombardier’s underlying cost restructuring actions are on or ahead of plan, potentially positioning the company for better-than-expected future profitability as volumes begin to build for the C Series and Global” jets, Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said in a note to clients. Full-year revenue will be about $16.5 billion, at the low end of the company’s forecast range, while Bombardier maintained its outlook for cash-flow use at $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. In the rail business, earnings before interest and taxes will exceed 6.5% of sales this year, up from a previous goal of more than 6%, Bombardier said. Profit in the business-jet unit is expected to be stronger than the previous outlook of about 6% of sales. Bombardier said its loss in commercial aircraft will be $100 million less than the $550 million previously forecast. In September, it slashed its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the C Series, saying delays in shipments of Pratt & Whitney engines would cause the planemaker to burn through cash more quickly than expected. Seven of the new aircraft are now slated to be handed over this year instead of the 15 previously planned. Last week, Bombardier flew its Global 7000 business jet the first time, a milestone for the delayed aircraft that puts the company on track to begin deliveries in 2018. The $72.8 million jet remains on track to make its commercial debut in the second half of 2018. By Frederic Tomesco Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Aurora's work on the Autonomous Aerial Cargo Utility System (AACUS) program will be leveraged to integrate the company's Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS) on a UH-1H helicopter. The primary goal of the AACUS program is to enable rapid cargo delivery by unmanned, and potentially optionally-manned, VTOL systems. AACUS encompasses the development and implementation of VTOL-based obstacle detection and avoidance, and allows for autonomous landings at unprepared, off-field, non-cooperative landing sites. AACUS also enables dynamic contingency planning to the point of landing, with goal-based supervisory control by any field personnel with no special training. At the AACUS flight testing event held today in Northern Virginia, the AACUS program demonstrated on a manned Bell 206 the perception and planning capabilities required for autonomous takeoff, transit and landing. "We know how to make things fly, we've been doing it for over 100 years," said Retired Brig. Gen. Frank Kelley, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Unmanned Systems. "What we don't yet know how to do, is how to couple aircraft and autonomous systems together, but great programs like this are helping us get there." Aurora's TALOS system has been demonstrated previously on a Boeing H-6U Unmanned Little Bird flown autonomously, and three different human-piloted Bell 206 aircraft. "The arrival of a Huey as our third test platform frames a key point for future customers – the TALOS system is platform agnostic; you're not buying a new fleet of helicopters, you're buying a capability set for your current fleet," said John Wissler, Vice President of Aurora's R&D Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "TALOS is not an aircraft, nor is it a robot flying an aircraft –TALOS is transferable intelligence designed with both manned and unmanned aircraft requirements in mind. The value of TALOS can be described in a few words – platform agnostic, scalable autonomy, onboard sensing of the environment, and on-board intelligence that no other system in the world can provide." Commercial applications for the TALOS technology are also being explored by Aurora. "Think of the civilian first responder pilot attempting to land in a remote, storm-ravaged area at night – TALOS senses and alerts to power lines and landing zone obstacles well before the pilot and informs the pilot's maneuvers," said Wissler. The final phase of the AACUS program will transition the TALOS system onto an autonomous UH-1H platform currently under development at Aurora, with culminating demonstrations occurring in 2017-2018. Aurora's TALOS system is being developed for the AACUS program with funding from the Office of Naval Research. To learn more about TALOS, visit www.aurora.aero/aacus.

American has more than 1,100 aircraft with Wi-Fi service, a number the airline said gives it one of the largest Wi-Fi-equipped fleets in the world. ViaSat's largest North American customer to date is JetBlue Airways Corp., which provides the service to passengers for free through a marketing partnership with Amazon.com Inc. In June, the world's largest airline split an order between the two Wi-Fi providers, with ViaSat contracted for service on 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes and Gogo tapped to install its new 2Ku satellite service on more than 130 Airbus A319s and A320s. The ViaSat installations begin in the summer of 2017, while the Gogo additions will begin late next year, American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Thomas said Wednesday. In early June, Chicago-based Gogo told investors that about 550 American planes with its equipment "are subject to deinstallation at any time at American's option." Gogo also said it expected that American would exercise that right for many, or perhaps all, of those aircraft "from time to time over the next several years." ViaSat disclosed a large new order with its quarterly earnings report Nov. 8 but declined to reveal which airline, per the customer's request. Carlsbad, Calif.-based ViaSat operates its own satellites, while Gogo and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. contract with other satellite companies. "Gogo will still be outfitting other aircraft in our domestic fleet with its 2ku satellite Wi-Fi and Panasonic continues to provide satellite Wi-Fi for our international widebody fleet," Thomas said, adding: "Gogo remains a valued partner." American uses Panasonic Aviation on more than 60 of its international wide-body aircraft. Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan said in an e-mail Wednesday that American's announcement is "really old news and confirms what we said in our June 3 public statement. It doesn't change our business outlook and financial guidance." Separately, Southwest said late Tuesday that it's reviewing proposals for a "secondary connectivity provider" to the Row 44 service it has from Global Eagle on its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s. Southwest is Global Eagle's largest customer. The airline said it would have "more to share in the coming weeks," spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said Tuesday. Southwest hasn't revealed which companies it's reviewing for the second service or how much of its fleet would be covered. Shares of Global Eagle fell more than 12 percent to $7.17 in New York trading. Gogo fell almost 8 percent to $8.91, while ViaSat rose more than 11 percent to $78.45. --Justin Bachman and Mary Schlangenstein, Bloomberg View Comments Tags American Airlines Airlines Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Higher operating cash flow and reduced investment following certification of the CS100 and CS300 models of the marquee aircraft are driving the improvements, the Montreal-based company said in a statement Thursday. Earnings before interest, taxes and special items this year will be $350 million to $400 million, compared with a previous forecast of $200 million to $400 million, Bombardier said. “We are gaining confidence in Bombardier’s ability to meet its long-term margin targets,” Cam Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Montreal, said in a note to clients. The results suggested that Chief Executive Officer Alain Bellemare is finally making headway in overcoming cost overruns and a delay of more than two years on the all-new $6 billion C Series, a model intended to compete with planes from Boeing Co. and Airbus Group SE. Bellemare, who was hired in February 2015 with a mandate to restore profit, announced this year’s second round of major job cuts in October. The widely traded Class B shares climbed 5.6 percent to C$1.88 at 11:49 a.m. in Toronto Thursday after earlier advancing as much as 7.9 percent, the biggest intraday gain since April 28. Bombardier, which also makes trains, advanced 33 percent this year through Wednesday, more than twice the 13 percent gain of Canada’s benchmark S&P/TSX Composite Index. Job Cuts Bellemare unveiled plans three weeks ago to cut 7,500 jobs, saying they were needed to ensure competitiveness and improve profit margins. Both rounds are likely to save $500 million to $600 million a year by the end of 2018, executives said on a conference call Thursday. The company is about 80 percent through its February drive to cut 7,000 jobs, Bellemare said. “We’re executing on every single piece of our turnaround plan,” Bellemare said Thursday in an interview. “We are largely done de-risking the company.” Now that the C Series is in service, Bombardier has one development program left, the Global 7000 business jet, he said. “And we are focused on that. We have this thing under control.” Bombardier will provide more details on its financial goals for 2017 at a Dec. 15 investor day in New York. “Management’s cost transformation initiatives are taking hold and we believe investor confidence will continue to improve as this management team executes and delivers on its targets,” Walter Spracklin, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note to clients. Cash Flow Bombardier expects to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter, meaning it’s likely to end the year with about $3.5 billion in cash on hand and available liquidity of about $4.5 billion, Chief Financial Officer John Di Bert said in the interview with Bellemare. “We’ve improved our liquidity, and we are well-positioned for refinancing” debt that matures in 2018, he said. The company has $1.4 billion of bonds coming due that year. Bombardier had about $9 billion of long-term debt as of Sept. 30 and $4.4 billion of accessible liquidity, after Quebec injected $1 billion for a 49.5 percent stake in the C Series program. The manufacturer spent $320 million of its free cash in the third quarter, compared with $816 million a year earlier. Analysts watch the liquidity figure closely as Bombardier works through costs for programs such as the C Series and the Global 7000. Bombardier has predicted it will start generating free cash flow in 2018. ‘Future Profitability’ Bombardier posted an adjusted loss of $10 million in the third quarter, essentially breaking even on a per-share basis. Analysts had expected a 3 cent loss, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue dropped 9.7 percent to $3.74 billion, while analysts predicted $3.95 billion. The third-quarter performance “suggests Bombardier’s underlying cost restructuring actions are on or ahead of plan, potentially positioning the company for better-than-expected future profitability as volumes begin to build for the C Series and Global” jets, Nick Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co., said in a note to clients. Full-year revenue will be about $16.5 billion, at the low end of the company’s forecast range, while Bombardier maintained its outlook for cash-flow use at $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. In the rail business, earnings before interest and taxes will exceed 6.5 percent of sales this year, up from a previous goal of more than 6 percent, Bombardier said. Profit in the business-jet unit is expected to be stronger than the previous outlook of about 6 percent of sales. Maiden Voyage Bombardier said its loss in commercial aircraft will be $100 million less than the $550 million previously forecast. In September, it slashed its 2016 forecast for deliveries of the C Series, saying delays in shipments of Pratt & Whitney engines would cause the planemaker to burn through cash more quickly than expected. Seven of the new aircraft are now slated to be handed over this year instead of the 15 previously planned. Last week, Bombardier flew its Global 7000 business jet the first time, a milestone for the delayed aircraft that puts the company on track to begin deliveries in 2018. The $72.8 million jet remains on track to make its commercial debut in the second half of 2018. (An earlier version of this story corrected the amount of the adjusted loss.)

It’s hard to say. There are so many uncertainties, particularly when it comes to how he sees the world and how his policies may affect the multi-billion defense industry. Here are four questions about how he would handle the world’s largest defense industry. Q: Who does Trump pick as secretary of defense? A: If Hillary Clinton won, many in Washington thought that Michele Flournoy, the chief executive of the think tank Center for New American Security, would get the top job. She’s well known inside the beltway, having served as the under secretary of defense for policy from 2009 to 2012, while also serving in the Pentagon in the mid-1990s. Under Trump, it’s not clear who he’ll appoint. As a businessman who ran against the Washington establishment, some think he could bring an outsider to shake up the world’s largest bureaucracy, with 3 million people on the payroll. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the American Entterprise Institute who briefed the Trump campaign three times, said she urged against picking an outsider. “It’s much harder to make work given the sheer size of the Defense Department,” she said. “You don’t need someone who has to spend the first 12 months learning the acronyms.” Q: Trump says he wants to rebuild the military. What will that look like? A: Trump has said he wants to increase the size of the Army and the Marine Corps, build new ships for the Navy and add jets to the Air Force’s arsenal and modernize the nuclear arsenal. Defense stocks jumped Wednesday morning with news of his election. BAE System and Raytheon saw their stock prices go up more than 6 percent by 11 a.m. Wednesday. Lockheed Martin was up more than 5 percent. “Trump’s win is good news for the defense industry, especially when coupled with Republican majorities in the House and Senate,” said Loren Thompson, a defense consultant who advises many of the nation’s top tier contractors. Increasing the size of the military will favor BAE Systems and General Dynamics, plus helicopter makers Boeing and Lockheed Martin, in particular, he said. Northrop Grumman, which is building the Air Force’s new bomber, could be a winner, he said, as could General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, companies that make submarines. Trump would most likely focus on weapons systems already in development or production, instead of starting new ones, Eaglen said, which would be good news for programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, the Littoral Combat Ship as well as building new aircraft carriers. Q: All of that sounds costly. Where does he get the money? A: Eaglen has calculated that his promises could add up to an additional $55 billion in defense spending-”and that’s conservative,” she said. Trump has called to eliminate the budget caps that control defense spending, while also rooting out waste in the Pentagon’s budget, as he plans to disrupt Washington’s traditional ways of doing business. Some of the Pentagon’s main programs, many of which have suffered years of cost overruns and schedule delays, could be targeted, as well as the large defense corporations behind them. In a note to investors, Byron Callan, an analyst with Alpha Security Partners, “A populist president may be less tolerant of cost overruns on major weapons systems and greater use of fixed-price contracts might entail more risk for the sector.” Eaglen acknowledged that “the major defense contractors are part of the establishment he’s railing against.” But she said Trump doesn’t really have a choice but to stick with them. “If he wants to show results, he’s got to live with the contractors he has,” she said. “You have to go with the production lines you have open.” Trump’s ability to work with Congress will also be a huge factor. While the GOP has majorities in the House and Senate, they are narrow. And conservative Republicans may clash with defense hawks over spending-touching off intra-party budget battles, said Todd Harrison an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Many of those Republicans don’t support Trump or his policies,” he said. “I think it means continued and perhaps even worse gridlock.” Q: What happens to the Pentagon’s initiatives to reach out beyond its traditional industry base to harness innovation and technology from places like Silicon Valley? A: Under President Barack Obama, the Pentagon has launched a series of initiatives designed to harness innovation and partner with Silicon Valley firms. Known as the “third offset strategy” the plans would help the U.S. military hold on to its technological advantage over potential adversaries such as Russia and China. But under Trump those initiatives could be imperiled, Harrison said. Trump would likely bring in “a totally new team of civilian leaders with completely new priorities.” Eaglen said, though, that those programs are a relatively small portion of the budget, and that it is vital to invest in technology at a time when it is moving so fast. “We have lost our technological supremacy,” she said. “He would be crazy to abandon that.” Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Military News Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:14 Veterans Day tribute at Veterans Memorial Monument Pause 2:06 Children's choir performs at Veterans Day ceremony 0:59 Mabus credits America's shipbuilders for a better Navy 1:14 Navy Sec.

Mark West · Nov. 10, 2016 Tweet As I peer out the window at the terrain below, jetting over the heartland of America, I cannot help but ponder the future for our nation following the unexpected and historical win by Donald Trump. We saw so many “firsts” during Election 2016. The first billionaire to win the presidency. The first woman to ever receive the nomination for president of a major party. The first election where both candidates' unfavorable ratings were at historical highs. And so many more. Today I am indeed grateful to God that we are not referring to Hillary Clinton as president-elect. If you believe that God is still intimately engaged in His creation, then you understand that Daniel 2:21 was once again affirmed in this election in which we were all given the privilege and responsibility to participate: “And He changes the times and seasons; He removes kings and raise up kings.” While I am thankful that Hillary Clinton did not prevail, admittedly I remain a skeptic as to Trump’s veracity, trustworthiness and character. My concerns will either be affirmed or invalidated in the months and years to come. And honestly I pray they are proven wrong. But one thing is certain. As Donald Trump transitions from candidate to president, some very distinct realities will set in. If you’ve ever flown, as I am doing today, you know that there can be something magical about soaring 30,000 feet above the earth at 600+ MPH, seeing the earth below you whiz by. The details of all that lies below is indistinguishable from that altitude. Similarly though, if one is glancing up from the ground into the atmosphere, the specifics of an aircraft is also unknown. What airline is it? What is its tail number? Is it a Boeing or Airbus? Who is inside? There’s no telling until the plane lands. But when that silver capsule finally touches down, the answers will become clear. If there are defects in the plane, they will be exposed. And as the passengers disembark, their true identity will be revealed. Over the last year, the Trump campaign has been like the jet cruising at 30,000 feet. Its flight plan has been purposefully one of generalities with limited substance dealing in poll-tested, populist issues. But to an angry and disgusted populace, the vague flight plan proved wildly popular, with statements like these fueling Trump’s flight: “I will build a great wall on our southern border and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words!” “Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the US until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on.” (Interestingly this statement was removed from Trump’s website 11/09/16, the day after his election. See here.) “I’m going to repeal and replace Obamacare.” “We’re going to have a special prosecutor for Hillary. If I were president, Hillary would already be in jail.” But the Trump campaign is now descending from its year-long high altitude voyage to the reality of a Trump administration. As the implementation of the billionaire’s vision proceeds, which was strong on emotionally charged rhetoric but soft on specifics, any blemishes in Trump’s policies and flaws in his style and guiding philosophies will quickly be tested and revealed. Fortunately for Trump, he is landing his presidency on a “Republican-friendly” runway, given the reality that our new president will be advantaged with a GOP-controlled Senate and House. And while there are many Republicans in Congress who are not fans of Donald, the way in which Trump won will give him the gravitas that many of his predecessors lacked. So will president-elect Donald Trump touch down in Washington prepared to govern and deliver specific solutions that are as popular and successful as his campaign rhetoric was in its lacking of those same specifics? Can the reality TV star be accountable to voters to follow through in the drudgery of day-to-day governing? Will Trump’s decisions over the next four years remain in alignment with the positions he claimed he supported during his campaign? Or will President Trump revert back to the antithetical views and values he embraced during the many decades leading up to his Republican “conversion”? Will the dozens of campaign promises Trump made, many outrageous in nature, be fulfilled? And if not, will his supporters even care? The answers to these questions will determine whether President Trump’s arrival and tenure in Washington will be a successful and controlled touch down or a disastrous crash landing. For the sake of our nation, our communities and our loved ones, I pray our new president is not only wildly successful, both politically and personally, but that the man who disembarks in Washington is a man of great character and integrity. “What will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul?” —Mark 8:36 Republished from Awake to Freedom.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 10, 2016 at 10:41AM President-elect Trump ran on a promise to "make America great again." In one respect, his election on Tuesday is already turning out to be great news for investors in defense stocks. This morning, analysts at Barclays Capital reacted to news of the Trump win with a series of new upgrades for defense stocks. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC) -- tic-tac-toe, three-in-a-row, Barclays upgraded each and every one. But which of these defense stocks does Barclays like best? And in light of their widely varying valuations, which of these stocks should you like best for your portfolio? (And is there an even better option that Barclays might be missing?) That's what we're here to find out. Let's begin. Image source: Donald J. Trump for President. From least to greatest: Lockheed Martin Let's start with the stock Barclays likes least: Lockheed Martin. The nation's biggest pure-play defense contractor by revenue, S&P Global Market Intelligence reports that Lockheed Martin did $50.6 billion in business over the last 12 months, and earned $5.2 billion in profits on that business. That works out to a very respectable 10.4% net profit margin, and makes Lockheed Martin nearly twice as profitable (per revenue dollar) as it was five years ago. Lockheed Martin stock seems inexpensive at just 14.1 times earnings. With a growth rate currently estimated at just 8.2% annualized over the next five years, it's not the best bargain on the market, and Barclays rates the stock only equal weight. Even so, in light of the Trump victory, the analyst has upgraded the stock from its old rating of underweight, and added $30 to its price target -- to $275 a share. A "100% likelihood" to benefit? L-3 Communications What leads Barclays to think Lockheed, and these other stocks as well, will benefit? As explained in a write-up on TheFly.com today, Barclays believes "the market will assign a 100% likelihood of higher near-term defense spending under a Trump administration." This belief is enough to convince the analyst to upgrade L-3 Communications as well, and this time it's going all the way to an overweight rating, with a price target set at $165. Curiously, though, while L-3 gets a higher rating from Barclays, most analysts see its growth prospects as slightly inferior to Lockheed's. Consensus estimates call for only 7.9% growth at L-3 over the next five years, and with L-3 shares already trading for more than 32 times trailing earnings, that would appear to make L-3 stock a riskier bet. Top o' the heap: Northrop Grumman? Perhaps the single stock Barclays likes best is Northrop Grumman -- but it's hard to imagine why. At 20 times trailing earnings, Northrop is not the most expensive stock in the defense space, but neither is it the cheapest. Northrop's 1.5% dividend yield is less than the 1.9% that L-3 pays, and barely half of Lockheed Martin's beefy 2.9% payout. In fact, the one thing that Northrop does seem to have going in its favor is the fact that analysts were expecting it to outgrow its rivals. Consensus estimates were calling for 9.2% long-term earnings growth at Northrop Grumman -- and that was before Trump won the election. Is there a better way to profit from a Trump presidency? Barclays rates Northrop Grumman stock overweight,q just as it does L-3 Communications. Moreover, the $270 price target it assigns to Northrop Grumman stock implies similar upside for both stocks -- about 11% from current prices. But if you ask me, there's an even bigger opportunity in defense stocks than any of the three Barclays names: Boeing (NYSE:BA). With a smaller defense business than Lockheed's, Boeing's large commercial aircraft arm makes it a bigger company overall. In fact, at $94.8 billion in annual sales, Boeing is nearly twice the size of Lockheed by revenues (and pays an even bigger dividend -- 3%). Valued on GAAP earnings, Boeing stock looks similar to Northrop's, with a P/E ratio of 20.9. But Boeing has such strong cash production that, at last report, the stock was selling for less than 11 times annual free cash flow. At the same time, its 15.5% projected profits growth rate dwarfs those of the aerospace and defense rivals that Barclays endorsed today -- and gives Boeing stock a PEG ratio that looks downright cheap at just 0.7. All things considered, while I don't disagree with Barclays' major thesis that defense stocks will benefit from a Trump presidency, I fear the analyst may be overlooking the best stock of the bunch: Boeing.

Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon with his Norwegian counterpart, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide, outside Norway's Joint Headquarters, Bodø. Credit: Norwegian Armed Forces Sir Michael, who visited Norway’s top military headquarters, close to the Arctic Circle on Thursday, announced that the UK and Norway would work closer on Maritime Patrol Aircraft cooperation, including in reducing costs and increasing operational effectiveness. The UK announced that it would procure nine Boeing P8 MPA in last year’s Strategic Defence and Security Review. The new capability, which will be based in Scotland, will allow for enhanced situational awareness in key areas such as the North Atlantic, and will also further increase the protection of the UK’s nuclear deterrent and our two new aircraft carriers. Sir Michael also visited Norway’s Bodø Main Air Station, home of two F-16 squadrons and a squadron of Search and Rescue Sea King helicopters, where he signed a new agreement on host nation support for UK exercises in the country, further increasing the UK and Norway’s ability to exercise, train and operate together. Mr Fallon welcomed the fact that British armed forces undertake yearly winter training in Norway, particularly 3 Commando Brigade in Harstad and Evenes and elements of Joint Helicopter Command at Bardufoss. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said: Britain needs Maritime Patrol Aircraft to keep watch over the seas. As part of our £178 billion defence equipment programme, we’ve committed to new maritime patrol aircraft that are able to monitor threats to Britain and our armed forces. By stepping up cooperation with Norway on maritime patrol, we will help keep Britain safer and more secure. The Defence Secretary boards a Norwegian Maritime Patrol Aircraft with his counterpart, Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide. Credit: Norwegian Armed Forces The Defence Secretary arrived in Norway following meetings with the Northern Group countries on Wednesday in Copenhagen, where he reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to European defence. As part of this, the Defence Secretary announced that 5 Battalion The Rifles would lead the UK’s battalion in Estonia next year, part of NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence in the East. Work on the UK’s MPA programme is progressing well, including the investment on infrastructure in Lossiemouth in Scotland, where the planes will be based. Former armed forces personnel who previously served on UK Nimrod are also re-joining the RAF to help operate the future P-8s. 12 have recently re-joined and more will re-join in the future.

I'm not sure even President-elect Donald Trump has yet figured out exactly what he will be, other than "great" and "powerful." But a lengthy list of election winners and losers already has formed, and it's growing longer by the hour. It's prompted not only by the shift in national politics, but also by a change underway in Illinois that, depending on what happens in 2018, could be just as decisive. Among the items: trade, Obamacare, abortion rights and transportation. And the political influence of our state and city. First, the biggest winner: American democracy. Yes, I think our democracy was hurt by some of the shenanigans in this election, particularly signs of Russian influence via leaked emails and hacking. That ought to petrify every voter. And yes, some of my Democratic pals will shun the notion that anything good could come out of electing Trump. To them, I reply: That's democracy. Everyone has their say, the people decide and power changes hands peacefully. Then you wait for the politicians in charge to mess up—they almost always do—and your side strikes back. This peaceful transfer of power concept is at the core of America. Whatever else happens in coming years, preserving that principle is crucial. Loser: The beneficiaries of "free trade" policies, especially big exporters such as Boeing, Caterpillar, ADM and the like. I never totally count out Big Business and its Gucci'd friends. But I absolutely believe Trump when he says he'll tear up or severely renegotiate NAFTA, block TPP and potentially set off a trade war with China, a huge market for companies such as Motorola. I doubt the new president will be able to magically produce new jobs here—or, for that matter, replace the jobs in Chicago's service economy that could be lost if the U.S. goes too far. Killing a few trade deals is easy, though, and with the Democratic Party's Bernie Sanders wing in agreement, Trump will just have to deliver on that score. Winner: GOP mega-fundraiser Ron Gidwitz. His instincts were good a year ago, when he urged Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., to withdraw from a re-election race he could not win. Gidwitz later backed off under enormous pressure, but Kirk ended up being the only Senate Republican to lose yesterday. Beyond that, the Chicago investor and former cosmetics exec raised major coin for GOP Senate hopefuls in Wisconsin and Indiana who at one time were considered huge underdogs. Perhaps most significant, he was the only ranking member of the Illinois GOP establishment to kiss and make up with Trump well before the election, raising what I'm told is at least $1 million for him. That's important because, overall, Illinois is a big loser with Trump, at least in terms of having political chits to call in. All but gone now are the days when Mayor Rahm Emanuel could call on his old pals in the White House to get money for a Chicago Transit Authority project or the like. And with Kirk's loss, Gov. Bruce Rauner loses his best tie to D.C. In fact, I'm told that the governor and Trump may not have ever spoken, though the man who served as Rauner's general counsel in his election campaign, Nick Ayers, is a senior adviser to Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Another big loser: Lincolnwood's Merrick Garland and his nomination for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. That is dead. Trump now will get to fill that seat and perhaps one or two others, potentially leading to a reversal of the Roe v. Wade abortion decision, and serving Democrats setbacks on any number of social issues. A winner: Populism. Though Trump's blue-collar appeal frankly scares some voters, the same voters yesterday approved referenda in four states raising the minimum wage. If Washington Republicans don't follow up, the Democrats will have a dandy issue to rally middle-class voters in 2018. Ditto gun control. Clinton was way, way out in front on that issue, and her loss could stall progress. But voters in California, Maine, Nevada and Washington approved limits, so the idea has some legs. Winner: Anyone who works in the health consulting business, because it's now completely uncertain how Trump will implement his vow to repeal Obamacare. A big change is coming, but putting insurance companies back in charge of things such as pre-existing conditions will spark some of that populist backlash I just noted. There's more. Like the effect on Rauner's re-election race. (Probably not helpful). But you get the idea. Much more so than other elections, this one will have an effect. And it's going to take some time to figure out all of the angles of impact. Chicago Transit Authority Bruce Rauner Donald Trump Mark Kirk Mike Pence Rahm Emanuel Ronald J.

American has more than 1,100 aircraft with Wi-Fi service, a number the airline said gives it one of the largest Wi-Fi-equipped fleets in the world. ViaSat’s largest North American customer to date is JetBlue Airways Corp., which provides the service to passengers for free through a marketing partnership with Amazon.com Inc. In June, the world’s largest airline split an order between the two Wi-Fi providers, with ViaSat contracted for service on 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes and Gogo tapped to install its new 2Ku satellite service on more than 130 Airbus A319s and A320s. The ViaSat installations begin in the summer of 2017, while the Gogo additions will begin late next year, American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Thomas said Wednesday. In early June, Chicago-based Gogo told investors that about 550 American planes with its equipment  “are subject to deinstallation at any time at American’s option.” Gogo also said it expected that American would exercise that right for many, or perhaps all, of those aircraft “from time to time over the next several years.” ViaSat disclosed a large new order with its quarterly earnings report Nov. 8 but declined to reveal which airline, per the customer’s request. Carlsbad, Calif.-based ViaSat operates its own satellites, while Gogo and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. contract with other satellite companies. “Gogo will still be outfitting other aircraft in our domestic fleet with its 2ku satellite Wi-Fi and Panasonic continues to provide satellite Wi-Fi for our international widebody fleet,” Thomas said, adding: “Gogo remains a valued partner.” American uses Panasonic Aviation on more than 60 of its international wide-body aircraft.  Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan said in an e-mail Wednesday that American’s announcement is “really old news and confirms what we said in our June 3 public statement. It doesn’t change our business outlook and financial guidance.” Separately, Southwest said late Tuesday that it’s reviewing proposals for a “secondary connectivity provider” to the Row 44 service it has from Global Eagle on its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s. Southwest is Global Eagle’s largest customer. The airline said it would have “more to share in the coming weeks,” spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said Tuesday. Southwest hasn’t revealed which companies it’s reviewing for the second service or how much of its fleet would be covered. Shares of Global Eagle fell more than 12 percent to $7.17 in New York trading. Gogo fell almost 8 percent to $8.91, while ViaSat rose more than 11 percent to $78.45.

Qatar Airways turning 20 - and hoping for a joint venture with American Airlines CAPA > Aviation Analysis > Qatar Airways turning 20 - and hoping for a joint venture with American Airlines 10-Nov-2016 Tweet © CAPA Qatar Airways turns 20 in 2017. The once tiny regional airline has become a global powerhouse and is reshaping oneworld, the alliance to which it belongs. Qatar has stakes in IAG and LATAM, and Qatar Airways CEO H.E. Akbar Al Baker has told CAPA that in the near future he expects Qatar to make acquisitions in two additional airlines, aside from Meridiana. He said the additional airlines would be successful airlines, as "We are not going to collect crap". Strategic partnerships without equity are important; Mr Al Baker hopes American Airlines will cease its partnership with Etihad Airways and work solely with Qatar Airways, even forging a multilateral JV anchored around American, British Airways/IAG and Qatar. Qatar is heading towards a fleet of 250 aircraft in 2-2.5 years' time. Mr Al Baker expects recently ordered 787-9s to replace 787-8s, while an LoI for 737 MAX 8s will be to replace Qatar's A320s and grow that fleet. Qatar Airways to have 250 aircraft in two years. Al Baker leads 'disciplined' approach Outlining future plans, Mr Al Baker highlighted that Qatar Airways will have 250 aircraft in 2-2.5 years. Emirates in Nov-2016 has 242 aircraft in Nov-2016, but all are widebodies. Qatar's 189 aircraft in Nov-2016 include 49 narrowbody aircraft and mostly medium-sized widebodies, whereas Emirates has more of a large/very large widebody fleet (although it has been evaluating the medium-sized widebodies A350 and 787). Qatar's existing impact in size and strategic direction earned it the title of CAPA Airline of the Year, awarded on 27-Oct-2016 at the CAPA Global Aviation Summit in Amsterdam. In accepting the award Mr Al Baker reflected on how he had initially refused the CEO job for six months but finally accepted it. Since then his impact on the airline has been pronounced, as he led it from being a small regional airline to the global powerhouse it is today. Like many reigns, Mr Al Baker's defining tenure and high objectives have not been a match for everyone. Mr Al Baker said he knew that his reputation at the airline was "The Dictator", but defended his actions as "discipline" necessary to delivery the high service that is a core part of Qatar Airways. Comparing Qatar Airways with competitors Mr Al Baker remarked: "They have legacy costs, they have inefficient airport regimes...they have low utilisations of their airplanes compared to us, and of course most importantly the standards of service that people have to give. And if they don't give, then they have to leave the organisation. They have to leave. They don't have to worry, we don't have to worry about unions. People are accountable and people have to deliver." Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker interview after receivig the award for CAPA Airline of the Year: Oct-2016 Source: CAPA TV. Qatar CEO Al Baker: 'It's not all about money' Like its peers Emirates and Etihad, Qatar Airways faces a range of accusations to the public and government designed to discredit them or stop/reduce their expansion. A common public accusation is that Gulf airlines, via their wealthy government owners, have unlimited money and that this alone changes competition to a point where others cannot compete. Mr Al Baker rejected this notion, saying: "Just sitting on the fence and crying foul that these Gulf carriers, as one of the CEOs of a European carrier said, 'They only have sand and money' – that is not the case. When people say this about our region, I think they are just sitting and smelling glue because they don't realise we are really sophisticated countries, we don't just throw away money because we want to throw away money. We are launching successful entities". Mr Al Baker concluded: "It's not all about money and sand. It's about serious business". Even if the money argument was taken at face value, no amount of money at western countries (or Air India, for that matter) could address dysfunctional aviation ecosystems and hubs, as well as underlying service issues (for example, passenger treatment before considering hard products). Accusations to governments about Gulf airlines often come down to the lack of a "level playing field" or the lack of "fair competition". CAPA has recently analysed Mr Al Baker's views on "fair competition", a phrase that is central to EU open sky negotiations with countries/markets including the State of Qatar and the UAE. See related report: EU-Gulf open skies negotiations: Qatar CEO Al Baker warns of biased 'fair competition' definition As for competitor airlines' claims of a distorted playing field, Mr Al Baker said: "Actually there is a level playing field but they cannot play on the level playing field. They want to keep the cake and eat it themselves". Airlines competing with Gulf airlines face the presence of Gulf airlines, but also internal problems. It is arguable these internal problems (especially labour and unions) are a greater threat than Gulf airlines as these challenges impact not just markets that overlap with Gulf airlines, but all market segments. The impact on short haul services under threat from LCCs has been considerably greater in many cases; and managements, faced with inertial forces, have faced enormous hurdles in adjusting to the new environment. Air France-KLM's new management plan for example reflects changes that the new executives are taking because of the control from labour groups, especially pilots. See related report: Air France-KLM: Attempting to rearrange the deckchairs while pilots remain on full steam ahead Qatar Airways considering investments in two airlines Besides Qatar Airways' pending deal with Italy's Meridiana, Mr Al Baker said that Qatar was weighing two additional undisclosed investments. Mr Al Baker said the near future could see Qatar "making some more acquisitions. We will be making some interesting announcements soon...We have two other projects in the pipeline which you will get to know." Qatar Airways now owns just over 20% of IAG - the holding company of British Airways, Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling. In Jul-2016 Qatar took a stake in LATAM. Mr Al Baker praised LATAM's management and noted the long-term opportunities for the airline and Latin America once the current economic woes are over. While the opportunity is undeniable, it is unclear how much Qatar Airways will strategically benefit, given the limited ties between Latin America and the Gulf, and what traffic flows Gulf airlines can participate in from Latin America to the Middle East and Asia, even when factoring in growth. Latin America is the smallest market for Gulf airlines. Average daily flights from Gulf airlines to long haul regions: 11-Jul-2016 to 17-Jul-2016 Source: CAPA - Centre for Aviation and OAG. As with the IAG stake, investing in LATAM was not necessarily a prerequisite for a partnership, especially since they are each members of oneworld. As far as investments go, on a strictly financial basis there are typically better investments than airlines, so Qatar's stakes must have a few driving elements that are difficult to quantify precisely.

Note: IAG and LATAM for 12 months to 31-Dec-2015, Qatar for 12 months to 31-Mar-2016. Qatar order for 30 787-9s to replace 787-8s In Oct-2016 Qatar Airways announced a 100 aircraft deal with Boeing consisting of an order for 30 787-9s and 10 777-300ERs, and an LoI for 60 737 MAX 8s. Mr Al Baker told an interview with CAPA TV that the 787-9s will replace Qatar's 787-8s. Qatar has 30 787-8s in service, potentially allowing for a one-for-one replacement. Qatar Airways average fleet age: Nov-2016 Source: CAPA Fleet Database. The 787-8s have the second youngest average fleet age in Qatar's fleet, at 2.5 years. Only the A350 fleet is younger, at 1.2 years. Qatar's 787-8s range in age from 4 years and 7 months to only seven months. All but one of the aircraft are leased, according to CAPA's Fleet Database. The low ages, even at the "old" range, makes is unlikely that 787-9s will immediately replace 787-8s. Qatar may find benefit in operating the two alongside each other. Some airlines are finding that the 787-8 allows them to open new services, but the 787-9's larger size brings lower unit costs that make operations more sustainable. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker interview with CAPA TV: Oct-2016 Source: CAPA TV. 737 MAX 8s to replace A320s, enter JV airlines Qatar's LoI for the 737 MAX 8s is yet to be finalised. It was entered into when Qatar had very difficult relations with Airbus over the A320neo, which Qatar Airways has refused the delivery of. This background has caused some to suggest that the Boeing 737 MAX LoI is leverage against Airbus, and that Qatar will not conclude the deal with Boeing. Nonetheless, Mr Al Baker said the 737 MAX 8s will be used to replace Qatar's A320s. Qatar operates 39 A320s, in addition to two A319s and eight A321s, its only narrowbody passenger aircraft. The addition of possibly 60 737 MAX 8s implies growth, although Mr Al Baker said that the aircraft could be placed into service with JV airlines. Noting airlines in the plural suggests that the aircraft would be placed with airlines other than Qatar's proposed investment in Meridiana. The planned Saudi airline Al Maha Airways has new A320s, but its launch prospects do not appear to be strong. Outlook: most radical shift would be Qatar joining American-IAG JV Mr Al Baker identified partnerships as central to Qatar Airways, remarking: "Cooperation, relationships will make this industry a win-win for everybody". Qatar Airways has been the only one of the three Gulf superconnector airlines to join an alliance. Qatar formed a JV with oneworld's Cathay Pacific, but this has since been dissolved. More recently Qatar and British Airways formed a JV. While Qatar owns approximately 20% of British Airways' parent company IAG, the JV was expected long before Qatar made the equity investment. See related report: British Airways-Qatar Airways form Europe's first Gulf airline JV, showing some oneworld flexibility Qatar's entrance into the oneworld alliance also resulted in it forming a bilateral partnership with oneworld's North American member, American Airlines. The Qatar-American partnership supplemented, and did not replace, American's partnership with Etihad Airways. Since Qatar joined oneworld and partnered with American, American has expanded its relationships with both Qatar and Etihad. American has even done this while denouncing Qatar as being part of the alleged subsidised Gulf airlines that the big three US airlines rallied against. Mr Al Baker did not like American choosing a bilateral partner over a fellow oneworld member, saying: "I don't see the sense of them doing business with two airlines from the same region and diverting more traffic to Etihad, ignoring the alliance partner Qatar Airways". It would be bold for American Airlines to end its relationship with Etihad and work solely with Qatar in the Gulf (oneworld's Royal Jordanian is in the Levant). Even more extreme, but logical, could be Qatar Airways and American Airlines forming a joint venture. With such a JV, the American Airlines-IAG/Finnair JV, and British Airways-Qatar JV, an end-game scenario could emerge of the three JVs being stitched together covering an expansive segment of travel. JVs have so far been region-specific, but ultimately in the long term and with adaptation from regulators could be combined and take closer steps toward consolidation. As for the prospect of American and Qatar having a JV with British Airways/IAG, Mr Al Baker was opportunistic: "I'm a businessman and I would be delighted to do this with American. I think the American Airlines administration has been misled by Delta and I think in the long run they will realise that a partnership with Qatar Airways is a very robust business proposition for them". In his opening remarks Mr Al Baker referenced how airlines long doubted Qatar Airways' growth ambitions. Having proved naysayers wrong, Qatar Airways is narrowing the gap in size between itself and Emirates. Qatar's planned next steps indicate continuing capacity growth while adding strategic growth. Qatar Airways is increasingly becoming too big to say no to. Want more analysis like this?

EU-Gulf open skies negotiations: Qatar CEO Al Baker warns of biased 'fair competition' definition 7-Nov-2016 As the US-Gulf airline dispute loses momentum with the American government, the big Middle East aeropolitical debate will now shift across the Atlantic to Europe, where the European Commission has a mandate to try to negotiate an open skies agreement with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, as well as other countries/blocs, including Turkey and ASEAN. Qatar Airways CEO H.E. Akbar Al Baker gave a keynote presentation at the recent CAPA-ACTE Global Aviation Summit in Amsterdam and addressed the subject of the EU mandate. Mr Al Baker called for unquestionable third and fourth freedom liberalisation and eventual fifth freedom liberalisation. The devil as always is in the detail; the non-EU airlines in the negotiations are sceptical about how the EU will define a "fair competition" clause, and whether it will be left abstract enough that "fair competition" could potentially be used against airlines in a way they have not envisaged. The Brexit referendum could result in the EU negotiating side losing the UK, whose liberal views have balanced those of the more protectionist France and Germany. Brexit follow-up Part 3: Gulf airlines, Turkish lose UK ally in M/E talks as protectionism spreads 31-Aug-2016 The Brexit referendum produced a vote for the United Kingdom to leave the EU, although this process has not yet been formally invoked. In the scope of aviation, one outcome is the potential loss of the UK in shaping air service agreement negotiations. The UK has been a liberalising voice, one that often counterbalanced more protectionist views from France and Germany. The UK is often able to galvanise the smaller EU states too. The EU now has mandates to negotiate open skies with states, including the UAE, Qatar, Turkey and the ASEAN bloc. The UAE and Qatar, home to the three Gulf network airlines, are expected to produce the most contentious negotiations. France and Germany will surely takes cues from Air France and Lufthansa to impede Gulf growth. In this light there are questions about whether the talks are genuinely motivated, or merely designed to draw out the discussion and thereby not produce any additional traffic rights while under negotiation. What Air France and Lufthansa need is a real, lasting solution, rather than persevering Canute-like with stonewalling. Although a partnership seems logical, they may have waited too long. The Gulf airlines have found that they can succeed on their own. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

Textron Aviation File photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story With the election of Donald Trump as the next president, financial analysts on Wednesday think his presidency will mean more spending on defense, including military aircraft. But they are less certain on what it will mean for the commercial aircraft and business jet sectors. “In the near term, it should support defense stocks, with a moderate negative impact for commercial aero that may be in line with the market as a whole,” J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. Higher defense spending could be good for Spirit AeroSystems and perhaps Textron Aviation. Spirit, whose business is largely building major parts of all Boeing and some Airbus commercial jetliners, also has a smaller portfolio of defense work on programs including the new B-21 Bomber, the Navy’s P-8A Poseidon, Air Force KC-46 air refueling tanker and Sikorsky’s CH-53K heavy lift helicopter for the Marine Corps. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 3:00 Trump vows to be a president for all Americans Pause 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 1:57 Wink Hartman Sr. may open downtown grocery 0:42 Supermoon over Wichita 0:46 Supermoon rises over Wichita 0:29 Supermoon timelapse from Coronado Heights 3:15 Whooping cranes at Texas Aransas National Wildlife Refuge 0:32 Crime scene where two were stabbed and one girl is dead 0:52 Eyewitness describes arrest after child stabbed to death 0:28 Eyewitness captures the arrest of 'person of interest' in stabbing death Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Watch a KC-135 refuel a fighter jet in close quarters A KC-135 tanker refueled six F-16 Fighting Falcons on Tuesday to provide fuel for the planes to perform aerial exercises over New Mexico and Texas.

But neither aircraft types have new orders from the U.S. military. “Now, with the President and both houses as Republican, it should enable stronger budget growth for defense over time,” Wells Fargo Securities senior analyst Sam Pearlstein wrote in an investor note on Wednesday. Cowen & Co. analyst Cai von Rumohr said in his note Wednesday that even with the possibility of stronger defense spending, Trump has said the Defense Department could “buy smarter,” and that “could suggest a tougher attitude on contractor profitability.” While Seifman, Pearlstein and two other analysts expect greater defense spending with Trump, they aren’t clear what his presidency means for commercial airplanes and business jets. “Bizjet OEMs have long blamed uncertainty as one of the issues that … has been holding down new bizjet demand, and the uncertainty level (h)as arguably moved up another notch,” Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard wrote in a note Wednesday about Trump winning the election. Stallard and J.P. Morgan’s Seifman wrote that uncertainty extends to airlines and commercial aircraft manufacturers. “Moreover, hostility toward trade animated Trump’s campaign and Boeing is the biggest US manufacturing exporter, creating vulnerability to an increase in global trade barriers, should they emerge,” Seifman wrote. Concerns from outside the U.S. about what a Trump presidency means for international relations could also affect the airline industry, which is Boeing and Airbus’ customers. “We would expect any real impact from the Trump Administration to take some time to flow through to global airline results, and the demand for new aircraft,” Stallard wrote. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 9:10 Obama welcomes Canadian prime minister to White House, cracks jokes Pause 2:54 Melania Trump delivers speech at Republican National Convention 1:25 Trump goes to Mexico, doesn't ask them to pay for the wall 0:45 Lynn Rogers talks about his campaign 0:53 Bishop says opponent's negativity may have hurt him 0:37 Crum cautiously optimistic 0:48 Fishing, archery taught at Dodge City High School 2:20 Grandma of KCK boy fed to pigs recites a message she wrote to her grandson 1:57 Wink Hartman Sr. may open downtown grocery 0:42 Supermoon over Wichita Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Trump vows to be a president for all Americans Donald Trump delivered his victory speech from his election night event at the New York Hilton in Midtown Manhattan.

Kershner   November 9, 2016 | LXXVI No. 33  | View PDF Russell W. Kershner of Coulee City, Washington, passed onto the loving hands and embrace of our Lord, Jesus Christ, on Wednesday, November 2, 2016, in Grand Coulee Washington. Mr. Kershner was born on December 13, 1941, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, to William Kershner and Edith (Woodhouse) Kershner. Mr. Kershner was a proud Vietnam Veteran as a member of The United States Army from 1960-1968. He served two tours of duty in Vietnam, where he was wounded in action during the second tour. He was honorably discharged with a combined eight medals/decorations. When he returned to the states he went to work at Boeing in Seattle, Grand Coulee Dam and eventually became a pioneer in the installation of computer systems in lumber mills from Canada to Portland, Oregon. As a Computer Analyst he started his own business earning contracts with many government agencies, including NASA, and private businesses such as IBM, until his retirement. He was a member of the Coulee Dam ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where he became an elder; the VFW, American Legion, Kiwanis Club, former Scout Master, and had met all of the requirements to acquire his Eagle Scout certificate.

American has more than 1,100 aircraft with Wi-Fi service, a number the airline said gives it one of the largest Wi-Fi-equipped fleets in the world. ViaSat's largest North American customer to date is JetBlue Airways Corp., which provides the service to passengers for free through a marketing partnership with Amazon.com Inc. In June, the world's largest airline split an order between the two Wi-Fi providers, with ViaSat contracted for service on 100 new Boeing 737 Max planes and Gogo tapped to install its new 2Ku satellite service on more than 130 Airbus A319s and A320s. The ViaSat installations begin in the summer of 2017, while the Gogo additions will begin late next year, American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Thomas said today. MORE ON THE STORY: • Why in-flight Wi-Fi pioneer Gogo is losing altitude • American just ended the era of awful Gogo Wi-Fi • Airplane Wi-Fi should soon be somewhat less awful In early June, Chicago-based Gogo told investors that about 550 American planes with its equipment “are subject to deinstallation at any time at American's option.” Gogo also said it expected that American would exercise that right for many, or perhaps all, of those aircraft “from time to time over the next several years.” ViaSat disclosed a large new order with its quarterly earnings report Nov. 8 but declined to reveal which airline, per the customer's request. Carlsbad, Calif.-based ViaSat operates its own satellites, while Gogo and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc. contract with other satellite companies. “Gogo will still be outfitting other aircraft in our domestic fleet with its 2ku satellite Wi-Fi and Panasonic continues to provide satellite Wi-Fi for our international widebody fleet,” Thomas said, adding: “Gogo remains a valued partner.” American uses Panasonic Aviation on more than 60 of its international wide-body aircraft. Gogo spokesman Steve Nolan said in an e-mail today that American's announcement is “really old news and confirms what we said in our June 3 public statement. It doesn't change our business outlook and financial guidance.”Separately, Southwest said late Tuesday that it's reviewing proposals for a “secondary connectivity provider” to the Row 44 service it has from Global Eagle on its fleet of more than 700 Boeing 737s. Southwest is Global Eagle's largest customer. The airline expects to select a service in the “coming weeks,” spokeswoman Michelle Agnew said Tuesday. Shares of Global Eagle fell more than 9 percent, to $7.43, at 12:37 p.m. in New York trading. Gogo fell almost 5 percent, to $9.20, while ViaSat rose more than 9 percent, to $76.90.

REUTERS/Mick Tsikas 2/2 NEW YORK U.S. defense shares jumped on Wednesday, with companies including Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) hitting lifetime highs, as the presidential victory by Republican Donald Trump lifted expectations of increased military spending here and overseas. Shares of Northrop, Raytheon (RTN.N) and General Dynamics (GD.N) hit intraday lifetime highs after gapping higher at the opening. Shares of Raytheon were last up 7.5 percent at $146.70, while General Dynamics was up 5.8 percent at $162.6,2 and Northrop was up 5.7 percent at $242.95. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) rose 6.5 percent to $254.75 and hit their highest intraday level since about mid-August. Other defense names rose more modestly: Boeing (BA.N) was up 2 percent at $145.05. Defense shares had already been higher this year, underpinned in part by signs of increased global conflict. While Trump's rival in the race for the White House, Democrat Hillary Clinton, also had advocated tough defense and foreign policies, Trump has been a big supporter of increased defense spending, saying he would expand the Army and add to the number of ships. "It's basically he believes in stronger preparation. It's strength equals preparedness," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. Trump has called on NATO alliance partners to do more to pay for their own security. Elsewhere, shares of the U.K.'s BAE Systems (BAES.L) gained 6.8 percent.

(Reuters/Edgard Garrido) Share Written by Ray Sturm Associate Lecturer of Finance, University of Central Florida Obsession 2016 November 09, 2016 Global financial markets plunged—and then recovered—as Donald Trump won the US presidential election. The Standard & Poor’s 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average were up about half a percent around noon as investors more calmly absorbed the election results following a night of panic. Futures on the S&P 500, for example, had tumbled as much as 5 percent, and the Mexican peso—which has been a key indicator of investor sentiment during this race—plummeted as much as 12 percent, to a record low. While investors around the world continue to digest the results, a central issue for them is how the outcome will affect their assets. But do the markets’ reactions tell us anything about the future, as well? As it turns out, whether markets—specifically stocks—continue to fall or begin to rise over the next few days can be a useful predictor for how they will perform in the months and even years to come. In the case of the 2016 presidential election, investors will decide whether they think Trump will be good or bad for the economy—and more importantly their investments—as the 45th president. The rest of us, investor or not, would be well-advised to pay attention. Performance in the near term In general, as you might expect, markets tend to rally if investors think the election winner will be good for their investments, and drop if they deem otherwise. Essentially, they’re all just making bets on the future—some short term, some longer term. In particular, they may turn bullish and buy more US stocks, for example, if they think the next president will create a more favorable business climate for companies, perhaps by lowering tax rates, investing in the economy (leading to stronger growth), reducing regulation, or reducing uncertainty. Research I published in 2014 offers evidence that the stock market’s early assessment tends to be a good predictor of how it will perform in the near future. In other words, investors cast their own votes—with their hard-earned dollars—on the outcome of the election: If more investors think that America’s choice for president will be good for the economy rather than bad, stock prices rise, and vice versa. In my study, I examined market returns for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)—which includes 30 of the best-known U.S. stocks such as Microsoft and Boeing—covering 29 presidential elections from 1896 to 2011. I found two key pieces of evidence that may drive investors’ stock portfolio performance both in the short term and the long term. First, how the market reacts the day after the election appears to be an indicator of how it will perform for the remainder of the election year. If this pattern persists, then investors can expect stock returns from Nov. 10 through Dec. 31 to continue in the same direction as the returns on Nov. 9. This is generally known as the momentum effect—made popular in academic literature by finance professors Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman. In those 29 presidential elections I examined, when the market “approved” of the outcome by rallying the day after the election, stocks returned an average of about 3 percent over the rest of the year. When stocks initially dropped, the market lost an average of about 2 percent during the period. Course correction My second key finding was that markets tend to change their mind in a new president’s second year in office. That is, in cases where stocks rallied for the first three days after an election, the market seems to consider the initial move an “overreaction,” and vice versa. Specifically, the DJIA lost an average of about 2.5 percent in a president’s second year if he got a victory boost during those three days. When the president-elect was initially punished by investors, stocks returned about 12.5 percent in his second year. The reason for this anomaly seems straightforward. Media attention leading up to the election induces extreme beliefs in voters, including investors, which are reflected in trading decisions as soon as the results are known. So if the market reacts negatively to the election’s outcome and the president turns out to be not as bad as expected, then the market recovers. The opposite behavior occurs when the market reacts positively to the election’s outcome and apparently, this behavior happens frequently. The presidential election cycle More broadly, these findings seem to fit into a well-known phenomenon called the presidential election cycle, referring to the four years following a new president taking the oath of office. Going back to at least the 1960s, the second half of a president’s term—especially the third year—has almost always outperformed the first half. For the last 14 election cycles, returns in the third year of a term have averaged about 16 percent, double the average during every other year. That means for this year’s election, 2019 should be a good one for investors regardless of how markets react in the coming few days. Some have argued the reason is that going into a presidential election year, the president is motivated to keep his party in power. Hence, he has an incentive to implement fiscal policies designed to give the economy a boost, which is usually good news for a company’s bottom line, resulting in positive stock returns. Evidence supporting this theory, however, has been elusive. A study I published in 2013 suggested that tax policy may be behind the second-half bump because most tax legislation is passed in a president’s first two years in office, so the economic impact is felt in later years. What does it mean? Research has shown that Democratic presidents have historically been better for stocks than Republican presidents, but at the cost of higher inflation. So how can investors expect their portfolios to perform now that the 2016 election is over? If history is any guide, the probabilities indicate that the market returns for the remainder of 2016 should continue in the same direction as the returns for the day following the election. The returns for the year 2018 should be in the opposite direction of the cumulative returns for the three days following the election. Finally, 2019 will likely be a positive year regardless. Given the unusual characteristics of this election, it is hard to speculate whether or not these patterns will continue. This is the first time in history that the country may have a true outsider without military or government experience as president. So only time will tell whether these patterns will persist. Regardless, Americans have cast their votes for president, and now investors will continue to cast their own on whether they think he will able to improve the economy. And that may provide valuable clues for investors’ portfolio performance for years to come. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

Share story American history offers no precedent to Donald Trump’s election to the presidency. Never before has a successful candidate brought no experience in statecraft and politics — and certainly not as chief executive of an America as a populous, complex nation and superpower. Ronald Reagan was “just an actor,” except he had served two successful, largely pragmatic terms as governor of the nation’s biggest state, and he had thought and written extensively about politics. Never before have we had a president-elect who brings the trail of scandal, bragging of sexual assault, business failures and loose talk about such trifles as nuclear weapons. We are on uncharted seas. And I am afraid. The economy can expect substantial changes. Two of Trump’s consistent pledges have been to limit immigration and threaten Mexico and China over trade to get them to “negotiate.” I see no evidence not to take him seriously, with whatever checks might be applied by a Republican Congress and (soon to be) Republican Supreme Court. It’s impossible to see how China, especially, could be brought to “negotiate.” Trump’s nationalism, meet the nationalism of Xi Jinping, a very dangerous game. China happens to be Washington’s largest trading partner and the state would be badly mauled by a trade war. The Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead, with more geo-strategic consequences than economic ones for the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.

On immigration, even if Trump “limits” his reach to illegal, largely Hispanic, immigrants and Muslims, the situation will be chilling. This potentially affects Washington, and especially metropolitan Seattle, by keeping out talented people from around the world, who boost the economy through their skills and give Seattle much of its world city diversity. A large body of evidence suggests that immigration adds to economic growth and STEM talent (see here, and here, for example). Would severely cutting immigration raise wages? Perhaps for some. But here things run into the reality of total Republican control of the federal government. Today’s GOP opposes unionization, a higher minimum wage and “burdensome” protections for workers. Republicans see inequality as a natural condition, not one meriting government intervention. Trump and the GOP do promise big tax cuts for the richest. “Entitlements” (i.e. the earned benefits of Social Security and Medicare) will be cut and privatized. Obamacare will be repealed (too bad, you soon-to-be-uninsured 20 million). Any average American who voted for Trump to improve his or her economic lot is dreaming. Contrary to the prevailing narrative, most of Trump’s appeal was racial, cultural and nationalistic, not economic. Big business might do very well in the short term under the GOP, hence today’s advance on Wall  Street. Trump has no overall plan and a weak bench of advisers, so Rep. Paul Ryan’s Congress will set the template of governance. It will go deep into the pores of the economy. Cutting antitrust enforcement, deregulating, eliminating the federal Environmental Protection Agency, allowing even more offshore tax evasion — all this is coming. The major corporations of the Puget Sound will get these laissez faire advantages, while they last. One exception are the enterprises of Jeff Bezos, whose Washington Post produced some of the top journalism of the campaign. As a result, Trump, known for his vindictiveness, has vowed to use antitrust as a weapon in this case. Boeing is something of a question mark. It has earned the ire of many Republicans in their desire to shut the Export-Import Bank. Maybe now that they control the White House, Republicans will let the agency get back in business. Maybe not. The big enchilada: Get in a fight with China, and lose Boeing’s vital Chinese business. Another large question comes on the defense side. Trump has been heterodox on defense spending and even willing to go after procurement dysfunction (if his attention span allows it). This puts him at odds with Republicans who want to let the military Keynesianism roll. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will be among the first to hear, “You’re fired.” The Fed will become more politicized, gutting its ability to anticipate and respond to crises (Republicans don’t believe in market failures). Deregulation is likely to sweep away the Dodd-Frank financial reform. Inadequate though it was, Dodd-Frank was at least a beginning. So expect a wave of corruption and bubbles. Paying for those tax cuts will require cutting research and aid to cities, big blows to our innovation economy and improvement of the urban area. Trump has said he wants big infrastructure, especially passenger rail and high-speed rail like other advanced nations. But he faces a Congress whose opposition to rail is an act of faith. All this is nothing compared with Trump and the Congress denying mainstream science on climate change. Two years, four years — even if Trumpism is not a permanent regime — will be too late if the United States reverses its leadership on this genuine existential threat. To enumerate its costs to the economy, including our fisheries, trivializes the human and species suffering ahead. So to the purists who wanted to “burn down the house,” you voted to burn up the planet, morons. This is reality, not reality TV.         Jon Talton: jtalton@seattletimes.com; on Twitter: @jontalton.

It reminds me of 1976, when Jimmy Carter led a manufacturing and trading rebellion against the oil boom in Houston, when I was getting my degree from Rice University. What I didn’t realize, sitting amidst all those new skyscrapers, was how badly trading centers on the coasts were hurting. The real estate recession that began in 1974 would continue through the decade. After the 1976 election, of course, oil men redoubled their efforts to take political power. They succeeded, in 1978 and 1980, then dominated our politics from that day to this. From that perspective, Trump is a “Bizarro World” version of Jimmy Carter. But history doesn’t repeat, it can only rhyme. What does Donald Trump mean to investors in 2017 and beyond? The Oil Economy The oil economy includes both the production and consumption of resources. 16 Best Stocks to Buy Under President Donald Trump It’s not just buy Pioneer Natural Resources, EOG Resources and Philips 66. This should mean big gains on the consumption side of the equation, for suburban homebuilders like Toll Brothers and automakers like Ford Motor and General Motors. Obviously, this is big news for defense stocks like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing. A world marked by growing nationalism is going to mean huge sales, not just to the U.S. military but to military people around the world. The knee-jerk reaction is going to be selling tech stocks, especially companies like Alphabet, Amazon and Facebook. If you have a time horizon of a year or two, and especially if you still have a gain in these stocks after today, it may be time to take profits. If you are an investor with a five-year time horizon or longer, however, you may want to pick up some bargains. Hunker down and know that the future is inevitable. Things like self-driving cars, self-running factories, and immersive, virtual reality gaming … they are all in our future. Economic forces work their will. It just takes time. Buy China The most important investment call I can make is that you buy China. China has a large, and still growing, domestic economy, under an unshakeable state that controls its Internet. China is the model every other country will be following going forward. Over time, I think this leads to a balkanization of the Internet, and a true global recession. But China should skate through, helped by the growing economies of Southeast Asia around it, where one-quarter of the world’s people live. So Aliababa Group Holding So Weibo Corp. So Trina Solar Limited. So the SPDR S&P China and other instruments that give you access to the Chinese economy. China is going to drop the chips America is leaving on the table, so maybe pick up some Las Vegas Sands as well. A Bumpy Night The natural impulse in the face of a shock like today is to sell, sell, sell. Buy the SPDR S&P Biotech (ETF) (XBI) TODAY Lots of investors will be doing that this morning, adjusting their portfolios to an unexpected reality, talking up global nationalism and tension, wondering where Wall Street got things so wrong. It’s more important to note that, in the longer run, the economy drives politics and not the other way around. Donald Trump can no longer halt the Internet economy with his bluster than Jimmy Carter could halt the rise of oil with a cardigan sweater. But for now, that’s the world we live and invest in.

By Rebecca Moore editors@plansponsor.com | November 09, 2016 Page 1 of 3 View Full Article Since December 2010, companies like Honeywell, AT&T, Verizon Communications, UPS and others announced they would use mark-to-market recognition in corporate earnings statements of defined benefit (DB) plan gains and losses. This move to mark-to-market accounting, an alternative to amortizing gains and losses over many years, resulted in large reported losses for many. The Boeing Company, AT&T, UPS, Windstream Corp. and FirstEnergy Corp. all announced that lower discount rates and a change to practices around recognizing pension gains and losses in the year in which they occur—rather than amortizing them over time—resulted in a charge for pensions. For example, AT&T ended 2011 on a down note, posting a $6.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter due largely to a change in how it accounts for its employee pension benefits and the breakup fee it was required to pay after scrapping its bid to buy T-Mobile USA. In many announcements, the companies stated they were changing accounting methods to increase transparency. Companies say this is a more accurate measure of a DB plan sponsor’s financials. In addition, removing amortization removes long-term market fluctuations and when DB plan sponsors use this accounting to project into the future, it improves their ability to budget for the plan, she adds. Other than for financial reasons, Willis Towers Watson has seen clients move to mark-to-market accounting to align with international accounting standards or to align their measures with their competitors’. However, Professor Jaewoo Kim, and others from the University of Rochester, Simon Business School, note in a research report that the possibility that company managers were incented to change accounting methods to report higher future profits and extract higher compensation was not unnoticed by financial analysts and commentators in the financial press. Kim and his fellow researchers call this motivation “managerial opportunism.” NEXT: Some support for the transparency motive Prev 1 2 3 Next View Full Article Tagged: Actuarial-issues, Defined-Benefit related articles related research most e-mailed Cover The Costs of COLAs From plansponsor.com Motives Behind DB Sponsors’ Move to Mark-to-Market Accounting FASB Proposes New Reporting Standards for Pensions SOA Publishes Update to Mortality Improvement Scale Low Interest Rates Not the Driving Force Behind Lower DB Funding Costly Actuarial Errors Alleged in New Provider Lawsuit Transamerica Defines the ‘DB Plan Continuum’ Cover The Costs of COLAs From plansponsor.com 2016 Defined Contribution Survey 2016 Third–Party Administrator Buyer’s Guide 2016 PLANSPONSOR Stock Plan Administration Buyer's Guide 2016 PLANSPONSOR THIRD-PARTY ADMINISTRATOR SURVEY 2016 Recordkeeping Survey 2016 Participant Survey Cover The Costs of COLAs From plansponsor.com Fee Arrangement Between Providers Questioned in ERISA Suit Robo-Advisers Create Challenges for Plan Fiduciaries PlanPILOT to Offer Digital RFP Experience to Customers DOL Fiduciary Rule Implementation Now Faces a Trump Presidency Motives Behind DB Sponsors Move to Mark-to-Market Accounting go to news topic SPONSORED MESSAGES Get PLANSPONSOR Email NewsDash (i) PLANSPONSOR’s Newsdash: The industry’s leading daily source for information focused on the critical issues impacting benefits industry professionals.

The elevation of Rao, Airbus’s 52-year-old executive vice president for strategy and future programs, has been disclosed to top management, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is still private. A public announcement will come within the next month, they said. Airbus spokesman Stefan Schaffrath declined to comment. The appointment comes less than a month after Boeing announced that Ihssane Mounir would replace John Wojick as its head of sales early next year. Leahy, 66, has outlasted more than a half-dozen Boeing counterparts since being named Airbus’s chief commercial officer in 1994. In his career at the planemaker, Leahy has won aircraft commitments valued at more than $1 trillion. Airbus announced a plan in September to combine all divisions into a single company, as chief executive officer Tom Enders seeks to cut costs, streamline operations and reduce bureaucracy. Rao also held the title of executive vice president for sales and marketing. Rao was born in India and studied aeronautical engineering.

Partners View all partners Republish this article Republish our articles for free, online or in print, under Creative Commons licence. Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Global financial markets initially plunged, recovered and then posted solid gains as Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. The Standard & Poor’s 500 closed up 1.1 percent as investors saw some upside to a President Trump. That followed a night of panic, when futures contracts on that same index tumbled 5 percent, and the Mexican peso – which has been a key indicator of investor sentiment during this race – plummeted as much as 12 percent, to a record low. While investors around the world continue to digest the results, a central issue for them is how the outcome will affect their assets. But does how markets react tell us anything about the future as well? As it turns out, whether markets – specifically stocks – continue to fall or begin to rise over the next few days can be a useful predictor for how they will perform in the months and even years to come. In the case of the 2016 presidential election, investors will decide whether they think Trump will be good or bad for the economy – and more importantly their investments – as the 45th president. The rest of us, investor or not, would be well-advised to pay attention. Early market reaction to Trump’s victory was decidedly negative. Toru Hanai/Reuters Performance in the near term In general, as you might expect, markets tend to rally if investors think the election winner will be good for their investments and drop if they deem otherwise. Essentially, they’re all just making bets on the future – some short term, some longer term. In particular, they may turn bullish and buy more U.S. stocks, for example, if they think the next president will create a more favorable business climate for companies, perhaps by lowering tax rates, investing in the economy (leading to stronger growth), reducing regulation or reducing uncertainty. Research I published in 2014 offers evidence that the stock market’s early assessment tends to be a good predictor of how it will perform in the near future. In other words, investors cast their own votes – with their hard-earned dollars – on the outcome of the election: If more investors think that America’s choice for president will be good for the economy rather than bad, stock prices rise and vice versa. In my study, I examined market returns for the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) – which includes 30 of the best-known U.S. stocks such as Microsoft and Boeing – covering 29 presidential elections from 1896 to 2011. I found two key pieces of evidence that may drive investors’ stock portfolio performance both in the short term and the long term. First, how the market reacts the day after the election appears to be an indicator of how it will perform for the remainder of the election year. If this pattern persists, then investors can expect stock returns from Nov. 10 through Dec. 31 to continue in the same direction as the returns on Nov. 9. This is generally known as the momentum effect – made popular in academic literature by finance professors Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman. In those 29 presidential elections I examined, when the market “approved” of the outcome by rallying the day after the election, stocks returned an average of about 3 percent over the rest of the year. When stocks initially dropped, the market lost an average of about 2 percent during the period. Course correction My second key finding was that markets tend to change their mind in a new president’s second year in office. That is, in cases where stocks rallied for the first three days after an election, the market seems to consider the initial move an “overreaction,” and vice versa. Specifically, the DJIA lost an average of about 2.5 percent in a president’s second year if he got a victory boost during those three days. When the president-elect was initially punished by investors, stocks returned about 12.5 percent in his second year. The reason for this anomaly seems straightforward. Media attention leading up to the election induces extreme beliefs in voters, including investors, which are reflected in trading decisions as soon as the results are known. So if the market reacts negatively to the election’s outcome and the president turns out to be not as bad as expected, then the market recovers. The opposite behavior occurs when the market reacts positively to the election’s outcome and apparently, this behavior happens frequently. The presidential election cycle More broadly, these findings seem to fit into a well-known phenomenon called the presidential election cycle, referring to the four years following a new president taking the oath of office. Going back to at least the 1960s, the second half of a president’s term, especially the third year, has almost always outperformed the first half. For the last 14 election cycles, returns in the third year of a term have averaged about 16 percent, double the average during every other year. That means for this year’s election, 2019 should be a good one for investors regardless of how markets react in the coming few days. Some have argued the reason is that going into a presidential election year, the president is motivated to keep his party in power. Hence, he has an incentive to implement fiscal policies designed to give the economy a boost, which is usually good news for a company’s bottom line, resulting in positive stock returns. Evidence supporting this theory, however, has been elusive. A study I published in 2013 suggested that tax policy may be behind the second-half bump because most tax legislation is passed in a president’s first two years in office, so the economic impact is felt in later years. What does it mean? Research has shown that Democratic presidents have historically been better for stocks than Republican presidents, but at the cost of higher inflation. So how can investors expect their portfolios to perform now that the 2016 election is over? If history is any guide, the probabilities indicate that the market returns for the remainder of 2016 should continue in the same direction as the returns for the day following the election. The returns for the year 2018 should be in the opposite direction of the cumulative returns for the three days following the election. Finally, 2019 will likely be a positive year regardless. Given the unusual characteristics of this election, it is hard to speculate whether or not these patterns will continue. This is the first time in history that the country may have a true outsider, with no military or government experience, as president. So only time will tell whether these patterns will persist. Regardless, Americans have cast their votes for president, and now investors will continue to cast their own on whether they think he will able to improve the economy. And that may provide valuable clues for investors’ portfolio performance for years to come.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 11 November 2016 Emirates calls outlook bleak as profit tumbles on strong dollar DUBAI: Emirates Group first-half profit plunged 64% as the world’s biggest airline by international traffic struggled with a rising US dollar and political and economic uncertainty that damped global travel and weighed on fares. Net income fell to 1.3 billion dirhams (US$364mil) in the six months through September from 3.7 billion dirhams a year earlier, the Dubai-based carrier said Wednesday in a statement. Revenue rose 1% to 46.5 billion dirhams. “The bleak global economic outlook appears to be the new norm, with no immediate resolution in sight,” Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in the statement. “We continue to make strategic investments, because we know we have to work even harder for every customer.” Emirates, which has exploited its Persian Gulf location to turn its Dubai hub into an inter-continental crossroads, has faced a tough year. Low petroleum prices have sapped demand for lucrative premium bookings from executives in the oil and gas industry, while terrorist attacks in Europe have scared off travelers from Asia. The dollar’s exchange-rate gains held back revenue growth, which Emirates also said was hurt by currency restrictions in some African countries. Cash at the group dwindled to 14.9 billion dirhams by Sept 30 from 23.5 billion dirhams on March 31 as the company invested in new aircraft, among other payments. Emirates took delivery of eight Airbus Group SE double-decker A380 planes and eight Boeing Co 777s, and 20 more wide-bodies will join the fleet by the end of the fiscal year. Fuel costs fell 10% in the first half amid low oil prices, reducing spending on jet kerosene to 24% of operating costs from 28% a year earlier. New routes to destinations including Yangon, Myanmar, and Hanoi, Vietnam, helped push passenger numbers up 8.9% to 28 million in the first half. – Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: emirates Related Stories Emirates says ex-MAS CEO Mueller to join this month RM61bil orders by AirAsia Emirates profit rises 50% on fuel windfall and long-haul routes Dubai to close Sheikh’s buyout firm that held US$13bil Emirates, Malaysia Airlines add 15 destinations You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read Footwear icon Jimmy Choo all for dimsum.my Minding the language of politics MRT fare starts at RM1 Property Related advertisement Latest News There is no "truly low-cost" airlines in Asia, there is a gap for this Malaysian palm oil price declines for 2nd session in a row Oil rallies on OPEC deal bets; tech, energy boost global stocks Google announces new London office, 3,000 jobs expected Wall Street rises, helped by tech and energy (Update 1) Most Viewed in Business MRT fare starts at RM1 There is no "truly low-cost" airlines in Asia, there is a gap for this Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Malaysia Airlines mulls purchase of 25 widebody jets next year EPF, Eco World in JV to develop township, business park in Selangor Oil rallies on OPEC deal bets; tech, energy boost global stocks Google announces new London office, 3,000 jobs expected Astro to be taken private?

Home Metals Directory Learning Resources Editorials FAQs Literature White Papers Classifieds Member Guides Archive Category Archive Digital Editions Web Exclusives SUBSCRIBE Print Magazine Digital Edition eNewsletters 2017 Media Kit Company Profiles Tweet Aluminum Strategic thinking By Corinna Petry Above: AMAG put in a second hot rolling mill at its Ranshofen, Austria, aluminum mill complex. A heat treat facility will open in 2017. Following major customers’ footprints, Austrian aluminum producer is keen on North American expansion November 2016 - An aluminum producer based in Ranshofen, Austria—immediately across the Inn River from Germany and less than 60 kilometers north of Salzburg—has been expanding capacity, shipments, revenues and profits for a couple decades now and the current phase is powering up in North America. One might wonder where AMAG (Austria Metall AG), which shipped 206,300 metric tons during the first half of 2016, fits in with giants like Alcoa, Constellium, Aleris and Novelis. Chairman of the Executive Board and CEO of the company, Helmut Wieser, doesn’t worry about that. “We have been in an expansion mode for the last 20 years,” he says. In 1995, AMAG produced about 60,000 metric tons of rolled products and last year, 175,000 metric tons. “Everything is already under way to expand to 300,000 metric tons.” AMAG’s product was chosen to decorate a highly visible luxury restaurant in Vienna. In 2014, AMAG started up a second hot-rolling mill, a plate production center, and expanded its cast house and its recycling capacity, Wieser says. “Slab is our material going into the rolling mills.” Between 75 and 80 percent of the molten metal is from recycled aluminum, which Wieser claims is a higher percentage than competing remelters.  The second hot rolling mill produces a wider and heavier gauge product: Sheet and plate can be up to 6 inches thick by 90 inches wide. “For tread plate, we go up to 82 inches wide,” says Wieser. Beyond that stage, AMAG will add wide cold rolling mills and a continuous heat treatment line for coil. The wider material is what customers in aerospace, automotive and other sectors want. “We can offer more capabilities based on the width,” says Wieser, adding, “It is a mitigation risk for the customer to have two large hot rolling mills and two large cold rolling mills.” By doubling production, there is pretty much a zero chance AMAG would miss a promised delivery.  The second cold mill and heat treatment facility will be fully operational next year. In all, AMAG has invested €520 million in the accumulated projects. The company exports about 85 percent of its volume; 50 percent is consumed by Western European customers, 25 percent goes to North America and 5 percent is shipped to Asia. “We have been exporting to the United States more than 25 years and we continuously increase that,” Wieser says.  Alouette One part of AMAG’s global footprint lies in Sept-Iles, Quebec, at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. That is where Alouette Aluminerie produced around 600,000 metric tons of ingots last year. The largest smelter in North America is co-owned by Rio Tinto, Marubeni Metals & Minerals Canada, Hydro Aluminium, AMAG and the provincial government (Investissement Quebec). AMAG takes 20 percent of the output and “most of the product is shipped to the American market. We barely bring any metal to Europe,” says Wieser. The additional hot and cold rolling equipment mills support the production of heavy-gauge aluminum, with plate being as thick as 6 inches and up to 90 inches wide. This partnership has been beneficial on several levels, he says. “Many other smelters closed down in Canada and the U.S., which makes Alouette even more important to our future.” The partners secured a new electricity contract last year, effective in 2017 and which won’t expire until 2029. It will tie the kilowatt rate to the spot price of aluminum, which helps improve both the cost position and risk profile in relation to fluctuating LME prices and currency exchange rates. Based on hydropower, the long-term contract also gives Alouette “a minimum carbon footprint” among competing smelting operations globally, according to Wieser. “It has set worldwide benchmarks in energy efficiency and cleanliness.” There are plans on the books to boost Alouette’s capacity, but “because of low aluminum prices, this is not the right time to decide. When the opportunity arises, we have prepared the ground for it,” Wieser says. All five partners must agree to any such capital project.  Market diversity “We are proud to serve Boeing [Co.] in sheet and plate,” Wieser says. “We are also the certified supplier to the automotive industry, including Audi, BMW, Daimler-Mercedes, General Motors, Fiat Chrysler and Porsche. And we sell to tier I suppliers like Magna International, stampers and automotive service centers.”   The company also rolls architectural product. Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management will open a 410,000-square-foot education center this winter on the shores of Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois. The façade features AMAG aluminum. “All the heat treatable alloys are specialty products from our plant. This means skin sheet and plates for aerospace, auto body sheet and structural—crash management—applications, brazing sheets for coolers and heat exchangers, and very bright material for automotive trim,” says Wieser. “Get into an Audi or BMW and you’ll find good-looking trim.” Demand for anodized and strong, perfect surface aluminum has been growing, he notes. “We have another automotive product, AMAG TopForm, which is made for super plastic forming processes. This is a special product with a very fine grain structure.” It’s especially used for complex geometries and for high-end luxury vehicles like the Bentley.” Based on its expanded capabilities in Ranshofen, “the wide sheet, wide plate and thick plate are entering the U.S. market,” says Wieser, noting that demand for these products “is good.” AMAG is also “producing marine grades, which were often a challenge due to the previously limited width.” Applications include tankers and dump bodies as truck builders adopt lightweight materials to meet more stringent fuel economy standards. Gerald Mayer, CFO, left, Helmut Wieser, CEO, and Helmut Kaufmann, COO, lead AMAG, remelter and roller of specialty grades of aluminum for aerospace, architectural and automotive applications. Stability Employing the right processes and products, even a medium-sized company like AMAG (first-half 2016 revenues were €461.4 million) can be a valued supplier with a global footprint.  “We are a public company. We have stable shareholders in a stable country. Many customers are very happy to count on our quality and delivery. We are not in commodities. Customers and shareholders can see we have sustainable growth. We have paid dividends in each of the last five years,” Wieser notes. AMAG will also seize upon every metallurgical and process technology development that makes economic sense. “We have 100 employees in R&D, many of them Ph.D.s,” he says. “We also have local application engineers in the U.S.” As a partner to automakers like GM, Daimler and Audi, which “have plants all over the world,” AMAG is poised to roll and ship what they need. “The latest development is producing C-class Mercedes in the United States. They developed technology in Europe and are deploying it worldwide,” says Wieser. By being adaptable, AMAG has proven itself with “a high proportion of specialty products compared with other aluminum producers.” He cites the production of heat treat plate and sheet for automotive and aircraft from a single location. “[Peers] produce either automotive or aerospace. Very few do both. That is a good crossover,” says Wieser, especially because “automakers are asking for aerospace quality product. So what we have done gives us synergies.” MM Sources AMAG Ranshofen, Austria phone: +43 (0) 7722-801-0 www.amag.at Editor's Choice Up to the task On the cusp Pure power Doubling down Durable beauty Most Viewed Alcoa Corp. launches as an independent industry leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products > Metals Service Center Institute and National Safety Council unveil partnership program > OMAX MicroMAX named finalist for prestigious R&D 100 Awards > Operational Excellence in Manufacturing 2016, December 6-7, 2016, Chicago > Ampco-Pittsburgh announces acquisition of ASW Steel Inc. > A veteran’s best friend > Copper Industry Sustainable Energy Director appointed to Federal Clean Energy Committee > Regional manufacturing centers boost high school completion rates > SSAB launches Docol (hot-rolled) steel, tailor made for chassis applications > Wismarq advances with strategic acquisition of Prior Coated Metals Inc. > LATEST ISSUE   November 2016 READY RESOURCE Service Center Metals produces billets to battle imports. > READ THIS MONTH'S ISSUE Instagram - @ModernMetalsMag Modern Metals on Twitter Tweets by @ModernMetalsMag Company Profiles COIL PROCESSING DEBURRING/FINISHING PLATE SERVICE CENTERS Butech Bliss Supermax Tools Peddinghaus Corp.

Source: US Naval Air Systems Command Sikorsky is pitching its CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter as a potential solution for the US Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL)-Heavy requirement, a company official told IHS Jane's in early November. With the CH-53K now entering into the operational testing phase of its development ahead of the commencement of deliveries to the US Marine Corps (USMC), the programme vice-president Mike Torok said that the US Army's FVL-Heavy requirement presents an "interesting opportunity". "One interesting 'downstream' opportunity is for the US Army's FVL-Heavy requirement that will follow the FVL-Medium [now being developed by Sikorsky-Boeing and Bell Helicopter under the Joint MultiRole-Technology Demonstrator (JMR-TD) effort]," Torok said, adding, "We have done some assessments with the US Army, and have shown that right off the production line the CH-53K hits a significant number of the key capability requirements without any additional investment." The US Army plans to field its FVL-Medium replacement(s) for the current Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and Boeing AH-64 helicopters in about the 2030 timeframe, to be followed by an FVL-Heavy replacement for the Boeing CH-47 Chinook from about 2040. Official performance parameters for FVL-Heavy have not yet been publically disclosed, but with a maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of close to 40,000 kg (with external load) the CH-53K will have the largest lift capacity of any helicopter in the US military when it begins entering USMC service in 2019. Other CH-53K performance specifications include a maximum speed of 170 kt; a range of 454 n miles or a radius of operation of 110 n miles with a 12,340 kg payload; and a service ceiling of 14,380 ft. While Torok conceded that, as it stands, the CH-53K does not meet all of the FVL-Heavy performance requirements, he suggested that it meets enough of them for the US Army to give it some serious consideration when the decision does finally come to be made, noting, "It will be an interesting discussion when we get to that point as to whether [the US Army] really needs the additional requirements, and if they have the budget for them."

Tuesday night saw markets thrown into disarray as investors around the world recalibrated their positions that had been set under the long-held assumption that Hillary Clinton would be elected the next U.S. president. Around an hour after trading started in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down about 0.15 percent. The S&P 500 had shed about 0.36 percent, and the Nasdaq was off about 0.6 percent. All three indices had been in positive territory for a short period Wednesday morning. While in flux, the markets were comparatively calm relative to the tumult seen in corresponding futures markets Tuesday night. As overnight results painted a clearer picture that Trump would clinch the presidency, futures and foreign markets were thrown into the red. At one point, Dow futures were down 800 points, a figure that would have been worse than some of the darkest days of the 2008 financial crisis if it had stuck into regular trading. There were bright spots, notably in stocks for health care and defense companies, which could be boosted by Trump’s policies. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences sector was up more than 4.6 percent around 11:00 a.m., according to Bloomberg, a financial data and news firm. The banking sector was up more than 2.8 percent, the firm’s website said. Defense companies were also faring well. Raytheon was up more than 6.2 percent around 11 a.m. Lockheed Martin was up about 5 percent, and Boeing was up about 1.2 percent. Private prisons, with which the Obama administration said earlier this year it would cut off ties, were enjoying a great morning. Corrections Corporation of America was up more than 36.3 percent shortly after 11 a.m. Its rival Geo Group was up more than 16 percent. One asset was still feeling a hangover Wednesday morning from the night’s drama: the Mexican peso. The Mexican currency has become somewhat of a celebrity asset over this election cycle, with investors and the media pointing to how sensitively it has reacted to the twists and turns of campaign developments. The peso began a substantial slide shortly after 8 p.m. ET Tuesday when voting results began to throw doubt on polling that showed a Clinton lead in recent days. At about 10:45 a.m., the peso was trading around 20 pesos to the dollar, having lost about 9.7 percent since the slide began the night before. Staying abroad, stock markets in Europe and Asia turned positive Wednesday. London’s FTSE 100 was up about 0.3 percent not long before it closed. And Nikkei futures in Japan were up about 4 percent after a large decline in the wake of the election result. Copyright © 2016, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.

Investors' initial fears were eased by Trump's inclusive victory speech and some of his policy plans, such as increased infrastructure and military spending as well as repealing landmark health care and financial reform laws, boosted stocks in several key sectors. Credit markets reflected more nervousness. Yield on many bonds, including U.S. Treasury securities, rose amid concerns that budget deficits might increase, and push up borrowing costs, if Trump pursues some spending programs and tax cuts he discussed during the campaign. The Dow Jones industrial shot up 256.95 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 18,589.69, near August's record high after a relatively calm open. The rally came after an 800-point plunge in overnight futures as Trump's victory became apparent early Wednesday, after investors somewhat duplicated the initial market turmoil and quick recovery that followed the stunning vote in Britain in June to leave the European Union. The Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500 rose about 1.1 percent after similar steep futures declines. "Markets tend to assume the worst and react immediately," Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients before the opening bell Wednesday. "Expect an immediate market pullback on fear, and then a pause." As with the surprise "Brexit" vote, when Britain voted in June to leave the European Union, part of the market's turmoil reflected money managers having guessed incorrectly on the outcome of the election. "Markets tend to have knee-jerk reactions to these kind of situations" and in this case investors also "had all but priced-in a (Hillary) Clinton victory," Nigel Green, chief executive of the financial advisory firm DeVere Group in London, said in a statement. Major stock indexes had fallen around the globe as world markets digested Trump's victory. Japan's Nikkei index fell more than 5 percent overnight but major European indexes turned positive later Wednesday recovering from sharper declines earlier in the day. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, said Trump's inclusive victory speech helped calm markets -- for now. "It's a knee-jerk reaction in both cases, first to the shocking election outcome second to the very tempered speech that President-elect Trump had given in acceptance," McBride said. "In neither case are the multitude of questions outstanding answered," he said, adding that Trump was "deliberately vague" on specific policy positions during the campaign. "So in the face of unanswered questions, I would expect very choppy waters in financial markets over the coming weeks and months," McBride said. There was confusion in the credit markets, too. Prices of many U.S. Treasury securities -- typically one of the safe havens that investors seek in volatile times -- fell in early trading Wednesday, driving their yields higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, jumped to 2.06 percent -- the highest since January -- from 1.85 percent on Tuesday. "I don't think the bond markets have a good handle on the implications of the events of last night, so they're pricing in the potential for greater risk," said Guy LeBas, head of fixed-income strategy at the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott. "If you look at the proto-policies that Trump has referenced, including possibly renegotiating the U.S. debt and running a massive deficit, while those outcomes are by no means certain that enhances the risk of Treasury securities," LeBas said. McBride said short-term bond prices fell because investors believe Federal Reserve policymakers are less likely to nudge up interest rates next month in the wake of Trump's victory. Long-term bond yields were up because Trump used his speech in part to tout plans for more infrastructure spending, "which portends bigger deficits and debt," McBride said. Stocks in certain sectors rallied on speculation that Trump's proposals eventually would boost the companies' growth. Big bank stocks surged with the expectation of less financial regulation and construction and heavy equipment companies rallied on Trump's expected push for more federal spending on roads, airports and other infrastructure. "We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals," Trump said in his early morning victory speech. "We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it." There is bipartisan backing for increased infrastructure spending. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also wanted more such spending and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday that "we can work together to pass a robust infrastructure jobs bill." Consequently, Caterpillar Inc. stock was up about 7.7 percent Wednesday. And shares of Vulcan Materials Co., which produces asphalt and concrete mixes, shot up more than 10 percent. Aerospace and defense stocks also rose in response to Trump's promise to build up the U.S. military. Raytheon Co. surged about 8 percent in morning trading, Northrop Grumman Corp. jumped about 5.8 percent and Boeing Co. gained 2 percent. Drug stocks also shot higher with Trump vowing to repeal Obamacare and replace it with another national health care plan. Pfizer Inc. and Amgen Inc. both rose 6 percent and Merck & Co. was up 5.5 percent. But Trump's exact plans are still unclear, so investors should wait for more details, said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. "I think this is a very short-term bump," he said. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) The Mexican peso was down about 8 percent against the dollar after plunging earlier Wednesday by more than 13 percent to a record low amid concerns about a Trump presidency. Trump has promised to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to halt undocumented immigration. He also promised during the campaign to rewrite or scrap the 2-decade-old North American Free Trade Agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Investors also were concerned about the effect of Trump's victory on global trade. Trump has been highly critical of U.S. trade deals and adamantly opposes the proposed 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership pact with Asian nations. Those positions have raised fears among investors of a global trade war and a U.S. recession after Trump takes office. "Trump has proposed economic and trade policies which, if enacted, would represent a sharp departure from the status quo," HSBC Global Research said. "These include sharp cuts in income and business taxes, renegotiation of trade agreements and potential tariffs on goods imported from China and Mexico, and the large-scale deportation of illegal immigrants." Fitch Ratings said Trump's victory "does not have immediate near-term implications" for the federal government's AAA bond rating.

The airline said Indonesian Civil Aviation Authorities are unable to approve the flights due to runway maintenance works. The airline initially planned to launch flights three times a week on its Boeing 777 aircraft on Nov. 23. The airline received requisite written approval from the authorities and even secured airport slots. Based at Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore Airlines is the national carrier of Singapore, employing a fleet of wide body Boeing and Airbus aircraft, including the A380. Singapore Airlines operates an extensive network across Asia, North America, Australasia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Southwest Airlines Recommends Shareholders Reject "Mini-Tender" Offer by TRC Capital Corporation DALLAS, Nov. 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) announced today that it received notice of an unsolicited “mini-tender” offer by TRC Capital Corporation (TRC Capital) to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares, or approximately 0.4 percent of the outstanding shares, of Southwest’s common stock at a price of $38.63 per share. The offer price is 4.33 percent below the closing price per share of Southwest’s common stock on November 4, 2016, the last trading day before the offer was commenced.  TRC Capital may terminate or amend its offer if certain conditions occur, including any decrease in the market price of Southwest’s common stock from the price on the date of the offer. Southwest does not endorse TRC Capital’s unsolicited mini-tender offer and is not associated with TRC Capital, its mini-tender offer, or the mini-tender offer documents.  Because TRC Capital’s offer price is at a price below the current market price, Southwest recommends that Shareholders not tender their shares (i.e., take no action) or, if they have already tendered shares, withdraw their shares by providing the written notice described in the TRC Capital mini-tender offer documents prior to the expiration of the offer, currently scheduled for 12:01 a.m., New York City time, on Wednesday, December 7, 2016. Mini-tender offers, such as this one, are third-party offers that seek to acquire less than 5 percent of a company’s outstanding shares.  These offers typically do not provide the same investor protections required of larger tender offers, including the filing of disclosure documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other procedures required by U.S. securities laws. The SEC has cautioned investors that “some bidders make mini-tender offers at below-market prices, hoping that they will catch investors off guard if the investors do not compare the offer price to the current market price.” The SEC’s guidance to investors on mini-tender offers is available at http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm. TRC Capital has made many similar unsolicited mini-tender offers for shares of other public companies. Shareholders should obtain current market quotations for their shares, consult with their broker or financial advisor, and exercise caution with respect to TRC Capital’s mini-tender offer.  Southwest encourages brokers and dealers, as well as other market participants, to review the SEC’s letter regarding broker-dealer mini-tender offer dissemination and disclosure at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/minitenders/sia072401.htm. Southwest requests that a copy of this press release be included with all distributions of materials relating to TRC Capital’s mini-tender offer related to shares of Southwest’s common stock.

Donald Trump's Election Unlikely To Delay Predator Drone Sale To India NDTV 5 days ago Written by Vishnu Som New Delhi: Donald Trump's election as America's next President is unlikely to affect talks between the US and India for the sale of state-of-the-art Predator drones for the Indian armed forces. NDTV has learned that, for the moment, the visit of the outgoing US Secretary of Defence Ashton Carter to India in December remains unchanged. During Mr Carter's visit, the two sides are expected to discuss the sale of 22 unarmed Predator B Guardian drones for maritime surveillance and possibly 100 armed Predator C Avengers for the Indian Air Force.   Dates for Secretary Carter's visit are expected to be finalised over the next few days. Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar had met him in the US in August this year, when talks on India acquiring the sensitive Predator systems were taken forward.   Progress in talks has largely been made possible by India joining the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) in June and being declared a "major defence partner" of the US.   In pics: 5th generation fighter aircraft - the most lethal warbirds in the sky 5th generation fighter aircraft: The most lethal warbirds in the sky Secretary Carter's likely visit to India post the elections - Mr Trump will take oath in January - is unprecedented and shows how the outgoing Barack Obama administration wants to solidify the gains made in Indo-US defence ties, sources told NDTV.  At the same time, there is broad bipartisan support in the US Congress for the Predator sale, they said. The Indian Armed forces presently operate unarmed Israeli Heron and Searcher unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones used for day and night-time reconnaissance missions. The Indian Air Force has for years said it needs armed drones - weapon systems that have come into sharp focus after the Uri terror attack when the Indian Army took significant risks in deploying para-commandos across the Line of Control (LoC) to take out terrorist launch pads. The government has cleared a request by the Air Force to acquire 10 Heron TPs at an estimated cost of Rs 2,620 crore from Israel. These can be fitted with weapons to engage targets on the ground such as terrorist camps. Armed with Hellfire anti-armour missiles, which can strike targets eight kilometres away, the Predator C Avenger has the ability to detect targets across the LoC and hit them while flying well within Indian airspace. Attack variants of the Predator have been used widely by US forces deployed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Iraq in fighting terrorist forces, often through precision strikes. An extended range version of the Predator Avenger featuring a 76 foot wingspan can fly for up to 20 hours at an altitude of 50,000 feet. © Provided by NDTV 24x7 Predator C Avenger armed remotely piloted vehicle Those watching the progress of talks between India and the United States on the Predator systems point out that while the armed version of the Predator is a priority, talks are at a more advanced stage for the Indian Navy's requirement for the maritime Predator `B' Guardian. The Guardian carries an electro-optical night vision system and multi-mode maritime surveillance radar. © Provided by NDTV 24x7 Predators have been used widely by US forces deployed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Iraq Capable of flying up to 27 hours nonstop , the Guardian can cover vast stretches along India's coast line sharing crucial intelligence data with ground or ship based operators or the Indian Navy's new Boeing P-8 I maritime reconnaissance aircraft which are equipped with torpedoes and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. China recently unveiled its new CH-5 (Rainbow 5) armed drones described by some as the world's most advanced. The CH-5 has also been cleared for export to friendly countries such as Pakistan, which is already working closely with China on its UAV programmes. © Provided by NDTV 24x7 China's new CH-5 drone cleared for export to countries like Pakistan In an interview to www.china.org.cn, a mouthpiece for the Chinese government, Shi Wen, the chief designer of the drone has said the CH-5 can remain airborne for up to 32 hours when carrying 8 AR-1 air-to-ground missiles. "Hovering above a hostile region for that long time creates enough deterrence. You can just imagine a drone carrying eight missiles and watching you from above non-stop for 24 hours," said Shi.

Related Articles O’Sullivan, Afriforum taking criminal prosecution private – targeting Myeni, Zuptas Maynard: Dudu’s wasted SAA billions could pay for 55 000 #FeesMustFall students SAA to break even by 2021 Zuma stands firm on keeping Myeni as SAA chair Myeni takes a backseat at parly briefing on SAA SAA chair Dudu Myeni: 'I never appoint myself'   Cape Town - Dudu Myeni, chairperson of South African Airways, states in a lengthy letter why she cannot resign from her position at the beleaguered state-owned airline. In a response to a question from DA MP David Maynier, Myeni says "it is in the best interest of SAA and taxpayers that I serve my prescribed full term". Here is Myeni's full response to Maynier's questions, which she sent on Thursday to the Standing Committee on Finance. LETTER:  HONOURABLE MEMBER OF DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE, MR DAVID MAYNIER Subsequent to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance meeting with SAA on the 20th of September 2016, the Hon David Maynier asked a question as stated below: QUESTION: “Will the Chairperson, in the light of the preliminary report tabled today, tell us whether: a) she still believes that it is still in the best interests of the airline that she doesn’t resign, and if she believes that, b) why does she believe that?” RESPONSES: a) It is in the best interest of SAA and Taxpayers that I serve my prescribed full term. b) As stated previously, as part of their mandate, the South African Cabinet appointed the Board of South African Airways (SAA). I did not appoint myself. The SAA Chairperson therefore serves at the pleasure of the executive arm of the state (Cabinet). Importantly, SAA’s performance as reported in the financial report, presented to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance on 20 Septembers 2016, cannot be solely attributed to me, as current Chairperson. Objective facts dictate that SAA’s performance it is a historical consequence, underpinned by factors known to all South Africans. Further, SAA has never been capitalised and its competitive position was worsened by an  American Aviation Expert, who sold the fleet and leased them back. Such were bad decisions, which continue to haunt the airline, and quite conveniently, they are lumped on my doorstep. We still lease all our fleet from foreign countries and pay in dollars. In November 2015, the Honourable David Maynier MP, asked the same question during the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance hearing at which I appeared on behalf of SAA. The question posed then was “Tell us why you should not resign, (as the Chairperson). It is concerns one that this question persists without any indication as to the specific part(s) bases for the same relative to the alleged bearing on the performance of SAA in general. I shall therefore attempt to deal with the question from a broad perspective and also share some of historical challenges and achievements to date. At the outset, it is common cause that it is the prerogative of the shareholder to determine who is best to serve on the Board and my suitability, as a question, is therefore irrelevant. I accept that the Board is accountable for the performance of the company. As the “Accounting Authority”, as prescribed in the PFMA, the Board carries a well enshrined fiduciary responsibility for its own performance and that of the company. Acknowledging this responsibility against my personal prudency, as a leader, I continually reflect on my own performance in respect of SAA’s interest. I have found no sound reason not to continue to serve. As a member of a collective, I believe my contribution  has added intrinsic value to the SAA. My recent reappointment confirms the Shareholder’s confidence in my role as Chairperson. I have nothing but respect for that. There are many factors that have impaired our financial performance; while some are within our control and others are distinctly out of our control. And they are not dissimilar to what other players in our sector face. It has been established as an irrefutable fact that an airline is a capital intensive business and SAA is no exception. SAA has, for many years, been under capitalised, something acknowledged by most, including a series of former Boards. MY RESPONSE IS AS FOLLOWS: "To rephrase the BMW, Gore, Rodenstock and Royal Australian Navy case studies, no leader can lead an organisation single-handedly. "Rather, leadership is a distributed phenomenon, occurring in various parts of an organisation, just not emanating from the top." This is the constant about all organisations, nationally and globally. Similarly, the challenges of SAA cannot credibly be attributed to me as a person. Such a view is as bereft of any empirical corporate rationale as it represents a self-perpetuating narrative. Whilst this fact-free theory has no proximity to the objective facts, it has been authored and handed down to the multitudes of unsuspecting citizens, who have unquestioningly assimilated it. Whilst the status quo of non-transformation has been allowed to linger, owing largely to those who are hanging onto their ill-gotten unearned privilege, for over 22 years into the Constitutional Democracy, at the expense of the national imperatives, my term has sought to shake the R24 billion Procurement Spend benefiting 98% of the minority groups. The disadvantaged South Africans, who happen to be the majority, benefit only 2% of the R24 Billion Rand; this is absurd in any language. It is a serious concern that we preside over a State Owned Company, which continues to be dominated by one section of the society against the majority who receive crumbs from the R24bn procurement spend. Further, I have taken a dim view of the exclusive  benefits enjoyed by the pilots, as have been exposed in the leaks from SAA by those who are not happy with the Board’s moves to correct the situation. None of these glaring issues have received as much as a whimper from some people. I wonder why it is that certain issues are elevated at the expense of the supremely important issues which have a positive bearing on the envisaged state of nationhood. I am reluctant to state the obvious (that the key issues are being sneezed at owing to the fact that they tinker with the assumed unearned privilege by some). I would have therefore been a revered Chairperson had I protected the status quo; the media would be hoisting me overheads and standing ovation as the most effective Chairperson while poverty, unemployment and inequality continues to affect those in the majority and many downtrodden. My problem results from doing what is right, investigating losses, dealing with corruption and ensuring that we transform the hugely skewed SAA. I therefore respectfully submit that I will not resign. What has not been asked is how SAA found itself into this situation and how the Board has navigated to keep the airline afloat 2. Historical constraints Looking at the history of the SAA in the period 1998 to 2003 in particular, one realises that the decisions taken by erstwhile CEO, management and board, set the tone for the underperformance of the company in the next 18 years. The 2002/03 performance of the SAA realised billions of rands of earnings achieved through fuel hedging contracts. These earnings could not be attributable to operational performance but were a result of mainly currency and fuel price movements, with speculative hedging as the driver. In the subsequent financial year, having achieved huge earnings, the SAA locked itself further in hedging contracts, some of which lasted for up to 10 years. This saw SAA incurring hedging losses in excess of R5bn as the rand unexpectedly strengthened from around R13 to the US dollar to around R6.00 to the  dollar. The Government was therefore compelled to issue guarantees in access of R3 billion to cover SAA’s debts. The SAA’s balance sheet was severely weakened, and as a result Transnet, the former holding company instituted an investigation into the SAA’s hedging activities. This resulted in suspensions and resignations of senior executives including the CFO. The oil hedge losses of 2004 to 2010 are calculated to have amounted to R8 billion. This was under Mr Viljoen, when SAA suffered such losses. SAA has ever since relied on financial support from the shareholder in the form of government guarantees. Equity and reserves continued to be negatively impacted with the concomitant adverse impact on solvency. Some people suddenly found their  loudest voices when they were patently silent when the company was being run down by the “so called” Aviation Experts, who happen to be from America and trusted as they were of colour. a) Today, SAA has settled a debt, which resulted from decisions made in 2000 -  the courts ruled in favour of Nationwide Airline. And I am not there when all the seeds of unprofitability were planted. b) A portion of SAA was sold to SWISS Air, another poor decision which resulted in a fiasco, which purported to privatise SAA in part, another call for the DA. I was not there. c) The Pilot Evergreen Contracts, which consume billions from the revenues, represent a hobbling historical decision. I never signed those contracts, yet the DA finds a scapegoat in me for all these things. 2.1.  Mismanagement Around 1998, SAA sought the services of an American, Mr Coleman Andrews, who then assumed the position of leadership of the airline. It is common knowledge that the Andrews’ era was a clear disaster. Corporate governance and sound business decision- making became a challenge and a risk which continue to erode the value of the business. During this period, SAA paid more than R1-billion (in expenditure) without realising any return for it. There were allegations of nepotism, wasteful expenditure and poor business decisions  with regard to the appointment of consultants, Baine Capital, employment of staff,  including expatriates, and decision-making based on factors beyond the mandate and business imperatives of the SAA. The allegations stemmed from, among others, the disclosure that Andrews, a founding member of Bain Capital, had appointed Bain and Company as consultants to SAA, and had not disclosed this relationship with the consulting firm to the board at the time of his appointment. During this period, the consultant Baine Capital, became the largest recipient of consultant payments from SAA, totaling R243 million. In addition, nine expatriates were employed at a cost of R118 million. The expatriates, who formed the core leadership of SAA between 1998 and 2001, at the expense of local and experienced managers, also enjoyed inflated performance bonuses, although there were no auditable performance measures in place. The majority of appointments of consultants did not comply with the SAA’s tender procedures and PFMA, and no questions about such contraventions. Mr Andrews agreed to pay performance-related fees to the consultants despite the fact that there were no performance measures in place, and also conflicted. In addition, SAA reported profits of R350-million during the Board and former CEO, Coleman Andrews’ tenure. However, it turned out that this reported profit resulted from aircraft sales and lease backs, which had never been the core business of SAA. If this item (aircraft sales) was removed from the books, the SAA showed a loss for that year. Having been stripped of assets including aircraft, SAA’s balance sheet became weaker over time, since the cash realised from the aircraft sales was used to cover operational costs rather than buy assets.SAA had to later seek funding to buy new aircrafts. At the time, there was no identifiable turnaround strategy to be spoken of, other than the stripping and selling of SAA’s assets. This was not profit, but a pure and simple sale of the most prized assets of the airline. It is in this era that SAA switched from sourcing aircrafts from Airbus to Boeing without a fathomable business case advanced. Notwithstanding these disastrous decisions, the board gave Coleman Andrews more than R220-million in earnings during his 20-month stay at SAA – a record-breaking feat viewed against a questionable return on investment and decisions which continue to haunt the future of the airline. Over and above that, Coleman Andrews had contracted Baine Capital Consulting to help turn SAA around, without disclosing that he was part of the same company, as a co-founder. He paid the consulting firm over 200m. To be fair, Mr Andrews didn’t make these decisions on his own, but he had the full Board to support him. It appears, some people are allowed to elevate certain issues to serve certain interest with impunity. If we truly represent the honest interest of this nation, let us ask genuine questions which are informed by the objective issues and circumstances. There are dominant share of voices on SAA issues, but some could be scored zero in relation to the real risks affecting SAA. The issue here is SAA pays for all its fleet, 65. The performance of SAA in the 2014/15 financial year is inextricably linked to the historical performance of the airline of at least the past 18 years. The past three Boards of Directors and management teams of SAA have continued to be constrained by these historical decisions, whose impact continues to permeate the operations of SAA to date. 2.2. Hedging contracts SAA continues to face hedging losses as a result of plummeting global oil prices and currency movements. These can hardly be placed at the doorstep of management and the immediate past Board of Directors. The ripple effects of the past fuel hedging decisions coupled with the weak currency continue to impact adversely SAA’s ability to reap the benefits of low oil prices. Fuel remains SAA’s single biggest variable cost and will remain so for some time to come. 3. Current constraints 3.1. Liquidity constraints In the past financial year, SAA’s ability to raise funding for its operations was severely affected by factors beyond the powers of management and the Board. With a balance sheet that had been severely eroded by past operational and strategic decisions, the SAA could not raise funding. This had, as a result, led to SAA requesting an extension of the guarantee from the shareholder, in itself leading to unjustified views that the SAA was a drain to the fiscus. This was a mistaken belief that SAA received cash transfers from the fiscus; a fallacy willfully peddled by just a few who choose to ignore good efforts. Going forward, it is envisaged that the turnaround strategy will go a long way in not only stabilizing the SAA, but also propelling it to the path of sustainability. Be that as it may, it is critically important to ensure (as the deputy Minister of Finance intimated) that the current Board be given space to lead the SAA to stability. 3.2. Transformation/ Evergreen contracts Transformation relating both to procurement of goods and services for SAA and employment equity remain some of the biggest challenges facing the airline today. The powerful vested interests have used every means available to defend and further entrench their positions to the exclusion of the majority of the people. In the process, the Board, and particularly, current, as Chairperson, have been attacked by various forums including the media. The SAA Pilots’ Association has used every means to resist the attempts to restructure the pilots’ unprecedented evergreen contracts that are a significant drain on the cash-flow of SAA. The pilots are costing the SAA in excess of R600 million per year in excessive guaranteed benefits - constituting a huge chunk of the losses SAA recorded in the financial report table in Parliament on the 20th September 2016. The structure of these agreements is such that even if SAA were to be sold to another shareholder, they(the agreements) would continue to bind the new shareholder. It is a matter of public record that the SAA Pilot’s Association recently petitioned the courts to stop the Board from slashing their benefits. SAA buys cars for Pilots. Yet again this matter, which threatens the sustainability of SAA, is a non-issue for those who continue to attack the airlines leadership. Why? 4. ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE 4.1 It is under our tenure that we resolved to commission an investigation into financial losses of SAA. This has been the most successful intervention, as it has unearthed a lot of historical corruption. The extent is that some people decided to resign than face disciplinary hearings and/or being fired as a consequence. 4.2 It is under our tenure, that we resolved to commission an investigation into procurement, where we discovered that many contracts were as old as 1993, they never get advertised, and they continue to be extended without testing the market and also exploring options for transformation. 4.3 We appointed a Black Chief Pilot for the first time in the 82 years of history of the Airline. 4.4 We continue to find ways to grow the airline, albeit all negative media reportage, but we have managed to expand in Africa, we increased frequencies, and added more routes, such as Abudja in Nigeria, and a new Ghana/Washington Route during our tenure. Route profitability is a key yardstick. Recently we completed a network and fleet review conducted by an international organisation. It is evident that that had SAA been able to introduce new generation aircraft on its international routes these routes would almost immediately turn to profit. I would also like to make the point that SAA is an incredibly efficient operation. Our flights take off and land on time. Our passengers enjoy our superior service and we  lose less baggage today than we regrettably did historically. We are a reliable airline and few would disagree.SAA is revered all over the world and is still the leading Airline on the continent. I urge those members of the society, in particular to refrain from making reckless statements which serve nothing but erode the value for SAA. Any emerging economy, or developing country without its own National Carrier does not progress well economically and in the tourism space. I will be the first one to admit that we have some serious challenges. But we have overcome many more, in a number of key areas and this is illustrated by a measureable improvement. I cannot take credit for these improvements, as an individual, as these results emanate from the efforts of our vision, contribution made by our loyal employees, customer support and suppliers. This airline is not the product of one or a few people but a collective of various teams working in concert with each other. Ultimately, the South African Government who is the sole shareholder. SAA is a proud airline. We facilitate the efficient movement of millions of South Africans and foreign visitors. We all share the responsibility to promote its sustainability and this includes all South Africans. When we are attacked unfairly we dent our valuable image  and brand. I am proud and equally humbled to have been entrusted with the responsibility to serve; I don’t take this for granted and, to this end, I will continue to give my best for the duration of my term as Chairperson. 4. Conclusion As I conclude, I request that the Honourable Member join SAA to root out institutionalized corruption and lack of transformation. SAA has fully subscribed to the OECD and we have rolled out the Anti corruption and bribery compliance workshops into the whole company and its subsidiaries. This is the commitment the Board made and therefore, this should auger well to those who support such actions like our Honourable Member, Mr Maynier, and indeed, we will equally expect support to the Boards Transformation Agenda, to balance the 24 Billion Procurement Spend to benefit poor majority South Africans.

Probably the most visible aspect of the overall bilateral relationship in the last decade between New Delhi and Washington has been in the arena of military-to-military ties. So far, the relationship has had bipartisan support irrespective of changes in governments: since the time the NDA under Atal Bihari Vajpayee made way for two UPA administrations under Manmohan Singh and then to the NDA under Narendra Modi. In the meanwhile, the successive administrations of George Bush (Republican) and Barack Obama (Democrat) have pushed forward the relationship with Obama and Modi overriding concerns in India to clinch the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) this August. US ambassador to India Richard Verma was seeking to highlight the bipartisan support when he said this afternoon after Donald Trump's victory: "The ties that bind our two countries together are built on our shared democratic values, and go beyond the friendship of the American President and the Indian Prime Minister. They go beyond the economic and people-to-people ties. The US-India relationship is vitally important, it is bipartisan, and it is only growing stronger. Here's to another four years of robust US-India Dosti." The military-to-military ties have expanded in the field of exercises. The Malabar series of naval exercises has not only grown more complex but expanded to include Japan. The Yudh Abhyas series between the armies has also been institutionalised and expanded. Indian Air Force contingents have twice participated in the USAF's Red Flag series - said to be the largest for fighter pilots - involving many other friendly countries twice. Many of the deployments for the exercises - particularly the Malabar series for which the US has often deployed aircraft carriers - have been dependent on the US Pacific Command's engagement in waters around and near India. These in turn had increased with Obama's "Asia Pivot" policy that has seen an increased redeployment of US military assets in the region that has often been referred to as the "Indo-Pacific". The "Asia Pivot" was also explained as a rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region after a decade of heavy military involvement in West Asia from Iraq and Afghanistan. In election campaign-mode, Trump had promised to focus increasingly on economic growth within the US while reducing US engagements across the world. Coincidentally, it is also over the same period of extended US engagements that India has concluded more than $10 billion contracts for US weapons and systems for its armed forces. Last year alone, India contracted more than Rs 80,000 crore of contracts for US weapons. This military trade, boosted by the signing of the LEMOA this August, has often so enthused defence planners that there have also been suggestions that India should consider a military relationship with the US that would find a historical parallel in the ties that India and the erstwhile Soviet Union forged after a 1971 Indira Gandhi-Leonid Brezhnev treaty of friendship. That had made India overwhelmingly dependent on Soviet arms, a fact it has been trying to shift course on since the year 2000. But it is in the area of producing weapons and systems in India that New Delhi will be watching where a Trump administration takes the US. Trump has won the elections after advocating a series of Right-wing policies, one of which is that he will not allow American jobs to be taken away. Modi is seeking to align defence production in the country to a "Make in India" policy. Following that, US companies Boeing and Lockheed Martin have offered to transfer production lines for the Super Hornet F/A 18 and the F-17 Block 70 Fighting Falcon wholesale to India, should New Delhi choose one of the aircraft for the requirement projected by the IAF. Even if the offers have been made to India closer to the end of the development cycle of the aircraft, they would still require the US government's backing for the companies to make and execute such an offer. The risk is that would mean a curtailment of jobs in the US facilities and which could be interpreted by Trump's critics to show that he was not being true to his promises. But early signals from the Trump camp indicate that the President-elect is favourably disposed towards continuing and strengthening the defence relationship. "We (a Trump administration) would be looking to strengthen not just the cultural and economic aspect, but also on the defence side there is so much common ground with India. At a time when India's foreign policy is changing because of China and Pakistan, because of Islamic terrorism, we need to be there to greet them with open arms. I think, the Trump administration is ready to do that," PTI quoted Alexander Gray, a military adviser and author of several of the ambitious defence policies of Trump, as saying. Ongoing Indian military contracts to the US include aircraft such as the P8I maritime surveillance planes, C-130J Hercules special missions planes, Harpoon anti-submarine missiles, C-17 Globemaster III strategic transport aircraft, 22 Apache attack and 15 Chinook heavy lift helicopters. A contract for M777 ultra-light howitzers is in the final stages.  More stories in Nation 'Deplorables' have their day ...and some who tried but could not halt the march Hillary greets Donald What will you think of me, a fat, old, blob of an Indian woman?

The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense exchange-traded fund ITA, -0.63%  powered up 4.3% to a record close, with 34 of 37 equity components trading higher. That outperformed the broader stock market, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.75%  rose 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  tacked on 1.4%. See Market Snapshot. Among the companies with the largest market capitalizations, shares of Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC, -1.46%  surged 5.4%, General Dynamics Corp. GD, -1.28%  ran up 5.4% and Raytheon Co. RTN, -1.63%  climbed 7.5%, with closing at all-time highs. “Defense stocks should outperform in what’s likely a tough day in the markets after an election upset,” analyst Jason Gursky at Citigroup wrote in a note to clients. “Why? Because President-elect Trump and the GOP Congress [will] very likely undo sequester, unshackling military spending.” Elsewhere, shares of Boeing Co. BA, -1.25%  gained 2%, United Technologies Corp. UTX, -0.17%  added 1.4%, Lockheed Martin Co. LMT, -0.49%  rallied 6%, Rockwell Collins Inc. COL, -0.43%  advanced 2% and L-3 Communications Holdings Ltd. LLL, -1.13%  shot up 7.7%. World leaders react to Trump victory(2:41) As Russian President Vladimir Putin was among the first to congratulate Donald Trump on his startling election victory, leaders in Europe, NATO and China offered a cautious welcome, calling for the continuation of working relations with the U.S. Photo: Getty Images The sector had been in limbo in the months leading up to the election, with the aerospace & defense ETF trading in a relatively narrow range of $126.07 to $132.73 the past three months. There was some concern that if Democrats won control of the Senate, whether Trump or Hillary Clinton won the election, that military spending would be more difficult to push through Congress. Don’t miss: This map shows election results from every state, county “We’ll let the politicians figure out how to pay for it all without blowing out the debt, but a GOP sweep was the best outcome for defense in this election,” Gursky wrote.

Shares of major defense contractors, including Raytheon Co. , Northrop Grumman Corp and General Dynamics hit lifetime highs, on Wednesday as investors bet on higher Pentagon spending under Trump, who has vowed a massive build-up of the U.S. military even as he pledges to reduce foreign entanglements. While Trump has frequently made contradictory statements when it comes to foreign policy, he has repeatedly called on allies in Europe and East Asia to pay more for their own defense. Defense experts say that could benefit the domestic industry as Trump is expected to keep supporting the supply of U.S. arms exports to allies to help them build up their own defense capabilities. "From the U.S. side it would be us equipping them to do that," said Roman Schweizer an analyst at Cowan & Co. That would also fit with Trump's plan to stimulate the domestic economy by boosting U.S. manufacturing jobs. A Trump administration will have "more openness to selling weapons to our allies and partners. It's business friendly, it plays to the U.S. manufacturing base," said Mark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. U.S. arms exports, measured by production costs, grew 54 percent in 2015 from 2008, the year before President Barack Obama took office, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. That represents the highest growth for any administration since the Truman and Eisenhower presidencies following World War Two. The boom was fueled by consistent lobbying by the Obama administration for arms deals, its policy of arming and training proxy groups in conflicts, and by budget constraints at home that prompted arms makers to look abroad for sales. In 2015, the U.S. accounted for 36 percent of worlds arms exports, the Stockholm Institute's data shows, followed by Russia at 12 percent. That marked an increase in the U.S. share from 28 percent in 2008. In fiscal 2015, U.S. arms sales to foreign governments exceeded $47 billion, up 36 percent from around $34 billion a year earlier, according to the Department of Defense. Saudi Arabia, Australia, Iraq, Korea and Taiwan -- all considered U.S. allies -- were the top five recipients of U.S. weapons in the year ended September 2015. GLOBAL CONFLICTS Trump has never spelled out how he would deploy additional manpower for the U.S. military, such as 60,000 more Army troops, as many as 10,000 more Marines, and dozens of new Navy ships and fighter jets. Independent cost estimates for his plan range from $150 billion to $900 billion in additional spending over 10 years, which could be achieved only by raising the federal budget deficit, raising taxes or making large cuts in spending programs such as healthcare benefits for older Americans. None of these is politically popular, and raising the deficit would face fierce resistance from the deficit-fighting Freedom Caucus wing of the Republican Party. Trump's lack of national security credentials and scarce detail about his possible advisors also make it difficult to assess his impact on foreign policy. Nevertheless, analysts say his call for a stronger U.S. military against the backdrop of rising global conflicts, bodes well for strong revenues. "I think that foreign military sales would absolutely go up, or at the very least stay at its current level," said Franklin Turner, co-leader of law firm McCarter English's government contracts & export controls practice. "I can't imagine that the world becomes a less violent place." Raytheon Co, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, said its international business will continue to grow regardless of the change of administration. During the 2008-2015 period, its international sales grew 55 percent to $7.15 billion. "Raytheon has been in business for over 90 years, over the time we have obviously worked with presidents from both parties," Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien told Reuters in an interview. Lockheed Martin Corp, the Pentagon's No.1 contractor known for its Hellfire missiles and F-35 fighter jets, increased international sales by 74 percent during Obama's presidency to $9.5 billion in 2015. Boeing Co's international defense sales rose 28 percent in the last five years to $9.4 billion in 2015, while Northrop Grumman Corp's foreign sales grew 60 percent over the same period to $3.3 billion. There are two major ways foreign governments purchase arms from U.S. companies. Direct commercial sales, negotiated between a government and a company; and foreign military sales, where a foreign government typically contacts a Department of Defense official at the U.S. embassy in their capital. Both require approval by the U.S. government. Some major sales have been held up by members of Congress, who fear U.S. arms could be used to fuel foreign conflicts, quell popular unrest or facilitate human rights violations. Congress has oversight over major weapons sales, including those that are completely or partly financed by the U.S. government, and it is highly unusual for sales to go ahead if there are strong objections from lawmakers. "Congress has never been a rubber stamp on arms transfers. We exercise close oversight and will continue to do so under the next president," said Representative Eliot Engel, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington, said the government and companies often are not "paying sufficient attention to the long-term impact of weaponizing key regions" while trying to sell to "win friends and allies." "When several warring states in a region are being amply supplied with new weapons, they are more tempted to use those weapons," Kimball said.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen U.S. president-elect Donald Trump’s victory was a surprise, and bank economists aren’t sure what it means or what comes next, reports from the major banks said Wednesday morning. CIBC and BMO economists both saw the biggest concern as cross-border trade, given Trump’s strong protectionist positions on the campaign trail.

READ MORE: Reality check: Could Donald Trump pull the plug on NAFTA? It’s not as easy as he says “Mr. Trump’s concerns about globalization are mostly focused on low-cost producers like China and Mexico, but tearing up NAFTA would leave Canada in a vulnerable position,” wrote CIBC World Markets economists Royce Mendes and Avery Shenfeld. Canada and the U.S. could revert to a version of NATFA that leaves Mexico out, but U.S. protectionism could easily turn against Canadian exports.  “The election result clearly raises a lot of uncertainties for Canadian companies reliant on the American market.” In a conference call Wednesday, BMO chief economist Douglas Porter called  trade “probably the biggest area of concern from an economic standpoint.” READMORE: Mexico begins laying groundwork for relationship with president-elect Donald Trump “While Congress will try to blunt his worst impulses, it is an area where the president has a fair degree of power. He can impose temporary tariffs of up to 15 per cent, and he does have the power to pull out of some trade deals.” “We’re going to take a wait-and see stance, and see whether his tough talk actually translates into real action.” In a separate report, BMO Capital Markets predicted an upside for Canadian oil producers if the Keystone XL pipeline is approved, which seems more likely with Republican control of both houses of Congress and the White House. READ MORE: Sask. Premier Brad Wall says Trump win means Canada should stop carbon tax, hopeful for Keystone pipeline The CIBC report took a bullish view of the defence sector and gold under Trump: Defence could be boosted by increases in U.S. military spending and by other NATO countries feeling pressured to increase defence spending, the report predicted. (In fact, stocks in defence contractors like General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Boeing were up in morning trading Wednesday.) Gold is “… looking like a big winner too, at least in the near-term.” “Precious metals will see inflows as a result of their safe-haven status, that is until investors become more comfortable with this unexpected election outcome.” READ MORE: What President Donald Trump will mean for Canada “While the changes in policy might not be as drastic as the platform he ran on, this was an unexpected outcome and will likely lead to sharp movements in asset prices.” Porter wasn’t willing to predict how a Trump presidency would affect markets on either side of the border. “Clearly, the result was not what the market was looking for,” he said. WATCH: The U.S. dollar sank and stocks have plummeted in market mayhem as investors faced up to a shock win for Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election that could upend the global political order. Sonia Legg reports. “In the past, we’ve seen many apparently extreme events that the markets react heavily to which have little or no economic impact on the overall environment. We believe that it’s extremely dicey to leap to conclusions about what the election means for the outlook at this early stage.” After an initial shock as traders reacted to Trump’s presidential victory, which was not widely predicted, markets stabilized on Wednesday. On the TSX Wednesday, gold companies were among the biggest gainers. Two of Canada’s biggest producers, Barrick Gold and Goldcorp, were up about three and five per cent. Among the biggest losers were forestry and manufacturing companies dependent on cross-border trade, including several B.C. lumber producers and Ontario-based auto parts manufacturers. Meanwhile, energy companies on the Toronto market were seeing an uptick because Republicans’ policies on oil are much more friendlier than those of the outgoing administration. -With files from the Canadian Press © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Markets' reaction to the election (AP)—Major U.S. stock indexes moved higher this afternoon as Wall Street sized up the implications of Donald Trump's stunning presidential election victory. The solid gains marked a reversal from earlier in the day, when global stock markets were roiled after it became clear that Trump had sealed the win over Hillary Clinton. Markets had been jittery in recent weeks over the prospect of a Trump administration. But conciliatory comments from the president-elect helped global stock markets recover a large chunk of their earlier losses. MORE ON THE ELECTION: • President Trump . . . and a slightly less powerful Mike Madigan • GOP's Senate victory sets stage for Trump Supreme Court, agenda • Why Trump's win could boost Caterpillar, Deere On Wall Street, financial companies led the gainers, surging 3.2 percent. Banks and other financial stocks tend to benefit from higher interest rates and less government regulation, two things investors anticipate could happen during a Trump presidency. Health care stocks were also heading sharply higher. Traders had feared Clinton would implement curbs on drug pricing increases that could hurt drugmakers and biotechnology companies. Utilities were down the most, sliding 2.6 percent, followed closely by consumer-focused stocks. Crude oil prices headed higher after being down earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up almost 257 points, or 1.4 percent, this afternoon, to nearly 18,590. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose about 24 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at just over 2,163. The Nasdaq composite index rose about 58 points, or 1.1 percent, closing at just over 5,251. A sell-off in bonds sent prices tumbling, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.08 percent from 1.86 percent late yesterday, a large move. That's the highest the rate has been since January. That rate is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders are selling bonds to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under a Trump administration, said Tom di Galoma, managing director of trading at Seaport Global Securities. "People are starting to believe that Donald Trump is good for the economy, which makes him not so good for the bond market," di Galoma said. "You've also had the stock market come back overnight. People are starting to realize that a Trump presidency is not the end of the world." Though uncertainty remains over Trump's trade, immigration and geopolitical policies and what his victory means for the future of globalization, investors appeared somewhat calmed by his victory speech, in which he praised Clinton and urged Americans to "come together as one united people" after a divisive campaign. "While Trump slightly soothed some concerns in his victory speech, uncertainty remains over what kind of a U.S. he plans to lead," said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA. Here's how some industries shook out: WINNERS: —Drugmakers. Pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefits managers rose sharply on the expectation that Trump and a Republican-controlled congress are less likely to crack down on rising drug prices. Pfizer jumped 7 percent, Celgene rose 9 percent and Express Scripts gained 7 percent. — Defense contractors and infrastructure companies. Hopes that Trump will spend more on defense and follow through on campaign promises to boost spending on infrastructure benefited several companies. Raytheon jumped 7 percent. So did Caterpillar, a heavy machinery maker. — Private prison operators. Clinton had said she wanted states to stop using privately operated prisons. That threat is now diminished. Corrections Corp. of America jumped 50 percent, and Geo Group rose 21 percent. — Coal: Trump's election breathed fresh life into an industry struggling with debt and the worst price slump in decades. Coal tycoon Robert Murray said in a statement that the election marked a “great day for America” and he looked forward to a national policy that puts all energy sources on a level playing field. Bonds of his company, Murray Energy Corp., surged to their highest in 16 months. — Steelmakers: U.S. Steel and Nucor soared as Trump's promise to favor American manufacturers led investors to believe that domestic prices for the metal will increase. Nucor gained the most in more than seven years; U.S. Steel climbed more than 20 percent. LOSERS: —Gun companies. With his endorsement from the National Rifle Association, Trump is seen as far less likely to push for stricter gun control measures than Clinton would have been. That means investors are no longer expecting a rush of gun sales due to nervous customers looking to stay ahead of government restrictions. Smith & Wesson dropped 15 percent and Sturm, Ruger plunged 14 percent. — Hospital chains and certain insurers. Companies that benefited from President Obama's health care legislation, the Affordable Care Act, took heavy losses. Trump has said he would repeal the law. The nation's largest hospital chain, HCA, plunged 15 percent, and Community Health Systems plunged 29 percent. — Clean energy. Trump has advocated for lighter regulation of oil and coal companies, which could hamper demand for clean energy alternatives, such as solar and wind power. SunPower sank 15 percent. — Aircraft deals: Trump's ascension raised doubts about the sales and leases of as many as 230 Boeing and Airbus Group SE jetliners to Iranian carriers. Renewed trade restrictions could unravel the transactions, valued at an estimated $17.6 billion for Boeing and $27 billion for Airbus, based on list prices. In Europe, Germany's DAX was up 1.6 percent, while France's CAC-40 gained 1.5 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 1 percent higher. As Trump gained the lead in the electoral vote count, share prices tumbled in Asia, which were open during the election results. By the time Trump was confirmed the winner and made his speech, financial markets had steadied. The dollar also recouped some ground, while assets that many investors search out at times of uncertainty, such as gold, came off earlier highs. One currency that remained heavily sold is the Mexican peso. It was down 8.4 percent as the prospect of a wall along the United States' southern border, a key campaigning point for Trump, has come one step closer to reality. Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The U.S. currency rose sharply to 19.75 Mexican pesos from 18.68 pesos. Also potentially impacting the peso is Trump's threat to rip up trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, a key plank in Mexico's economic strategy and growth. "If Trump is able to follow through with these suggestions, Mexican activity will suffer greatly," said Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank International. Trump doesn't formally take the reins of power until January but he will begin the transition to his presidency almost immediately. In the coming weeks, investors will be looking to see if he further tempers some of the rhetoric that polarized American opinion and often spooked investors in financial markets. Another point of interest will center on the U.S.'s trade relations with China and its impact across Asia. Trump's victory has raised concerns that the U.S. and China might embark on a trade war of sorts and that protectionism around the world will grow. Those concerns weighed heavily on Asian stocks. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 5.4 percent lower, recouping some losses. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed 2.2 percent lower. Bloomberg contributed.

Shares of Northrop, Raytheon <RTN.N> and General Dynamics <GD.N> hit intraday lifetime highs after gapping higher at the opening.

The government-owned carrier has recently issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the purpose of selecting a consulting entity that has expertise in airlines sector in this regard. Air India, which has reported an operating profit of Rs 105 crore for the fiscal ended March 2016, the first time since Indian Airlines merged with it in 2007, is staying afloat on a Rs 30,000 crore government bailout. "The consulting firm shall review existing internal processes and prepare business plan strategy for short and long-term (10 years), engagement would also include benchmarking as per industry standards," Air India said in the RFP document. Besides, the firm would also carry out gap analysis, recommendations for changes and detailed implementation blue print, keeping in mind current and future market scenario, handhold Air India in implementing these plans, it said. Air India along with its two subsidiaries --Air India Express and Alliance Air -- at present has a fleet of over 130 aircraft in its fleet, comprising Airbus, Boeing, ATR and CRJ planes. The airline commands 14.7 per cent market share in the domestic air space. In addition, the carrier plans to add another 100 planes in its fleet, including smaller ones for the regional connectivity over the next four years, to take on the competition in the fast growing domestic market, which is seeing over 20 per cent growth for nearly two years now. In 2012, the then UPA government had granted over Rs 30,000 crore to Air India under a turnaround and financial restructuring plan, stretching over a period of nine years, to turn around the company.

Aviana Holdings is the parent of seven Latin American passenger airlines including Colombian flag carrier Avianca and air-freight carrier Avianca Cargo. Avianca’s total operating revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion, down 4.9% year-over-year (YOY). Operating expenses fell 3.1% YOY to $978.8 million. The company’s operating income for the quarter was $83.4 million, up 15.7% compared to $72.1 million in 3Q 2015, with an operating margin of 7.9%, up 1.4 point YOY.  Avianca said the results were driven by lower operating costs as the company benefited from its revised hedging policy, reducing expenses by nearly $30 million compared to 3Q 2015. Fuel expenses were down 19.3% YOY. The company also cut maintenance and repairs expenses 16.6% YOY, following a reduction in fleet re-delivery provisions as well as a decline in engine overhaul expenses. “While we continue to experience some political and macroeconomic uncertainty in several markets throughout Latin America during the third quarter of 2016, Avianca benefited from welcome oil price stability as well as exchange rate steadiness in key markets,” Avianca Holdings CEO Hernán Rincón said. “[This] stability has fueled renewed demand on both the international and domestic fronts. Growth in terms of ASKs has been leveled throughout our network, at around 3% [to 12 billion ASKs] … [and] passenger traffic numbers, measured in RPK, grew by 5.9% [to 10 billion RPKs]… driven by steady demand in our home markets and strong sales for our international routes,” Rincón said. “In particular, the services from Bogota to Buenos Aires, Los Angeles, London and Madrid all registered load factors above 85%. As such, the 83.5% load factor registered this quarter across the network is the strongest since the integration between AVIANCA and TACA.” To accommodate increased demand the airline increased its frequencies to the Iberian Peninsula from 21 to 35 weekly frequencies, Rincó said. The company served 7.6 million passengers during the quarter, up 3.2%. Yield fell 7.1% to 9.5 cents; PRASK was down 4.6% to 7.7 cents. Avianca took delivery of two Boeing 787-8s and one Airbus A319 during the quarter.  As of Sept. 30, Avianca Holdings and its subsidiaries operating fleet totaled 177 aircraft, comprised of 110 A320 family aircraft, 15 ATR 72s, 11 Cessna 208s, 10 Embraer E190s, nine A330s, nine 787s, five A330F and four A300F cargo aircraft, two ATR-42s, and two 767F freighters. In his 3Q CEO message, Rincón announced the appointment of Roberto Held Otero as the company’s new CFO, effective Nov. 1, replacing Gerardo Grajeles, who will now head Avianca’s new strategic business unit.

The government-owned carrier has recently issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the purpose of selecting a consulting entity that has expertise in airlines sector in this regard. Air India, which has reported an operating profit of Rs 105 crore for the fiscal ended March 2016, the first time since Indian Airlines merged with it in 2007, is staying afloat on a Rs 30,000 crore government bailout. “The consulting firm shall review existing internal processes and prepare business plan strategy for short and long-term (10 years), engagement would also include benchmarking as per industry standards,” Air India said in the RFP document. Besides, the firm would also carry out gap analysis, recommendations for changes and detailed implementation blue print, keeping in mind current and future market scenario, handhold Air India in implementing these plans, it said.

Shane Kimbrough, the sole American astronaut aboard the International Space Station, cast his vote Monday via a digital version of the familiar federal absentee ballot. By Rowena Lindsay, Staff November 8, 2016 Save for later Saved US astronaut Shane Kimbrough, a member of the main crew to the International Space Station (ISS), talks to his relatives prior to the launch of the Soyuz MS-02 space ship, in Russian leased Baikonur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, Oct. 19. Ivan Sekretarev/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Every four years, millions of American voters both abroad and at home US cast their ballot for president without going to the polls, mailing in absentee ballots to vote from afar. And a few ballots digitally make the 250-mile journey from the International Space Station to the Earth's surface.  This year, Shane Kimbrough, currently the only American in space, cast his ballot from the International Space Station (ISS) Monday. Kate Rubins also voted early, submitting her ballot before returning to Earth last week after a four-month stint on the ISS. For the purposes of voting, the astronauts’ address is listed as “low-Earth orbit.” The "voting process starts a year before launch, when astronauts are able to select which elections (local/state/federal) that they want to participate in while in space," NASA officials said recently in a blog post. "Then, six months before the election, astronauts are provided with a standard form: the 'Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot Request – Federal Post Card Application.' " Recommended: Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Johnson Space Center sends a digital version of the classic absentee ballot to the ISS and when crewmembers have filled them out the ballots are sent directly to voting authorities, according to Johnson Space Center officials. Test your knowledge Could you pass Astronomy 101? Take the quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 The first American to vote in space was David Wolf in 1997, who voted from the Russian Mir Space Station. Since most astronauts lived near Houston, Texas passed a law allowing astronauts to vote while off planet in any local, state, or federal elections scheduled during their mission. "I think it's pretty amazing," Dr. Rubins said in an October interview for NASA's weekly "Space to Ground" ISS update. "It's very incredible that we're able to vote from up here, and I think it's incredibly important for us to vote in all of the elections." Their votes are particularly important because the two candidates have very different views on the future of America’s space program. Donald Trump has said he will encourage joint projects between NASA and private space companies, such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Blue Origin, but that public money is more needed in infrastructure here on Earth than on Mars. And while the Republican nominee has spoken highly of NASA, he has said that economic stability and military defense must come first. "If we are growing with all of our people employed and our military readiness back to acceptable levels, then we can take a look at the timeline for sending more people into space," Trump told Mic. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has said that she wanted to be an astronaut as a child and even wrote to NASA about what the requirements were only to be told that they were not currently accepting applications from women. In addition to promising to declassify government information on UFOs, Clinton has said that she supports private space companies but feels that the future of cosmological discoveries lies with NASA and its funding should reflect that.

Emirates Group H1 profits slide 64pc to $364m DUBAI, 6 days ago The Emirates Group today reported a net profit of Dh1.3 billion ($364 million) for the first six months of its 2016-17 financial year, down 64 per cent compared to the same period last year. The group held steady on revenue, but profit was hit by the double impact of a strong US dollar and challenging operating environment for the airline and travel business, it said. The Emirates Group revenue was Dh46.5 billion ($12.7 billion) for the first six months of its 2016-17 financial year, up 1 per cent from Dh46 billion ($12.5 billion) during the same period last year. The group’s cash position on 30th September 2016 was at Dh14.9 billion ($4.1 billion), compared to Dh23.5 billion ($6.4 billion) as at 31st March 2016. This is due to ongoing investments mainly into new aircraft, airline related infrastructure projects, business acquisitions, and the repayments of bonds totalling Dh4.1 billion ($1.1 billion), loans and lease liabilities, the group said. “Our performance for the first half of the 2016-17 financial year continues to be impacted by the strong US dollar against other major currencies. Increased competition, as well as the sustained economic and political uncertainty in many parts of the world has added downward pressure on prices as well as dampened travel demand,” said Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, chairman and chief executive, Emirates Airline and Group. He added: “The bleak global economic outlook appears to be the new norm, with no immediate resolution in sight. Against this backdrop, the Group has remained profitable and our solid business foundations continue to stand us in good stead. In the first six months of this year, both Emirates and dnata continued to grow in capability and capacity. Our past investments in product and services are now paying off, enabling us to retain valued clients and attract new customers - reflected in the airline’s passenger growth of 2.3 million. We continue to make strategic investments, because we know we have to work even harder for every customer, and make every dollar spent go even further through innovation and driving efficiency across our business.” In the past six months, the Group continued to develop and expand its employee base, increasing its overall staff count to over 103,000, a 9 per cent increase compared with March 31. This was mainly due to recent acquisitions in dnata businesses, and also required support for Emirates’ growing fleet. Emirates airline Emirates continues to invest in the most advanced wide-body aircraft to improve overall efficiency and provide better customer experience. During the first six months of the financial year, Emirates received 16 wide-body aircraft – 8 Airbus A380s, and 8 Boeing 777s, with 20 more new aircraft scheduled to be delivered before the end of the financial year. It also retired 19 older aircraft from its fleet with further 8 to be returned by March 31, 2017. Overall capacity during the first six months of the year increased 9 per cent to 30.2 billion Available Tonne Kilometres (ATKM). Capacity measured in Available Seat Kilometres (ASKM), grew by 12 per cent, whilst passenger traffic carried measured in Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPKM) was up 8 per cent with average Passenger Seat Factor dropping to 75.3 per cent, compared with last year’s 78.3 per cent. Emirates carried 28.0 million passengers between April 1 and September 30, up 9 per cent from the same period last year. The volume of cargo uplifted remained stable at 1.3 million tonnes, a solid performance in a challenging air freight market. In the first half of the 2016-17 financial year, Emirates net profit is Dh786 million ($214 million), down 75 per cent, following one of the airline’s best half-year performances during the same period last year. Emirates revenue, including other operating income, of Dh41.9 billion ($11.4 billion) was slightly down by 1 per cent compared with Dh42.3 billion ($11.5 billion) recorded last year. This is due to the unfavourable currency environment - where the US dollar continued to strengthen against most other major currencies; and increased competition resulting in lower average fares. The airline was also impacted by currency devaluation and hard currency shortage in some African countries, as well as dampened travel demand due to the ongoing economic malaise and looming security concerns across major markets in its network, it said. Emirates operating costs grew by 5 per cent against the overall capacity increase of 9 per cent. On average, fuel costs were 10 per cent\ lower compared to the same period last year. However, fuel remained the largest component of the airline’s cost, accounting for 24 per cent of operating costs compared with 28 per cent in the first six months of last year. Dnata Dnata continued to strengthen its global businesses which now span 83 countries. In the first half of 2016-17, dnata’s international operations accounted for over 67 per cent of its total revenue. Dnata’s revenue, including other operating income, is Dh6 billion ($1.6 billion), a robust 14 per cent increase compared to Dh5.2 billion ($1.4 billion) last year.  - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Emirates | profit | Revenue | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Agilysys opens new office to serve EMEA customers Al Faisaliah Hotel summit to feature Como Hotels chef Mövenpick Hotels Jordan wins two top awards Oman Air concludes a successful WTM London GCC airlines should change how they market and sell to customers - study Dine with a difference at Jumeirah Messilah Beach Hotel & Spa Emirates boosts fleet with new A380, B777 aircraft Turkish Airlines offers GCC passengers special fares to Europe Busy Rooms, Thomas Cook ink strategic agreement 158,714 hotels rooms 'under contract' in ME 90pc of US,UK theme park guests want pre-booking-survey RJ, AccesRail ink key agreement Indonesia first SE Asian nation to announce Dubai Expo participation Hack your way into a flight upgrade Abu Dhabi residents get a glimpse of Korean culture Passenger traffic at DWC surges 161pc in Q3 Aviator Lifestyle to participate at Big Boys Toys exhibition First Group breaks ground on 34-storey Dubai hotel tower Etihad receives top recognition Emirates passengers can get UAE visa via mobile app New sales head for Le Méridien Dubai Hotel & Conference Centre Qatar Airways fined by US for flying over 'prohibited airspace' VR, robots to become the future of theme parks Gulf Air adds Colombo to destination network Air Arabia Q3 net profit up 26pc Trump effect dampens ME tourism to the US Al Futtaim, InterCon ink deal for UAE's largest Holiday Inn Family-friendly staycation at Emirates Park Zoo and Resort Mövenpick Hotel West Bay Doha wins two top honours Emirates Skywards adds The Wall Street Journal to partner list Calendar of Events View all events Tools Exchange Rates Weather Forecast BBC World Service Ads Sectors | Information | About Us | Construction & Real Estate Energy, Oil & Gas Finance & Capital Market Industry & Logistics IT & Telecommunication Health & Environment Motoring Retail & Wholesale Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Government & Laws Media & Promotion Back to top Trade News Newsletter Events Business Directory TradeArabia Network Advertising Contact Feedback Privacy Statement Terms of Service Web Feeds

The Dubai government-controlled carrier said in an e-mailed statement that its revenue, including other operating income, of 11.4 billion dollars was down by 1 percent compared with 11.5 billion dollars recorded last year. "This is due to the unfavourable currency environment - where the US dollar continued to strengthen against most other major currencies, and increased competition resulting in lower average fares," said the airline. The airline was also impacted by currency devaluation and hard currency shortage in some African countries, as well as decreased travel demand due to the ongoing economic slump, the statement added. Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emirates Airline and Group added that "increased competition, as well as the sustained economic and political uncertainty in many parts of the world has added downward pressure on prices as well as dampened travel demand." He also said that "Against this backdrop, the Group has remained profitable and our solid business foundations continue to stand us in good stead." Earlier last month, Emirate Airline President Sir Tim Clark said the Brexit referendum on June 23 in the United Kingdom led to some repercussions on the airline's operations as well, and that the carrier was considering reducing services to destinations in Africa. During the first six months of the financial year, Emirates received 16 wide-body aircraft comprised of eight Airbus A380s, and eight Boeing 777s, with 20 more new aircraft scheduled for delivery before the end of the financial year. Furthermore, the airline retired 19 older aircraft from its fleet with a further eight to be returned by 31 March 2017. Emirates expanded its global route network by launching passenger services to four new destinations including Yinchuan and Zhengzhou in China, Yangon in Myanmar, and Hanoi in Vietnam. As of 30 Sept. Emirates' global network spanned 155 destinations in 82 countries, with Fort Lauderdale to come online on 15 December 2016. Emirates has 248 planes in operation, three less than a year ago. On August 4, 2016, Emirates lost a Boeing 777 passenger plane flying from Thiruvananthapuram, India, to Dubai, which crashed during an emergency landing in Dubai International Airport, killing one firefighter during the rescue operations. The 300 passengers including 18 crew onboard managed to escape the blaze and were unharmed however.

X Irish-based Apollo Aviation to get $640m securitising 35 aircraft Aircraft finance specialist to manage and service transaction through subsidiary Wed, Nov 9, 2016, 07:00 Barry O'Halloran The 35 aircraft Apollo Aviation is securitising are leased to carriers such as American Airlines, Virgin and Viva Aerobús. Photograph: Mike Fuentes/Bloomberg         Irish-based aircraft finance specialist Apollo Aviation will realise $640 million from the securitisation of 35 aircraft leased to carriers such as American Airlines, Virgin and Viva Aerobús. The aircraft lessor, with offices in Dublin, Miami and Singapore, is establishing Apollo Aviation Securitisation Equity Trust 2016-2, which will borrow $640 million to buy 35 craft from the company and a number of third parties. It will borrow the cash in a series of tranches and secure it against the aircraft, which will remain on lease to their airlines. The company will manage and service the transaction through a subsidiary, Apollo Aviation Management. Aircraft lessors frequently securitise their craft by transferring them to special-purpose vehicles that raise the money to buy the aircraft from the capital markets. The exercise allows lessors to cash in on their assets. Third securitisation Apollo’s latest deal is the second securitisation that it will have completed this year and the third overall since it was founded in 2002. The craft involved are a mix of Boeing and Airbus manufactured aircraft that are used mainly for short-haul flights. The carriers to which they are leased include American Airlines, Virgin America, India’s SpiceJet, Air Berlin and Mexico’s Viva Aerobús, the company in which Irish businessman Declan Ryan’s Irlandia Aviation is selling its 49 per cent stake. Standard & Poors and Kroll are expected to give the loans taken out by the securitisation ratings between A and BBB, implying a low risk of default. Apollo’s chairman, William Hoffman, said the company was continuing to build on its position as a premier aviation asset manager.       Topics: Declan Ryan William Hoffman TRUST A Air Berlin Airbus American Airlines Apollo Group Bbb Boeing Irlandia Aviation Spicejet Virgin Virgin America Viva Aerobus Dublin(IE) India Mexico Miami Singapore Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Technology Snapchat has secretly filed for flotation, sources claim Personal Finance The bond rout and Irish pension savers: what you need to be aware of Golf Rory McIlroy focusing on Major improvement in 2017 Ireland The top five spots in Dublin to go for a walk with the kids Sponsored World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

(Katie G. Cotterill / The Seattle Times) As Donald Trump appeared headed toward the presidency, what started out as a hopeful, even celebratory night in Democrat-dominated Washington turned toward despair. Share story By David Gutman Seattle Times staff reporter As Donald Trump appeared headed toward the presidency in a stunning rebuke to pollsters and political forecasting, what started out as a hopeful, even celebratory night in Democratic-dominated Washington turned toward despair. The Associated Press called Washington state for Hillary Clinton not long after the polls closed — she led 56 to 38 percent in the Tuesday count. But the rest of the country appeared a lot more like Eastern Washington — nearly every county east of the Cascade Mountains voted in lockstep for Trump — than like the deep-blue Puget Sound region. LOCAL REACTION The state Democratic Party was serving blue vodka cocktails dubbed “The Madam President” at its election night party at the Westin in downtown Seattle.   Full local, national results Mayor: Seattle will remain sanctuary city for immigrants despite Trump Jonathan Martin | There wasn't a 'Trump effect' in Washington What does Trump’s election mean, how will it impact the country? Clinton on pace to win popular vote, despite losing election Pot legalization marches ahead; Trump calls it ‘state issue’ Republicans celebrate under Puget Sound area's blue bubble Seattle reacts to Trump’s victory: ‘Shocked, strangely unfazed’ Danny Westneat | The year the white man roared Jon Talton | The economic consequences of President Trump Jerry Large | Voters who lost must stay engaged now more than ever As swing state after swing state began to tilt Trump, the crowd looked stunned. The mood grew darker. A brass band did little to lift the crowd’s spirits. “We thought it would feel different at this point,” said Maggie Carr of Seattle. Across Lake Washington, at the GOP event at the Hyatt Regency Bellevue, it was just the opposite. “What you are seeing tonight is the anger in the country, the silent majority has spoken up,” said Kay Meyers, 72, of Mukilteo. “We will have a major change with Donald Trump.” Many attendees wore stickers ironically identifying themselves as “deplorables,” in reference to a September remark by Clinton caught on tape at a private fundraiser. Susan Hutchison, chairman of the state Republican Party and one of the few prominent Washington Republicans to wholeheartedly support Trump, was ebullient. “We had no idea what would happen. We hoped and we prayed,” she said. “They took a chance on a guy they didn’t know instead of a woman they know all too well.” Befitting a divided nation, AMC Theaters held partisan viewing parties in 25 cities across the country — Democrats watching in one theater, Republicans in another. At the pro-Trump theater, the AMC Southcenter in Tukwila, only eight people showed up. As the night wore on, and the pollsters kept being proved wrong, the Republicans’ cheers kept growing. Anthony Catalfamo, 38, of Auburn, a materials processor at Boeing, was there with his wife, Alexes, 33. “I’m a team leader and a union steward,” he said. “Almost everyone I know is for Trump.” Trump famously called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Khalid Lites, an Army veteran and Muslim American, watched the results come in with his wife and three young children in his Shoreline home. A Clinton supporter, he said he was alarmed by a Trump presidency, but dismissed the Muslim ban as a campaign tactic. “If he wins office, obviously he’s going to have to change his rhetoric completely,” Lites said. “I’m compelled, not only by my faith, to show respect to one another, but also as an American. So I wish and I pray that in days to come we can try to find some common ground.” At Fall City Firearms in Redmond, owner Lee Stallman favored Trump — citing his support of gun rights and his hard-line stance on immigration — but had been preparing for Clinton. More than 100 recently acquired rifles cluttered the alleys of his shop. He’s been stocking up, anticipating a rush in demand if Clinton, who is perceived as anti-gun, was elected. “He’s obviously boisterous and crass sometimes, but I agree with what he says,” Stallman said. “I told my wife, either we win politically or we win as a merchant.” As the results came in, Emma Kates-Shaw started hyperventilating, in a near panic attack. She walked to Capitol Hill’s Wildrose bar to “to be with people who feel the pain like I do.” She pointed at MSNBC’s electoral map. “It’s like a blue exterior with a red interior, groups of people who aren’t even talking to each other,” she said. “We’re so, so divided now, we can’t even have a conversation.” Seattle Times staff writers Angel Gonzalez, Lynda Mapes, Erik Lacitis, Nina Shapiro, Katherine Long and Brendan Kiley contributed to this report.

23:32 ET Share this article LONDON, Nov. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- "Rising need for precision weapons and increasing demand of laser weapons in naval forces are the major factors expected to drive the growth of the directed energy weapons market in near future." The directed energy weapons market is expected to grow from USD 6.87 billion in 2016 to USD 24.45 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 28.90% from 2016 to 2021. The growth of the market is expected to be driven by several factors, such as increasing demand of laser weapons in naval forces, change in nature of warfare from conventional to urban warfare, and increasing demand for non-lethal deterrents, among others. However, high cost of development of directed energy weapons and susceptibility to degradation by environment may restrain the growth of the market in the coming years. "Lethal segment to witness higher growth during the forecast period" The key products considered in the directed energy weapons market are lethal and non-lethal weapons.

 Here's how an American astronaut cast his vote from space Rowena Lindsay, Christian Science Monitor Nov. 8, 2016, 7:42 PM 10,677 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shane Kimbrough Ivan Sekretarev/AP Photo Every four years, millions of American voters both abroad and at home US cast their ballot for president without going to the polls, mailing in absentee ballots to vote from afar. And a few ballots digitally make the 250-mile journey from the International Space Station to the Earth's surface.  This year, Shane Kimbrough, currently the only American in space, cast his ballot from the International Space Station (ISS) Monday. Kate Rubins also voted early, submitting her ballot before returning to Earth last week after a four-month stint on the ISS. For the purposes of voting, the astronauts’ address is listed as “low-Earth orbit.” The "voting process starts a year before launch, when astronauts are able to select which elections (local/state/federal) that they want to participate in while in space," NASA officials said recently in a blog post. "Then, six months before the election, astronauts are provided with a standard form: the 'Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot Request – Federal Post Card Application.' " Johnson Space Center sends a digital version of the classic absentee ballotto the ISS and when crewmembers have filled them out the ballots are sent directly to voting authorities, according to Johnson Space Center officials. The first American to vote in space was David Wolf in 1997, who voted from the Russian Mir Space Station. Since most astronauts lived near Houston, Texas passed a law allowing astronauts to vote while off planet in any local, state, or federal elections scheduled during their mission. Michael Reaves/Getty Images "I think it's pretty amazing," Dr. Rubins said in an October interview for NASA's weekly "Space to Ground" ISS update. "It's very incredible that we're able to vote from up here, and I think it's incredibly important for us to vote in all of the elections." Their votes are particularly important because the two candidates have very different views on the future of America’s space program. Donald Trump has said he will encourage joint projects between NASA and private space companies, such as SpaceX, Boeing, and Blue Origin, but that public money is more needed in infrastructure here on Earth than on Mars. And while the Republican nominee has spoken highly of NASA, he has said that economic stability and military defense must come first. "If we are growing with all of our people employed and our military readiness back to acceptable levels, then we can take a look at the timeline for sending more people into space," Trump told Mic. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton has said that she wanted to be an astronaut as a child and even wrote to NASA about what the requirements were only to be told that they were not currently accepting applications from women. In addition to promising to declassify government information on UFOs, Clinton has said that she supports private space companies but feels that the future of cosmological discoveries lies with NASA and its funding should reflect that.

Related News/Archive County sale of 'surplus' property will bring several changes to Istachatta 3 Months Ago Pinellas County buys 7 acres of Lealman property for affordable housing 8 Months Ago Amazon property in Ruskin sells for $103.6 million, biggest industrial sale in Tampa Bay history 5 Months Ago With a $10.1 million price, the county and Industrial Realty Group are working to finalize the sale of the Young-Rainey Science, Technology and Research, or STAR Center, a 96-acre manufacturing and technology campus the county owns on Bryan Dairy Road. The Los Angeles firm manages more than 120 properties in 28 states, with more than 100 million square feet of rentable space. The firm specializes in turning shuttered military bases and industrial complexes into centers that attract jobs from national corporations. Three of IRG's projects under way in Ohio are estimated to be worth $1 billion. County commissioners voted 5-1 in late September to sell the property that went on the market last year. The federal government gave the complex to Pinellas County in 1995. "Our rich Uncle Sam gave us a gift 21 years ago," County Administrator Mark Woodard told the commissioners. "The facility is about as good as it will ever be. It is pure profit." The proceeds from the sale could come in the first quarter of 2017 and would be applied to economic development. County leaders would then hold workshops to discuss the best ways to spend the money. The complex currently features eight buildings totaling nearly 662,000 square feet and about 7 acres of developable land. IRG would have to honor the current leases of the 30 tenants, including Raytheon, which develops and produces communication devices. Raytheon accounts for most of the jobs on the site and has leasing options for up to 18 years. The proposed deal could also bring the county an additional $750,000 each time Raytheon renews a lease every five years before 2032. A building's reserve fund of $1.5 million would also go back to redevelopment, officials said. Currently, Raytheon accounts for about 1,000 of the 1,200 jobs on the property. Two developers bid on the proposal, and both were within $80,000 of each other. A drawback to keeping the building is future repairs could cost $7 million, said economic development director Mike Meidel. He estimated the facility's economic impact each year at about $100 million, including payroll and taxes. The county expects to pay about $50,000 in closing costs. "The facility is really only worth what a buyer is willing to pay," Meidel said. Commissioner Karen Seel voted against the sale and feared the developer would flip the property to another buyer. "I just don't think we got the price that we deserve for this property," Seel said. "They don't have a track record of doing that," Woodard said, adding that he can't guarantee a future sale won't happen. One of the firm's biggest projects includes the former McClellan Air Force Base in California, now called McClellan Park. After buying the property from Sacramento County in 2000, the firm turned the base into a multiuse business park with about 8.5 million square feet of buildings. The firm has now leased more than 5 million square feet of commercial, industrial, and aviation space there. Tenants include Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and the Department of Agriculture. IRG said the project has created more than 8,000 jobs. In Ohio, the firm developed Goodyear's world headquarters in Akron. A few miles south in Canton, IRG redeveloped the 88-acre site of the old headquarters of the Hoover Vacuum Co. In addition, the company is in the middle of a $500 million project at the Pro Football Hall of Fame campus, called Hall of Fame Village. Commissioner Ken Welch quizzed IRG leaders on their plans. The firm "buys and holds real estate" and is not a flipper, senior vice president Debra Harrell said. "Our core business is adaptive reuse," Harrell said. "We have the capital to reinvest."

Image: David Leiser, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 China Dialogue Thursday 10 November 2016 Share this story Carbon emissions from aviation are growing faster than any other sector. In an effort to address the problem, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) approved the world’s first global emissions reduction scheme last month. The Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is a market-based mechanism in which carbon emissions are offset through the purchase of credits, leaving aviation emissions to remain – at least on paper – at 2020 levels. Aviation currently accounts for just 2 per cent of total carbon dioxide emissions globally, about half of which is from international aviation. However, without effective measures, aviation could account for about 22 per cent of all emissions by 2050, according to projections from Greenovation Hub, an environmental non-governmental organisation. The aviation sector is growing rapidly, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predict that the number of airline passengers will more than double by 2034 to 7.3 billion, up from 3.5 billion in 2015. China will account for a significant proportion of the growth in passenger numbers. IATA expect that 20 per cent of passengers will be travelling to, from or within China by 2034. China is also predicted to overtake the US as the world’s largest aviation market for passengers by 2024. Passenger numbers are expected to double from current levels to over 900 million by 2025 and to 1.3 billion by 2035. The US market, in comparison, is expected to increase from just over 650 million passengers in 2015 to 900 million passengers. To address this rapid growth, the CORSIA calls for international aviation to supplement efforts to reduce emissions from within the aviation sector with additional off-setting through a market-based mechanism. The CORSIA will begin with a trial from 2021 to 2023 and then a first stage from 2024 to 2026. Both the trial and first stage will be voluntary, meaning airlines worldwide will have a decade to prepare for the start of the scheme in 2027. At this point countries will need to purchase emissions credits to keep sector emissions at the 2020 level. There will be some exceptions to the scheme: countries with minimal aviation traffic, least-developed nations, and island and landlocked developing nations will all be exempt. Like shipping, the cross-border nature of international aviation has made finding agreement on limiting emissions especially challenging. The sector was not covered in the Paris Agreement so the CORSIA will be the key driver of emissions reduction. WWF China described the deal as “an important step for reduction of aviation emissions.” As of October 12, 66 nations, including China, and together accounting for 86.5 per cent of international aviation emissions, had signed up to the CORSIA trial. Russia and India have said they will not participate in the voluntary phases. Limited headroom for cuts The main challenge in curbing aviation emissions is that improvements in technology, operational efficiency and the development of sustainable alternative fuels will be unable to keep pace with passenger growth, meaning an increase in overall carbon emissions. Andrew Murphy, aviation officer with Transport and Environment, a sustainable transportation body, told chinadialogue: “For the next few years, it’s expected that passenger demand will grow around 4-6 per cent a year, while efficiencies will improve by about 1-2 per cent a year.” Even under ICAO’s most optimistic modelling scenario for technological and operational improvements, international aviation is expected to increase carbondioxide (CO2) emissions by 523 million tonnes by 2040 or 1039 million tonnes by 2050, based on projected emissions in 2020. The solution to this emissions gap is to utilise carbon off-setting so that passenger growth can continue unfettered whilst keeping aviation emissions at 2020 levels. This approach has been criticised by some EU law makers as lacking ambition because carbon trading under the CORSIA scheme will not lead to a reduction in emissions on 2020 levels. There are also concerns about whether CORSIA will even incentivise airlines to change. Andrew Murphy is concerned that low carbon prices and overall costs won’t provide sufficient incentives for airlines to use better technology and optimise routes. ICAO calculations show that by 2035 airlines worldwide will be spending just 0.5 per cent to 1.4 per cent of their total costs on carbon abatement. This is less than the impact of fluctuations in the price of oil. There are also concerns that the CORSIA will fail to maintain emissions at 2020 levels. Greenovation Hub and WWF claim that the CORSIA may see emissions traded with projects that actually do little to reduce carbon emissions or that have damaging environmental impacts. Ensuring that the aviation sector only purchases credits that guarantee real and long-term reductions in emissions will be challenging. It is also the case that projects selling carbon credits may have broader negative environmental impacts. WWF China also point out that the CORSIA and the targets in the Paris Agreement’s to reduce global warming to 2C or 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This means the actual contribution of the aviation industry toward cutting emissions will remain undetermined. “ For the next few years, it’s expected that passenger demand will grow around 4-6 per cent a year, while efficiencies will improve by about 1-2 per cent a year. Andrew Murphy, aviation officer, Transport and Environment A level playing field for developing nations Despite the low overall costs of the scheme, the price of participation will be higher for developing nations, where aviation is expanding more rapidly, than for developed nations. WWF China has pointed out that under the CORSIA, developed nations are responsible for historical emissions. A proposal submitted to ICAO by Russia noted that aviation is expanding at a higher rate in some developing countries than in developed ones where aviation industries have had longer to mature. Furthermore, developed nation airlines make much higher profits than those in Africa. The argument goes that additional financial burdens on developing nation airlines would hamper their development and offer an unfair advantage to established aviation industries. Wang Changyi, head of the development planning department at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, said at the 2015 China Civil Aviation Development Forum that passenger numbers in China had grown by 10 per cent a year during the 12th Five Year Plan (2011-2015). As China uses mostly imported Boeing and Airbus aircraft on international routes, the country itself can do little to cut emissions. To resolve this issue, ICAO has used a “dynamic approach” to calculating carbon off-sets. Between 2021 and 2029 airlines will not be expected to benchmark themselves against their own emissions, but rather against an industry average. Over time the airlines’ performance will become more important, and by 2035 they will be responsible for the bulk (70 per cent) of their emissions. Chai Qimin, deputy director of the strategic planning department at the NDRC’s National Centre for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation told chinadialogue that the rapid growth of Chinese airlines is unlikely to continue in the long-term, and if extra emissions are distributed based on an industry average, Chinese firms will not see severe cost increases. The specific details of the scheme such as costs for carbon credits are still being determined, and developing nations still have time to discuss the balancing of their development rights and industry-wide emissions cuts in future talks.

 UPDATE 1-Trump victory shocks global firms reliant on open trade Reuters Nov. 9, 2016, 2:37 PM 28 facebook linkedin twitter email print (Adds U.S. airline shares, analyst comment) By Tim Hepher, Brenda Goh and Clara Denina HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election sent shockwaves through industries that rely on open trade, from airlines to cars and IT outsourcing, although shares of some companies rebounded in afternoon trading. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to revive the U.S. economy by slashing taxes, preventing companies from making products overseas, renegotiating trade accords and imposing tariffs on imports from countries like China. "This is part of a much broader problem that we've seen in the world, in which countries are turning inwards and reacting against globalisation and open borders," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Virginia-based Teal Group. In Asia, shares in airlines with significant exposure to global trade, such as cargo giant Korean Airlines, fell as much as 5 percent as Trump closed in on the White House. Air China's Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled to their lowest level since June, and automakers like Toyota, for whom the United States is a top market, fell 6.5 percent. Many executives remain unsure what Trump's protectionist rhetoric will mean in practice. Shares of the three largest U.S. airlines - American , Delta and United - rose more than 1 percent in afternoon trade. "We would think they would be down today, but I'm thinking that it's a play on more economic growth" from new policies, said Jim Corridore, analyst at CFRA Research. Protectionism "would be a longer term (outcome) that would hang over the industry but it's going to take a long time to get to that point." Investors at a major Airline Economics finance gathering in Hong Kong last week expressed alarm at a surge in unconventional politics from Britain to Washington and the Philippines - a trend that many expect will leave its mark regardless of how it translates into real policies. That comes as an industry that depends entirely on the flow of goods and people faces doubts over its own economic cycle. POPULIST POLITICIANS "We have seen a large section of the population that has not benefited in the past decade and we are seeing support for populist politicians with simple answers," Brian Pearce, chief economist of the International Air Transport Association told Reuters ahead of the election. "Unfortunately, a lot of those answers are for protectionist policy solutions and air transport flourishes with open borders, so that is quite a dangerous development." International trips make up 64 percent of global air traffic, according to IATA. Executives at U.S. auto companies said they were concerned about Trump's stance on free trade, especially his tough talk on the North American Free Trade Agreement. They all have production sites in Mexico. But industry executives and analysts said aviation had a history of riding out economic and political shocks. On average, plane makers insist, air traffic doubles every 15 years. "If there are brakes on trade, there could be some impact on international travel. But you have seen more or less 5 percent annual growth in traffic for decades," said veteran U.S. aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group. And the defence industry could benefit, as a Trump administration spends more on the military and encourages even allies to shoulder more of the security cost. Defence stocks, including listed land mine manufacturer Ishikawa Seisaku , jumped. REALITY BITES? After a bitter election campaign, trade experts said it remained unclear how Trump's statements in favour of protectionist trade measures and tough immigration controls would translate into policy. "The honest answer is that no one knows; even Trump himself doesn't know," said Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at Germany's DVB Bank which specialises in financing trade. "He campaigned not on ideas but on anger and frustration." Tighter rules could impact Indian IT services firms supporting companies in the United States. Shares in companies like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services were sharply down as Trump closed in on the White House. But Narayana Murthy, co-founder of Infosys and a key figure in India's outsourcing industry, said realism would prevail. "They may fine tune it here and there, but let's remember that he is the president of 300 million U.S. people and I'm sure he'll do what is in the best interest of America. And what is in the best interest of America is for its corporations to succeed, for its corporations to create more jobs," he said. For now, acquisitions at least will cool off, especially Chinese purchases of U.S. companies, as a Trump presidency pushes up regulatory scrutiny. "If he now requires a certain percentage of manufacturing parts to be made in America, it's going to be protectionist... and that increases the risk and cost of doing business," said Stephanie Yuen, an M&A lawyer in Singapore. "He's not just building a Mexican wall, he builds an economic wall around America." And for key sectors, competition will heat up. Europe's Airbus and U.S. rival Boeing in the $100 billion annual jet market could become even fiercer with more government lobbying support, adding stridency to efforts to compete for jobs. Trump's victory may also raise questions over plans to sell over 200 Western airplanes to Iran under a deal to lift sanctions that the president-elect has severely criticised. Airbus is seen close to finalising a tranche of 17 jets, but needs U.S. approval to complete plans for another 80 or so because the jets are built with many U.S. parts. Boeing has U.S. approval to finalise a deal for some 100 jets but Middle East sources say progress has been slow so far. "It further reduces the prospect of the deals going ahead," Aboulafia said.

Publication: Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume: 13 Issue: 180 By: Sergey Sukhankin November 9, 2016 06:09 PM Age: 6 days The first children from the Kola peninsula sign up for the Young Army (Source: mil.ru) In addition to concrete steps aimed at upgrading Russian military capabilities, Moscow has launched a vigorous campaign promoting the cult of the military within Russian society, particular focusing on younger generation of Russians. On September 1, the government launched the so-called “Yunarmia” military-patriotic movement, to be composed of Russian schoolchildren.  Two months later, it is said to have already assembled around 27,000 members (Mil.ru, accessed November 9). The movement was initiated by the Ministry of Defence (it is frequently nicknamed “the army of Sergei Shoygu,” the present minister of defense) and enjoys the full support of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It currently consists of 5,000 branches all across Russia, on the basis of the Central Sport Club of the Army (CSKA) and the Volunteer Society for Cooperation with the Army, Aviation, and Fleet (DOSAAF). In the majority of regions, the local Yunarmia branches are headed by veterans of the Afghan or Chechen wars. The main agenda of the movement is concerned with nurturing the young generation in accordance with Russian national traditions that reject such “foreign” elements as LGBT rights, religious fanaticism, radical nationalism, various sects, and “aggressive minorities” that allegedly seek to overthrow “legitimate governments.” Moreover, it is construed as an “inoculation against Fascism” (Russkaya Pravda, April 10). Also, there is an explicit reference to some “contemporary stage of Russian patriotism” that is based on restoring all “spiritual staples” (a notion introduced by Putin in 2012) and a readiness of ordinary people to serve the motherland (Tretya Mirovaya Voyna, accessed November 9). Russian Minister of Defence Shoygu has also been very explicit as to the goal of the Yunarmia movement: the popularization of military ideology and the fostering of a special bond between young Russians and the army. “Paratroopers and racketeers, infantrymen and tank crew are determined to invite each and every member of ‘Yunarmia’ into their circle,” he noted earlier this year. On the other hand, Alexander Kanshin, the head of the National Association of Reserve Officers, has claimed that even in a short-term prospect, the youth movement is likely to accept “hundreds of thousands” of new members. Indeed, Yunarmia was conceived as a militarized wing of the “Russian movement of schoolchildren,” and thus it potentially has truly immense human resources at its disposal. Moreover, even though membership is officially “voluntary,” there are serious doubts in this regard—particularly considering Russo-Soviet historical tradition. Some observers have already compared the new organization to its historical predecessor of the mid-1980s, which played the role of a military supplement to the Soviet Pioneers youth organization. The alleged similarity is not only based on the visible ideological commonalities between the two, but is also underscored by the uniforms its members are given (Kp.ru, May 25). One should not, however, conflate Yunarmia with such artificially created pro-Kremlin projects of the early 2000s as “Nashi”: the former is, by no means, just another “patriotic” initiative created by Russian political technologists. Rather, Yunarmia is a growing movement closely linked with the Russian Armed Forces. And considering the militaristic ideology now seen growing in the country, it the new “youth army” should be understood as an organic “part of the Russian state” (Openrussia.org, August 12). Notably, Kaliningrad oblast—the Russian “island in Europe,” which is currently also being subjected to profound Soviet-style militarization (see EDM, November 7)—seems to have been chosen by Moscow to showcase Yunarmia’s launch. The ceremony of acceptance of the first Yunarmia members in the oblast was carried out with unprecedented pomp: not only was it attended by prominent Russian sportsmen, it also allowed the new members to undertake a short sea voyage on the naval corvette Steregushchiy (Tvzvezda.ru, July 9). The “militarization of public conscious” in Kaliningrad has more recently taken yet another turn. On October 26, the holding company AO “Voentorg” had an opening ceremony for the first store in the exclave oblast that will sell consumer goods branded “Russian Army” (“Armija Rossii”). All in all there are only six stores of this kind across Russia; the one located in Moscow is physically situated right in front of the United States Embassy. The launch event for the Kaliningrad store was overseen by the commander of the Baltic Sea Fleet, Vice Admiral Alexander Nosatov (Newkaliningrad.ru, October 26). Aside from products aimed at adults—the so-called “Polite People” brand, styled in the Soviet tradition of goods dating from the early 1940s—the shop offers a special line for children branded “Polite Bears.” The children’s line also adheres to the currently extremely popular “military style” (Minoborony Rossii, October 25). Undoubtedly, the last aspect should be viewed as an extremely dangerous and far-reaching trend that underscores the growing link between the youngest members of Russian society and the cult of militarism. Quite recently, the Russian blogosphere was appalled by the release of a children’s bed designed to look like the notorious “Buk” missile system, which was used to down the MH17 Boeing passenger jet over eastern Ukraine, in July 2014 (Mk.ru, October 1). Admittedly, it would be quite inaccurate to claim that today’s Yunarmia and its Soviet-era predecessor are entirely analogous. In fact, today’s “youth army” appears to be a much more ominous phenomenon for Russian society.  Given the extent of xenophobia and the cult of the military in Russian society today, the emergence of a mass popular youth movement like Yunarmia reflects a much darker time of the last century when young people became tools of totalitarian regimes in Europe. It will be up to Russians to make sure Yunarmia does not retread these footsteps of the past. Back Short-Term Personnel Contracts Negate Go..Next Belarus Balances Pursuit of Economic Gro..

Posted 09 Nov 2016 20:03 Traders at BGC Partners look at screens as victorious U.S. Presidential election candidate Donald Trump speaks on a television screen behind, in London, Britain, November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Toby Melville Enlarge Caption  Email More A A HONG KONG/SHANGHAI: Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election sent shockwaves through industries that rely on open trade, from airlines to cars and IT outsourcing, even though many executives remain unsure what his protectionist rhetoric will mean in practice. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to revive the U.S. economy by slashing taxes, preventing companies from making products overseas, renegotiating trade accords and imposing tariffs on imports from countries like China. "People are in shock. It seems commentators misread the mood of the country," said veteran U.S. aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group. In Asia, shares in airlines with significant exposure to global trade, such as cargo giant Korean Airlines, fell as much as 5 percent as Trump closed in on the White House. Air China's Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled to their lowest level since June, and automakers like Toyota, for whom the United States is a top market, fell 6.5 percent. "This is part of a much broader problem that we've seen in the world, in which countries are turning inwards and reacting against globalisation and open borders," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Virginia-based Teal Group. Investors at a major Airline Economics finance gathering in Hong Kong last week expressed alarm at a surge in unconventional politics from Britain to Washington and the Philippines - a trend that many expect will leave its mark regardless of how it translates into real policies. That comes as an industry that depends entirely on the flow of goods and people faces doubts over its own economic cycle. POPULIST POLITICIANS "We have seen a large section of the population that has not benefited in the past decade and we are seeing support for populist politicians with simple answers," Brian Pearce, chief economist of the International Air Transport Association told Reuters ahead of the election. "Unfortunately, a lot of those answers are for protectionist policy solutions and air transport flourishes with open borders, so that is quite a dangerous development." International trips make up 64 percent of global air traffic, according to IATA. Executives at U.S. auto companies said they were concerned about Trump’s stance on free trade, especially his tough talk on the North American Free Trade Agreement. They all have production sites in Mexico. But industry executives and analysts said aviation had a history of riding out economic and political shocks. On average, plane makers insist, air traffic doubles every 15 years. "If there are brakes on trade, there could be some impact on international travel. But you have seen more or less 5 percent annual growth in traffic for decades," Lundquist said. And the defence industry could benefit, as a Trump administration spends more on the military and encourages even allies to shoulder more of the security cost. Defence stocks, including listed land mine manufacturer Ishikawa Seisaku, jumped. REALITY BITES? After a bitter election campaign, trade experts said it remained unclear how Trump's statements in favour of protectionist trade measures and tough immigration controls would translate into policy.

Many executives remain unsure what Trump's protectionist rhetoric will mean in practice. Shares of the three largest U.S. airlines - American <AAL.O>, Delta <DAL.N> and United <UAL.N> - rose more than 1 percent in afternoon trade. "We would think they would be down today, but I’m thinking that it’s a play on more economic growth" from new policies, said Jim Corridore, analyst at CFRA Research. Protectionism "would be a longer term (outcome) that would hang over the industry but it's going to take a long time to get to that point." Investors at a major Airline Economics finance gathering in Hong Kong last week expressed alarm at a surge in unconventional politics from Britain to Washington and the Philippines - a trend that many expect will leave its mark regardless of how it translates into real policies.

(AP Photo/ Evan Vucci) HONG KONG  • Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election sent shockwaves through industries that rely on open trade, from airlines to cars and IT outsourcing, even though many executives remain unsure what his protectionist rhetoric will mean in practice. Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has vowed to revive the U.S. economy by slashing taxes, preventing companies from making products overseas, renegotiating trade accords and imposing tariffs on imports from countries like China. "People are in shock. It seems commentators misread the mood of the country," said veteran U.S. aerospace consultant Jerrold Lundquist, managing director of The Lundquist Group. In Asia, shares in airlines with significant exposure to global trade, such as cargo giant Korean Airlines, fell as much as 5 percent as Trump closed in on the White House. Air China's Hong Kong-listed shares tumbled to their lowest level since June, and automakers like Toyota, for whom the United States is a top market, fell 6.5 percent. "This is part of a much broader problem that we've seen in the world, in which countries are turning inwards and reacting against globalization and open borders," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, vice president of Virginia-based Teal Group. Investors at a major Airline Economics finance gathering in Hong Kong last week expressed alarm at a surge in unconventional politics from Britain to Washington and the Philippines — a trend that many expect will leave its mark regardless of how it translates into real policies. That comes as an industry that depends entirely on the flow of goods and people faces doubts over its own economic cycle. Populist politicians "We have seen a large section of the population that has not benefited in the past decade and we are seeing support for populist politicians with simple answers," Brian Pearce, chief economist of the International Air Transport Association told Reuters ahead of the election. "Unfortunately, a lot of those answers are for protectionist policy solutions and air transport flourishes with open borders, so that is quite a dangerous development." International trips make up 64 percent of global air traffic, according to IATA. Executives at U.S. auto companies said they were concerned about Trump's stance on free trade, especially his tough talk on the North American Free Trade Agreement. They all have production sites in Mexico. But industry executives and analysts said aviation had a history of riding out economic and political shocks. On average, plane makers insist, air traffic doubles every 15 years. "If there are brakes on trade, there could be some impact on international travel. But you have seen more or less 5 percent annual growth in traffic for decades," Lundquist said. And the defense industry could benefit, as a Trump administration spends more on the military and encourages even allies to shoulder more of the security cost. Defense stocks, including listed land mine manufacturer Ishikawa Seisaku , jumped. Reality bites?   After a bitter election campaign, trade experts said it remained unclear how Trump's statements in favor of protectionist trade measures and tough immigration controls would translate into policy. "The honest answer is that no one knows; even Trump himself doesn't know," said Bertrand Grabowski, a managing director at Germany's DVB Bank which specializes in financing trade. "He campaigned not on ideas but on anger and frustration." Tighter rules could impact Indian IT services firms supporting companies in the United States. Shares in companies like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services were sharply down as Trump closed in on the White House.

"They may fine tune it here and there, but let's remember that he is the president of 300 million U.S. people and I'm sure he'll do what is in the best interest of America. And what is in the best interest of America is for its corporations to succeed, for its corporations to create more jobs," he said.
