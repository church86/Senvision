(Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images) The Export-Import Bank of the United States -- informally known as the “Ex-Im Bank,” but irreverently referred to as “Boeing's Bank” behind closed doors -- is hosting a ritzy conference for power players in Washington this week. It's another exercise in willful deception. Bank beneficiaries and bureaucrats will attempt to conceal their blatant cronyism from the public with misleading platitudes about protecting U.S. exports, job creation, and in particular small businesses. Here's an example: “In FY 2013, Ex-Im Bank approved more than $27 billion in total authorizations to support an estimated $37.4 billion in U.S. export sales and approximately 205,000 American jobs in communities across the country. For the year, the Bank approved a record 3,413 transactions, or 89 percent, for small businesses.” Sounds pretty impressive, no? Americans know small businesses struggle in this uncertain economy, and are understandably inclined to view the bank’s operations in a more positive light when they hear statements like that. There’s one big problem: The claim is misleading. It's true that small businesses account for 89 percent of the total number of deals. But the value of those deals tells a different story. For fiscal year 2013, for instance, only $5.2 billion of the $27.3 billion in total authorization amounts, or 19 percent, was designated as “small business” activity on the Ex-Im Bank's annual report. The bank is also pretty fast and loose with its definition of “small business" to include manufacturing and wholesale firms with 500 to 1,500 employees. Other sectors can contain “small businesses” that earn annual revenues of up to $21.5 million. For instance, in the general construction sector, a firm counts as "small" if it earns anywhere between $13.5 million and $17 million a year. The organization’s definition of “small business” is more expansive than the Small Business Administration’s. With few exceptions, the SBA sets their threshold at 500 employees and average annual receipts at $7 million — considerably smaller than the bank’s. Other government institutions like the Federal Reserve adhere to the SBA’s definitions — thus raising the question of why the Ex-Im Bank in particular found it necessary to create their own standards. It is clear that what is a “small business” to the Ex-Im Bank is not what most Americans think of when they hear the term. Perhaps this can be explained by Ex-Im’s long history of rubbing elbows with the big guys. The Ex-Im Bank has been in the “big business” business for so long it can’t distinguish a publicly traded corporation from a local coffee shop. In truth, the bank's main beneficiaries are giant manufacturing conglomerates and aerospace contractors. The bank's main customer happens to be America's No. 1 exporter and manufacturing giant: Boeing. According to the bank's data, in fiscal year 2013, Boeing procured roughly 66 percent of Ex-Im's loan guarantees. Ex-Im reports that Boeing was designated primary exporter for 55 deals (including insurance, loans, and guarantees) valued at roughly $8.3 billion in total assistance. Sometimes, the bank doesn’t report where the money goes at all. The second-largest exporting beneficiary, topping off at $2.9 billion in Ex-Im assistance in fiscal 2013, is simply labeled as "unknown." And the top 10 exporter beneficiaries received roughly 75 percent of total assistance last year. Diane Katz, a Heritage Foundation regulatory research fellow, assembled a helpful list of some of the biggest beneficiaries. The list reads like a “who's who” of powerful exporting empires: General Electric, Dow Chemical, Bechtel, Caterpillar, and John Deere all enjoy the bank's support of “small business” and “job creation.” The bank’s transparent “small business” pitch should bother us. But the truth is it's unrealistic to expect Americans to monitor every deal and bald-faced half-truth that comes out of Ex-Im reports and balance sheets. This is the tragic conclusion of public choice economics: Private benefits for Boeing and Caterpillar continue unabated because the costs are dispersed among millions of taxpayers who simply don’t have the time and energy to fight this injustice. Big business lobbyists have “all hands on deck” at this year's conference to protect their cash cow. But that's no reason for us to buy what they are selling.

Trump, who as a candidate said he didn’t think the bank needed to exist, named former New Jersey Representative Scott Garrett, one of the biggest recipients of Wall Street donations among House members, to be the bank’s chairman and president. He tapped former Alabama Representative Spencer Bachus for a seat on the bank’s board of directors. Both positions require Senate confirmation. Trump hinted at his reversal in media interviews earlier this week, signaling a shift from his position on the campaign trail. In 2015, he told Bloomberg that the bank’s role amounted to “featherbedding” for some politicians and companies.  Boeing Co. Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg is said to have been particularly influential in changing the president’s view of the agency. Boeing is by far the largest exporter beneficiary of the bank, to the tune of several billion dollars annually, followed by General Electric Co. Small-government conservatives shut down the bank in 2015 by blocking its reauthorization. While the bank was revived, its five-member board has lacked a quorum, which restricted it from granting loans of more than $10 million. Former President Barack Obama’s late-term nominees were blocked by Senate Republicans, including Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama. Read about the Ex-Im bank’s path from star to snuffed to saved: QuickTake In Garrett, Trump has once again chosen a critic of a government agency to run it.  “The Export-Import Bank’s long legacy of crony capitalism has hurt the livelihoods and businesses of many Americans who don’t get special treatment from this misguided government program,” Garrett said in a 2015 statement. Conservative groups including Heritage Action and Americans for Prosperity oppose the bank for similar reasons. Garrett lost re-election last year after seven terms in Congress when he lost the backing of major Wall Street donors after a report that he’d told fellow Republican lawmakers he wouldn’t give money to the party’s congressional campaign arm because it supported openly gay candidates. Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, has previously backed the Ex-Im bank, sponsoring a 2012 law that reauthorized the bank. Backers of bank say that most of its lending supports small and medium-sized businesses. In fiscal 2014, the bank’s last fully operation year, it backed $27.5 billion in exports — somewhat less than 2 percent of the U.S. total. This financing supported 164,000 American jobs that year, according to the bank, and about 90 percent of the bank’s deals helped small businesses. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has pushed for the bank’s lending powers to be fully restored, saying that without it jobs might be lost to competitors in China or Russia.

The order, valued at $1.1 billion at current list prices, was previously attributed to an unidentified customer on the Boeing Orders & Deliveries website. “Silk Way’s success and profitability is a direct result of investing in its fleet and services and growing its regional and international footprint,” said Zaur Akhundov, president, Silk Way Group of Companies. “I am confident we will maintain our rate of growth, supported by 10 new Boeing 737 MAX 8 airplanes.” “We are very pleased to expand our partnership with Silk Way with this airplane order,” said Marty Bentrott, vice president of Sales, Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “We value our partnership with Silk Way and are grateful for their enduring confidence in the Boeing products.”  Azerbaijan-based Silk Way Group includes 23 companies working in the aviation industry and related services including passenger and cargo airlines. The airline currently operates seven Boeing airplanes, including two 767-300 Freighters, three 747-400 Freighters and three 747-8 Freighters. The 737 MAX family has been designed to offer customers exceptional performance, flexibility and efficiency, with lower per-seat costs and an extended range that will open up new destinations in the single-aisle market. The MAX 8 and 9 will be followed in 2019 by the smaller MAX 7 and higher capacity MAX 200, while studies and customer discussions continue on further growing the family. The 737 MAX incorporates the latest technology CFM International LEAP-1B engines, Advanced Technology winglets and other improvements to deliver the highest efficiency, reliability and passenger comfort in the single-aisle market.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Google, Facebook, Snapchat lobby up By Theodoric Meyer 04/14/17 02:00 PM EDT With David Beavers, Aubree Eliza Weaver and Daniel Lippman TECH GIANTS LOBBY UP: Google, Facebook and Snapchat are all signing new lobbyists amid a flood of end-of-quarter filings. Google has added Holland & Knight to its stable of lobbying firms, working for its Waymo self-driving car operation on “development, testing, deployment and regulation of autonomous vehicles,” according to a disclosure filing. Facebook has hired Ogilvy Government Relations to lobby on immigration reform. (The company also brought on BakerHostetler last quarter.) And Snapchat has hired Monument Policy Group to lobby on technology, cybersecurity and “lawful access issues.” (Invariant and Jochum Shore & Trossevin also lobby for Snapchat.) Story Continued Below — Other filings that caught our eye: Koch Industries — a major opponent of House Speaker Paul Ryan’s border-adjustment tax proposal — has hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to lobby on tax reform. And Dorelita Limited, a Greek consulting firm, has hired former Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.), to “assist with developing and improving relationships with US government officials” and “manage meetings with US Administration, Congress and Dorelita.” NATIONAL RETAIL FEDERATION HITS THE AIR TO FIGHT BORDER ADJUSTMENT: The National Retail Federation is hitting the air while members are at home during the recess, going up with new TV and digital ads pushing House Republicans to oppose the proposed border-adjustment tax. The ads feature small-business owners who say the tax would devastate their companies. They’re targeting three GOP lawmakers who the trade group hopes will vote against the proposal, which has been championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan and Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady: Reps. David Valadao (R-Calif.), Andy Barr (R-Ky.) and John Culberson (R-Texas). (Valadao and Culberson are both likely Democratic targets next year after Hillary Clinton carried their districts in November.) — Why is the NRF hitting the air now? “We thought it was time to introduce the voice of small-business owners into the conversation,” said David French, the NRF’s senior vice president of government relations. Much of the campaign against the tax has been waged by Americans for Affordable Products, a coalition that includes giant companies like Wal-Mart, Nike and Target. (Another coalition, the American Made Coalition, led by exporters like General Electric and Boeing, has championed the tax.) The NRF’s goal is to kill the border adjustment by the time Congress is ready to move onto tax reform, so Congress can pass legislation more favorable to retailers. “It’s dead in the Senate, it’s probably dead in the House, and it’s time to admit it,” French said.

BARNETT IN THE AGE OF TRUMP: It was “Bob Barnett, the Washington superlawyer who likes to describe himself as the ‘doorman to the revolving door,’” who represented the Obamas and Hillary Clinton in their post-election book deals. “But the Obama and Clinton book deals are being viewed by people in the publishing and agenting business as potentially something of a Barnett swan song,” POLITICO’s Annie Karni reports. “His old-school tactics — a multimillion-dollar book deal for an outgoing government official, coupled with a launch on ‘60 Minutes’ or one of the Sunday shows — seem out of sync in the age of Trump, a former reality show star who reverse-engineered his presidency by starting with the lucrative book, the branding and the television deals and then worked his way into the Oval Office.” Full story. BEEKEEPER AND PIVOT POINT COMBINE: The Beekeeper Group, a Washington public affairs firm, has acquired Pivot Point Communications, a public relations and marketing firm based in Alexandria, Va. Vanessa French, Pivot Point’s president and lead strategist, and Casey Kincheloe, Pivot Point’s creative director and new media strategist, are joining Beekeeper’s leadership team. HOW BOEING’S CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHANGED TRUMP’S MIND: Donald Trump called the Export-Import Bank — reviled by the House Freedom Caucus and other conservatives as a symbol of “crony capitalism” — “unnecessary” during the campaign. “But that view changed earlier this year after he talked to Boeing Co. CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who explained to him what role the bank plays, according to people familiar with the matter,” The Wall Street Journal’s Eli Stokols and Michael C. Bender report. “In a recent meeting with lawmakers, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D., N.D.) urged Mr. Trump to fill the bank’s board vacancies, and the president told Ms. Heitkamp that he agreed with her that the posts—which require a presidential nomination—should be filled.” Full story. CHARITIES STICK WITH MAR-A-LAGO: A number of Florida charitable donors unhappy with President Donald Trump’s policies demanded earlier this year that charities stop holding their events at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, The Palm Beach Post’s Alexandra Clough reports. “A few charities, hoping to minimize backlash, agreed to look for ‘neutral’ venues. But in interviews with numerous charities, donors, event planners and venues, it now seems that most, if not all, charities will stay put at Trump properties for the 2017-18 winter season. This is the case even if Trump’s policies appear to contradict the very causes for which the charities seek to raise money.” Full story. SPOTTED: At a “fireside chat” about Amazon’s rooftop solar panel initiative last night at the company’s Washington offices, according to a PI tipster: Amazon’s Kara Hurst and Tom Chandlee, who led the discussion; Yuri Horwitz of Sol Systems, who moderated; Carrie Annand of the Biomass Power Association; Brandon Audap of the Solar Energy Industries Association; Blaise Sheridan of Sen. Al Franken’s office; Linda Church Ciocci of the National Hydropower Association; Gil Jenkins, Lesley Hunter, James Hewett, Greg Westrup, Scott Clausen and Anna Hahnemann of the American Council on Renewable Energy, which hosted the event with Amazon; Bud DeFlaviis of the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association; Katharine Lister and T.A. Hawks of Monument Policy Group; and Brian Huseman, Andrea Fava, Shannon Kellogg, Kate Viar, Charlotte Newman and Jena Gross of Amazon. ON THE CALENDAR: “Top insurance officials from across the country are scheduled to meet with [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] Administrator Seema Verma on Tuesday as the Trump administration weighs a decision that could determine the future viability of the Obamacare markets,” POLITICO’s Paul Demko reports. “Executives from America’s Health Insurance Plans, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association and many of the country’s largest regional plans are among those expected to attend the gathering. The list of health plans that have confirmed attendance includes Molina Healthcare, Geisinger Health Plan, Oscar Insurance Company, Kaiser Permanente and Health Care Service Corp.” NEW JOINT FUNDRAISERS: MacArthur-Donovan Victory Fund (Rep.

Ars Technica says the proposal was initially floated in 2013. The concerns that led to the ban in 1991 were safety related, and those concerns have abated due to the evolution of the technology.  The reason the ban will remain is more about the mental than the physical well-being of passengers. To some extent, the move was academic. The government has shown itself willing to step in and keep cellphones off planes. In any case, airlines would have the final say, and it seems unlikely that any would take this step. Boeing 3D Prints Plane Parts Boeing has retained Norsk Titanium AS to print parts for the 787 Dreamliner. This method of fabricating the structural elements will cut $2 million to $3 million off the cost of each aircraft, says Reuters. The contract, which was announced on Monday, is a sign of the acceptance of 3D printing. Strong and lightweight titanium is far more costly than aluminum, and Boeing has been seeking ways to cut those costs. Boeing builds about 144 Dreamliners annually. The craft uses more titanium than other types of aircraft, which obviously gives Boeing an incentive to find ways to cut the cost of its use. United Airlines Should Look at Artificial Intelligence Continuing on this week’s theme of aeronautical stories, a columnist at Computerworld suggested that machine learning could have saved United Airlines a tremendous amount of bad publicity and, in terms of its stock price, a significant amount of money. One of the biggest stories of the week, and perhaps the story of the year in marketing, was the saga of an airline passenger who was injured when he refused to give up his seat on a flight from O’Hare Airport in Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky. John Brandon suggests that machine learning could have been the answer, and could avoid such breakdowns in the future: Here’s how it would work. Because there is already a wealth of data related to passenger counts, who needs to get to their destination and when, and even which employees are on stand-by for a given flight, machine learning could determine who should be allowed to board and when. Not allowing someone to board is a different issue for airlines than asking someone to disembark. It has a different set of security parameters, and a different set of passenger relation issues. Airline employees often don’t have up to date data and are often overwhelmed. Using machine learning, he suggests, can help avoid such a scenario. FCC’s Broadband Auction Raises $19.8B The FCC yesterday released the results of its broadband incentive auction, aimed at freeing up broadcast spectrum for use by wireless networks. The auction, which was authorized by Congress in 2012, is an important step in the evolution of 5G. The FCC says that the auctioning of 70 MHz of spectrum raised $19.8 billion. More than $10 billion will go to 175 broadcasters who participated in the incentive auction. Thirty of the broadcasters will be compensated for moving to lower channels, and another 133 will relinquish their licenses and remain on the air through channel-sharing arrangements with non-winning stations. The industry will now enter a 39-month period during which these changes will be implemented. ONOS Releases SDN Deployment Models The implementation of software-defined networks (SDNs) is a very complex and challenging task. This week, the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) released recommendations. ONOS is a joint effort of The Open Networking Foundation and the Open Networking Lab (ONF and ON.Lab). The disruptive approach, RCR Wireless Report said, “is more straightforward in that it leverages white boxes and ONOS for real-time network control.” The incremental model is nuanced, includes incorporation of legacy systems, and can be used on an as-needed basis, while the older equipment is gradually cycled out of the network.

(Centrair) Snohomish County and Japanese airports reach agreement Noah Haglund Fri Apr 14th, 2017 12:36pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — Snohomish County airport officials have reached their first formal agreement with counterparts in Japan, a relationship they hope will pay dividends for aerospace business on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. County representatives traveled to Japan to announce an agreement Friday with officials from Chubu Centrair International Airport. The airport in Aichi Prefecture is located near the major port city of Nagoya, more than 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. Like Snohomish County’s Paine Field, it is known as an aerospace manufacturing hub. “These two airports, while continents apart, are linked by Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner,” said Bill McSherry, vice president of government operations for Boeing Commerical Airplanes. “In fact, both airports play an integral role in the manufacturing process of Boeing’s newest airplanes and are key to our long-term success. We are excited to help strengthen the partnership between Paine Field and Centrair for many more years to come.” Japan’s consulate general in Seattle was involved in the negotiations, according to a county press release. State Department of Commerce director Brian Bonlender said aerospace relationships have flourished between the two regions for nearly 50 years, since Japan Airlines began using the Moses Lake airfield in Grant County. County Executive Dave Somers said the memorandum should help strengthen ties between local governments through an exchange of information and mutual assistance on projects. The sectors expected to benefit most are aircraft manufacturing and air cargo operations. Traveling to Japan on the county’s behalf were executive director Kendee Yamaguchi from Somers’ office and County Councilwoman Stephanie Wright, who also serves as board treasurer of the Trade Development Alliance of Greater Seattle.

Boeing Advertisement Boeing Co.’s newest and largest 737 Max gunned down the runway and soared over the shore of Lake Washington, south of Seattle, on its way to an almost three-hour maiden flight Thursday. The latest model in Boeing’s best-selling jet family took wing five days ahead of schedule, during a week marking the 50th anniversary of the first 737 flight. The single-aisle Max 9 faces an uncertain future, however, in a market dominated by Airbus SE’s longer A321neo. About three-quarters of orders for the workhorse planes favored by budget carriers are clustered around midsized models such as the Max 8 and A320neo. But sales are growing faster for larger narrow-bodies, one reason why Boeing (IW 500/9) is targeting Airbus’s lead with two stretched jets. “It’s an incredibly important part of our family moving forward,” Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president of marketing, said of the Max 9. Boeing has also begun marketing an even larger model, the Max 10X, and expects the two variants combined to eventually account for about a quarter of its narrow-body sales, he told reporters. Popular Now The Future of Work Why Manufacturers Are Turning to Supply Chain Finance to Prep for Growth GE Digital's Secret Weapon The U.S. planemaker is trying to pull off a balancing act with the 737, its largest source of profit. Boeing is mulling introducing as many as five Max models targeting different niches, while ratcheting up the tempo in its Renton, Wash., factory over each of the next three years. Any stumbles in developing the new jets, a process fraught with delays, could damage Boeing’s bottom line if snarls slow manufacturing at a plant preparing to increase output to 47 planes a month in May -- five more than the present rate. The Max 8, the first of the upgraded 737 models, has completed flight-testing and is slated to begin deliveries in May, months earlier than initially planned. Year of Many Plane Debuts The first Max 9 took to the skies with Captain Christine Walsh in command. It is designed to seat 178 travelers in a two-class cabin, about 16 more people than the Max 8, while flying the same distance: as many as 3,515 nautical miles. The debut is the latest in a year crammed with new planes produced by manufacturers from Brazil to Ukraine. Boeing has already begun to cut metal for the next 737, the smaller Max 7. Meanwhile the company’s 787-10, the largest Dreamliner, took its first flight March 31 -- the same day that Airbus’s A319neo and Antonov’s An-132D turboprop aircraft made their maiden flights. Sputtering airplane sales raise concerns that the new aircraft are entering the market as the aerospace industry heads into a downturn after more than a decade of growth. That could make it tougher for manufacturers to recapture the billions of dollars poured into engineering, tooling and factories. The pain won’t be felt equally, however. Boeing and Airbus are cushioned by record backlogs for their upgraded narrow-bodies: 3,703 orders for the 737 Max and 5,056 sales for the A320neo lineup. “This is why we have a duopoly,” said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, referring to Boeing and Airbus. “Newcomers have a harder time with an ultimately cyclical market, combined with heavy spending on new-product development.” Pioneer Jet Boeing shouldn’t have any problem recovering its costs for the 737 Max family, the latest versions of the venerable single-aisle jet that revolutionized low-cost travel and aircraft manufacturing with its moving line. The bulk of Boeing’s orders are said to be for the -8, which seats more travelers than the A320neo, although the U.S. planemaker doesn’t break out sales by Max model. With the Max 9 struggling to gain sales, Boeing has begun pushing the Max 10X, a longer model. It would seat about 230 travelers in a single cabin and cruise on transcontinental routes flown by Boeing’s 757, which has been out of production for more than a decade. But potential customers, including Air Lease Corp., fret that the new model will get to market too late, with a planned 2020 debut. That will be a year after Airbus will introduce an A321neo model configured to seat as many as 240 people. Boeing would probably have to discount heavily to cut into Airbus’s lead, Aboulafia said. “They can’t seem to get the pricing power they had with the NG series,” the analyst said, referring to the previous generation of the 737s that commanded premiums to Airbus jets. “Maybe that will change. But if it does, it will happen on the Max 8.” But Boeing, for now, may be content to have product offerings that it can hone for 737 operators -- without ceding the top end of the narrow-body market to Airbus, said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “The investments haven’t been excessive relative to the broader program,” he said. The Max 9 and 10X will help “keep Airbus pricing in check,” he said. “Part of the benefit is just having something in place and letting the technology mature.” By Julie Johnsson Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Iran says it expects to receive the first airplane from American aviation giant Boeing before June.  Farhad Parvaresh, the managing director of Iran’s national flag carrier airline Iran Air, was quoted by the domestic media as saying that Boeing officials were in Tehran to discuss the matter. Parvaresh added that if Iran Air’s conditions were met, proceedings for the earlier-than-scheduled delivery of the plane that had originally been destined to be handed over to Turkey’s Turkish Airlines would begin.    “Considering that Turkish Airlines has announced that it is not ready to take delivery of the Boeing 777 [that it had ordered from the US company], Boeing has proposed to deliver the plane to Iran Air, instead,” Parvaresh was quoted as saying by Iran’s Tasnim news agency. “We are currently discussing this matter with them (Boeing).  If Iran’s conditions are met, this plane would be most probably delivered to Iran within the next 45 days.”  US aviation giant has already made a $16.6 billion sale already to Iran Air and has also signed a $3 billion deal to sell 30 737 MAX aircraft to Iran's Aseman Airlines, a firm owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation. The first deliveries as per the deal between Iran Air and Boeing were previously expected to take place in 2018.    Boeing’s biggest European rival – Airbus – has signed another deal estimated to be worth some $25 billion to sell planes to the same company. Airbus has so far delivered three planes to Iran and more deliveries are expected to be made in the near future. Iran Air also this week signed a deal with the French-Italian aircraft maker ATR to purchase 20 new planes.  All the planes are expected to be delivered by the end of 2017.   Loading ...   News Iran Middle East US UK Asia-Pacific Africa Europe Americas Society Arts Business Sports Video News Bulletin Reports Interviews TV Watch Live Schedule Shows Documentaries PressTV About PressTV Frequencies Privacy Policy Contact Info SMS Subscribe PressTV © Copyright 2016 PressTV.

The Boeing 747's "stick-shaker" warning came on, rattling the pilot's control stick to indicate the plane was in danger of stalling. Read more Climate change 'likely to lead to bumpier flights' JetBlue passengers taken to hospital after plane hits turbulence Dozens of passengers hurt after London flight hits severe turbulence Experts say stick shaker incidents are so rare that most commercial airline pilots go their whole career without encountering one, other than during training. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is investigating the incident, said the pilots experienced “airframe buffeting” while holding at 22,000 feet and disconnected autopilot and “manouevred the aircraft in response”. The safety watchdog is treating it as a “serious incident”, meaning there were indications that an accident causing loss of life or aircraft damage nearly occurred, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.  Keith Tonkin, an aviation expert and managing director of consultants Aviation Projects, told the Herald, for the stick shaker to go off, “it means that the aircraft is not able to sustain straight and level flight — the wings stop creating enough lift to hold the aeroplane up in the sky under controlled conditions.” The airline said customers had experienced “unexpected in-flight turbulence” on the Boeing 747, leading to speculation a sudden change in wind conditions threw the plane off course and into an unusual position.  “We notified the [Australian Transport Safety Bureau] of the occurrence, and our own teams are also reviewing the event,” a spokeswoman for Qantas said. The Aviation Herald reported that plane was about to enter a holding pattern about 60 nautical miles south-east of Hong Kong at the time and was travelling between 340 knots and 290 knots.

However, in doing so they risk straying out of a plane's allocated airspace, he told the Herald, which is especially risky in busy airspace like that near Hong Kong.   “At a high altitude it's recoverable within the height that you have, if it happened at a low level it may not be,” he said. The plane landed about 24 minutes after the incident and two passengers were taken to hospital. According to Boeing the stick shaker function takes a physical, rather than visual, form so crew members will be alerted even if they are not looking at the panel at the time.

New Atlas Lifestyle Science Technology Transport Search Subscribe Aircraft Lockheed Martin details Sikorsky-Boeing Future Vertical Lift concept David Szondy April 13, 2017 The Sikorsky-Boeing Future Vertical Lift  is based on the X2 technology demonstrator (Credit: Lockheed Martin) View gallery - 4 images Lockheed Martin has provided a glimpse of future combat rotorcraft with the release of new video of its Sikorsky-Boeing Future Vertical Lift concept. Under development by Lockheed subsidiary Sikorsky Helicopters and Boeing, the futuristic helicopter comes in Assault and Attack variants that build on the X2 demonstrator that set an unofficial helicopter speed record in 2010. Like the X2, the fly-by-wire Future Vertical Lift concept is based on a contra-rotating, co-axial rotor system combined with an aft push prop – all powered by an advanced turbine plant. According to Lockheed, this allows the concept to cruise at over 250 knots (288 mph, 464 km/h) and hover efficiently even at altitudes of 6,000 ft (1,800 m) in temperatures of 92° F (33° C). And it has greater range and payload capacity than comparable helicopters, though Lockheed is a bit coy as to just how much. Sick of Ads?

There's also an active vibration control to make the aircraft more comfortable and less noisy – which is what you want when you're dropping off commandos in the middle of the night. If things go pear shaped, the Future Vertical Lift can bring its weapons to bear in all flight modes. For long distance missions, it has aerial refuelling capabilities. All of this is wrapped up in a composite fuselage that carries a crew of four and 12 fully-loaded troops or eight medivac pallets. Both the Assault and Attack variants share a large number of common systems and are designed to minimize the initial price, operating costs and maintenance over the aircraft's lifetime.

The latest model in Boeing's best-selling jet family achieved the critical milestone at 10:52 a.m. local time, days after the Chicago-based planemaker celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first 737 flight. The single-aisle Max 9 faces an uncertain future, however, in a market dominated by Airbus's longer A321neo. The U.S. planemaker is trying to pull off a balancing act with the 737, a workhorse favored by budget carriers that is Boeing's largest source of profit. The manufacturer is mulling the introduction of as many as five Max models targeting different niches, while ratcheting up the tempo in its Renton, Washington, factory over each of the next three years. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Any stumbles in developing the new jets, a process fraught with delays, could damage Boeing's bottom line if snarls slow manufacturing at a plant preparing to increase output to 47 planes a month in May, five more than the present rate. The Max 8, the first of the upgraded 737 models, has completed flight-testing and is slated to begin deliveries this quarter, months ahead of schedule. The Max 9 also took to the skies ahead of schedule, with Captain Christine Walsh in command. It is designed to seat 204 travelers in a single-class cabin, about 16 more people than the Max 8, while flying the same distance: as many as 3,515 nautical miles. The debut is the latest in a year crammed with new planes produced by manufacturers from Brazil to Ukraine. Boeing's largest 787 Dreamliner, the -10, took its first flight March 31 -- the same day that Airbus's A319neo and Antonov's An-132D turboprop aircraft made their maiden flights. Sputtering airplane sales raise concerns that the aerospace industry is headed into a downturn after more than a decade of growth, making it tougher for manufacturers to recapture the billions of dollars spent developing aircraft. "This is why we have a duopoly," said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, referring to Boeing and Airbus. "Newcomers have a harder time with an ultimately cyclical market, combined with heavy spending on new-product development." Boeing shouldn't have any problem recovering its costs for the 737 Max family, the latest versions of the venerable single-aisle jet that revolutionized low-cost travel and aircraft manufacturing. The company has already landed 3,703 orders, the most in its history for a new program. Europe's Airbus has garnered 5,056 orders for its A320neo lineup. The bulk of Boeing's orders are thought to be for the -8, which seats more travelers than the A320neo, although the U.S. planemaker doesn't break out sales by Max model. That gives Airbus a commanding lead at the top end of the market with the 1,385 orders notched by the A321neo, the longest narrow-body in production. With the Max 9 struggling to gain sales, Boeing has begun marketing the Max 10X, a longer model. It would seat about 230 travelers and cruise on transcontinental routes flown by Boeing's 757, which has been out of production for more than a decade. But potential customers, like Air Lease Corp., fret that the new model will get to market too late, with a planned 2020 debut. That will be a year after Airbus will introduce an A321neo model configured to seat as many as 240 people. Boeing would probably have to discount heavily to cut into Airbus's lead, Aboulafia said. "They can't seem to get the pricing power they had with the NG series," the analyst said, referring to the previous generation of the 737s that commanded premiums to Airbus jets. "Maybe that will change. But if it does, it will happen on the Max 8." But Boeing, for now, may be content to have product offerings that it can hone for 737 operators -- without ceding the top end of the narrow-body market to Airbus, said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. "The investments haven't been excessive relative to the broader program," he said. The Max 9 and 10X will help "keep Airbus pricing in check," he said. "Part of the benefit is just having something in place and letting the technology mature."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Once free despite his sex assault convictions, it's prison for former Mormon bishop Op-ed: Turning to religion won't prevent sexual assault Remembering Utah actor Jenessa Bowen, who lit up the stage with her talent American Preparatory Academy demolishes nearby house to open emergency route through Draper neighbor Utah football: Unproven Utes look to gain ground in Red-White game ELEVATE You may be procrastinating on your taxes if...   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

(Grant Hindsley/seattlepi.com) By Julie Johnsson, Bloomberg Published: April 13, 2017, 6:06 PM A   A Boeing’s newest and largest 737 Max gunned down the runway and soared over the shore of Lake Washington, south of Seattle, on its maiden flight Thursday. The latest model in Boeing’s best-selling jet family achieved the critical milestone at 10:52 a.m., days after the Chicago-based planemaker celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first 737 flight. The single-aisle Max 9 faces an uncertain future, however, in a market dominated by Airbus’s longer A321neo. The U.S. planemaker is trying to pull off a balancing act with the 737, a workhorse favored by budget carriers that is Boeing’s largest source of profit. The manufacturer is mulling the introduction of as many as five Max models targeting different niches, while ratcheting up the tempo in its Renton factory over each of the next three years. Any stumbles in developing the new jets, a process fraught with delays, could damage Boeing’s bottom line if snarls slow manufacturing at a plant preparing to increase output to 47 planes a month in May, five more than the present rate. The Max 8, the first of the upgraded 737 models, has completed flight-testing and is slated to begin deliveries this quarter, months ahead of schedule. The Max 9 also took to the skies ahead of schedule, with Captain Christine Walsh in command. It is designed to seat 204 travelers in a single-class cabin, about 16 more people than the Max 8, while flying the same distance: as many as 3,515 nautical miles. Busy year The debut is the latest in a year crammed with new planes produced by manufacturers from Brazil to Ukraine. Boeing’s largest 787 Dreamliner, the -10, took its first flight March 31 — the same day that Airbus’s A319neo and Antonov’s An-132D turboprop aircraft made their maiden flights. Sputtering airplane sales raise concerns that the aerospace industry is headed into a downturn after more than a decade of growth, making it tougher for manufacturers to recapture the billions of dollars spent developing aircraft. “This is why we have a duopoly,” said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, referring to Boeing and Airbus. “Newcomers have a harder time with an ultimately cyclical market, combined with heavy spending on new-product development.” Boeing shouldn’t have any problem recovering its costs for the 737 Max family, the latest versions of the venerable single-aisle jet that revolutionized low-cost travel and aircraft manufacturing. The company has already landed 3,703 orders, the most in its history for a new program. Europe’s Airbus has garnered 5,056 orders for its A320neo lineup. The bulk of Boeing’s orders are thought to be for the -8, which seats more travelers than the A320neo, although the U.S. planemaker doesn’t break out sales by Max model. That gives Airbus a commanding lead at the top end of the market with the 1,385 orders notched by the A321neo, the longest narrow-body in production. With the Max 9 struggling to gain sales, Boeing has begun marketing the Max 10X, a longer model. It would seat about 230 travelers and cruise on transcontinental routes flown by Boeing’s 757, which has been out of production for more than a decade. Customers’ concerns But potential customers, like Air Lease Corp., fret that the new model will get to market too late, with a planned 2020 debut. That will be a year after Airbus will introduce an A321neo model configured to seat as many as 240 people. Boeing would probably have to discount heavily to cut into Airbus’s lead, Aboulafia said. “They can’t seem to get the pricing power they had with the NG series,” the analyst said, referring to the previous generation of the 737s that commanded premiums to Airbus jets. “Maybe that will change. But if it does, it will happen on the Max 8.” But Boeing, for now, may be content to have product offerings that it can hone for 737 operators — without ceding the top end of the narrow-body market to Airbus, said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “The investments haven’t been excessive relative to the broader program,” he said. The Max 9 and 10X will help “keep Airbus pricing in check,” he said. “Part of the benefit is just having something in place and letting the technology mature.” Please take a second to review our community guidelinesCommunity guidelines Blogs Staff Blogs Home All Politics is Local Blazer Banter Brews in Clark Cannabis Chronicles Clark County Faces Digital Desk Family Room Ghost Stories High School Sports HealthBeat History Political Beat Tailgate Talk Community It's the Fair!

Scott Garrett questions SEC chairwoman Mary Jo White during a hearing in Washington November 15, 2016. — Reuters picWASHINGTON, April 15 — US President Donald Trump nominated former Republican lawmaker Scott Garrett as president of the Export-Import Bank of the United States yesterday, completing an about-face over an institution he had denounced as “featherbedding” for big business. A White House statement also named Spencer Bachus, another Republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. Both were named for four-year terms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the bank's five-member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over US$10 million (RM44.1 million). His picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing Co and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in Congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's backing of the bank represents a victory for manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric Co, which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump told the Journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. Trump's about-face followed a meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing chief executive Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank's charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Soros sued by fellow billionaire in US$10b mine brawl Ringgit expected to climb against US dollar Bursa Malaysia to consolidate next week Uber lifts financial veil, says sales growth outpaces losses In about-face, Trump nominates new head of export bank Saudis, oil majors discuss gas investments ahead of giant IPO Village Grocer buys up Ben’s Independent Grocer Petronas pitches RM4.4b offshore gas project stake to oil firms, sources say Demand for Malaysian palm oil set to rebound, says Council United Airlines CEO won’t resign Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner file for divorce Reuters Video: The fight for luxury comes to the New York auto show Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Obama to US business-owners: Press congress to renew Ex-Im Bank Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

A White House statement also named Spencer Bachus, another Republican former congressman, to be a member of the board of directors of the bank. Both were named for four-year terms. Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday he would fill the two vacancies on the bank's five-member board that have prevented it from having a quorum and being able to act on loans over $10 million. His picks must gain approval from the Senate, which blocked nominees by former President Barack Obama. The Export-Import Bank, an independent government agency, provides loans to foreign entities that enable them to purchase American-made goods. For example, it has been used by foreign airlines to purchase planes from Boeing Co and farmers in developing nations to acquire equipment. The bank has become a popular target for conservatives, who worked in Congress to kill the institution, arguing that it perpetuates cronyism and does little to create American jobs. Trump's backing of the bank represents a victory for manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric Co, which have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. Trump told the Journal the bank benefits small businesses and creates jobs, a reversal of his earlier criticism of the bank as being "featherbedding" for wealthy corporations. Trump's about-face followed a meeting on Tuesday with former Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney, who left the company last year but oversaw the corporation's aggressive lobbying effort in support of the bank in 2015. Large American corporations that do significant amounts of exports say other countries have similar agencies and the export bank levels the playing field. A 2015 fight to shutter the bank led by conservatives in Congress allowed the bank's charter to expire for five months. After overwhelming bipartisan support emerged to renew the bank's charter, which is needed for it to operate, conservatives blocked nominees to the board, preventing it from financing large exports like aircraft and power turbines.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory Among the promises Donald Trump made on the campaign trail, the now-president vowed to get rid of the Export-Import Bank calling it “unnecessary,” and saying it was used for “featherbedding” wealthy corporations. Now, however, Trump has had a change of heart because the CEO of Boeing — which benefits greatly from the bank — pulled him aside and explained how it works, reports the Wall Street Journal. In a piece explaining how Trump’s policies are either being shaped by business leaders or completely flipped, the Journal claimed that Boeing Co. CEO Dennis Muilenburg met with the president and explained the importance of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which allows overseas customers to receive government-backed loans in order to purchase U.S. goods. Following the meeting, and after speaking with several lawmakers who also supported the bank, Trump reversed course, agreeing to fill several spots on the bank’s board which require a presidential nomination. The report on Trump’s lack of knowledge about the bank follows another report stating the president was given a brief ten-minute history lesson by President Xi of China on the history of the relations between his country and North Korea. The former businessman-turned-politician also admitted in late February that, “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” before his replacement for the Affordable Care Act collapsed before it could reach the floor of the House for a vote.

By Bernard Mpofu AirZim, which at Independence in 1980 boasted a fleet of 18 planes, is technically insolvent and operating at less than a third of that capacity. The airline is reeling under a debt in excess of US$330 million that has hampered efforts to engage strategic partners in a bid to retain and grow market share. Foreign currency shortages that have seen the nostro accounts of local banks depleted have ground AirZim’s operations to a halt as the company struggles to procure crucial spare parts. Sources said this week the airline’s woes worsened last month after it failed to service most of its routes, leaving passengers stranded. AirZim executives blamed the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for delaying the release of foreign currency to buy spare parts needed for maintenance work. The sources said one of AirZim’s Modern Ark (MA) 60 planes, which was servicing domestic routes, is awaiting spare parts bought from China while Boeing planes are also awaiting spares from suppliers. Pilots at the airline, sources said, are also up in arms with management amid concerns the problems dogging AirZim could complicate renewal of their licences, an international requirement dependent on their flying hours. “The situation at AirZim really got bad on Tuesday. No past chief executive has ever experienced what happened when five planes were grounded for being un-airworthy. By late Tuesday frantic efforts were being made to bring back one bird to the sky. As of Wednesday the Airbus was operational and it was servicing the Victoria Falls route,” said an aviation industry source. Questions sent to AirZim chief executive Ripton Muzenda were not responded to while his phone went unanswered. Transport minister Jorum Gumbo’s phone was not reachable. Insiders say Zimbabwe’s cash situation worsened last year on the back of dwindling exports, externalisation and government’s growing dependence on Treasury Bills which has crowded out private sector lending. The deteriorating economic situation has seen international airlines like Qantas ordering travel agents in Zimbabwe to stop selling tickets for its flights after the International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned it is getting harder to move funds out of the country due to foreign currency shortages. This comes as government decided to go it alone in turning around the airline, abandoning previous considerations to get a technical partner. Late last year government engaged five international carriers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Singapore, Turkey and Malaysia to partner the troubled Air Zimbabwe with hopes of turning around the fortunes of the ailing and debt-ridden national airline. Ethiopian Airlines, Africa’s largest carrier, recently told the Zimbabwe Independent that it is ready to rescue AirZim, but this depends on the will of the government. Last year, cabinet gave Gumbo the nod to seek private partnerships for the debt-ridden flag carrier. The national airline has continued to struggle, incurring cumulative losses and relying on Treasury for survival. In 2011, Air Zimbabwe’s Boeing 737-500 was impounded in South Africa after failing to settle a US$500 000 debt owed to Bid Air Services for ground handling services. Its largest aircraft, a Boeing 767-200, was seized by American General Supplies in London over a US$1,2 million debt in the same year. The plane was later released after the airline paid the debt, but Air Zimbabwe immediately stopped flying to London, one of its most lucrative routes. The debt-ridden airline was kicked out of Iata’s flight reservation services in 2012 after failing to honour its obligations — which then stood at US$3,4 million — a development which resulted in limited business. In 2013 cabinet approved a proposal by the AirZim board to raise US$15 million through 180-day commercial paper. The airline also proposed the issuance of ordinary shares to raise US$30 million through private placement to local investors and the issuance of ordinary shares and preference shares to international investors and partners. To clean up its balance sheet and shake off legacy issues, the AirZim board proposed the restructuring of the current debt through the issuance of money market instruments to current creditors. The company also planned to issue 10-year corporate bonds to current creditors and third-party investors up to US$200 million to reduce the debt overhang affecting the entity. Officials have been on roadshows canvassing for investors. During that same year, the Transport ministry commissioned audit firm Ernst & Young to develop a business plan for AirZim which was approved by cabinet. Government has agreed to take over the debts, through the Air Zimbabwe Debt Assumption Bill, to allow the airline and its technical partner to start on a clean slate.

There. a homely metaphor that should even make sense to the ZANU clown circus. But it probably won’t. Reply Tommy Sithole April 14, 2017 at 2:04 pm # The 737-500 is one of the hottest properties in the air. I suppose the reporter meant the original and ancient B737-200. Which is what Air Zim has always had. Now, the Air Zim story is more complicated than everything I’ve always read in the local media. I don’t know the two gentlemen at the top of the airline’s management. But whatever their qualifications they are guarantee to fail. Absolutely. Get this, Air Zimbabwe is configured in such a way that no one, whatever their qualifications and good intentions, can ever succeed to make it profitable. I read jokes about a previous CEO who was said to have turned it around in the short spell he was only acting in the seat. His supporters didn’t want us to notice that it was “operating” profit they were referring to. Not profit. Now the reason why I say the two gentlemen have been set up to fail is that it’s the minister, a politician, for goodness sake, who’s taken the lead in this whole turnaround saga. Yes, saga. We are gleefully told about cabinet having given the go ahead to do partnership. Wait a minute. Where are the CEO and the COO? They can’t do their jobs because ever since time immemorial politicians have gotten used to making decisions for the airline. As long as government refuses to recognise that the airline has/had some of Africa’s best administrators, engineers and pilots who should be allowed to get on with the job we shall continue to mire the nation into multimillion dollar debts as politicians take the lead in acquisition of aircraft, which routes the airline should fly, what “partnerships” they should develop while at the same time continuing to dish out Fifth Freedom rights to a dozen airlines flying to Zimbabwe the CEO and the COO can and will never succeed. This is a promise. T A Ganda Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Aside from the reclusive regime’s nuclear weapons, Kim Jong-un’s hermit kingdom boasts air defenses that are more advanced than many might realize. Moreover, Pyongyang has also taken steps to increase its resilience against any aerial onslaught that that United States might launch in the event of war. The so-called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has not forgotten the lessons of the Korean War–which technically has not yet ended. “Between 1950 and 1953, the U.S. Air Force and Navy flattened North Korea, so the NORKS have had 65 years to think about how to make sure that does not happen again and dig lots of bomb proof shelters and tunnels,” retired Rear Adm. Mike McDevitt, a senior fellow at the Center for Naval Analyses, told The National Interest. But aside from hardening its facilities, Pyongyang fields more advanced air defenses than one might assume. While the overwhelming majority of North Korean air defenses are older Soviet systems, Pyongyang does field some surprisingly capable indigenous weapons. “They have a mix of old Soviet SAMs [surface-to-air missiles], including the S-75, S-125, S-200 and Kvadrat, which are likely in more or less good condition,” Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics told The National Interest. “They used to produce the S-75 themselves—and those could have received some significant upgrades. In addition to them, since early the 2010s they are fielding an indigenous modern SAM system which is called KN-06 by South Korea and the U.S.” It is not clear how many KN-06 SAM batteries Pyongyang has built, but the North Korean weapon is a surprisingly capable system that is similar to early model versions of the Russian-built S-300. “No one knows exactly how many such systems exist,” Kashin said. “The KN-06 has phased array radar and tracks via missile guidance system and maybe equivalent to the early S-300P versions but with greater range.” Kashin—who is a specialist on Asian matters—said that South Koreans sources have written that the KN-06 has been successfully tested. The weapon is thought to have a range of up to 150 km. One of the reasons that the KN-06 is often ignored—even though information is available about the North Korean weapon—is that Western analysts often underestimate Pyongyang’s industrial capabilities. “Generally, there is a great underestimation of North Korean industrial capabilities in the world,” Kashin said. “From what I know, they do produce some computerized machine tools and industrial robotics, fiber-optics, some semiconductors as well as a variety of trucks and cars, railroad rolling stock, consumer electronics etc. So they can do something comparable to Soviet designs of the 1970s to early 80s—especially when they cooperate with the Iranians.” North Korean low altitude air defenses are also fairly robust—even if the systems that Pyongyang fields are dated. “At low altitudes, they have huge numbers of license produced and indigenous MANPADs [man-portable air defenses] and 23-57mm anti-aircraft artillery—many thousands of pieces,” Kashin said. North Korea also has a large but nearly completely obsolete air force. The only aircraft Pyongyang possesses that might marginally threaten American airpower are its small fleet of Mikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrums. “They supposedly have up to 40 MiG-29s, but I’m not sure how many of them are still airworthy but some surely are,” Kashin said. “Pilot training is limited and never exceeds 20 flight hours per year.” However, while North Korean technology is relatively primitive—the nation’s air defenses are coordinated. “They do have an old Soviet computerized anti-aircraft command and control system. Most of the radars are old, but they did receive some newer Iranian phased array radars,” Kashin said. “This is what I know, the anti-aircraft units are extensively using underground shelters for cover—not easy to destroy.” Thus, while generally primitive, North Korean defenses might be a tougher nut to crack than many might expect.

Aside from the reclusive regime’s nuclear weapons, Kim Jong-un’s hermit kingdom boasts air defenses that are more advanced than many might realize. Moreover, Pyongyang has also taken steps to increase its resilience against any aerial onslaught that that United States might launch in the event of war. The so-called Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has not forgotten the lessons of the Korean War–which technically has not yet ended. “Between 1950 and 1953, the U.S. Air Force and Navy flattened North Korea, so the NORKS have had 65 years to think about how to make sure that does not happen again and dig lots of bomb proof shelters and tunnels,” retired Rear Adm. Mike McDevitt, a senior fellow at the Center for Naval Analyses, told The National Interest. But aside from hardening its facilities, Pyongyang fields more advanced air defenses than one might assume. While the overwhelming majority of North Korean air defenses are older Soviet systems, Pyongyang does field some surprisingly capable indigenous weapons. “They have a mix of old Soviet SAMs [surface-to-air missiles], including the S-75, S-125, S-200 and Kvadrat, which are likely in more or less good condition,” Vasily Kashin, a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies at Moscow’s Higher School of Economics told The National Interest. “They used to produce the S-75 themselves—and those could have received some significant upgrades. In addition to them, since early the 2010s they are fielding an indigenous modern SAM system which is called KN-06 by South Korea and the U.S.” It is not clear how many KN-06 SAM batteries Pyongyang has built, but the North Korean weapon is a surprisingly capable system that is similar to early model versions of the Russian-built S-300. “No one knows exactly how many such systems exist,” Kashin said. “The KN-06 has phased array radar and tracks via missile guidance system and maybe equivalent to the early S-300P versions but with greater range.” Kashin—who is a specialist on Asian matters—said that South Koreans sources have written that the KN-06 has been successfully tested. The weapon is thought to have a range of up to 150 km. One of the reasons that the KN-06 is often ignored—even though information is available about the North Korean weapon—is that Western analysts often underestimate Pyongyang’s industrial capabilities. “Generally, there is a great underestimation of North Korean industrial capabilities in the world,” Kashin said. “From what I know, they do produce some computerized machine tools and industrial robotics, fiber-optics, some semiconductors as well as a variety of trucks and cars, railroad rolling stock, consumer electronics etc. So they can do something comparable to Soviet designs of the 1970s to early 80s—especially when they cooperate with the Iranians.” North Korean low altitude air defenses are also fairly robust—even if the systems that Pyongyang fields are dated. “At low altitudes, they have huge numbers of license produced and indigenous MANPADs [man-portable air defenses] and 23-57mm anti-aircraft artillery—many thousands of pieces,” Kashin said. North Korea also has a large but nearly completely obsolete air force. The only aircraft Pyongyang possesses that might marginally threaten American airpower are its small fleet of Mikoyan MiG-29 Fulcrums. “They supposedly have up to 40 MiG-29s, but I’m not sure how many of them are still airworthy but some surely are,” Kashin said. “Pilot training is limited and never exceeds 20 flight hours per year.” However, while North Korean technology is relatively primitive—the nation’s air defenses are coordinated. “They do have an old Soviet computerized anti-aircraft command and control system. Most of the radars are old, but they did receive some newer Iranian phased array radars,” Kashin said. “This is what I know, the anti-aircraft units are extensively using underground shelters for cover—not easy to destroy.” Thus, while generally primitive, North Korean defenses might be a tougher nut to crack than many might expect. Moreover, while their technology is old, North Korea’s philosophy of self-reliance means it can produce most of its own military hardware. “They produce a lot of stuff, although in many cases the technology would lag some 20 to 40 years behind,” Kashin said. “But they do produce it independently.” Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

By Bernard Mpofu STRUGGLING national flag carrier Air Zimbabwe (AirZim) has lurched into a new crisis after all of its five aircraft were grounded on Tuesday due to technical problems, forcing the airline to hire a plane from neighbouring South Africa in a desperate effort to fulfill some of its flight schedules, it has been established. AirZim, which at Independence in 1980 boasted a fleet of 18 planes, is technically insolvent and operating at less than a third of that capacity. The airline is reeling under a debt in excess of US$330 million that has hampered efforts to engage strategic partners in a bid to retain and grow market share. Foreign currency shortages that have seen the nostro accounts of local banks depleted have ground AirZim's operations to a halt as the company struggles to procure crucial spare parts. Sources said this week the airline's woes worsened last month after it failed to service most of its routes, leaving passengers stranded. AirZim executives blamed the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for delaying the release of foreign currency to buy spare parts needed for maintenance work. The sources said one of AirZim's Modern Ark (MA) 60 planes, which was servicing domestic routes, is awaiting spare parts bought from China while Boeing planes are also awaiting spares from suppliers. Pilots at the airline, sources said, are also up in arms with management amid concerns the problems dogging AirZim could complicate renewal of their licences, an international requirement dependent on their flying hours. "The situation at AirZim really got bad on Tuesday. No past chief executive has ever experienced what happened when five planes were grounded for being un-airworthy. By late Tuesday frantic efforts were being made to bring back one bird to the sky. As of Wednesday the Airbus was operational and it was servicing the Victoria Falls route," said an aviation industry source. More on This Any Expectations of a Turnaround in Air Zimbabwe's Performance? Airzim Deal Collapses 'State-Owned Airline to Cut Senior Positions' Questions sent to AirZim chief executive Ripton Muzenda were not responded to while his phone went unanswered. Transport minister Jorum Gumbo's phone was not reachable. Insiders say Zimbabwe's cash situation worsened last year on the back of dwindling exports, externalisation and government's growing dependence on Treasury Bills which has crowded out private sector lending. The deteriorating economic situation has seen international airlines like Qantas ordering travel agents in Zimbabwe to stop selling tickets for its flights after the International Air Transport Association (Iata) warned it is getting harder to move funds out of the country due to foreign currency shortages. This comes as government decided to go it alone in turning around the airline, abandoning previous considerations to get a technical partner. Late last year government engaged five international carriers from Kenya, Ethiopia, Singapore, Turkey and Malaysia to partner the troubled Air Zimbabwe with hopes of turning around the fortunes of the ailing and debt-ridden national airline. Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's largest carrier, recently told the Zimbabwe Independent that it is ready to rescue AirZim, but this depends on the will of the government. Last year, cabinet gave Gumbo the nod to seek private partnerships for the debt-ridden flag carrier. The national airline has continued to struggle, incurring cumulative losses and relying on Treasury for survival. In 2011, Air Zimbabwe's Boeing 737-500 was impounded in South Africa after failing to settle a US$500 000 debt owed to Bid Air Services for ground handling services. Its largest aircraft, a Boeing 767-200, was seized by American General Supplies in London over a US$1,2 million debt in the same year. The plane was later released after the airline paid the debt, but Air Zimbabwe immediately stopped flying to London, one of its most lucrative routes. The debt-ridden airline was kicked out of Iata's flight reservation services in 2012 after failing to honour its obligations -- which then stood at US$3,4 million -- a development which resulted in limited business. In 2013 cabinet approved a proposal by the AirZim board to raise US$15 million through 180-day commercial paper. The airline also proposed the issuance of ordinary shares to raise US$30 million through private placement to local investors and the issuance of ordinary shares and preference shares to international investors and partners. To clean up its balance sheet and shake off legacy issues, the AirZim board proposed the restructuring of the current debt through the issuance of money market instruments to current creditors. The company also planned to issue 10-year corporate bonds to current creditors and third-party investors up to US$200 million to reduce the debt overhang affecting the entity. Officials have been on roadshows canvassing for investors. During that same year, the Transport ministry commissioned audit firm Ernst & Young to develop a business plan for AirZim which was approved by cabinet. Government has agreed to take over the debts, through the Air Zimbabwe Debt Assumption Bill, to allow the airline and its technical partner to start on a clean slate.

In an interview Wednesday with the Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump said he’s learned a lot about the bank and how it boosts trade and helps a variety of businesses. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was the president’s chief tutor, the Wall Street Journal reported. At first, Trump was opposed, wondering why large companies such as General Electric, IBM and Boeing would need this financial service. But he was told how many small businesses service those companies. Indeed, about 90 percent of the more than 2,300 Ex-Im transactions in fiscal year 2016 directly benefited suppliers and other vendors, according to the National Association of Manufacturers. Trump also learned that about 60 other countries have such a tool, and it would put U.S. businesses at a trade disadvantage if Ex-Im were scrapped. “It’s a very good thing, and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money,” Trump said in the article. None of this is news to manufacturers and other exporters. The virtues of Ex-Im have been extolled extensively, and the bank had been reauthorized 16 times without controversy since its founding in 1945. The bank provides loans and guarantees so foreign buyers can quickly get American products, and American companies can avoid risks associated with overseas deals. Conventional banks often shy away from loans to foreign entities. But in 2014, tea-party Republicans tagged the bank with the “crony capitalism” label and said it ran the risk of losing money – something it had never done. In fact, the federally chartered bank returned $675 million to the U.S. Treasury in 2014 and helped sustain 164,000 jobs. The year before, it returned more than $1 billion. Oddly, many of the same politicians are silent when it comes the Farm Bill and its subsidies for agricultural businesses in their districts. Nonetheless, the bank’s charter expired in July 2015 when key legislators bottled up reauthorization. But business groups were able to pressure the House to move a reauthorization measure to the floor three months later. It ultimately passed by large margins in both chambers. But the politics didn’t end there. Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby, then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, blocked confirmation votes for vacant seats on the bank’s board of directors. Without a quorum, the board has not been able to authorize loans for more than $10 million. As a result, transaction volumes have plummeted. Even still, the bank returned $284 million in fiscal year 2016. The hope now is that the president can persuade Congress to fill those vacancies on the Ex-Im board, and make this international trade tool great again.

Julie Johnsson Boeing is mulling introducing as many as five Max models targeting different niches, while ratcheting up the tempo in its Renton, Washington, factory over each of the next three years. Photo: Bloomberg Chicago: Boeing Co.’s newest and largest 737 Max gunned down the runway and soared over the shore of Lake Washington, south of Seattle, on its way to an almost three-hour maiden flight Thursday. The latest model in Boeing’s best-selling jet family took wing five days ahead of schedule, during a week marking the 50th anniversary of the first 737 flight. The single-aisle Max 9 faces an uncertain future, however, in a market dominated by Airbus SE’s longer A321neo. About three-quarters of orders for the workhorse planes favoured by budget carriers are clustered around mid-sized models such as the Max 8 and A320neo. But sales are growing faster for larger narrow-bodies, one reason why Boeing is targeting Airbus’s lead with two stretched jets. “It’s an incredibly important part of our family moving forward,” Randy Tinseth, a Boeing vice president of marketing, said of the Max 9. Boeing has also begun marketing an even larger model, the Max 10X, and expects the two variants combined to eventually account for about a quarter of its narrow-body sales, he told reporters. The US planemaker is trying to pull off a balancing act with the 737, its largest source of profit. Boeing is mulling introducing as many as five Max models targeting different niches, while ratcheting up the tempo in its Renton, Washington, factory over each of the next three years. Any stumbles in developing the new jets, a process fraught with delays, could damage Boeing’s bottom line if snarls slow manufacturing at a plant preparing to increase output to 47 planes a month in May -- five more than the present rate. The Max 8, the first of the upgraded 737 models, has completed flight-testing and is slated to begin deliveries in May, months earlier than initially planned. The first Max 9 took to the skies with Captain Christine Walsh in command. It is designed to seat 178 travellers in a two-class cabin, about 16 more people than the Max 8, while flying the same distance: as many as 3,515 nautical miles. Also Read: How a border tax could divide Boeing and its suppliers The debut is the latest in a year crammed with new planes produced by manufacturers from Brazil to Ukraine. Boeing has already begun to cut metal for the next 737, the smaller Max 7. Meanwhile the company’s 787-10, the largest Dreamliner, took its first flight 31 March—the same day that Airbus’s A319neo and Antonov’s An-132D turboprop aircraft made their maiden flights. Sputtering airplane sales raise concerns that the new aircraft are entering the market as the aerospace industry heads into a downturn after more than a decade of growth. That could make it tougher for manufacturers to recapture the billions of dollars poured into engineering, tooling and factories. The pain won’t be felt equally, however. Boeing and Airbus are cushioned by record backlogs for their upgraded narrow-bodies: 3,703 orders for the 737 Max and 5,056 sales for the A320neo lineup. “This is why we have a duopoly,” said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia, referring to Boeing and Airbus. “Newcomers have a harder time with an ultimately cyclical market, combined with heavy spending on new-product development.” Boeing shouldn’t have any problem recovering its costs for the 737 Max family, the latest versions of the venerable single-aisle jet that revolutionized low-cost travel and aircraft manufacturing with its moving line. The bulk of Boeing’s orders are said to be for the -8, which seats more travellers than the A320neo, although the US planemaker doesn’t break out sales by Max model. With the Max 9 struggling to gain sales, Boeing has begun pushing the Max 10X, a longer model. It would seat about 230 travelers in a single cabin and cruise on transcontinental routes flown by Boeing’s 757, which has been out of production for more than a decade. But potential customers, including Air Lease Corp., fret that the new model will get to market too late, with a planned 2020 debut. That will be a year after Airbus will introduce an A321neo model configured to seat as many as 240 people. Boeing would probably have to discount heavily to cut into Airbus’s lead, Aboulafia said. “They can’t seem to get the pricing power they had with the NG series,” the analyst said, referring to the previous generation of the 737s that commanded premiums to Airbus jets. “Maybe that will change. But if it does, it will happen on the Max 8.” But Boeing, for now, may be content to have product offerings that it can hone for 737 operators—without ceding the top end of the narrow-body market to Airbus, said Ken Herbert, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity. “The investments haven’t been excessive relative to the broader program,” he said. The Max 9 and 10X will help “keep Airbus pricing in check,” he said. “Part of the benefit is just having something in place and letting the technology mature.” Bloomberg Julie Johnsson Topics: Boeing 737 max jet airbus airplanes More From Livemint READ MORE BJP eyes eastern push as executive meet begins in Bhubaneswar Liquor sale ban on highways to affect 30% premium hotels, says Crisil Kulbhushan Jadhav sentencing: India cancels maritime talks with Pakistan First Published: Fri, Apr 14 2017. 10 58 AM IST Editor's Picks Operation Clean Money II: Over 60,000 to face tax dept probe Is the end of the road near for Tata Nano?

Apr. 4, 2017 at 4:06 p.m. ET by Wallace Witkowski Why Goldman believes Caterpillar is set for a rebound after mining and building slump Apr. 4, 2017 at 3:45 p.m. ET by Ciara Linnane Breaking Dow's gains led almost entirely by stock rally in Caterpillar, United Tech, Boeing The Dow Jones Industrial Average's Tuesday afternoon advance was being spearheaded by a trio of its 30 components, contributing about 32 points to the blue-chip gauge. Caterpillar Inc. . which was trading 2.2% higher after a bullish note from Goldman Sachs, added about 15 points to the Dow , while shares of United Technologies Corp. , climbed 0.9%, tacking on about 10 points. Meanwhile, Boeing Co.'s shares , up 0.9%, contributed about 7 points. Earlier in the session, the Dow was under pressure, along with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which is threatening to log its longest period of losses, three days, since the three-day skid ended Dec. 30, according to FactSet data. The lackluster moves for equities highlight a pullback from the euphoria that followed President Donald Trump's November election victory. Stock valuations considered lofty and doubts about the president's ability to put into law his pro-growth campaign agenda sooner than later have been cited as the source of the recent retreat. Apr. 4, 2017 at 12:13 p.m. ET by Mark DeCambre UPDATE: Caterpillar stock jumps as Goldman upgrades to Conviction Buy list Shares of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. rose 1% in early trade Tuesday, after Goldman Sachs added the stock to its Conviction Buy list and set a stock price target that's 30% above current trading levels. "We see an attractive combination of (1) structurally higher mid-cycle EPS, (2) exposure to underinvested machinery markets in the early stages of recovery, (3) management strategy transition towards improving returns on capital (vs. market share in the last cycle), and (4) a ~20% underweight average mutual fund position," analysts led by Jerry Revich said in a note. Goldman set a stock price target of $120. Shares are down 0.5% in the year so far, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 5.4% and the S&P 500 has gained 5%.

(AFP) SEATTLE/SYDNEY: A new version of Boeing Co’s 737 jetliner took off for the first time on Thursday, marking another step in Boeing’s revamp of its best-selling product line that could see up to five new models introduced by 2020. Boeing’s 737 MAX 9, a fuel-efficient, long-range successor to the 737-900, made its initial flight, a test mission, about 50 years after the 737 first took to the skies on April 9, 1967, and follows the first flight of Boeing’s largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, last month, from its factory in South Carolina. The new models are coming to market just as demand for aircraft has slowed. Boeing has committed to making four new 737 versions and is considering a bigger version than the MAX 9, known as the 737 MAX 10X. It could begin delivering that version in 2020 if airlines start ordering it this year, with China emerging as a promising market, said Michael Teal, 737 MAX chief project engineer and deputy program manager. With the MAX 9 in the air, Boeing is turning more attention to the larger version. It began pre-marketing the plane this year but has yet to formally launch development of the jetliner, which would compete against the popular Airbus A321neo. Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year and customers could receive the aircraft in 2020, depending on orders. “We’ll determine (the delivery date) when we launch that program when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane,” he said on a conference call with reporters. “The China market and airlines there are very interested in the (MAX) 9 and 10 depending on their needs,” said Teal. “We are looking at putting together deals for the China market today on both the 9 and the 10.” Boeing said in March it had approached India’s SpiceJet and Jet Airways about the MAX 10X, which its marketing chief says would offer the best efficiency in that part of the market, a claim Airbus rejects. However, the heads of two major aircraft leasing companies have voiced skepticism about the appeal of the MAX 10X and suggested it would eat into rentals of other MAX models. The 737 MAX 10X would be 66 inches (167 centimeters) longer than the current largest family member, the 737 MAX 9, and add 12 seats. It would require longer landing gear as a result. Teal said the landing gear was still in the development stage, with several concepts in prototype testing. “We will not hit the firm configuration on the gear and, really, the complete airplane until the end of this year,” he said. “All of the development tests are proving positive and we are well on our way to firming up that configuration and moving forward into production.” The first 737 MAX 9 customer delivery is expected next year, while the first 737 MAX 8 should be delivered next month. “We start with several airplanes in May, more in June and more in July and we start the ramp-up from there,” Teal said.

Every news report about cost of the “Mother of All Bombs” relied on a misreading of a 2011 article or a dubious internet website that InfoWars once linked to with a “healthy bit of skepticism.” The actual cost of the bomb is unknown. The actual cost of the program isn’t publicly available because the Mother of All Bombs, officially known as GBU-43 or the Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), is manufactured by the military and not a private defense company. (RELATED: US Drops ‘Mother Of All Bombs’ On ISIS In Afghanistan) In fact, the Air Force doesn’t even keep track of the per unit cost, nor the cost of the program as a whole, because it is not manufactured privately. “We don’t have a cost per unit” for the MOAB, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek told The Daily Caller News Foundation. “These munitions were produced in-house so we don’t have a standard procurement cost associated with them.” The Air Force mostly used existing technologies and hardware for the first MOAB prototypes and never contracted out the full production of the bomb, so they did not need to itemize and add the cost of each weapon component, Stefanek told TheDCNF. Many reports Thursday, including USA Today, the Washington Examiner, CNBC and others, claimed the MOAB cost $314 million to develop, citing a 2011 Los Angeles Times report. The cost estimates in that article, however, only refer to the cost of the Air Force’s biggest bunker busting bomb, the 5,300 pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), or GBU-57, which is built by private defense contractor Boeing Company. “At a total cost of about $314 million, the military has developed and ordered 20 of the GPS-guided bombs, called Massive Ordnance Penetrators,” the LA Times report says. The bomb dropped today in the middle of nowhere, Afghanistan, cost $314,000,000. https://t.co/mV6sJoMIFJ (credit @thenib) pic.twitter.com/aj0Om5RhAV — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) April 13, 2017 While the two bomb types are related, they serve different functions — the MOP is designed to destroy underground bunkers as deep as 200 feet below the surface, while the MOAP crushes everything on the surface within a wide radius. The MOAB, like its Daisy Cutter predecessor, can only be dropped out of a C-130 built by Lockheed Martin, and the MOP is deployed from the B-2, a Northrop Grumman aircraft. Many news organizations, including TIME and CNBC, also cited Deagel.com, a site with extensive lists of weapons assets owned by multiple countries, which claims the MOAB costs $16 million per unit, the same amount as the reported cost of the MOP. Deagel links to no source to verify its information. The site’s IP is registered to an address in Spain, and the most press they’ve received was for a 2015 prediction that the U.S. population would drop by more than 80 percent by 2025 due to an economic and cultural collapse. “The American collapse is set to be far worse than the Soviet Union’s one [sic],” the forecast said. InfoWars wrote this disclaimer when it wrote up Deagel’s report: “…we publish this report with some hesitation and a healthy bit of skepticism, yet find it compelling enough given the current global environment that it may be of interest to readers.” The Air Force did award at least one contract in the development of the bomb to Dynetics, a defense contractor headquartered in Huntsville, Ala., for design of the bomb’s guidance system for the relatively low sum of $35,000. The MOAB was developed rapidly leading up to the Iraq war in 2002. The bomb is based on the BLU-82/B “Daisy Cutter” used to clear helicopter landing sites in jungles during the Vietnam war. The Air Force Research Laboratory ordered design concepts for “a 21,000-pound weapon system called the Massive Ordnance Air Blast” in April 2002, according to a 2014 report Dynetics delivered to the Senate Committee on Appropriations. Dynetics then partnered with the Air Force to build and test three prototypes of the MOAB on March 11, 2003. Anyone within 20 miles of Eglin Air Force Base in Florida that day would have been able to see a giant mushroom cloud on the horizon at 1 p.m. The Air Force then “produced more than 10 weapons and delivered them between April and May,” according to the Senate report, just nine weeks after the successful test. The rapid development of the weapon could have cost more than $314 million. “Every technical glitch or roadblock we encountered was worked out,” Robert Hammack, who lead the design team for AFRL, said in an Air Force post about the history of the MOAB. “Our team was filled with engineers and other people with deeply important skill sets necessary to pull this off.” The MOAB is reportedly constructed at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, in Oklahoma, though a spokesman for McAlester could not confirm that to TheDCNF. The fact that the bomb was never used during the Iraq war doesn’t mean they didn’t have an effect, according to the Air Force. “The most amazing thing about MOAB is it’s the most powerful bomb ever built and has done its job — deterring the enemy — simply because they know about it,” Hammack said.

Moreover, the report also raised doubts over the feasibility of NASA's plans to send crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s or early 2040s, calling for a more detailed operational plan beyond 2021's Exploration Mission-2 (EM-2). "If the Agency is to reach its goal of sending humans to the vicinity of Mars in the 2030s, significant development work on key systems such as a deep space habitat, in-space transportation, and Mars landing and ascent vehicles must be undertaken in the 2020s, and the Agency will need to make these and many other decisions in the next 5 years or so for that to happen," the OIG wrote in its report, published Thursday. "In addition, to position itself to make wise investment decisions, NASA will need to begin developing more detailed cost estimates for its Mars exploration program after EM-2." Read: Boeing Unveils Concept Images For Deep Space Gateway, Transport Vehicle NASA's planned missions to the red planet rest on two legs — the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which is a successor to the agency’s now-defunct Space Shuttle program, and the Orion deep-space capsule. Under the space agency’s current plans, the first uncrewed integrated flight of Orion and SLS — Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) — is slated to take place no later than November 2018, and the first crewed launch would follow in 2021. During the first mission of SLS and Orion, NASA plans to send the spacecraft into a distant lunar retrograde orbit — a stable orbit that would involve a flyby of the moon. The space agency says that the challenging mission would help it test maneuvers needed to accomplish future missions to deep space. However, in its report, the OIG expressed skepticism over whether NASA would be able to meet its deadlines, citing both technical and budgetary hurdles. "Although the Agency’s combined investment for development of the SLS, Orion, and GSDO programs will reach approximately $23 billion by the end of fiscal year 2018, the programs’ average monetary reserves for the years leading up to EM-1 are much lower than the 10 to 30 percent recommended by Marshall Space Flight Center guidance," the report, published after a nine-month audit by the OIG, warned. "Low monetary reserves limit the programs’ flexibility to cover increased costs or delays resulting from unexpected design complexity, incomplete requirements, or technology uncertainties." The report comes less than two months after NASA began a feasibility study to consider the risks and benefits associated with adding astronauts to the first integrated launch of the SLS and Orion. If the study, expected to be completed by this spring, concludes that the benefits associated with a crewed flight outweigh the risks, it could push the target date for the first EM-1 mission to mid-2019.

(iStock Photo) Export-Import Bank funds went to a company accused by federal prosecutors of bribing foreign officials, records obtained by the Washington Examiner show. The U.S. government's Export-Import Bank is the subject of a congressional funding battle, with small-government types saying its "corporate welfare" for massive corporations like Boeing and should be eliminated. The federal agency has figured prominently in the rhetoric of early presidential contenders. Its employees, in an effort to preserve their jobs, say that most of its transactions help small American businesses. They also grease multimillion dollar foreign deals for companies like Diebold Inc., which the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission charged in 2013 with foreign corruption in China and Russia. The Ohio-based company paid nearly $50 million in penalties and agreed to accept a "compliance monitor" in exchange for deferred prosecution. "Diebold paid bribes and falsified documents in connection with the sale of ATMs to bank customers in China, Indonesia, and Russia," federal prosecutors said in a statement two years ago. "Diebold attempted to disguise the payments and benefits through various means, including by making payments through third parties designated by the banks and by inaccurately recording leisure trips for bank employees as 'training.' The court documents also allege that from 2005 to 2009, Diebold created and entered into false contracts with a distributor in Russia for services that the distributor was not performing." An inspector general's report shows that Ex-Im complied with lending its support to the company because the specific Ex-Im money involved transactions with Kazakhstan, not Russia or China. In the inspector general's review, Ex-Im officials said that funding recipients sign a certificate saying that they "have not engaged, or will engage, in any activity ... that is a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act," but noted that it also contains the caveat "in connection with this transaction." Kazakhstan, in central Asia, is a notoriously corrupt country, but the specific Department of Justice case did not involve that nation. Ex-Im provided about $83 million in "insured shipments, guaranteed credit or disbursed loan[s]," according to federal data. Spokesmen for the Ex-Im Bank did not immediately return a voicemail left this weekend seeking comment. A spokesman for Diebold did not return a similar email message.

Saturday, April 15, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets As government grows, K Street lobbyists get parallel boost by Luke Rosiak | Apr 14, 2015, 5:00 AM The 1300 block of K Street in northwest Washington, Thursday, Jan. 30th, 2014. (Graeme Jennings/Examiner File) Source: Congressional Budget Office, OpenSecrets.org. Lobbying has grown in direct proportion to government spending, with special interest groups consistently spending almost exactly $1 million for every billion dollars in federal expenditures. The correlation suggests that while liberal politicians portray K Street lobbyists as villains ruining Washington, it may be Big Government policies that attract them, according to a Washington Examiner analysis. The money spent on lobbying rose from $1.5 billion in 1998 to a high of $3.6 billion in 2010, during President Obama's stimulus package. During that same time period, spending grew from $1.7 trillion to $3.5 trillion. Experts said that as lawmakers have created new government programs and pumped up spending on existing programs, companies and activist groups have mobilized lobbyists to figure out how to cash in on the newfound money. "To paraphrase James Carville, drag a billion dollars through a trailer park, and there's no telling who will turn out," said Bill Allison, a lobbying expert at the Sunlight Foundation. "Lobbying is an overhead expense of Big Government — a constant." Sunlight is a nonprofit that seeks more government transparency. In some ways, it's a chicken-and-egg relationship, and a competing theory is that lobbyists are causing the government to grow. To be sure, some companies lobby to increase the federal budget in areas on which they can profit. That includes defense contractors like General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing; government consultants like Accenture; quasi-public entities like public television stations; and healthcare firms like Emergent BioSolutions and AdvaMed. But many companies would prefer lower taxes over new government spending. If their lobbyists were successful, the result should be less government spending — in order to balance out the lower taxes — rather than the increase in government outlays, as measured by the Congressional Budget Office. Lobbying on taxes are mammoth companies like Microsoft, Wal-Mart, ExxonMobil and FedEx. Those companies may boost their lobbying presence as a reaction to government growth, which they see signaling higher taxes on the horizon. Three thousand entities hired lobbyists on federal appropriations last year, while 2,000 hired lobbyists on tax issues, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Lobbyists generally don't create demand, they sense an opportunity and respond to it, Allison said. "If I didn't think government had an interest in funding me, I wouldn't be putting the effort into lobbying it." Often that interest comes in the form of well-intentioned programs crafted by liberals from which companies almost always seem to find a way to profit. Politicians created government-backed student loans, for example, out of concern for young people. But for-profit colleges now lobby heavily for them, and depend upon the revenue that results. Soda and junk food manufacturers lobby to boost the food stamp program, and green-energy companies' business models depend on legal carve-outs. Big Government spending on defense and national security has the same effect. Creation of a new cabinet-level agency, the Department of Homeland Security, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, set off a gold rush of lobbying, as did the heightened defense spending of the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, said Tim LaPira, a political science professor at James Madison University. Government taking on an expanded role — as it has done recently with healthcare — brings out lobbyists for both sides of an issue, as well as a crop of entities who were formerly not politically active, but now see a chance to profit. "A governmental decision to become involved in an issue area sets the agenda for existing and potential organized interests," LaPira and colleagues wrote in an academic paper titled "Drawing lobbyists to Washington." "If government had no authority over or involvement in an issue-area, then there would be little point in forming an interest group to lobby," LaPira and colleagues wrote. Demian Brady of the National Taxpayers Union noted that, while lobbying parallels federal spending, it doesn't match up so smoothly with federal revenues. "New federal programs create new constituencies who then lobby not only for additional benefits but to protect what they've already been granted," he said. "The benefits to the constituents of a given program are concentrated, while the costs of those programs are diffused, so that those people with the benefits have a much greater incentive to lobby on behalf of themselves than" taxpayers do to keep costs down.

Saturday, April 15, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets The Export-Import Bank socializes risk for private benefit by Veronique de Rugy | Jul 31, 2014, 5:00 PM (iStock) One reason that governments grow fast without many obstacles is because the benefits of expansion are concentrated on a few while the costs are spread among millions. Program beneficiaries have strong incentives to coordinate and protect their privileges. Average Americans, on the other hand, simply do not have the time or information to organize enough opposition to defeat these programs. They might bear the costs of government expansion, but individual programs only cost each American a few tax dollars here and there. Fighting for reform is simply not worth it. Bad programs proliferate, then, because cronyism pays more than stewardship. The Export-Import Bank is a prime example of this dynamic. There is no policy justification for this corporatist program. Economists have long known that these kinds of export credit subsidies will never raise the overall level of trade; rather, they redistribute wealth away from unsubsidized American firms, employees, and consumers and direct it toward a tiny number of subsidy beneficiaries. The bank is allowed to prosper and grow because its costs are spread over millions while its benefits are jealously protected by its few clients. A recent chart series that I produced for the Mercatus Center clearly illustrates this effect. The map above uses data from the Export-Import Bank to display Ex-Im disbursements in each state as a percentage of total disbursements. Washington is the clear winner in terms of total Ex-Im disbursements, receiving a massive 43.6 percent of all Ex-Im Bank disbursements from 2007 to 2014. Why? The state houses Boeing, one of Ex-Im Bank’s biggest beneficiaries, but the sheer size is nonetheless startling. Larger states like Texas and California only respectively pulled in 10.5 percent and 8.8 percent of total Ex-Im Bank disbursements during the same time. While businesses in most states barely benefit from the Ex-Im Bank at all, their taxpayers are just as exposed to Ex-Im Bank liabilities as taxpayers in handful of states that receive the most Ex-Im Bank backing. The same is true when look at the portion of total state exports backed by the Ex-Im Bank, as a second chart in the Mercatus series demonstrates. Washington is again the big winner, with an incredible 22.67 percent of state exports backed by the Ex-Im Bank since 2007. The state percentages drop off quickly from there. While almost four percent of Wisconsin’s exports and about 3.5 percent of Massachusetts’s exports were backed by the Ex-Im Bank, the Ex-Im Bank supported less than two percent of the exports of 41 states for the same time period. The truth of the matter is that the Ex-Im Bank yields negligible benefits for the vast majority of state exports, aside from one big outlier. These charts make it clear that the Ex-Im Bank primarily exists to benefit Boeing at the expense of everyone else in the country. You might wonder why lawmakers would refuse to acknowledge this reality. For one, politicians are pressured by an army of lobbyists representing powerful companies who are committed to protect their perks even if it hurts everyone else. But politicians are not exactly shrinking violets, here. They like being able to point to the small businesses and American jobs that they “support” through the Ex-Im Bank. What is much harder is to point to the millions of victims of the Ex-Im Bank. Taxpayers, for instance, bear a massive $140 billion exposure so that giant corporations like Boeing and General Electric can make a little more profit each year. Should the bank’s portfolio go south, normal people like you and I will be on the hook. Then there’s the economic distortions. Consumers face higher prices for airline travel, for instance, because the bank heavily subsidizes the foreign purchase of aircraft. Unsubsidized companies are subjected to an unleveled playing field. Because Ex-Im artificially lowers subsidized competitors’ financing costs, unsubsidized firms get crowded out of capital markets and find it hard to expand and maintain employment. If they fail, they won’t have the convenient assurance of a de facto taxpayer bailout like Boeing does. Since more than 98 percent of all U.S. exports receive no assistance from Ex-Im, this means the vast majority of Americans are victims who bear the costs of political privileges for a tiny number of politically-connected firms. Lawmakers should stand up for these unseen victims of the Ex-Im Bank. But they should also ask themselves why they are protecting a program that mostly benefits Washington.

Its corporate beneficiaries are fighting tooth and nail to protect their subsidies. Do not be fooled by their rhetoric. Insider lobbying groups like the Chamber of Commerce claim the Ex-Im Bank is about small business and jobs. Without the bank, they threaten, catastrophe will strike average Americans. This is just fear-mongering. The bank only subsidizes less than 2 percent of exports and jobs and less than 1 percent of small businesses in the U.S. each year. Most of this support directly benefits a handful of well-connected domestic and foreign firms, like Boeing and General Electric. Unfortunately, Ex-Im supporters know that “promoting small business” is a good way to conceal toxic Ex-Im corporatism. Take this piece in The Hill by Rep. Charles Boustany Jr., R-La. He argues that the bank primarily helps small businesses to gain customers, create thousands of jobs, and grow exports. These claims are misleading. First, the Ex-Im Bank's definition of a “small business” isn't exactly “small.” Most government bodies set the threshold at firms with fewer than 500 employees. Ex-Im “small businesses” can be three times that large and earn up to $21 million in annual revenues. This isn't “small” for most Americans. Even with this expansive definition, it is misleading to imply, as Boustany does, that Ex-Im supports most small business firms and jobs in America. In fact, Ex-Im's effect on U.S. small businesses and jobs is so tiny that you can hardly see it on the chart above. Data from Census Bureau's Statistics of U.S. Businesses dataset and this Export-Import Bank dataset show that only 0.3 percent of all small business jobs in 2007 (the most recent year for the Census dataset) were supported by the Ex-Im Bank. Assuming that each Ex-Im small business transaction went to a unique small business, only 0.04 percent of all small businesses were supported by Ex-Im that year. The pattern is similar on the state level. Consider Boustany's home state of Louisiana. Census data show that Louisiana exported $355 billion in goods and services from 2007 to 2014. Ex-Im reports that it supported $1.6 million of Louisiana's exports in that same time, $786 million of which went to small businesses. This means that only 0.44 percent of Louisiana’s exports were actually supported by the bank — which is lower than the national average of 1.6 percent. Additionally, Ex-Im only supported 0.22 percent in exports for small businesses in Louisiana. Boustany either doesn’t know the facts or he doesn’t care. Either way: Ex-Im is hardly critical for more than 99 percent of small businesses in the U.S. and his own state. That doesn’t stop Boustany from trying to scare Americans from ending the Export-Import Bank with visions of exports collapsing and economic catastrophe. The sad part is that the Export-Import Bank actually harms many U.S. small businesses and workers by subsidizing their competitors. Boustany doesn’t explain that when Ex-Im subsidizes one Louisiana firm, it penalizes all other unsubsidized firms and workers. Subsidized firms undoubtedly enjoy that these taxpayer-backed subsidies lower their costs and raise their profits, but they come at the cost of slower wage growth, less hiring, and more layoffs among the other 98 percent of unsubsidized exports. These unsubsidized Americans shouldn’t matter less than the few privileged firms who receive government subsidies. Boustany is right when he says that “American people are tired of Washington politicians playing political games when American jobs are at stake.” He should look in the mirror. More than 98 percent of jobs and exports in the U.S. bear the unjust costs of Ex-Im privileges for politically connected few. Members of Congress should represent all of us, not just those of us fortunate to have friends down at the Export-Import Bank.

In a well-timed statement, just as tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program and potential US airstrikes run wild, the NNSA said that in conjunction with the US Air Force, it had completed the first qualification flight test of B61-12 gravity nuclear bomb on March 14 at the Tonopah Test Range in Nevada.   #NNSA & @usairforce complete first B61-12 #LEP qualification flight test. @NellisAFB @NNSANevada https://t.co/cmhlhJsPnC pic.twitter.com/JbTpHn2cCB — Frank Klotz (@FrankKlotzNNSA) April 14, 2017 In the press release, the NNSA said that the “non-nuclear assembly test” was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base and was intended to evaluate “both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon.” This test was the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. “This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance in a realistic ballistic flight environment marks another on-time achievement for the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Lutton, NNSA’s principal assistant deputy administrator for military application. “The successful test provides critical qualification data to validate that the baseline design meets military requirements. It reflects the nation’s continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners.” The flight test included hardware designed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, manufactured by the Nuclear Security Enterprise plants, and mated to the tail-kit assembly section, designed by the Boeing Company under contract with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. Phil Hoover, an engineer at Sandia National Laboratories, shows off a flight test body for a B61-12 nuclear weapon The B61-12 consolidates and replaces four B61 bomb variants in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. The first production unit is scheduled to be completed by March 2020. The original B61 gravity bomb is the mainstay of the Air Force’s nuclear arsenal and one of the legs of the so-called nuclear triad, along with the intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed from either ground-based silos or oceangoing submarines. The B61 nuclear gravity bomb, deployed from U.S. Air Force and NATO bases, has almost 50 years of service, “making it the oldest and most versatile weapon in the enduring U.S. stockpile.” Numerous modifications have been made to improve the B61’s safety, security, and reliability since the first B61 entered service in 1968, and four B61 variants remain in the stockpile: the 3, 4, 7, and 11. However, the aging weapon system requires a life extension to continue deterring potential adversaries and reassuring our allies and partners of our security commitments to them. The B61-12 LEP will refurbish, reuse, or replace all of the bomb’s nuclear and non?nuclear components to extend the service life of the B61 by at least 20 years, “and to improve the bomb’s safety,  effectiveness, and security” according to the NNSA. The B61-12 first production unit will occur in FY 2020. The bomb will be approximately 12 feet long and weigh approximately 825 pounds. The bomb will be air-delivered in either ballistic gravity or guided drop modes, and is being certified for delivery on current strategic (B-2A) and dual capable aircraft (F-15E, F-16C/D & MLU, PA-200) as well as future aircraft platforms (F-35, B-21). President Trump has endorsed the ambitious and expensive plan to modernize the US nuclear triad, begun under his predecessor. The March test of the B61-12 was the first in a series to take place over the next three years, with the final design review due in September 2018 and the first production unit scheduled for completion by March 2020. Once the bomb is authorized for use in 2020, the US plans to deploy some 180 of the B61-12 precision-guided thermonuclear bombs to five European countries as follows: Belgium – 20; Germany -20; Italy – 70; Netherlands – 20; Turkey -50; … although in light of recent developments, and this weekend’s Turkish referendum which may grant Erdogan what are effectively dictatorial powers, it may consider reassessing the Turkish deployment. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-14/us-conducts-successful-field-test-new-nuclear-gravity-bomb Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

The Jet2 service had been due to leave for Prague in the Czech Republic at about 15:15 BST on Good Friday. But its departure was delayed when the cabin crew called for police assistance The airline apologised to affected customers and said it would "not let the behaviour of a disruptive few spoil the flight for everyone else". 'Stuck on tarmac' A spokesman for the carrier said the Boeing had to return to the airport's parking stand shortly before its scheduled take-off. Several passengers went on social media to describe the scene. One, Lauren Sian, said the group had been "damaging property, swearing and being disruptive" before they were escorted from the flight. Dave Illingworth tweeted: "Stuck on the tarmac at Manchester Airport as some idiot stags and their luggage are removed. Don't envy the jet2 staff at times like this." Jet 2 said police arrested one passenger while two others were "issued with public order offences". "We apologise to all other customers for the inconvenience that this has caused at the start of their bank holiday weekend. "However, as a family-friendly airline we will not let the behaviour of a disruptive few spoil the flight for everyone else." The flight eventually departed at 17:57 - a delay of more than two hours.

Jerry Brown to develop a comprehensive statewide plan to prevent other states from poaching California companies and jobs. Jay Mather Sacramento Bee file Business & Real Estate April 14, 2017 11:40 AM Feeling sting of Aerojet’s departure, Sacramento group calls for statewide jobs plan By Mark Glover mglover@sacbee.com The Greater Sacramento Economic Council on Friday called on the administration of Gov. Jerry Brown to develop a comprehensive statewide plan to prevent other states from poaching California companies and jobs. Members of the council’s board joined Executive Director Barry Broome in a brief news conference outside Wells Fargo Bank at 400 Capitol Mall. Congressman Ami Bera also attended the gathering, which was called in response to this week’s announcement that Aerojet Rocketdyne would relocate or eliminate about 1,100 of its 1,400 jobs in Rancho Cordova and shut down manufacturing operations in the city by 2019. Broome chastised the state for not doing enough to keep jobs in California and said the economic council was committed to a “new beginning to make jobs a priority.” He said the state “lacks compassion” when it comes to widespread job losses. Council officials cited Texas, Arizona, Minnesota, Washington and Alabama as having more sophisticated statewide economic development programs. Broome said such a program developed in California would “help communities like ours build a more advanced economy.” Bera, an Elk Grove Democrat, agreed and added: “This isn’t a handout to business. This is about creating jobs.” The congressman said he was “disappointed that we are losing these high-skilled jobs.” Broome cited the example of the state of Washington twice working to keep Boeing operations from moving over the past 14 years, an effort that brought billions of dollars in spending and taxes to Washington over that time. Brook Taylor, deputy director of the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, noted that a special GO-Biz committee on Thursday approved $91.4 million in tax credits for 114 companies. In an emailed statement, Taylor said “GO-Biz has a long-standing relationship with Aerojet and worked with them over the last couple years with regards to their facility in Rancho Cordova. “We were upset to see them decide to shift jobs elsewhere, and we are now focusing our efforts on the employees. We are working with the executives at Aerojet to mitigate further job losses, transition existing employees to new jobs and identify creative ways to repurpose their properties.” Taylor said the state is “focused on growing our overall economy, workforce development for the next generation of employees, helping launch our entrepreneurs and assisting existing companies (to) expand. As a result, California has led the nation in job growth the last three years running. The state is home to 20 percent of the U.S. headquarters, which is by far the most in the U.S. It’s the No. 1 state for manufacturing, biotech, logistics, film and many other categories.” On Monday, Aerojet announced that it would consolidate local manufacturing jobs in a new plant in Huntsville, Ala. The company said defense-related program management, engineering and related support positions in Sacramento will be moved to Huntsville by the end of 2018. The majority of the remaining local programs and support positions will be relocated to the company’s space headquarters in Los Angeles. The 300 employees who will remain in Rancho Cordova will work in finance, legal, personnel and other support functions. Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO Eileen Drake said the company is two years into a consolidation aimed at creating annual costs savings of $145 million when completed in 2019. The job cuts will close out a major chapter of Aerojet’s long history in the Sacramento area. Aerojet’s Rancho Cordova rocket engine-building operations date back to 1951. At its peak in 1963, amid the space race, Aerojet employed nearly 20,000 locally.

Times Community News Glendale News-Press News Rolling Robots co-founder shares how robotics impact students’ education Bing Jiang Tim Berger / Glendale News-Press Bing Jiang, co-founder of Rolling Robots, gives a presentation to a group of about 20 at Glendale Central Library on Wednesday, April 12, 2017. Bing Jiang, co-founder of Rolling Robots, gives a presentation to a group of about 20 at Glendale Central Library on Wednesday, April 12, 2017. (Tim Berger / Glendale News-Press) Kelly CorriganContact Reporter The use of robotics can be important in the education of children and teens —particularly in learning how to solve problems — according to co-founder of Rolling Robots, where students of various skill levels build robots. Former Boeing engineer Bing Jiang spoke to a couple dozen people at the Glendale Central Library during the city’s latest Tech on Tap event on Wednesday. Rolling Robots has a Glendale location and two other sites in the L.A. area. Jiang said she’s learned a lot from working with students as they build robotic creations during after-school programs, winter or summer camps or birthday parties. Some students go on to compete in robotics competitions. The youngest students involved are 4 years old, and they learn “simple stuff,” Jiang said, such as building electrical circuits. Older students have built and programmed a Lego robot to solve a Rubik’s cube, among other robots that solve complex tasks. Join the conversation on Facebook » Speaking about some of the students she’s met, Jiang learned several of their parents had previously tried to push them into playing a sport but were unsuccessful. “Most of them are not exactly into sports,” Jiang said. Some of them also needed to learn how to work with other students, or they’re shy and unsure about which aspect of the robot they should work on, whether building, programming or another component. Some students only learn how to work together after confronting each other during arguments. “Sometimes it’s physical,” Jiang said, jokingly. “We have to get that out of the way.” However, once the students are part of a team, they often excel, even if they endure huge setbacks, such as a motor stopping dead during a high-stakes competition. “Although you’re messing up, you can always pick up from where you are,” Jiang said. kelly.corrigan@latimes.com Twitter: @kellymcorrigan Copyright © 2017, Glendale News-Press Pushing school start times is good for students’ mental health and safety, experts say City Council approves funds for CicLAvia event in Glendale ‘We’ll be a regional destination’: Glendale Central Library’s $15-million renovation is unveiled Most Popular Coachella Local Sports Entertainment Politics Place An Ad 59°

SALVATORE ALU JR. All Education General News Missouri Apr 14, 2017 0 122 English Version Spanish Version Salvatore Alu Jr. Is a 17 year-old student from De Smet Jesuit High School and Boy Scouts’ member. He stands out among many of his pairs because of his commitment with serving the community and his outstanding leadership abilities. Red Latina spoke with him about how he dedicates his life to service and fulfillment of his potential. 1. What do you dedicate your life to? (what’s important activities in and outside of school contribute to your being a leader?) To start off, my idea of leadership is based off the idea of leadership by inspiration and motivation rather than intimidation and domination. It is not the idea of being the guy with the loudest mouth or the guy who knows how to give orders. Rather the true leaders are those who are willing to get down in the mud with their followers and partners and work for and with others to accomplish a goal. I run cross country and while cross country is an individual sport, it is also a team sport. For those who don’t know points are based off of the places of the top 5 runners of a team added together. Say the top five places for a team are 1st 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 16th. You get a team score of 32 points. The team with the lowest score wins, similar to golf. But with cross country, in order to get a better score, you have to train with your teammates not just in running, but in eating, sleeping and doing the little things to get better every day. When one teammate is down one day the other members in the running group work more together to have a successful day of staying on pace. Constant motivation is seen between the running group and the bigger connection of the entire team. That is because success in the sport it is all about taking care of the little things of your body and helping others achieve their goals as well as your own goals. On my cross country and track teams, I have been elected as team captain 3 seasons in a row and received two leadership awards in the sport. Another activity that I am involved in is Boy Scouts, which in which I have been elected in multiple leadership positions, including the highest scouting position as the Senior Parrol Leader of the Troop (who runs and plans meetings, outings and overall activity with a council of other scouts), and also achieved the highest rank of Boy Scouts: the Eagle Scout rank.  Within Boy Scouts, I was elected as the Troop 456 Sea Base High Adventure Crew Leader. As Crew Leader, I helped plan and run events as well as making sure our crew was ready for events throughout the high adventure. On this high adventure, we went scuba diving in the Florida Keys.  Within the world of Boy Scouts, I was a part of the Staff for the 2015 NYLT (National Youth Leadership Training). We trained Boy Scout youth through ethics of Boy Scouts. We went through leadership retreats and taught skills through presentations, challenges, and discussions in order to better leadership skills for the next generation of leaders within the Boy Scout world. I am also in Nation Honors Society in which certain individuals who best exemplify academic achievement as well as leadership in the class are elected into this group who help plan and run service events dedicated to giving back to the De Smet community. I am also the co-president of the Engineering club at my school. This club competes in different competitions involving in the subject of engineering and visiting engineering sites. One of the major competitions is the Boeing Glider Competition in which a team must design and build a plane based off one of three divisions. At my school, I am involved in the Compañeros Program in which a senior is chosen to act as senior advisor for the incoming freshman at my high school: De Smet Jesuit High School. These seniors sacrifice their senior homeroom to be in a homeroom with incoming freshmen, as they teach them the ropes, aid them into high school, and go on retreats with the freshmen. I have also have been apart of the leading staff for every class’ retreat. I led the Freshmen Oddyssey retreat. On this retreat, I assisted in leading groups of Freshmen through teamwork activities and ice-breakers in the summer before their Freshmen year of high school in order to gain a better sense of brotherhood and adapt to the new high school experience for these Freshmen. I led the El Camino Freshmen retreat. On this retreat, I assisted in leading groups of Freshmen through small-group meetings and presentations in order to gain a better sense of brotherhood in create better relationships as the Freshmen adapt to high school life. I led the Sophomore Ascent Retreat. On this retreat, I assisted in leading groups of Sophomores through teamwork activities as well as small-group meetings in order to gain a better sense of brotherhood and closer connection to religious faith I led De Smet’s 103rd Kairos Retreat. Kairos is a religious retreat led by each individual Catholic High School in the St. Louis area, as well as at Catholic high schools throughout the country. I led groups of high school juniors in order to help the participants contemplate their relationship with God, discover their own identity and build stronger bonds with their peers on a much deeper experience than previous retreats. 2. Where did your family come from? (Who immigrated and specifically what city?) Both sides of my family immigrated from the city of Palermo which is located in Sicily, Italy. My great grandparents along migrated with my grandparents (at adolescent ages) immigrated to the city of St. Louis, where my generation of the family resides today. 3. What are you studying and where? (Mention any recognition that you have received as a student, leader, or anything where you have shown above average level of dedication and commitment. I will be continuing my education at the University of Kansas to study in the field of Electrical Engineering. Academic awards that I have received include: First Honors (to have a 3.5 GPA or higher) every semester, National Honors Society, and Scholar Athlete Award (to have a 3.0 GPA while participating in a sport) every season. 4. What are the principle problems of the United States? Do you have any ideas on how to resolve them? Principle problems of the United States include the lack of servant leaders in the United States. In a utopia world, I would see people working together to overcome differences together as they work for and with others. By empowering others to be leaders rather than controlling the situation, we create more leaders rather than just followers. Productivity would increase, and the world could be a better place overall. 5. An ideal world, how would it look? I would see servant leaders who are willing to overcome differences and problems to get down in the mud with his followers and partners and work for and with others no matter what government system he/she lives in or background he/she comes from. 6. What does happiness mean to you? Quaker activist and writer, Parker Palmer, explains that the path of realizing and seeking one’s vocation becomes clear. In order to realizing true vocation, one must ultimately answer the question of “Who am I?” The vocation is finally achieved when the person has achieved true vocation; that is finding a vocation that “joins self and service…the place where your deep gladness meets the world’s deep need”. (Palmer 3). It is this notion of finding your true level of fulfillment that not only serves oneself concerning accomplishing a life goal but also contributes to helping the worldly need of service. My level of fulfillment comes from the idea of fulfilling my potential in all means of hard work that I can being school, sports, extra-circular etc. My goals in life include starting a family that I can support and graduating from college with a degree in engineering. My happiness will presumably derive from achieving this satisfaction and achievement with the hope that I can always learn new ways to better myself and those around me.   SALVATORE ALU JR. Salvatore Alu Jr. Es un estudiante de 17 años de De Smet Jesuit High School y miembro de los Boy Scouts. Él se destaca entre muchos de sus pares debido a su compromiso con el servicio a la comunidad y sus sobresalientes habilidades de liderazgo. Red Latina habló con él sobre cómo dedica su vida al servicio y la realización de su potencial. 1. ¿A qué dedica su vida? (¿Qué actividades importantes dentro y fuera de la escuela realiza que le ayudan a ser un líder?) Para empezar, mi idea de liderazgo se basa en la premisa de ser un líder por inspiración y motivación, en lugar de intimidación y dominación. No es la idea de ser el tipo con la boca más fuerte o el tipo que sabe cómo dar órdenes. Más bien los verdaderos líderes, son aquellos que están dispuestos a meterse en el barro con sus seguidores y socios, y trabajar para y con otros para lograr una meta. Practico el cross country y aunque es un deporte individual, es también un deporte de equipo. Para aquellos que no saben, los puntos se basan en los lugares de los 5 mejores corredores de un equipo. Digamos que los cinco primeros lugares para un equipo son el 1º 3º, 5º, 8º y 16º. Usted obtiene una puntuación en equipo de 32 puntos. El equipo con la puntuación más baja gana, similar al golf. Pero en cross country, con el fin de obtener una mejor puntuación, tienes que entrenar con tus compañeros de equipo no sólo corriendo, sino incluso con la comida, con el dormir y hacer pequeñas cosas juntos para mejorar cada día. Cuando un compañero de equipo está mal, los otros miembros en el grupo trabajan más unidos para mantener un buen ritmo. La motivación en el grupo es constante y se da una mayor conexión entre todo el equipo. Esto ocurre porque el éxito en el deporte se trata de cuidar el cuerpo y ayudar a otros a alcanzar sus metas, así como las propias. En mis equipos de cross country y pista, he sido elegido como capitán del equipo por 3 temporadas seguidas y recibí dos premios de liderazgo en el deporte. Otra actividad en la que estoy involucrado son los Boy Scouts, en donde he sido elegido en múltiples posiciones de liderazgo, incluyendo el más alto puesto de exploración como Líder Parlamentario Superior de la Tropa (quien dirige y planea reuniones, salidas y actividades generales con un consejo de otros exploradores), y también logré el rango más alto de Boy Scouts: el rango de Eagle Scout. Dentro de Boy Scouts, fui elegido como el Jefe del Equipo de Aventura de la Base del Mar de la Tropas 456. Como Líder de Tripulación, ayudé a planificar y ejecutar eventos, así como a asegurarme de que nuestra tripulación estuviera preparada durante la gran aventura en la que fuimos a bucear en los Cayos de la Florida. Dentro del mundo de Boy Scouts, fui parte del Personal para el NYLT 2015 (National Youth Leadership Training). Hemos entrenado a jóvenes Boy Scouts sobre la ética de la organización. Pasamos por retiros de liderazgo y enseñamos habilidades a través de presentaciones, desafíos y discusiones, para mejorar las habilidades de liderazgo en la próxima generación de líderes dentro del mundo Boy Scout. También estoy en la Sociedad de Honores de la Nación, en el que ciertas personas que ejemplifican el logro académico, así como el liderazgo en la clase, son elegidos para formar parte de este grupo que ayuda a planificar y ejecutar eventos dedicados a servir a la comunidad De Smet. También soy el copresidente del club de Ingeniería de mi escuela. Este club compite en diferentes concursos involucrados en el tema de la ingeniería y se visitan lugares claves de la industria. Uno de los principales es el Boeing Glider Competition en el cual un equipo debe diseñar y construir un avión basado en una de tres divisiones. En mi escuela, estoy involucrado en el “Programa Compañeros” en el cual se elige a un alumno para que sea el asesor principal para un estudiante de primer año que ingrese en mi escuela: De Smet Jesuit High School. Los alumnos Senior sacrifican su salón principal para estar en un salón de clases con los nuevos estudiantes de primer año, les enseñan a hacer las cuerdas, les ayudan en la escuela secundaria, y van a retiros juntos. También he sido parte del personal principal para el retiro que se realiza para cada clase. Dirigí el retiro de Freshmen Oddyssey. En este retiro ayudé a dirigir grupos de estudiantes de primer año a través de actividades de trabajo en equipo para romper el hielo, durante el verano antes de su primer año de preparatoria. Esto les ayuda a los estudiantes de primer año a obtener un mejor sentido de hermandad y a adaptarse a la nueva experiencia de la preparatoria. Dirigí el retiro de los recién llegados de “El Camino”. En este retiro, ayudé a dirigir grupos de estudiantes de primer año a través de reuniones de grupos pequeños y presentaciones, con el fin de obtener un sentido de fraternidad y crear mejores relaciones, para que los estudiantes de primer año puedan adaptarse a la vida de la escuela secundaria. Dirigí el Retiro del Ascenso para estudiantes de Segundo Año. En este retiro, ayudé a dirigir grupos de estudiantes de segundo año a través de actividades de trabajo en equipo, así como reuniones de grupos pequeños, con el fin de obtener una sensación de hermandad y una conexión más cercana a la fe religiosa Dirigí el 103º Retiro de Kairos de De Smet. Kairos es un retiro religioso dirigido por cada escuela secundaria católica en el área de St. Louis, así como en las escuelas secundarias católicas en todo el país. Dirigí a grupos de jóvenes de secundaria para ayudarles a contemplar su relación con Dios, descubrir su propia identidad y construir vínculos más fuertes con sus compañeros en una experiencia mucho más profunda que los retiros anteriores. 2. ¿De dónde viene su familia? (¿Quién emigró y específicamente a qué ciudad?) Ambos lados de mi familia emigraron de la ciudad de Palermo, que se encuentra en Sicilia, Italia. Mis bisabuelos migraron con mis abuelos (en edades adolescentes), y llegaron a la ciudad de St. Louis, donde mi generación de la familia reside hoy. 3. ¿Qué está estudiando y dónde? (Mencione cualquier reconocimiento que haya recibido como estudiante, líder o cualquier actividad donde haya mostrado un nivel de dedicación y compromiso por encima del promedio). Voy a continuar mi educación en la Universidad de Kansas, para estudiar en el campo de la Ingeniería Eléctrica. Los premios académicos que he recibido incluyen: First Honors (por tener un GPA 3,5 o superior) cada semestre, la National Honors Society y el premio Scholar Athlete (por tener un GPA 3.0 mientras participan en un deporte) cada temporada. 4. ¿Cuáles son los principales problemas en los Estados Unidos? ¿Tiene alguna idea sobre cómo resolverlos? Los principales problemas de los Estados Unidos incluyen la falta de líderes dedicados al servicio en el país. En un mundo de utopía, vería a las personas trabajando juntas para superar las diferencias mientras trabajan para y con los demás. Al capacitar a otros para ser líderes en lugar de controlar la situación, creamos más líderes que seguidores. La productividad aumentaría, y el mundo podría ser un lugar mejor en general. 5. Un mundo ideal, ¿cómo se vería? Vería a líderes enfocados al servicio, que están dispuestos a superar las diferencias y los problemas para meterse en el barro con sus seguidores y socios, trabajando para y con otros sin importar en qué sistema de gobierno viva o de donde venga. 6. ¿Qué significa la felicidad para ti? El activista y escritor cuáquero, Parker Palmer, explica que el camino de la realización y búsqueda de la vocación se hace claro. Para alcanzar la verdadera vocación, hay que responder finalmente a la pregunta de “¿Quién soy yo?” La vocación se logra cuando la persona ha alcanzado la verdadera vocación; Lo que se traduce en encontrar una vocación que “le una a sí mismo y al servicio… el lugar donde su alegría se encuentre con las necesidades del mundo”. (Palmer 3). Es esta noción de encontrar el verdadero nivel de realización personal, donde no sólo se sirve a sí mismo en relación con el logro de un objetivo de vida, sino que también contribuye a ayudar a la necesidad de servicio que hay en el mundo. Mi nivel de realización personal proviene de la idea de cumplir mi potencial en todos los ámbitos, trabajando duro en la escuela, los deportes, actividades extra-curriculares, etc. Mis metas en la vida incluyen formar una familia que pueda apoyar y graduarme de la universidad en Ingeniería. Mi felicidad probablemente se derivará de lograr estas metas, con la esperanza de que siempre podré encontrar nuevas maneras de mejorar para mí mismo y para los que me rodean.                                                 TAGS Boy Scouts De Smet Jesuit High School Missouri Red Latina SALVATORE ALU JR.

Joe Wilson take a back seat ride in a Lockheed jet by Travis J. Tritten | Apr 14, 2017, 12:37 PM Two lawmakers rode in a T-50A during a demonstration in South Carolina this week. (Screengrab) Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Joe Wilson spent one of the first days of their congressional recess getting a first-hand preview of what could be the Air Force's next trainer jet. The two lawmakers rode in a T-50A during a demonstration in South Carolina this week, yielding some video of Wilson soaring through the blue skies over Greenville. The event might also be important publicity for Lockheed Martin, which is hoping to sell the jet trainer this year as part of the T-X competition and beat out its rival Boeing. "The T-50A would be an asset for training military pilots and represents the latest in advanced technology," Wilson, a House Armed Services subcommittee chairman, said in a released statement following his flight. The two defense industry titans are dueling for the T-X next-generation trainer program that could reportedly be worth $16 billion. The Air Force is looking for a new two-seat trainer to replace its aging T-38 Talons, which entered service in 1961. The replacement jet would be used to train pilots on the F-22 Raptor and the fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which is made by Lockheed. Graham's staff is declining to release any video of the senator's flight, citing Senate rules. Wilson infamously shouted "you lie" to President Obama as he was addressing Congress in 2009. This week, residents shouted the line against Wilson during a town hall meeting. Travis J.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Amber Phillips By Amber Phillips April 14 at 12:06 PM Follow byamberphillips President Trump is changing his tune on NATO, China's currency, Syria and many other policies he campaigned on. The Post's Jenna Johnson looks at why his stances have shifted now that he's in the White House. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) You can say this for President Trump: Unlike most other politicians, he's totally at peace with changing his mind at any given moment, with very little explanation. But where are these sudden changes coming from? Is it for a desire to moderate his populist policies? Is he suddenly reading briefing books? Or could it be that the president simply amenable to the last person he talked to? On that last point, we've noticed that some of his biggest flip-flops on a key issue of his issue happen immediately after he's talked to a person directly involved on the other side. To wit: 1. On labeling China a currency manipulator Trump during the campaign: He promised to do this on day one, arguing that it would force China to adhere to the same currency standards the United States does and thus make the trade playing field more even. (Many economists say that theory is outdated, but that's another story.) Trump on Wednesday, days after meeting with China's president: “They're not currency manipulators,” he told the Wall Street Journal. President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Fla. (Jim Watson/AFP) 2. On whether China's doing enough to tame North Korea China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 After talking to the Chinese president last week: “After listening for 10 minutes, I realized it’s not so easy,” he told the Journal of China's dynamic with North Korea. " ... I felt pretty strongly that had a tremendous power. But it's not what you would think.” 3. On NATO's usefulness Trump during the campaign: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance of some 28 European and North American countries, is “obsolete.” On Wednesday, at a joint news conference with NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg: “I said it was obsolete. It is no longer obsolete.” During a joint news conference with North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, April 12, President Trump said NATO is "no longer obsolete." (The Washington Post) 4. On whether the Export-Import Bank should stay or go Trump during the campaign: It's “unnecessary,” he said, siding with conservatives like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) who think the quasi-government agency that helps finance U.S. business exports and projects abroad is “crony capitalism.” Trump now: “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing,'" he told the Journal in that interview Wednesday. “But actually, it’s a very good thing.” The Journal later reported Trump changed his mind after meeting earlier this year with Dennis Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, whose company is a beneficiary of the bank's work: The CEO "explained to him what role the bank plays, according to people familiar with the matter." 5. On how easy repealing the Affordable Care Act would be Trump during the campaign: “I think disaster. ... It should be repealed and replaced, and if I'm elected, we're going to repeal it, replace it with something much better, much better and much less expensive.” Trump after meeting with insurance chief executives after being inaugurated: “Now, I have to tell you, it's an unbelievably complex subject,” he said while addressing Republican governors. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” President Trump spoke about efforts to overhaul health care in America at the National Governors Association meeting at the White House, Feb. 27. He is expected to talk about health care, among other topics, in an address to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28. (Reuters) 6. On the use of torture Trump shakes hands with retired Marine Corps general Jim Mattis in November. (Carolyn Kaster/AP) Trump during the campaign: “Torture works,” he said during the campaign and shortly after being inaugurated. President-elect Trump after interviewing his now-Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis for the job: The New York Times got Trump's thoughts afterward about Mattis and torture: “He said, “I've never found it to be useful. Give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I'll do better. I was very impressed by that answer. Torture, he said, is 'not going to make the kind of a difference that a lot of people are thinking.'” Addendum: At a news conference his first week in office, Trump reconciled the differences: “I happen to feel that it does work. I’ve been open about that for a long period of time. But I am going with our leaders. And we’re going to — we’re going to win with or without, but I do disagree.” 7. On the "failing New York Times" Trump, dozens of times during and after the campaign: No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2016 Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena" — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 13, 2016 The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 Trump, at the end of sitting down with the Times shortly after his election: He called the paper “a great, great American jewel.” Also this Thursday: President Trump met with first responders from Atlanta at the White House on April 13, and introduced them to the media. "You know these folks back here," he said. "It's called the media. They're very honorable people. But you're more honorable, I can tell you that," he added. (The Washington Post) Trump's advisers don't seem to think any of these flagrant flip-flops are a problem. He's a new president, he's new to politics, he's new to governing. Of course he's going to hear other views out. Here's new reporting from WaPo's ace White House team: One former Trump aide, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said that the president is known to form initial opinions based on instinct but later to change his stance based on new information and the influence of his advisers. “He has a general reaction to something, then after he does a lot more homework on the situation, he can change his view,” the former adviser said. “The reason most of these voters voted on him was less because of the core issues, it was more based on the Trump decision-making, the Trump judgment.” But especially lately, the Trump judgment seems quite amenable based on whom he's talking to. politics the-fix Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Apr 14, 2017 at 10:13AM "Imagine an unstoppable commercial Learjet with a full-automatic cannon in its nose and an iron bathtub surrounding the cockpit. That gives you some idea of the A-10's appearance and performance." That's how Mother Jones describes the U.S. Air Force's A-10 Thunderbolt II, a 1970s-vintage close air support (CAS) fighter lovingly referred to as the "Warthog" for its homely appearance. Ugly the A-10 may be, but experts aver that the Warthog is also "the best CAS platform mankind has ever designed." And yet, as this aircraft enters its fifth decade of service, the Air Force worries that the A-10 Warthog is getting a bit long in the tooth. Multiple rounds of upgrades by "prime" contractors Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and even brand-new wing-sets manufactured by Boeing (NYSE:BA), can keep the Warthog flying for years to come. But no plane can fly forever. Eventually, the Air Force will need to replace the Warthog -- perhaps with Lockheed Martin's own F-35 stealth fighter (as the Air Force has repeatedly tried to do), or perhaps with something else. Foreseeing this day, about a year ago, the Air Force announced a plan to begin vetting potential replacements for the A-10's ground support mission -- specifically, a light attack fighter yet-to-be-named but temporarily dubbed the "OA-X." This A-10 Warthog seems to take umbrage at the idea that any other plane could replace it. Image source: Getty Images. What is OA-X? The Air Force wants to buy 300 light attack OA-X fighter planes -- this is known. What is not known (yet) is precisely what plane OA-X refers to, or will be. Reportedly, the guiding principle of picking an OA-X will be cost, both cost to acquire (the Air Force would really like to buy an off-the-shelf, already-existing warbird rather than develop something all new) and cost to operate. In the latter regard, the Air Force would probably prefer a fuel-sipping turboprop design over a jet-powered aircraft -- although the latter would surely be more survivable. Weapons-wise, OA-X should be armable to the teeth, capable of carrying everything from smart bombs to air-to-air missiles, ground attack rockets, and .50-cal machine guns. Who will win the OA-X contract? As one half of the "Prime Team" responsible for keeping the Warthog flying (and the inheritor of all of the A-10's technical data, after original manufacturer Fairchild-Republic went defunct), Northrop is probably best-positioned to know what kind of low-cost aircraft can best replace the A-10's mission. There's a question, though, as to whether Northrop Grumman will compete on this contract at all. Right now, Northrop arguably has its hands full trying to win the Air Force's much bigger "T-X" trainer jet contract, which, with a potential value of $50 billion, is a much more valuable prize than OA-X. Compared to that, the value of winning the OA-X contract (perhaps $4.5 billion for 300 aircraft priced at $15 million a pop, for example) might not hold much interest. Indeed, already, two of Northrop's rivals on T-X -- Boeing and Lockheed Martin -- have indicated they will pass on OA-X, perhaps to better focus their efforts on winning the trainer contract away from Northrop. That leaves second-tier aerospace builder Textron (NYSE:TXT) as the potential front-runner for winning OA-X. For years, Textron has been trying to interest the Air Force (or anyone else, really) in buying its internally developed Scorpion fighter jet for light attack missions. Textron also builds the AT-6 Wolverine, a prop-driven light attack bird once mooted for consideration as a light attack plane for the Afghan air force.  With two ready-built aircraft to offer the U.S. Air Force for its light attack needs, Textron already has a head start in competing for OA-X. And with annual revenue of only $4.9 billion from its aviation division, the company might have more than ordinary interest in winning a $4.5 billion OA-X contract -- and the extra years' revenues that come with it. Both of these factors suggest Textron will pursue this contract doggedly. If Northrop does want to win this one, though, it had better get a move on.

Pool The presidential learning curve remains steep for Donald Trump 04/14/17 09:30 AMUpdated 04/14/17 12:08 PM By Steve Benen One of Donald Trump’s most important early flip-flops came just 11 days into his presidency. As a candidate, Trump broke with Republican Party orthodoxy and endorsed lowering prices on prescription drugs by using Medicare’s negotiating power. That, however, did not last. On Jan. 31, after a meeting with executives and lobbyists from the pharmaceutical industry, Trump denounced the idea he used to support, calling it a form of “price fixing” that would hurt “smaller, younger companies.” Trump had one set of beliefs, he heard conflicting information, so he adopted a different set of beliefs. The Wall Street Journal noted a similar shift this week on the U.S. Export-Import Bank. During the campaign, Mr. Trump was skeptical of Ex-Im Bank, which funds U.S. trade deals, calling it “unnecessary.” The bank has been a target of Republican criticism, which Mr. Trump seized on. But that view changed earlier this year after he talked to Boeing Co. CEO Dennis Muilenburg, who explained to him what role the bank plays, according to people familiar with the matter. Explaining his new position, Trump told the Wall Street Journal this week that he “was very much opposed” to the Export-Import Bank, but “it turns out [that] lots of small companies will really be helped.” There’s been quite a bit of discussion this week about Trump’s many 180-degree turns and what the reversals tell us about his presidency. There’s been commentary about Trump “moderating,” “pivoting,” becoming more “conventional,” and choosing sides between the competing factions in his West Wing. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer went so far yesterday as to argue that Trump isn’t really flip-flopping, so much as the issues are “evolving towards the president’s position.” In other words, Trump isn’t changing; the world is. That’s obviously foolish, but even putting Spicer’s nonsense aside, it seems much of the political world is over-thinking this. Consider the importance of the key phrase in Trump’s Ex-Im Bank explanation: “it turns out.” Trump, with literally no background in government, politics, or public service before taking the nation’s highest office, took firm stands on a wide variety of issues he knew nothing about. As a rule, this isn’t a wise approach – it’s generally better to rely on some information before coming up with opinions – but this guy threw caution to the wind, and 46% of the American electorate found it compelling. Now, however, Trump is adopting an entirely different set of opinions on many issues, not as part of some grand ideological rebranding, but because some folks gave him new information he found compelling. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) explained this yesterday by saying, “Some of the things that were said during the campaign, I think he now knows simply aren’t the way things ought to be.” That’s an exceedingly polite way of saying, “Trump had no idea what he was talking about when he ran for the nation’s highest office, but a variety of people are now guiding him new directions.” Some sympathetic figures may find all of this vaguely encouraging. Perhaps it’s a good thing, optimists will argue, that the president is acquiring new information and drawing new conclusions. It’s at least preferable to him ignoring evidence and sticking to old assumptions that never really made any sense. But what this overlooks is the fact that Trump is still lost without a map. Someone told him the Ex-Im Bank is a good idea, and the president effectively responded, “Oh, OK, that sounds good. I’ll think that now.” What’s to stop some other person from persuading him in the opposite direction tomorrow? Nothing. And that’s the problem. Because Trump has no core beliefs about government or public policy, he’s inclined to listen to the most voice he finds credible, but there’s no reason to assume he won’t change his mind again and again. This isn’t a pivot or a rebranding; it’s chaos borne of ignorance.  Explore: The MaddowBlog and Donald Trump Asked about privacy changes, GOP rep says... Trump's praise for the military comes...

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News Engineering affects virtually every aspect of our lives, and at the University of Arizona’s Engineering Design Day on May 1, more than 500 students intend to prove it. Printer-friendly version „Engineering Design Day is our biggest event — there’s nothing else like it,” said Jeff Goldberg, dean of the College of Engineering. „It is the ultimate proving ground for our students and a unique opportunity for employers to see on a grand scale what our students, with industry and faculty partners, can achieve.„ People of all interests, abilities and ages will marvel at the 100-plus tools and technologies to improve health, safety and national security; boost cost- and energy-efficiency and worker productivity; mine big data and manage big mines; strengthen and secure communication networks; and make faster, lighter and smarter planes, trains, self-driving cars and rockets. Some projects are designed to save lives, others to save time and money.  The public is invited to see the displays in the Student Union Memorial Center Grand Ballroom and on the UA Mall from 11 a.m. until 4 p.m., and to attend the awards ceremony in the ballroom from 4 to 5:30 p.m., when industry sponsors will present more than $25,000 in cash prizes to project teams. Now in its 15th year, Design Day is the culmination of the college’s Engineering Design Program, in which teams of five or six students spend an entire academic year taking sponsors’ projects from concept to reality. Many of the students receive job offers from sponsors. Some projects result in patents assigned to sponsors, and some of the prototypes go on to become products and services used around the globe. This year’s 90-plus sponsors include Raytheon, Honeywell, Texas Instruments, Caterpillar, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble, as well as more than a dozen UA faculty. Public and government agencies sponsoring projects range from NASA and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research to Salt River Project and the city of Bisbee. Three Strikes and … A robotic softball umpire making its debut at Design Day features the laser-sharp accuracy of lidar, a pulsed laser used to measure distances, and LED technology in calling strikes. In pro baseball, radar and camera technologies produce the graphics viewers see on TV screens showing a ball’s position relative to the strike zone after a pitch. But the systems are mostly used for in-game and postgame analysis, said Jeffrey Thomas Bragg, a senior in engineering management and team leader. RoboUmp can be easily installed in the field without interrupting players and be used during games. The system is designed to make a call live, within one second of a pitch. The team of five seniors — with the others majoring in systems, electrical and optical sciences engineering — plans to demonstrate RoboUmp’s skills, but only to a degree. „The ball will not be flying at high speeds around the ballroom!” Bragg promised. Danielle Craig, a 2011 graduate in mechanical engineering and a mentor to the team, is a rotors design engineer with Boeing, which is sponsoring the project. She is one of the many UA engineering alumni who help make Design Day possible by serving as mentors and judges. „The scope of senior design projects submitted by industry becomes more challenging every year, and the students at the University of Arizona consistently exceed expectations,” Craig said. „Boeing looks forward to seeing the final deliverable from our team and all the teams.” Walk This Way Sponsors pitch their projects to engineering design students each year in late summer at the program’s open house. Hermelinda Bristol was there with her family, recruiting UA students to build an unpowered exoskeleton for her son Jeffrey, a UA junior in accounting who has cerebral palsy. Jason Keatseangsilp was the first person in line. „One of the reasons I chose biomedical engineering was so I could get into rehabilitative engineering,” said the team leader for the unpowered exoskeleton project. „I raced through the doors, and I’m really glad I did because it turned out to be one of the longest lines. This project has a lot of heart.” Six seniors in biomedical, materials science and mechanical engineering are fabricating the exoskeleton with an aluminum frame for Jeffrey’s legs and feet and a plastic brace made with a 3-D printer for his waist and lower back. The device will help him, and perhaps others with cerebral palsy, stay upright while exercising the muscles needed to walk. „Jeffrey has trouble walking, but he can walk on his own and doesn’t need a powered device like I do,” said Keatseangsilp, who has a spinal cord injury and uses a wheelchair. „We’re really trying to create a device that will engage Jeffrey’s key anatomical features — for example, by giving him good core stability and facilitating a normal gait pattern.” The exoskeleton is one of 22 Design Day projects with biomedical applications. Others include a mobile quarantine unit for isolating and transporting people exposed to infectious viruses and a neighborhood external defibrillator network for treating heart attacks.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 14 April 2017 by Military News Border Adjustable Tax Another Way to Grow Government Since President Trump was elected, the stock market has been doing well. Many attribute the performance to optimism about fundamental tax reform, in particular, the destructive corporate income tax system. RELATED ARTICLES MORE ARTICLES BY There are good reasons to be optimistic. You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks the corporate income tax system doesn’t need fundamental changes. Until recently there was a widespread and bipartisan consensus about the need to address the problem. At 35 percent, the U.S. has the highest corporate rate of all wealthy nations. Unlike most of our competitors, we also have a worldwide tax system. This means Uncle Sam taxes income earned by companies overseas, income already subject to tax if they bring it back to the United States. This has created a highly uncompetitive environment for U.S. companies doing business at home and abroad. In the wake of the election, Republicans had a golden opportunity to enact long-cherished reforms. This optimism overlooked the Republicans’ incredible tendency to make self-defeating decisions. Rather than being well on their way to passing a tax reform plan that would grow the economy and simplify the tax code, momentum has been dissipated in a counterproductive fight over a „border-adjustable” provision being pushed by House Republicans as part of a new 20 percent tax on businesses. This provision of the Better Way Plan, which otherwise promotes growth and reduces penalties against work, savings and investment, disallows any deductions for imports (which is the same as levying a tax) and eliminates all taxes on revenue generated by exports. It feels like export mercantilism because it is another attempt to hammer imports while promoting exports. Its proponents have admitted they hoped it would dissuade the president to impose more punishing tariffs. The immediate result is the dividing of the business community, which surely would be unified in support of a GOP plan absent the border adjustable tax. The usual beneficiaries of other pro-export corporate welfare policies, like Boeing and GE, are, not surprisingly, cheering the measure. American retailers who rely heavily on imports are lined up against it. A company the size of Walmart might stomach the extra cost but small businesses with razor-sharp profit margins may not survive the change. There is also the risk of increasing consumer prices to offset the impact of the import tax, although proponents claim the value of the dollar will automatically rise in value and neutralize the impact on trade. Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady (R-TX) recently told Politico Pro, „I’m confident that the currency does adjust very efficiently and quickly, which avoids consumer price impacts. Indeed, friction-free economic textbook models predict the dollar will adjust perfectly and immediately to offset the pain of the new tax. In the real world, where different actors react in anticipation of future policies, where adjustments may not be instantaneous, where politicians often mess up the implementation and the management of tax policy, the outcome can be quite different. Empirical studies done by my colleagues and I have found something less than perfection. As for the final result, no one really knows for sure. This uncertainty is reflected in recent comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen during testimony to Congress. She said, „The problem is there’s great uncertainty about how in reality markets would really respond to these changes … A strong set of assumptions is needed to believe that markets would fully offset those changes. … It’s very difficult to know just what would happen.” No other country has a border-adjustable corporate income tax, compounding the uncertainty. You wouldn’t know it listening to BAT proponents regurgitating misleading soundbites suggesting other countries have border-adjustable taxes. What they are talking about is the Value-Added-Tax (VAT), levies on top of corporate income taxes. Based on their economic performance and the size of their governments, these are not the countries advocates of free markets should try to emulate on tax policy. The border tax is the brainchild of economist Alan Auerbach, former adviser to former presidential candidate John Kerry. Auerbach first presented the idea in a 1997 paper, The Future of Fundamental Tax Reform. He revisited it for the Center for American Progress/The Hamilton Project in 2010, openly arguing for the end of tax competition and lower tax rates to relieve the pressure on politicians. Many ideas for making government more efficient emanate from the left, but they are never, ever about making government smaller. Nor do they protect taxpayers from the abuse of Uncle Sam. Some economists are already making the case that this tax is so efficient and distortion-free (as if such a thing exists) that the rate should be much higher than 20 percent. It has been remarkable to see so many conservatives and Republicans fighting hard for this plan. Also interfering in a perfect currency adjustment is the fact that the World Trade Organization will likely challenge the tax as discriminatory. And indeed it does add some distortions to the current system. The WTO poses another real risk: the possibility that the United States would adopt a dreaded big government VAT. A future Elizabeth Warren administration would only be happy to transform the BAT into a VAT and in a matter of time revive a corporate tax to drop on top of our VAT. I believe many proponents would not support the BAT proposal if they didn’t see it as the way to pay for the other very good aspects of the Republican blueprint. Scores of the plan have shown none of the economic growth comes from the BAT. But it would raise $1.1 trillion to pay for pro-growth features like lower rates, full expensing and a move to a territorial system. That’s important to BAT advocates now that Republicans must use the reconciliation process to push tax reform through the Senate. The process requires a deficit neutral proposal in order to make permanent changes. If we want all the good stuff in the plan, this logic goes, we’ve got to pass the BAT. That’s nonsense. The price is a terribly risky and unfair new tax, which may devolve into a money machine VAT. Instead, we should first settle for a smaller plan that would improve the system dramatically (lower the rate and move to the territorial system). In a second phase, Congress could implement other reforms. This two phase reform is what Republicans did in the 80s and while it wasn’t easy, it worked well. We could also offset the tax cuts with spending cuts. There are plenty of ideas to do that. Alternatively, we could finance the pro-growth tax cuts with a mix of spending cuts and smaller offsetting revenue increases (such as getting rid of the state and local tax deduction or ending the municipal bond interest exemption). The BAT tax is so complicated lawmakers still have no clue how they will treat services, and financial services in particular, under the plan. As mentioned earlier, it also undermines tax competition, exposing the country to the risk of higher tax rates down the road. And don’t get me started on the other misleading arguments used by those supporting the new levy. There are many more arguments against the BAT. This is a bad idea, seriously putting at risk the possibility of advancing tax reform. And if the Republican leadership doesn’t give it up, I predict tax reform will end the same way health care reform did.

The maiden flight marked another step in Boeing’s revamp of its best-selling product line that could see up to five new models introduced by 2020. 737 MAX 9, a fuel-efficient, long-range successor to the 737-900, made a test mission, about 50 years after the 737 first took to the skies on April 9, 1967. It followed the first flight of Boeing’s largest Dreamliner model, the 787-10, in March, from its factory in South Carolina. The new models are coming to market just as demand for aircraft has slowed. Boeing has committed to making four new 737 versions and is considering a bigger version than the MAX 9, known as the 737 MAX 10X. “It could begin delivering that version in 2020 if airlines start ordering it this year, with China emerging as a promising market,” Michael Teal, 737 MAX Chief Project Engineer and Deputy Programme Manager, said. With the MAX 9 in the air, Boeing is turning more attention to the larger version. It began pre-marketing the plane this year, but has yet to formally launch development of the jetliner, which will compete against the popular Airbus (AIR.PA) A321neo. Teal said the design of the 737 MAX 10X would be firmed up by the end of this year, adding that customers could receive the aircraft in 2020, depending on orders. “We will determine the delivery date when we launch that programme, when the customers show the interest and they buy the airplane,” he told journalists during a conference.

Emirates, known for its jumbo jets that seat up to 615 passengers with upscale cabins and luxurious amenities, has plans to purchase smaller aircraft and reduce the amount of amenities in an effort to appeal to a no-nonsense subset of travelers and connect key hubs on multiple continents. If the Dubai-based airline‘s plans move forward, Emirates would purchase either single-aisle or twin-aisle capacity planes, available in Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, a stark contrast from its double-decker, long-haul fleets. The potential purchase would spark competition between Boeing and Airbus, and could help Emirates score a sizeable deal on aircraft. The strategy behind this change in aircraft focuses on shorter routes that connect cities through the hub in Dubai, a central location within an eight-hour flight of major European and Asian cities. Emirates plans to take advantage of its convenient location to ramp up the regional competition and provide multiple flight options for its wide client base.

Former Rep. Scott Garrett, R-N.J., who voted twice against reauthorizing the bank while in Congress, will be nominated as president of the bank. Separately, former Rep. Spencer Bachus III, R-Ala., is slated to be nominated to join the bank’s board. Both nominees require Congressional confirmation. Garrett, a deeply conservative Congressman who helped found the House Freedom Congress, has in the past heavily criticized the agency he may now be tasked with leading, calling it a “fund for corporate welfare” and “a bank that embodies the corruption of the free enterprise system” in a speech on the floor of the House in 2015. The bank, which offers financial support to U.S. exporters, is despised by conservative Republicans, who have forced it to remain effectively dormant for nearly two years. Yet the appointments themselves may allow the bank to resume lending in earnest, after being legally barred from acting by a lack of leadership. Advertisement Continue reading Trump opposed the bank during the campaign, but indicated he planned to reopen the bank for business in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday — one of several recent decisions by the president that suggest a shift in his views on economic policy. In the Wall Street Journal interview, Trump said that he had been “much opposed” to the Ex-Im Bank, until he realized that the bank helps small companies and that other countries offer similar assistance. “So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money,” Trump said. Trump — who won the Republican nomination and the presidency on an agenda that eschewed conservative economic thinking — has adopted more orthodox GOP positions since taking office in January. Also Friday, his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, declined to declare that China is manipulating its currency in an official report, pleasing economists and experts on trade but violating a promise that the president repeated frequently on the stump. Conservative lawmakers have lambasted the Export-Import Bank for years. The bank helps U.S. firms sell their products abroad by offering cheap, federally guaranteed loans and other forms of financial support. Opponents point out that the bulk of the assistance provided by the bank goes to major multinational firms, such as Boeing. In 2015, Trump called the bank’s support “feather bedding,” and said the benefits mainly went to “a few companies – and these are companies that can do very well without it.” How Garrett might alter the bank’s operations to win support from conservative Republicans remains to be seen. A conservative faction in Congress succeeded in shutting down the bank in 2015. The bank reopened later that year, but conservative lawmakers prevented then-President Obama from filling two vacancies on the board. As a result, the board lacked the quorum legally required for any consequential deals. Trump’s nominees — if confirmed by the Senate — would allow the bank to begin doing business again. Despite his history with the House Freedom Congress, Garrett also has ties to Wall Street, having chaired the powerful Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which watches over financial institutions and the SEC. Garrett served as a representative in New Jersey, then represented the state in the House from 2003 to 2015. He was defeated in 2016 by former Clinton aide Josh Gottheimer. Bachus served in the House of Representatives from 1993 until he retired in 2015 and formerly chaired the House Financial Services Committee from 2011 to 2013. Bachus voted in favor of the bank while in Congress. Confirmation by the Senate is not assured. Last year, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the then-chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, prevented Obama’s nominees from reaching a vote on the floor. The current chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, could not immediately be reached for comment.

The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank’s board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank’s charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as “corporate welfare.” “I opposed the House’s vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism,” he tweeted in 2015. Trump used to share that view. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. “I don’t like it because I don’t think it’s necessary,” he told Bloomberg, describing it as “sort of a featherbedding for politicians” and “a few companies.” “And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage,” he added. But this past week Trump announced he had changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal that he now supports it. “It turns out that, first of all, lots of small companies will really be helped — the vendor companies. But also, maybe more importantly, other countries give” credit, he said. “And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.” “So instinctively,” he added, “you would say it’s a ridiculous thing, but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money.” The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million. Much of the bank’s financing benefits large corporations such as Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar. Many moderate, business-minded groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many tea party Republicans and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations. Trump’s reversal on the subject is just one of several he has made in recent days as he approaches his 100th day in office.

Saturday, April 15, 2017 Politics White House Congress Campaigns All Politics Policy Defense / National Security Energy Healthcare Finance / Economy Tech / Cyber Budgets / Spending Courts Foreign All Policy News Opinion Editorials Columnists Contributors Op-Eds Editorial Cartoons All Opinion Magazine Beltway Confidential Washington Secrets Strike a bipartisan blow against crony capitalism and end the Export-Import Bank by Veronique de Rugy | Jun 6, 2014, 11:53 AM (AP File) Everywhere we look big business is teaming up with big government and that's causing big problems. People know this and they're sick of it. They've even taken to the streets. It's a non-partisan outrage, from the Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street. People are sick of the cronyism, and the Export-Import Bank is the epitome of that cronyism. Come September, lawmakers have a chance to put an end to this boondoggle. It should be a no-brainer for anyone who believes in markets and who see the immorality of giving subsidies to companies, whether they are big or small and domestic-based or foreign-based. It should also be easy since most of the bank's activities support large and successful companies which didn't wait for the handout to make some cash. In fact, some great research by Heritage Foundation's Diane Katz proves that the bank's stories about being the secret ingredient in the success and profits sauce of specific small businesses--including the bank's poster child Mrs. Jenny's Pickles--are quite misleading. But what about the claim that export subsidies are necessary to counteract the competitive disadvantages posed by the export credit agencies of foreign nations? Since foreign firms enjoy the benefits of their own national export subsidy organizations, the thinking goes, U.S. firms would struggle to compete internationally if our federal government did not provide similar aid. Obviously, U.S. exporters prefer that their companies only had to compete on price and quality against unsubsidized foreign companies. Bad economic policy is hardly limited to the U.S., and many countries have indeed established their own export-financing agencies just like the Export-Import Bank. This does not justify the bank’s existence, however. Congress recently obliged the bank to provide more explanations for certain portfolio transactions as a condition of its most recent reauthorization in 2012. While the bank does not provide justifications for all transactions in its portfolio, the bank’s current charter now compels Ex-Im to at least provide categorical explanations for all loans and long-term loan guarantees in its annual report. According to the Export-Import Bank's fiscal year 2013 annual report, roughly $7.9 billion in estimated export-valued loans and $10.7 billion in estimated export-valued long-term loan guarantees, or a combined estimated export value of $18.7 billion, must be categorized as Congress legislated. Here is how Ex-Im justifies its activities: $4.1 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “political risks,” another $2.1 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “private sector limitations,” and finally $12.2 billion in estimated export value is justified because of “foreign competition.” That leaves $18.8 billion in estimated export value, or 50.2 percent, of the rest of the bank’s portfolio unjustified. Since the estimated export value of the bank’s entire portfolio for fiscal year 2013 was roughly $37.4 billion, this means that less than one third of the estimated export value of the bank’s portfolio is intended to actually counteract competitive disadvantages wrought by foreign export credit agencies. What's more, much of this financing goes to large corporations that are unlikely to be incontrovertibly harmed by foreign export credit agencies. For instance, roughly 66 percent of the value designated to “meet competition from a foreign, officially-sponsored export-credit agency” went to the Boeing Corporation, whose own financial director publicly admitted could “find alternative funding sources” without the Export-Import Bank. The bottom line is that defending the Export-Import Bank on the grounds that it effectively counters foreign competition simply does not hold water. The Export-Import Bank backs less than 2 percent of the value of total U.S. exports. It means that more than 98 percent of U.S. exports take place without any support from the Ex-Im Bank. In addition, the Bank’s data show that it justifies less than 33 percent of this tiny portion on the grounds of countering foreign competition. In other words, the Bank claims to counteract 0.0066 percent of the value of U.S. exports that are exposed to foreign-subsidized competition. The Bank's effect in countering foreign subsidies is negligible, but its activities come at the great costs of corporate cronyism, economic distortions and irresponsible taxpayer exposure. It's time to retire the Export-Import Bank. CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the percentage of the value of U.S. exports that are exposed to foreign-subsidized competition the Export-Import Bank claims to counteract.

Garrett would fill the role of Ex-Im president for a four-year term. In the past, Garrett was openly critical of the Ex-Im Bank, tweeting in 2015: “I opposed the House’s vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism.” Garrett served as a New Jersey Republican congressman from 2003 to 2015 and was a state representative for 12 years prior. He was one of the nine founding members of the House Freedom Caucus. Bachus would be a member of the Ex-Im Bank’s Board of Directors. Bachus served in Congress from 1993 to 2015, representing Alabama, and at one point was chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. He supported the bank’s re-authorization, once saying the Ex-Im Bank “is available to help those small businesses compete and win in the global marketplace.” The Ex-Im Bank, the federal government’s export credit agency, has been targeted by groups like the Heritage Foundation and some free-market conservatives in the past — who argue it’s a form of corporate welfare that unduly benefits major companies, such as Boeing and Caterpillar. Re-authorizing the bank became a campaign issue during the 2014 midterm election and remained an issue of debate in Congress afterward. Opponents, such as then-Senate banking chairman Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, have tried to hobble it by not confirming nominees to its board. The bank has lacked full power in recent years because of those vacant seats, which means it can’t approve transactions over $10 million. On the campaign trail, Trump called the bank “featherbedding” for politicians and companies. “I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage. I think it’s unnecessary,” he told Bloomberg in August 2015. “And when you think about free enterprise, it’s really not free enterprise. I’d be against it.” But Trump appeared to reverse a number of his campaign trail positions in an interview published by The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, including signaling support for the Ex-Im Bank. In the interview, Trump said the Ex-Im Bank helped small companies. “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing?” Trump said. “But actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” The White House did not return a request for comment.

Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post The White House announced Friday that it will nominate an outspoken critic of the Export-Import Bank to head the agency, following a week in which President Trump appeared to reverse his position on the controversial bank. Former Rep. Scott Garrett (R-N.J.), who voted twice against reauthorizing the bank while in Congress, will be nominated as president of the bank. Separately, former Rep. Spencer T.

As a result, the board lacked the quorum legally required for any consequential deals. Trump's nominees — if confirmed by the Senate — may allow the bank to begin doing business again. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) said in a statement Friday evening that the nominations moved the bank's board "closer to becoming fully functional." "While I have reservations about his nominations and believe they need to be thoroughly vetted, this is a positive step toward helping the Bank do its job of delivering funds back to the taxpayers while supporting American businesses and workers," Heitkamp said. Despite his history with the House Freedom Caucus, Garrett also has ties to Wall Street, having chaired the powerful Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises, which watches over financial institutions and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Garrett served as a representative in New Jersey, then represented the state in the House from 2003 to 2015. He was defeated in 2016 in a tough race against former Clinton aide Josh Gottheimer.

Bachus voted in favor of the bank in 2012. Confirmation by the Senate is not assured. Last year, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), the then-chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, prevented Obama's nominees from reaching a vote on the floor. The current chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), could not immediately be reached for comment. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

(AP) — President Donald Trump plans to nominate a vocal critic of the U.S. Export-Import Bank to serve as its president. The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank's board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank's charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as "corporate welfare." "I opposed the House's vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism," he tweeted in 2015. It's a view he used to share with Trump — at least until this week. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. "I don't like it because I don't think it's necessary," he told Bloomberg, describing it as "sort of a featherbedding for politicians" and "a few companies." "And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don't like it. I think it's a lot of excess baggage," he added. But this week Trump announced he'd changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he now supports it. "It turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it," he said. "And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business." "So instinctively," he added, "you would say it's a ridiculous thing but actually it's a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money."

The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million.

Many moderate, business-minded Republican groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many tea party Republicans and outside groups like the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations. Trump's reversal on the subject is just one of several he's made in recent days as he approaches his 100th day in office. __ Follow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Veteran says Trump using 'mother of all bombs' shows he puts more value on troops Adorable 3-year-old Scottish girl's inquiry into Easter has 39 million views Liberal director mocked for saying only love can defeat ISIS The MOAB that was dropped on Afghanistan costs far less than you think TV Channels Glenn Beck Dana Loesch Lawrence Jones Doc Thompson Check out all channels Radio myVoice Signup Login www.theblaze.com The MOAB that was dropped on Afghanistan costs far less than you think Brandon Morse 8 hours The MOAB bomb that was dropped on Afghanistan has a cheaper price tag than was first publicized. (Getty Images) 91 Follow Share Tweet A lot of misinformation has been circulated about the cost of the “mother of all bombs” that was dropped on a series of ISIS network tunnels in Afghanistan, but the true number is a lot less than many think. Back in 2011, the LA Times wrote an article that detailed the cost of the bombs sitting somewhere in the range of $314 million. This number was picked up by many in the media after teh Afghanistan MOAB was dropped, and soon the number was spread around social media. The bomb dropped today in the middle of nowhere, Afghanistan, cost $314,000,000. https://t.co/mV6sJoMIFJ (credit @thenib) pic.twitter.com/aj0Om5RhAV — Edward Snowden (@Snowden) April 13, 2017 Not 1 person in gov't,can tell me this country doesn't have enough money to fund social programs or water. We just dropped 314 million. — Tika Sumpter (@iamtikasumpter) April 13, 2017 The "mother of all bombs" dropped today in Afghanistan cost the US taxpayer $314 million. And yet America can't afford meals on wheels. — James Melville (@JamesMelville) April 13, 2017 The figure LA Times presented, however, was not at all accurate, but soon the site Deagle.com came out with the figure $16 million. As the Daily Caller writes, this number was then picked up from various media outlets. Many news organizations, including TIME and CNBC, also cited Deagel.com, a site with extensive lists of weapons assets owned by multiple countries, which claims the MOAB costs $16 million per unit, the same amount as the reported cost of the MOP. It was Business Insider, however, that got to the bottom of the actual cost of the MOAB bomb. Going to the US Air Force itself, who made the bomb in-house, and not through a third party like Boeing or Lockheed. The actual cost is $170,000. The $170,000 figure makes sense considering a general-purpose 1,000-pound MK-83 costs about $12,000. The MOAB simply features more high explosives and larger fins to direct the GPS-guided munition. So there you have it. The cost of the largest non-nuclear bomb in the United States’ possession actually costs under $1 million to make.

Trump tapped Scott Garrett, an Ex-Im critic and a former House member from New Jersey, as president of the bank’s board, and Spencer Bachus, a former chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, as a board member. If they are confirmed, the bank would once again have a quorum, and therefore the ability to approve deals above $10 million. Story Continued Below Ex-Im guarantees loans for foreign companies interested in buying U.S. exports, and also runs programs such as providing insurance and credit to help small businesses secure new customers and working capital. Trump criticized the agency during the presidential campaign, but in a Wednesday interview with The Wall Street Journal the president said the bank helps small companies. “Instinctively, you would say, ‘Isn’t that a ridiculous thing,’” Trump said. “But actually, it’s a very good thing. And it actually makes money, it could make a lot of money.” Morning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Garrett, a close ally of current Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, was vocally opposed to reviving the bank during the fight over whether to renew its charter in 2015. Garrett lost his reelection campaign last year. While in Congress, Bachus represented Alabama, which is home to facilities for aircraft maker Boeing — the export credit agency’s biggest user — and Airbus, its European competitor. Bachus retired from office in 2015. The bank is supported by a majority of the president's party in Congress but has faced strong opposition from key members — including Hensarling and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In the previous Congress, McConnell said he would move any Ex-Im nominee that came out of committee, in deference to the agency's strong support in the Senate, but it's unclear how Senate Banking Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) will approach the nominations.

The B61-12 bomb, which was the first of the upgraded B-61 variant, was dropped by an F-16 Fighting Falcon jet over the Nellis Test and Training Range Complex in Nevada, the UPI reported on Friday, citing military officials. During the test, the bomb's non-nuclear components, such as the arming and fire control system, radar altimeter, rocket motors and weapons control computer, as well as the aircraft's capability to deliver the weapon were reviewed. The US Air Force’s Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) has been working with the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration to extend the B61-12 bomb’s life. The new variant would replace four ageing versions of the B61 in the US nuclear arsenal. “The B61-12 gravity bomb ensures the current capability for the air-delivered leg of the US strategic nuclear triad well into the future for both bombers and dual-capable aircraft supporting NATO,” said Paul Waugh, AFNWC's Air-Delivered Capabilities director. The bomb (pictured below) is compatible with the US Air Force’s B-2A, B-21, F-15E, F-16C/D, F-16 MLU, F-35 and PA-200 aircraft. Boeing and two other federally funded research and development centers designed and manufactured the inert bomb used in the test. US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he would expand America’s nuclear arsenal to ensure it is at the "top of the pack." The US military’s recent test came amid simmering tensions between the US and North Korea over Pyongyang’s nuclear tests. Washington has threatened the North with a preemptive strike in case Pyongyang conducts its sixth test. Pyongyang detonated a purported hydrogen bomb in January 2016.

However, new CEO U Sai Kham Park Hpa insisted last week that the company was not in danger of ceasing operations permanently and would have three aircraft operating by February. “Air Mandalay’s suspension of operations is not related to our financial position. All of our crews are working except for pilots and air stewards,” he said. “We will resume operations with one ATR 72-212 and two [Embraer] ERJ 145 aircraft, which will arrive in Myanmar near the end of January 2015. So we will be officially flying again no later than February.” Air Mandalay announced earlier this month that it was halting flights from December 10 through to at least the end of January, after a planned aircraft leasing deal for two ERJ 145s fell through “due to unforeseen circumstances”. According to flight schedules released by the airline last month, the aircraft were due to come into service on November 17. U Sai Kham Park Hpa said the planes had failed to arrive because the taxes levied by the government were prohibitively high. Air Mandalay is negotiating to “adjust” the import taxes on the aircraft, he said. “We won’t be able to compete if the taxes are too high because we will have to set our ticket prices higher than other airlines,” he said. However, former CEO Gary Villiard, who resigned on November 14 due to conflict with the airline’s shareholders, said he did not believe it would be possible for the airline to resume services at the end of January. He said it was the third aircraft leasing deal to fall through in the past year and questioned whether Air Mandalay had the financing and corporate affairs skills needed to turn the airline around. Negotiations with a potential new investor had recently broken down, he said, while Air Mandalay is also engaged in a dispute with the Ministry of Transport over the sale of the government’s one-third stake in the carrier. “I drew on every connection I had to save the airline,” said Mr Villiard. “At every board meeting shareholders promised to make financial commitments but those commitments were never kept. “It’s a crying shame because the Air Mandalay brand is so powerful. I couldn’t believe when I got here how strong the brand is. But to underfund it or refuse to take on equity partners ... is going to leave 386 people on the street with no place to go.” The company also has a “considerable list” of vendors who are yet to be paid, including some who have been waiting more than 18 months, Mr Villiard said. He said refusal of the shareholders to pay these vendors was a major factor in his resignation. “I’ve spend 40 years maintaining my integrity and I was unwilling to let Air Mandalay sacrifice it.” Mr Villiard confirmed the details of complaints from several vendors with which The Myanmar Times has been in contact with. In one case, an IT management company had done “considerable work” for Air Mandalay fixing its online booking system, he said – including visiting the company four times at its own expense – but was never paid because Air Mandalay’s shareholders objected to paying a US$2000 administration fee. The suspension has caused few disruptions for the travel industry, agents said, as Air Mandalay has been operating on a reduced schedule for months due to most of its ageing fleet being out of service. In 2010, the airline was also forced to stop flying for several months because of maintenance problems with its aircraft, which include two ATR 72s and an ATR 42. Two of these – one ATR 72 and the ATR 42 – can no longer be operated in Myanmar because the Department of Civil Aviation Law prohibits the use of aircraft that are more than 25 years old. Nice Fare ticketing agency supervisor Ko Chu Maung Maung said his company had been refunding money to those who had purchased tickets or placing them on other carriers. “Passengers accepted these choices so we have not had many problems,” he said. Myanmar Voyages managing director U Thet Lwin Toh said his company rarely used Air Mandalay but he expected the airline to make a return next year. “They signed a deal this year to replace their planes with Boeing aircraft in 2015 so I think they suspended because they are training their crews,” he said. It comes just a month after Air Mandalay inked a memorandum of collaboration with Boeing that would see the two companies cooperate on procuring Boeing 737 airplanes through leasing channels to support Air Mandalay’s expansion. Boeing refused to discuss the deal last week, with a spokesperson saying its “official response is that we do not comment about our customer activities”. But U Sai Kham Park Hpa said the deal was related to a planned international expansion and was not linked to securing aircraft for domestic routes. Earlier this year Air Mandalay said it had placed an order with Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation for six MRJ90 aircraft, becoming the first Asian carrier outside to Japan to order the jet, which is being jointly developed with Toyota. The deal, which also gave Air Mandalay a purchase option for an additional four MRJ90, was signed on the sidelines of the Farnborough Airshow in Britain in July. The planes, which are expected to have a capacity of 86 to 96 seats, are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter of 2018. Air Mandalay was launched in 1994 as Myanmar’s first privately owned domestic carrier. According to its website, the current shareholders are Air Mandalay Holdings Pte Ltd of Singapore, Premier Airlines Pte Ltd of Malaysia and state-run Myanma Airways, which recently rebranded as Myanmar National Airlines.

 How much the US's 'mother of all bombs' really costs Alex Lockie Apr. 14, 2017, 4:24 PM 34,284 facebook linkedin twitter email print A Massive Ordnance Air Blast weapon, commonly known as the "Mother of All Bombs,” being prepared for testing at the Eglin Air Force Armament Center in 2003. DoD Photo The US's Massive Ordnance Air Blast bomb does not cost $314 million, or $16 million, but $170,000 a unit, the US Air Force told Business Insider on Friday. The weapon, whose acronym inspired the nickname "Mother of All Bombs," was produced by the Air Force, not by a third party like Lockheed or Boeing, "so we don't have a standard procurement cost associated with them," an Air Force official said. The $170,000 figure makes sense considering a general-purpose 1,000-pound MK-83 costs about $12,000. The MOAB simply features more high explosives and larger fins to direct the GPS-guided munition. Many outlets, including The New York Times and Business Insider, inaccurately stated the cost of the MOAB as being in the millions. Business Insider's article has since been corrected to reflect this information.

That bomb is 4 tons heavier than the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast that was dropped Thursday in Afghanistan, but it contains only about a third as much explosive. File photo Tacoma News-Tribune Local April 14, 2017 3:15 PM ‘Mother of all bombs’ is a runt compared to Missouri-based father of all bombs By Scott Canon scanon@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The giant “mother of all bombs” dropped on an Islamic State target in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday marked the largest non-nuclear bomb ever used in combat. It’s the second-heaviest non-nuclear bomb in the American arsenal. A bigger version can be packed into the B-2 stealth bomber based at Whiteman Air Force Base near Knob Noster, Mo. That 30,000-pound satellite-guided bomb — the Pentagon calls it the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator — might be considered the father of all bombs. The 22,000-pound bomb used in Afghanistan is the GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast, or MOAB. It’s typically fused to detonate above its target and uses shock waves to destroy things on and below the ground. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:55 Live Jazz has landed at KCI Pause 0:40 Aerial video of world's most powerful non-nuclear bomb exploding in Afghanistan 5:22 Cuddly critters: Baby animals at KC Zoo get extra TLC 2:02 Kelly's keeps tradition running 70 years in Westport 3:55 How Schlitterbahn’s Verruckt was built in Wyandotte County 1:46 The science behind Schlitterbahn’s Verrückt 1:32 Work of student journalists leads to principal's resignation 5:52 Some closed Kansas City schools getting a new life 2:12 Troubles ahead for the Buck O'Neil Bridge 3:03 Zero Suicide youth program counters feelings of severe depression Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email Aerial video of world's most powerful non-nuclear bomb exploding in Afghanistan The U.S. Department of Defense released video of the MOAB (mother of all bombs) GBU-43 on ISIS forces in Afghanistan on Thursday. Department of Defense In contrast, the MOP was built to burrow into the ground and then explode. A B-2, which can carry up to 160 smaller bombs, can carry just two on a flight. Special cranes are needed to load the behemoths. In a recent interview with The Star at Whiteman, B-2 pilot Lt. Col. Justin “Vapor” Grieve compared releasing 500-pound weapons like those used in a January attack over Libya to letting go of the 30,000-pound bombs in testing and training exercises. “The 500-pound weapon is pretty anti-climactic. What is exciting is when we release our 30,000-pound MOP, the Massive Ordnance Penetrator,” he said. “When you release that, you can feel it. The plane will actually raise up about 100 feet, and then it’ll settle back down. It’s pretty cool. It’s fun.” Some published reports suggest the MOP, which has never been used in combat, could dig 200 feet into the earth before its 5,300 pounds of explosives detonate. Analysts differ on whether that’s realistic. The bomb’s metal needed to be strong enough to withstand being dropped on a bunker, a target that might be made of steel-reinforced concrete, and its shape had to be slender enough to pierce the ground like a needle into your skin. The relatively skinny shape — they stretch 20.5 feet long with a 31.5-inch diameter — is why the heavier bomb made for the B-2 can carry less than a third as much H6 explosive as the MOAB. A 2005 paper published by the Union of Concerned Scientists discussed the potential damage of bunker-busting and its limits. “By exploding just a few meters underground instead of at or above the surface, a much larger fraction of the energy of the explosion is transmitted to the ground,” the document said. “The explosion creates a strong seismic shock wave that propagates and can crush or damage an underground bunker. … “Nevertheless, even nuclear weapons have limited effectiveness at destroying the deepest or widely separated underground bunkers,” the report continued. “For example, an earth penetrating weapon using the 1.2 megaton B83 warhead — the highest yield weapon in the U.S. nuclear stockpile — could crush underground bunkers to a depth of about 1000 feet. Deeper bunkers can be constructed with modern tunneling equipment, and are essentially invulnerable to nuclear attack.” Boeing made 20 of the B-2’s bunker busters, delivered and tested in 2011, for $30 million. The Air Force has not said how many remain in the arsenal after testing at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Analysts have long seen the MOP as a potential weapon to be used on deeply buried nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea. That’s one reason why they’ve been fitted to the B-2 bomber. The stealth jet is used rarely, typically on targets where air defenses pose a significant threat and a plane virtually invisible to radar can sneak through on a first-strike bombing run. In the recent Afghanistan bombing, the MOAB was dropped from an MC-130 cargo plane. Islamic State fighters on the ground had no way to shoot down a plane. That meant there would be little need to risk one of Whiteman’s 20 B-2s, jets that cost $2 billion-and-counting and are essentially irreplaceable. In Iran or North Korea, a jet without radar-dodging powers might easily get shot down. That makes the B-2 a more likely candidate — along with standoff weapons like the Tomahawk cruise missiles used earlier in April on a Syrian airfield. The MOAB was largely designed for what the military strategists consider “softer” targets — infantry troops and nonarmored vehicles. It also could prove devastating for the sort of compound hit in Afghanistan, a relatively primitive tunnel complex that lacked the steel- or concrete-hardened bunkers found at critical locations in Iran or North Korea. “So if you’re trying to block cave entrances or collapse rudimentary tunnel complexes, you might use the MOAB,” said Mark Gunzinger, a former B-52 pilot and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. “If you’re trying to penetrate a very hardened, very deep structure, you might want something to penetrate into the target or to a deep enough depth that you cause damage inside. “You have to select the kind of weapon you want to use,” he said. “It’s not always a bigger blast.” Scott Canon: 816-234-4754, @ScottCanon LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:55 Live Jazz has landed at KCI Pause 0:40 Aerial video of world's most powerful non-nuclear bomb exploding in Afghanistan 5:22 Cuddly critters: Baby animals at KC Zoo get extra TLC 2:02 Kelly's keeps tradition running 70 years in Westport 3:55 How Schlitterbahn’s Verruckt was built in Wyandotte County 1:46 The science behind Schlitterbahn’s Verrückt 1:32 Work of student journalists leads to principal's resignation 5:52 Some closed Kansas City schools getting a new life 2:12 Troubles ahead for the Buck O'Neil Bridge 3:03 Zero Suicide youth program counters feelings of severe depression Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 6 hours ago Live Jazz has landed at KCI 2:55 6 hours ago Live Jazz has landed at KCI 5:22 13 hours ago Cuddly critters: Baby animals at KC Zoo get extra TLC 2:08 21 hours ago 3D printers at Children's Mercy create models of bones, organs to assist surgeons View More Video Local Four dead after multi-vehicle wreck in St. Joseph Felony murder charges filed in infant’s death at Eudora day care Authorities identify man shot to death early Friday in Kansas City A Missouri church’s playground is now a First Amendment exercise for Supreme Court Kansas City businessman led a $10 million investment fraud scheme, feds say Local Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Star Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter Mobile apps and E-Star Mobile Alerts Newsletters Advertising Advertising information Print Digital Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Marco SantanaContact Reporter Privacy Policy NASA has plans to bring viewers face-to-face with a rocket at Launch Complex 41 at its next launch. The space agency announced Friday that the launch, scheduled for 11:11 a.m. Tuesday, will take place under the eye of a 360-degree camera that will broadcast live on its YouTube channel. The mission will send one of Orbital ATK’s Cygnus spacecraft to the International Space Station carrying more than 7,600 pounds of scientific research, supplies and hardware. The Cygnus will head into space aboard one of United Launch Alliance’s Atlas V rockets. The use of 360-degree video lets Internet viewers move a camera’s perspective, giving a look at an event or experience through different angles. Other organizations have brought viewers on a swim alongside sharks, a roller coaster ride and a landing bay on the Empire’s Death Star from the Star Wars movies. The broadcast is expected to begin about 10 minutes before launch time. The on-again, off-again launch had been scheduled for March 27 before it was pushed back multiple times, first because of a problem with ground support systems and then for booster hydraulic issues. ULA, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, has been part of the growing launch activity on the Space Coast, along with SpaceX. This will be the seventh of 10 flights for Orbital under the Commercial Resupply Services contract with NASA. On March 9, Orbital announced that it had named the spacecraft after former astronaut and U.S. Sen. John Glenn, who died Dec. 8.

 California may be the most desirable place to live in the US, but employers can't recruit 'high-performers' thanks to insane housing prices Tanza Loudenback Apr. 14, 2017, 7:27 PM 19,706 facebook linkedin twitter email print Los Angeles-based businesses may be in danger of being priced out of the region. Melpomene/Shutterstock The effect of California's housing crisis is reaching new heights. According to a new report from the University of Southern California and the Los Angeles Business Council, exorbitant housing costs in Los Angeles, the second most populous city in the US, are inhibiting employers from attracting "high-performers," or top talent, to their companies. For the study — which was led by Raphael Bostic, a USC Price School of Public Policy Professor and the newly appointed head of the Atlanta Federal Reserve — USC surveyed 14 of Los Angeles' largest employers, which account for nearly 200,000 jobs in the region. Nearly 60% of the employers say Los Angeles' high cost of living impacts employee retention, with 75% naming housing costs as a specific concern, according to the survey results. Further, 10 employers (71%) view high housing costs as "a barrier" to hiring new mid- and upper-level employees. "This study shows that high housing costs are burdening our leading employers, either by having to develop special hiring packages, or subsidizing transportation and relocation costs," Bostic said. By contrast, most of the employers surveyed said no special outreach or programs have been put in place to retain lower-skilled workers because local supply is abundant. "It's concerning that high housing costs could lead to Los Angeles losing its competitive edge in recruiting top talent. That would be devastating to our economy," Mary Leslie, president of the Los Angeles Business Council, said. In 2015, Boeing moved a manufacturing facility from Long Beach to Seattle likely to escape Southern California housing costs despite the state's pleas for it to stay, the report said. And Los Angeles-based SpaceX opened an engineering office in Seattle the same year in an effort to hire top talent who "just refuse to live in LA," founder Elon Musk previously said. Southern California's real estate market has been red hot for a few years now, thanks to low mortgage rates, a strengthening economy, and dwindling home supply. Zillow pegs the median home value in Los Angeles at $616,900 and the median rent at about $2,860. That's compared to $195,700 and $1,500 for the US as a whole. "Though we have yet to see a critical mass of businesses priced out of the region, this is an area of concern," Bostic said. "There's ample evidence to show that the time is now to implement strategies to reduce housing costs.” But while expensive housing has become ubiquitous with cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, overpaying for housing is a widespread problem. Over 10 million households pay more than half their income in housing costs nationwide, according to the report.

WASHINGTON STATE Wire Business Education Health Columns Politics Environment Business Education Health Columns Politics Environment Columns Column: Unpacking the car tab debate John Wyble   April 14, 2017   “Something must be done to address the outrageous cab-tab increases we’re seeing,” said Rep. Mark Harmsworth, R-Mill Creek and assistant ranking minority member of the House Transportation Committee. It sounds like Mark Harmsworth actually cares that your taxes are going up. I’m going to let you in on a little secret. He doesn’t. Let’s unpack this statement. The House Republicans introduced six amendments on April 5th to lower car tabs and allow cities and counties to opt-out of Sound Transit. Sounds like they care about you and your taxes, right? Wrong. The key to their amendment strategy is the part about opting out of Sound Transit. Mark Harmsworth doesn’t care about your taxes. He’s trying to stop Sound Transit. He is (like many Republicans in Washington) an ideologue that doesn’t believe in mass transit. He’s only using the increase in car tabs to relitigate the Sound Transit 3 campaign. How do I know that?  First, Republicans have a terrible record on helping working people get tax relief. Let’s start with the debate on Sound Transit itself. There have been two bills (HB 2148 and HB 2147) that would actually lower car tabs for working people either by changing the way cars are valued or by offering a rebate of up to 40 percent on car tab charges for low-income owners. But, Republicans like Mark Harmsworth have opposed those bills because they don’t give cities and counties any new authority to opt out of Sound Transit.  Second, let’s look at the difference between the Republican and Democratic budgets just in this year. The Democratic budget would enact a seven percent tax on capital gains and a 20% increese in the Business and Occupation Tax for some of the highest grossing businesses in the state. This would help pay for an increase in K-12 spending while not adding a tax burden to working people. The Republican budget, on the other hand, would give huge tax breaks to Boeing, Alaska Airlines, Walmart, Century Link, Avista, BNSF Railway Co., and Weyerhauser. Washington State already has the most regressive tax system in the country. An average taxpayer among the state’s poorest 20 percent sees 16.9 percent of his or her income go to state and local taxes in 2010. Meanwhile, a Washington taxpayer in the top 1 percent likely paid 2.8 percent of his or her income in state and local taxes. If you really cared about tax fairness, you could look at the roughly $6.5 billion in tax breaks to corporations and make sure these giveaways are either creating jobs or improving the state’s economy. Senator Rueven Carlyle took the first step by requiring transparency around all tax breaks. That’s the approach someone would take if they cared about your taxes.  In other words, if you care about people’s taxes you could provide a rebate on car tabs, you could reassess the value of cars, you could increase the amount that big business is paying, or you could scrutinize corporate tax breaks to make sure they are working. The other thing you could do as a legislator is invite hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative campaign advertising by proposing an income tax.  Or you can oppose everything unless the legislation strikes a blow against Sound Transit. That’s what Republicans like Mark Harmsworth are trying to do. They should just tell you that they don’t care if you are stuck in traffic instead of spending time with your family. They don’t want to give you any more choices for how you commute or get around. They don’t want to help the region’s businesses by ensuring a strong transportation infrastructure. They believe the Puget Sound region can just put down enough pavement that our traffic problems are solved.  Misguided? Certainly. Stupid? Probably. The truth about Mark Harmsworth. Exactly.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Apr 15, 2017 - Page 12　 Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp EVA Airways bullish on outlook NEW JOBS:The company is planning to hire 350 cabin crew and 150 pilots to support an increased number of flights, mainly to European and North American destinations By Ted Chen  /  Staff reporter EVA Airways Corp (長榮航空) yesterday gave an upbeat outlook for this year and said that the company is counting on rising passenger numbers to offset declining unit revenue as intensifying competition drives down ticket prices. The company has set its sights on increasing its revenue passenger kilometers (RPK) by 20 percent this year by adding more flights to European and North American destinations, as well as key cities in China, EVA corporate planning division executive vice president Albert Liao (廖至維) said at the company’s first earnings conference in its 28-year history. However, Liao said that some flights and destinations in China would be cut this year and redirected to other Asian destinations as uncertainties in cross-strait relations continue to affect sales. He added that sales from flights to China registered their first decline last year. Although unit revenue last year fell 9.8 percent annually to NT$2.1 from NT$2.3 the previous year, total passenger revenue posted a 4.7 percent year-on-year gain to NT$85.75 billion (US$2.82 billion) as RPK rose 17.2 percent year-on-year to 51.17 billion, Liao said. He said the passenger load factor would remain stable this year at about 80 percent, after the figure last year dipped 0.8 percentage points from 2015. The company gave a more reserved outlook for its cargo business due to oversupply and declining freight rates. Cargo revenue last year fell 20.1 percent year-on-year to NT$20.84 billion, while unit revenue fell 18.4 percent to NT$5.8, the company said. The highly anticipated iPhone 8 handset would help stimulate demand for cargo transport this year, he said. The company is adding four Airbus A330-300 and seven Boeing 777-300ER airliners to its fleet this year, as well as a Boeing 777F cargo aircraft, EVA president Derek Chen (陳憲弘) said. Capital expenditure is forecast at NT$25 billion this year, Chen said, while outlining plans to hire an additional 350 cabin crew and 150 pilots to support an increased number of flights. Meanwhile, Chen said that the government’s new labor rules would mean annual payroll expenses increase by about NT$200 million. Chen said that the company is not expecting any labor issues this year as negotiations with its union are due to begin next week, adding that wages were raised by between 2 and 3 percent last year. The company posted net income of NT$1.75 billion last quarter, down 25 percent year-on-year, or earnings per share of NT$0.28, with sales rising 4.5 percent year-on-year to NT$34.91 billion.

Under the new agreement, Oman Air passengers can connect to 59 destinations across Europe and North America from Lufthansa’s Frankfurt and Munich hubs on an interline basis. At the same time, Lufthansa will codeshare with Oman Air on Oman Air operated services from both Frankfurt and Munich to Muscat, a statement said. As part of the deal, Oman Air will be moving terminals to the Lufthansa operated terminals in Frankfurt terminal 1 and Munich terminal 2. Oman Air will also be retiming its current services to Frankfurt to arrive and depart Frankfurt during the morning to facilitate connections in Frankfurt to Europe and North America in under three hours. The Oman airline said it will also be operating its new Boeing Dreamliner 787-9 between Muscat and Frankfurt. CEO Paul Gregorowitsch said: “Strategic codeshares are a crucial way for us to broaden customer choice. Our relationship with Lufthansa is a very important development for Oman Air allowing us to offer even better connectivity in Europe and the North Atlantic and we are delighted to be operating one of newest additions to the fleet, the Boeing Dreamliner on the Muscat to Frankfurt route.” Follow @ArabianBusiness Related: Stories Oman Air increases flights to key Indian cities after gov't deal Oman Air launches grooming centre for frontline staff Lufthansa boss says rapid growth of Gulf airlines coming to an end Oman Air plans to double contribution to GDP to $2.3bn in 2017 Oman Air says image being attacked by fake Twitter account Companies Oman Air Lufthansa Also in Transport Dubai set to launch traffic diversions in bid to complete key projects Video: United Airlines Apology to Passenger Also in Oman Indian visitors key to growth of GCC tourism sector Oman Air carries 7.7m passengers in 2016, up 21% Join the Discussion Disclaimer:The view expressed here by our readers are not necessarily shared by Arabian Business, its employees, sponsors or its advertisers.

According to The Daily Caller News Foundation, the figures in the LA Times article "only refer to the cost of the Air Force's biggest bunker busting bomb, the 5,300 pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP), or GBU-57, which is built by private defense contractor Boeing Company." The Daily Caller continues to explant that "while the two bomb types are related, they serve different functions," and that "the MOAB, like its Daisy Cutter predecessor, can only be dropped out of a C-130 built by Lockheed Martin, and the MOP is deployed from the B-2, a Boeing aircraft." An MC-130 dropped the bomb on Thursday, according to CNN. An MOAB Air Force spokesperson told the Daily Caller that they "don't have a cost per unit" for the bomb. "These munitions were produced in-house so we don't have a standard procurement cost associated with them."

He changes his tune for the same reasons a salesman does: to close the deal. By Jeet Heer April 14, 2017 The presidency is an educational experience for everyone who assumes the office, since there is no other job like it. “For any new occupant of the White House, the early months are like a graduate seminar in policy crammed into every half-hour meeting,” Peter Baker wrote in The New York Times on Thursday. “What made sense on the campaign trail may have little bearing on reality in the Oval Office, and the education of a president can be rocky even for former governors or senators. For Mr. Trump, the first president in American history never to have served in government or the military, the learning curve is especially steep.” CNN’s Chris Cillizza put it more simply: “If Donald Trump has learned any big lesson in his 84 days as President, it’s this: The job is way harder than it looks.” This is a reasonable analysis given the president’s explanations for his many recent reversals of campaign positions: He has developed a telling rhetorical tic where he announces that some subject he had pontificated on with confidence is actually much more complex than the thought. Kevin Drum, writing in Mother Jones, has collected some choice examples. “I have to tell you, it’s an unbelievably complex subject,” Trump said, in February, of health care reform. “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” The same underlying formulation recurred this week. After meeting with Xi Jinping, he told The Wall Street Journal that China’s president “went into the history of China and Korea. Not North Korea, Korea. And you know, you’re talking about thousands of years … and many wars. And Korea actually used to be a part of China. And after listening for 10 minutes I realized that not—it’s not so easy. You know I felt pretty strongly ... that they had a tremendous power over China.... But it’s not what you would think.” He also told the paper, “I was very much opposed to Ex-Im Bank ... but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money. You know, it actually could make a lot of money.” These confessions of ignorance are startling, but can create a tempting, optimistic narrative: Trump is learning! He’s filling up the vast emptiness of his mind with new knowledge, replacing pat simplicities with a more nuanced engagement with reality. Perhaps over time, Trump could learn enough to do his job properly. “As he governs, he is realizing that the campaign talk doesn’t fit neatly into governing and he needs a different approach, one that gets results,” Christopher Ruddy, the Newsmax Media CEO who is close to the president, told Baker. “So he will discard things and people that don’t work out, and those that do work, he will magnify. That’s how he became successful in business and entertainment.” Alas, this hope is based on a mistaken understanding of how Trump operates. His approach to knowledge is not cumulative—to gather new information, have a better understand the world, and make more informed decisions—but rather situational. Trump is at heart a salesman, so the only knowledge he’s truly interested in retaining is that which he needs to know to close a deal. Trump’s real skill is figuring out what people want to hear so he can get them to do what he wants, whether it’s buying his products or voting for him. That is how he became a successful businessman and entertainer. It’s also how Trump became a successful presidential candidate. He watched Fox News and listened to talk radio to gauge what the average Republicans wanted. He then echoed back to the Right what they wanted to hear. Other Republican politicians do this, of course, but not so brazenly; they try to balance the red meat for the GOP base with semi-coherent policy prescriptions aimed at donors and the media. Trump’s shrewdness was realizing that in order to get the Republican nomination, he didn’t need to water down his message. He could offer undiluted wish-fulfillment fantasies. Now that he’s president, Trump has a wider audience beyond the “forgotten Americans” he indulged at rallies. He’s meeting with world leaders like Xi, former Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, and military generals like Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Trump listens to them and, again, echoes back what he hears. He does so because his attitude towards truth is situational. He’ll say whatever the moment requires. Right now, the moment doesn’t require winning over more white working class voters, but working with fellow members of the elite. What this means is that when the situation changes, Trump will unlearn all he has claimed to learn. Currently, his position on health care reform is based on what he’s been told by House Speaker Paul Ryan, whom he has to work with. But if these efforts fail, Trump will find a new, completely different political ally to echo. The same goes with China. Right now, Trump sees an advantage in having good relations, but if that changes he’ll forget everything Xi taught him. This is what Trump really means when he says, as he did before last week’s bombing of a Syrian airfield, “I like to think of myself as a very flexible person. I don’t have to have one specific way, and if the world changes, I go the same way, I don’t change, well, I do change, and I am flexible, and I’m proud of that flexibility.” Note the obvious confusion of his political messaging: “I don’t change, well, I do change.” There is no learning curve with Trump, no gradual accrual of knowledge. He’s a remarkably consistent actor who only seems like he’s capable of growth because he alters his language in new situations. What Trump calls “flexibility,” and the media calls “unpredictability,” is in fact a sign of his rhetorical opportunism. “Mr. Trump sometimes cloaks his evolving positions by declaring victory before retreating,” notes Baker, of the Times. Baker is wrong that Trump is “evolving”—we’re witnessing the same old Trump, as uninterested in knowledge and unprincipled as ever—but right about one thing: It’s all about winning.

Less than three months after Donald Trump took over as President, an MC-130 aircraft operated by the United States Air Force Special Operations Command dropped one of the biggest conventional bombs in country’s arsenal in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. Deployed by the US military for the first time in combat, the GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) is one of the most powerful non-nuclear weapons in the possession of any military worldwide. The 21,000-lb MOAB’s sheer destructive power has earned it the nickname ‘Mother of All Bombs’. Related: Russia has 'Father of All Bombs' Neither India nor Pakistan nor even China possesses non-nuclear bombs that are in the league of MOAB, developed in the early 2000s. In fact, their stockpile doesn’t come anywhere close to MOAB-like munitions. The rare strike against Islamic State fighters with a weapon of this size has turned the spotlight on the world’s biggest and largest contemporary non-nuclear bombs, primarily held only by the militaries of Russia and the US. Here’s a quick look at some of these deadly air-delivered monster munitions whose efficiency and power almost match nuclear weapons, and the smaller bombs that the air forces of India, China and Pakistan hold in their inventories: Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power: Also known as the ‘Father of All Bombs’ (FOAB), it is the Russian answer to the American bomb. Moscow successfully tested the weapon in 2007; four years after the US developed the MOAB. It is reportedly the world’s most powerful non-nuclear bomb, capable of unleashing 44 tons of explosives compared to 11 tons in the GBU-43 MOAB. At 15,650 lb, the FOAB is lighter than the American bomb but the former’s significantly higher blast yield makes it far more lethal. GBU-43 MOAB: Designed to destroy underground facilities, caves and tunnels, the US had developed the GPS-guided bomb for the 2003 invasion of Iraq but it was never used in combat until Thursday evening. Just like the Russian bomb, the 30-foot MOAB detonates before hitting the ground and causes unthinkable destruction by sending deadly shockwaves up to a distance of over a mile in all directions. The GBU-43 MOAB, however, is not the heaviest conventional munition in the American arsenal.

However, the bunker buster bomb’s explosive power doesn’t match that of the MOAB or the FOAB. Manufactured by US defence giant Boeing, the GBU-57A/B MOP is designed to obliterate underground nuclear facilities and deeply buried enemy targets.  GBU-28 Hard Target Penetrator: The air forces of Israel and South Korea have the 5,000-lb GBU-28 bunker buster munitions supplied by the US in their inventories. The bombs were deployed by the USAF during Operation Desert Storm to carry out strikes against Iraqi bunkers, military installations and high value strategic targets in 1991. The GBU-28, a variant of the Paveway III bomb, can reportedly blast through six metres of concrete. GBU-24 Paveway II bombs: The French Air Force’s Rafale omni-role fighters can carry a number of bombs from the US Paveway family of munitions. The heaviest air-to-surface conventional weapon the fighter can be equipped with is the GBU-24 Paveway II 2,000-lb laser-guided bomb.

While it was theoretically capable of launching a shell 2,759 yards (2,523 meters) with a flight time of 23 seconds, each test ended with damage to the mortar itself. One model is currently loaned out to the Royal Artillery in London, U.K., while the other (pictured) is kept on display at Fort Nelson, Hampshire, in Portchester, U.K. 3/13 SLIDES © Croquant with modifications by user: Hex via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 Biggest thermonuclear bomb: Tsar Bomba The most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever detonated, the Soviet RDS-220 hydrogen bomb weighed 60,000 lb (27,000 kg) and had a length of 26 feet (8 meters). Nicknamed the Tsar Bomba, the weapon had a 57 megaton yield and was test-detonated on Sukhoy Nos Cape on Severny Island, Russia, on Oct. 30, 1961. 4/13 SLIDES © Alvesgaspar via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 Biggest medieval cannon: Tsar Cannon Cast in bronze in Moscow, Russia, in 1586, this artillery piece was manufactured by prominent cannon and bell caster Andrey Chokhov. With a barrel diameter of 35.04 inches (890 mm), it is classed as the largest cannon by caliber by Guinness World Records. The 17.5-foot-long (5.34 meter) weapon weighs 86,668 lbs. (39,331 kg) and is now a major tourist attraction in the Russian capital. 5/13 SLIDES © Dmitry Terekhov from Odintsovo, Russian Federation via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.0 Biggest transport chopper: Mil Mi-26 The largest and most powerful helicopter to go into production, this Soviet heavy transport copter has been in service since 1983. Twenty-six feet 7 inches (8.10 meters) high, 131 feet 3 inches (40 meters) long, with a main rotor diameter of 104 feet 12 inches (32 meters) and tail rotor diameter of 24 feet 12 inches (7.61 meters), the Mi-26 holds the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale world record for lifting the greatest mass: 125,153.8 lbs. (56,768.8 kg) to an altitude of 6,562 feet (2,000 meters) in 1982. Several countries' militaries still use it: Algeria, India, North Korea, Russia and Ukraine. The United Nations, Belgium and Russia also use it for civil operations. 6/13 SLIDES © Phrontis via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 Biggest tank: Char-2C Developed during World War I, this French super-heavy tank was deployed in 1921. Physically the biggest tank ever made, the Char-2C had a length of 33 feet 8 inches (10.27 meters), width of 9 feet 10 inches (3 meters), stood 13 feet 5 inches (4.09 meters) high and had 1.8-inch (45 mm) armor thickness. It was the first of its kind to be fitted with a three-man turret and took a crew of 12 to operate. It used a 2.95-inch (75 mm) Canon de 75 modèle 1897 as its main weapon. They saw operational service in World War II but, after the French surrender in 1940, were never used on the battlefield again. 7/13 SLIDES © By U.S. National Arvhives (War Department Photo Collection) via Wikimedia Commons Biggest heavy mortar: Little David With a caliber, or barrel diameter, of 36 inches (914 mm), this American heavy mortar was used for test-firing aerial bombs at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland, U.S. The weapon was converted into a mobile unit comprising an 80,000 lb. (36,000 kg) barrel and 93,000 lb. (42,000 kg) base. After Japan surrendered in 1945 and World War II came to an end, development on the weapon came to an end without it ever seeing combat. The Little David can be seen as part of the outdoor collection of armor and artillery at the Maryland facility. 8/13 SLIDES © Georges DeKeerle/Sygma/Getty Images Biggest nuclear-powered submarine: Typhoon-class Deployed by the Soviet Navy in 1981, this nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine class has a submerged displacement of 52,911 tons (48,000,000 kg). With a length of 574 feet 2 inches (175 meters), beam or side-to-side width of 75 feet 6 inches (23 meters) and draught of 39 feet 4 inches (12 meters), they could reach 22.22 knots (41.15 km/h; 25.57 mph) when surfaced and 27 knots (50 km/h; 31 mph) when submerged. Between 1980 and 1990, seven Typhoons were launched. The TK 208 Dmitri Donskoy remains in active service, with two other models decommissioned but held in reserve. The remaining four have been scrapped. 9/13 SLIDES © Scargill via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 3.0 Biggest railway guns: Schwerer Gustav and Dora Designed in the 1930s by the German steel and artillery firm Krupp, these railway guns weighed 1,488 tons (1,349,999 kg) when assembled and were capable of firing 7.7 ton (6,985 kg) shells over a range of 29 miles (47 km). The Gustav was developed to assault the French Maginot Line during World War II; in fact, the only combat that the Gustav saw was during the siege of Sevastopol. (Pictured) A model of Dora in the Overloon War Museum in the Netherlands. 10/13 SLIDES © Geni via Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 4.0-3.0-2.5-2.0-1.0 Biggest supergun: Project Babylon Commissioned by former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the Babylon project began in 1988 under the guidance of Canadian-American engineer Gerald Bull. The project developed two superguns, Baby Babylon and Big Babylon (pictured). The Baby gun was intended to be a prototype, with a caliber of 13.8 inches (350 mm), barrel length of 151 feet (46 meters) and weighed 112.4 tons (101,967.56 kg). The Big gun was planned to have a caliber of 3.3 feet (1 meter), barrel length of 512 feet (156 meters) and weighed 2,314.8 tons (2,100,000 kg). Both the weapons were too bulky and not designed to be portable. Bull was assassinated in Brussels in March 1990 and parts of the supergun were seized while in transit in Europe, ending the project. 11/13 SLIDES © U.S. Navy graphic via Wikimedia Commons Biggest supercarrier: Gerald R. Ford class aircraft carrier Designed by the U.S. Navy to replace the Nimitz class carriers, the Ford class carriers have a length of 1,106 feet (337 meters), a flight deck beam of 256 feet (78 meters) and a height of 250 feet (76 meters), making them the largest aircraft carriers ever built. Able to carry more than 75 aircraft, the Ford-class uses an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System to improve efficiency. Still in the manufacturing mode, the class is expected to have 10 ships. Three of them have been announced to date: Gerald R. Ford (scheduled commissioning in 2017), John F. Kennedy (scheduled commissioning in 2020) and Enterprise (scheduled commissioning in 2025). (Pictured) Artist's concept of Gerald R. Ford. 12/13 SLIDES © Wikimedia Commons Heaviest battleship: Yamato The heaviest battleships ever created, these Imperial Japanese Navy World War II vessels were first commissioned on Dec. 16, 1941, and had a displacement of 64,000 long tons (65,027,002 kg). Named after the Japanese province, the Yamato class was created specifically to outgun the American naval fleet. Fitted with nine 18.1 inch (46 cm) 45 Caliber Type 94 guns as the main armament, the ships (two were launched) played an important role in the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. Both were sunk in the closing months of the war. 13/13 SLIDES © Superewer via Wikimedia Commons Heaviest tank: Panzer VIII Maus Weighing 207.2 tons (188,000.4 kg), this German tank remains the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built. Only one complete prototype was built, which was 33 feet 6 inches (10.2 meters) long, 12 feet 2 inches (3.71 meters) wide and 11.9 feet (3.63 meters) high. A 5-inch (128 mm) KwK 44 gun L/55 was used as the main armament, and the vehicle was also fitted with a 3-inch (75 mm) KwK 44 gun L/36.5 and 0.31 inch (7.92 mm) MG 34 machine gun. The Maus is showcased at the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia. 13/13 SLIDES INDIA SPICE: The Israel-manufactured SPICE (smart precise impact and cost effective) bomb is the biggest conventional bomb that can be delivered by the Indian Air Force. Manufactured by Israeli firm Rafael Advanced Defence Systems Ltd, the 2000-lb precision guided bombs are used on the French-origin Mirage 2000 fighters. The IAF’s Jaguar deep-strike penetration aircraft can be fitted with 1,000-lb bombs for destroying the enemy’s ammunition dumps during combat. In one configuration, a Sukhoi-30 MKI fighter can carry 26 bombs of 550-lb class to destroy a concentration of enemy armour and personnel. The fighter can also carry 1,000-lb HSLD (high speed, low drag) bombs to destroy enemy airfields. Indian fighter planes can also drop indigenously produced 1,000-lb bombs fitted with Israel Aircraft Industries-produced Griffin laser-guided systems. 36 ISIS militants killed in US 'mother of all bombs' attack, says Afghan ministry  CHINA AND PAKISTAN The People’s Liberation Army Air Force has a variety of conventional bombs ranging in the 500 lb to 3,000-lb class. Most of these general purpose bombs have been developed by the China’s North Industries Corporation. Most of the designs are reportedly based on bombs earlier imported from Russia. Some of the designs also reportedly draw inspiration from the US Mk 80/82/83/84 bombs. Some other bombs in the Chinese inventory are also suspected to have been copied from Western designs. The conventional bombs with Pakistan Air Force are in the 250 lb to 2,000-lb class, with the design again based on the US Mk 80 series bombs and mated to laser guided systems of American origin. Former IAF vice chief Air Marshal KK Nohwar told HT on Friday, “India, China and Pakistan largely have a similar stockpile of lighter non-nuclear bombs. It’s nowhere close to the mega bombs that the Russians and the Americans can deploy in combat.” Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

From the currency manipulation by the Chinese to his choice as the Federal Reserve head, Trump has contradicted statements he made while on the presidential campaign trail. By doing so, Trump has departed from some of radical changes he once promised and has moved toward policy positions of those before him. Up to now China was a target of his frequent barbs. Repeatedly during the election campaign, Trump accused China of manipulating its own currency. Trump last year before the election said he would instruct his future treasury secretary to put a label of currency manipulator on China. In 2015, Trump penned an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal that was named, “Ending China’s Currency Manipulation,” However, this week in an interview with the same WSJ Trump did a big about-face when he said China was not currency manipulators. The new view Trump has of China has aligned him with the conclusion of the mainstream that China no longer manipulated its yuan to increase exports a number of years ago, or years prior to the statements made by Trump during his presidential campaign. Former President Obama’s administration at times had called the currency in China significantly undervalued, but did never label the government a manipulator. In addition, Trump this week reversed his opinion of the Export-Import Bank, which provides loan guarantees to finance exports from the U.S. During his campaign he often complained that the bank did not support free enterprise because it unfairly subsidized exports from large companies such as General Electric, Caterpillar and Boeing. However, this week Trump said he no longer wanted to eliminate the bank, which is a stance similar to what Obama took, who advocated for the bank. Many believe that Trump has received many comments related to that matter from the different CEOs that have been invited to the White House. Some see the move by Trump to policy views that are more mainstream as evidence of how the power has been taken from Steven Bannon and the ascendancy of Jared Kushner the son-in-law of the president. Trump has also suggested that he might still reappoint current Federal Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen for another term. He had said previously he would not do that. He accused Yellen of keeping interest rates low to help the Obama administration, but now says he would like them to remain low.

In August, Solntsev said Energia was preparing a Moon expedition on board an upgraded Soyuz spacecraft, with eight space tourists interested in a trip. Renowned filmmaker James Cameron and a Japanese family were said to be among the first to express their interest in the lunar orbit. "Then there's also the development of tourist flights into lunar orbit on board the Soyuz, there is potential demand, four people are already prepared to pay us and a US company," Solntsev said at a parliamentary expert aerospace industry session. Energia has been cooperating with the US-based Space Adventures space tourism company to find potential tourists wishing to fly around the moon. Space Adventures reportedly priced the trip at $150 million, with the launch itself likely to take place by 2020. The Soyuz spacecraft was designed in the 1960s as part of the Soviet manned lunar program. It later became the world's most-used and longest-serving spacecraft model and was used to transport cosmonauts the Salyut and Mir space stations. It is now used to transport cosmonauts and astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS). ...

Listen Listening... / Listen to the Story President Trump's economic policy pronouncements have taken some twists and turns this week. From Chinese currency manipulation to his choice to head the Federal Reserve, Trump contradicted statements he'd made during the presidential campaign. In doing so, Trump is departing from some of the radical changes he promised, and moving toward the positions of his predecessors. Until now China was a frequent target. Over and over during the presidential campaign, Trump pilloried China, accusing it of manipulating its currency. "I'm going to instruct my Treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator! The greatest in the world," Trump said at a Florida rally last year. In 2015, Trump even penned an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal called "Ending China's Currency Manipulation." But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, Trump did an about-face, saying, "They're not currency manipulators." Trump's new view of China aligned him with the mainstream conclusion that China stopped manipulating its currency to boost exports several years ago, well before Trump's statements to the contrary during the campaign. Derek Scissors, a specialist in U.S.-China economic relations at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says Trump's opposing characterizations of China are both justified. "It's legitimate as a candidate to run against the history of Chinese action, because that affects the American people," he says. "But as president you have to deal with what's going on now. And with what's going on now, China is not a currency manipulator right now." Economist Dean Baker of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research says the timing of Trump's change of views was likely related to an annual report on trade manipulators that is due from the Treasury this weekend. "I don't have any advance knowledge of the report. But I'm assuming it will not be labeling China as a manipulator," Baker says. "And [Trump] had to lay the groundwork for that, because during the campaign, he made that his commitment. 'As soon as I get in office, we're going to label China a manipulator and take action against them.' " Baker says he's a little disappointed that Trump seems to be dropping the currency issue. Baker believes China still manages its currency in a way that perpetuates huge trade imbalances with the U.S. and hurts U.S. manufacturing. "We can't reverse history. We can't get back to where we were 20 years ago and bring back all the jobs that were lost in Michigan, Ohio and these other states," he says. "But we could make a difference if we had something closer to balanced trade." The Obama administration had at times called China's currency "significantly undervalued," but didn't take the step of labeling the country a manipulator. Also this week, Trump reversed his view of the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that provides loan guarantees to finance U.S. exports. During the campaign he complained the bank wasn't supporting "free enterprise," because it was unfairly subsidizing exports from big companies like Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar. It was a position similar to small-government conservatives like Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who opposed the bank and called it "corporate welfare." But on Wednesday, Trump told the Journal he no longer wants to eliminate it. That's a similar position to Obama, who had advocated for the bank's role. Baker says Trump is no doubt getting an earful on this matter from the CEOs he has been inviting to the White House. "These large firms are all politically powerful and when you're actually sitting there at the White House, they're talking to you," he says. The AEI's Scissors believes Trump's top White House economic adviser, Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs, has probably helped move Trump to more mainstream business views on the Ex-Im Bank. "They want the government involved in certain financial deals," Scissors says. "And the free market types — which includes me, by the way — don't want the government involved, because the Export-Import Bank doesn't spread the money evenly. It chooses certain companies to support." Others see Trump's move to more mainstream policy views as evidence of the waning power of populist Steve Bannon in the White House and the ascendancy of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump also suggested to the Journal that he could still reappoint Janet Yellen to another term as Federal Reserve chair — something he said before that he wouldn't do. And after accusing Yellen of keeping rates low to help President Obama, Trump said he'd like to see interest rates kept low for him, too. NPR's James Doubek contributed to this report.

But in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, Trump did an about-face, saying, "They're not currency manipulators." Trump's new view of China aligned him with the mainstream conclusion that China stopped manipulating its currency to boost exports several years ago, well before Trump's statements to the contrary during the campaign. Derek Scissors, a specialist in U.S.-China economic relations at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says Trump's opposing characterizations of China are both justified. "It's legitimate as a candidate to run against the history of Chinese action, because that affects the American people," he says. "But as president you have to deal with what's going on now. And with what's going on now, China is not a currency manipulator right now." Economist Dean Baker of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research says the timing of Trump's change of views was likely related to an annual report on trade manipulators that is due from the Treasury this weekend. "I don't have any advance knowledge of the report. But I'm assuming it will not be labeling China as a manipulator," Baker says. "And [Trump] had to lay the groundwork for that, because during the campaign, he made that his commitment. 'As soon as I get in office, we're going to label China a manipulator and take action against them.' " Politics Trump Can't Bring Back All Those Jobs From China. Here's What He Can Do Baker says he's a little disappointed that Trump seems to be dropping the currency issue. Baker believes China still manages its currency in a way that perpetuates huge trade imbalances with the U.S. and hurts U.S. manufacturing. "We can't reverse history. We can't get back to where we were 20 years ago and bring back all the jobs that were lost in Michigan, Ohio and these other states," he says. "But we could make a difference if we had something closer to balanced trade." The Obama administration had at times called China's currency "significantly undervalued," but didn't take the step of labeling the country a manipulator. Also this week, Trump reversed his view of the Export-Import Bank, a government agency that provides loan guarantees to finance U.S. exports. During the campaign he complained the bank wasn't supporting "free enterprise," because it was unfairly subsidizing exports from big companies like Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar. It was a position similar to small-government conservatives like Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, who opposed the bank and called it "corporate welfare." But on Wednesday, Trump told the Journal he no longer wants to eliminate it. That's a similar position to Obama, who had advocated for the bank's role. Baker says Trump is no doubt getting an earful on this matter from the CEOs he has been inviting to the White House. Business Export-Import Bank Debate: 'Retreat From Sanity' Or End of Corporate Welfare? "These large firms are all politically powerful and when you're actually sitting there at the White House, they're talking to you," he says. The AEI's Scissors believes Trump's top White House economic adviser, Gary Cohn, formerly of Goldman Sachs, has probably helped move Trump to more mainstream business views on the Ex-Im Bank. "They want the government involved in certain financial deals," Scissors says. "And the free market types — which includes me, by the way — don't want the government involved, because the Export-Import Bank doesn't spread the money evenly. It chooses certain companies to support." Others see Trump's move to more mainstream policy views as evidence of the waning power of populist Steve Bannon in the White House and the ascendancy of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump also suggested to the Journal that he could still reappoint Janet Yellen to another term as Federal Reserve chair — something he said before that he wouldn't do. And after accusing Yellen of keeping rates low to help President Obama, Trump said he'd like to see interest rates kept low for him, too.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images President Trump's economic policy pronouncements have taken some twists and turns this week. From Chinese currency manipulation to his choice to head the Federal Reserve, Trump contradicted statements he'd made during the presidential campaign. In doing so, Trump is departing from some of the radical changes he promised, and moving toward the positions of his predecessors. Until now China was a frequent target.

EDT/0130 GMT on FridayReuters | Apr 14, 2017, 07.05 AM IST April 13 (Reuters) - Highlights for U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Thursday: AFGHANISTAN The United States drops a massive GBU-43 bomb, the largest non-nuclear bomb it has ever used in combat, in Afghanistan against a series of caves used by Islamic State militants, the Pentagon says. NORTH KOREA Trump says Pyongyang is a problem that "will be taken care of" amid speculation that North Korea is on the verge of a sixth nuclear test. Military force cannot resolve tension over North Korea, China warns, while an influential Chinese newspaper urges Pyongyang to halt its nuclear program in exchange for Beijing's protection. The Trump administration is focusing its North Korea strategy on tougher economic sanctions, possibly including intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang, U.S. officials say. RUSSIA Trump says "things will work out fine" between the United States and Russia, a day after declaring U.S.-Russian relations may be at an all-time low. FEDERAL RESERVE Trump signals he could be moving closer to the mainstream on monetary policy, saying he has not ruled out reappointment of Janet Yellen as Federal Reserve chair as he considers his choices for the U.S. central bank. ABORTION Trump signs a resolution that will allow U.S. states to restrict how federal funds for contraception and reproductive health are spent, a move cheered by anti-abortion campaigners. DEUTSCHE BANK Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump's debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has "great concern" about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trump's office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. FINANCIAL REGULATION Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. TRADE WITH JAPAN The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. IMMIGRATION Trump's administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

DEUTSCHE BANK Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen presses Deutsche Bank to release information about issues including Trump's debt and any bank meetings with Trump administration officials, saying he has "great concern" about possible conflicts of interest. EXPORT-IMPORT BANK Trump's office says he plans to revive the hobbled Export-Import Bank of the United States, a victory for American manufacturers such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co that have overseas customers that use the agency's government-backed loans to purchase their products. FINANCIAL REGULATION Top Wall Street bankers say they are having positive discussions about financial regulation in Washington, and downplay the idea U.S. policymakers may force their institutions to split up. TRADE WITH JAPAN The United States is pushing for trade to be a key issue in top-level economic talks with Japan, a source says, an unwelcome development for Tokyo, which is seeking to fend off U.S. pressure to reduce the bilateral trade imbalance. IMMIGRATION Trump's administration has focused on one group of illegal immigrants more than others: women with children, according to eight Department of Homeland Security officials interviewed by Reuters about agency planning.

Photo: Gary Hershorn/Getty Images By now, you’ve probably seen this video of United Airlines refusing to let one of its passengers “fly the friendly skies.” The airline had overbooked a Sunday night flight from Chicago to Louisville, Kentucky. When not enough passengers were willing to relinquish their seats voluntarily, a few were selected at random for de-boarding. One of those unlucky souls was, apparently, a doctor with patients to see the next day in Kentucky. He refused to exit the plane. So, security officials dragged him kicking and screaming — and bleeding — down the aisle. Some minutes later, they allowed him back onto the plane. Reflecting on his experience, the passenger stammered, “I have to go home … just kill me.” #flythefriendlyskies @united no words. This poor man!! pic.twitter.com/rn0rbeckwT— Kaylyn Davis (@kaylyn_davis) April 10, 2017 From one angle, this incident might look too atypical to tell us much about the state of America’s airline industry. To travel by air, Americans must subject themselves to myriad indignities, including showing up for overbooked planes and learning gateside that they are no longer welcome aboard. But being randomly selected for assault by security personnel generally isn’t one of them. It would also be reasonable to expect that the onboard assault of an elderly man, motivated solely by the United’s desire to save a few hundred bucks, might bring about some major changes. But the big airlines are dysfunctional at deeper level than most fliers realize. All industry forecasts paint greater consolidation, higher fares, and reduced service to midsize airports as the only path to sustained profitability. The incident on the Chicago tarmac might be a new low, but things are not going to get better anytime soon. For decades, airlines have been cancelling low-volume routes, reducing service quality, raising prices, merging to achieve economies of scale, declaring bankruptcy, and sucking up billions in public subsidies, and the industry still teeters on the brink of insolvency. U.S. airlines were in the red for all but three years between 2001 and 2010, according to the industry’s trade group. Their net loss over that period amounted to $62.9 billion. When the Carter administration began deregulating the airlines in the late ’70s, it did so in the name of fostering price competition. Sure, relinquishing public control might jeopardize smaller, rural cities’ access to convenient air travel, but free-market competition would also make flying more affordable for the vast majority of Americans. But thanks in no small part to lax antitrust enforcement by President Reagan and his successors, deregulation ultimately turned a public quasi-monopoly into a private one. Or, as Phillip Longman and Lina Khan put it in a 2012 essay for Washington Monthly, Carter’s reforms shifted “control of the airline industry from experts answerable to the public to corporate boardrooms and Wall Street.” This shift did little to nothing to make airfare more affordable in the long term. The cost of flying was actually declining at a faster rate before deregulation than it has since, according to a 2007 study in the Journal of the Transportation Research Forum. But the shift has taken a big toll on customer service standards — and, more significantly, on the economic growth of America’s midsize cities. As Longman and Khan write: The loss of airline service to rural and remote areas is an old story; by the 1980s, even some state capitals — such as Olympia, Washington; Dover, Delaware; and Salem, Oregon — became places you could no longer fly to except in a private plane. But over the last five years, service to medium-sized airports fell by 18 percent. … St. Louis, for example, has seen “available seat miles” — an industry measure of capacity — fall to a third of their 2000 level, following the American Airlines takeover of TWA and Lambert International Airport’s subsequent downgrading as a mid-continental hub. Two of Lambert’s five concourses are now virtually empty, and another, which housed the TWA hub, is only partially used. A third runway — the building of which required demolishing hundreds of homes and cost local taxpayers a billion dollars to finish in 2006 — is now redundant. “This scenario,” notes Alex Marshall, a senior fellow at the Regional Plan Association, “can be likened to states building highways and then having General Motors, Ford, and other auto companies suddenly telling their drivers to use different roads.” St. Louis’s loss of service comes despite the fact that the population of the St. Louis metropolitan area, the eighteenth largest in the U.S., grew by more than 4 percent between 2000 and 2010. The city is also the home of eight Fortune 500 companies and is a major center for such international players as Anheuser-Busch InBev, Monsanto, Boeing, Emerson Electric, Express Scripts, and Nestlé Purina. The GDP of the metro area, which is also propelled by such large research institutions as Washington University and a fast-growing medical sciences sector, rivals that of oil-rich Qatar. Yet like most other midsize American cities, St. Louis’s economic development is now hostage to the shifting, closed-door deals and mergers of a mere handful of airline executives and their financiers. In the writers’ estimation, a return to robust antitrust enforcement can’t cure the airline industry’s “terminal illness” by itself, because: [A]irlines — just like railroads, waterworks, electrical utilities, and most other networked systems — require concentration both to achieve economies of scale and to enable the cross-subsidization between low- and high-cost service necessary to preserve their value as networks. And when it comes to such natural monopolies that are essential to the public, there is no equitable or efficient alternative to having the government regulate or coordinate entry, prices, and service levels — no matter how messy the process may be. Needless to say, radically increasing government regulation is a nonstarter in Trump’s Washington. And taking on the entrenched interests of the airline industry didn’t really fly in Obama’s, either. Three years ago, the Obama Justice Department sued to block a merger between American Airlines and U.S. Airways, after concluding that “increasing consolidation among large airlines has hurt passengers … The major airlines have copied each other in raising fares, imposing new fees on travelers, reducing or eliminating service on a number of city pairs, and downgrading amenities.” Then the airlines hired former Obama administration officials and well-connected Democrats to lobby on their behalf. Three months later, the DOJ cleared the merger for takeoff. Still, it seems doubtful that our government will let a giant, profit-starved, private monopoly torture its customers and suffocate regional economies in perpetuity. And the growth strategies of our major airlines suggest they’re not going to stop doing either of those things on their own volition. So maybe, someday, America will arrive at a sane air-transportation policy. But one thing’s for sure: All such departures have been delayed for four to eight years.

(REUTERS) Less than three months after Donald Trump took over as President, an MC-130 aircraft operated by the United States Air Force Special Operations Command dropped one of the biggest conventional bombs in country’s arsenal in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday. Deployed by the US military for the first time in combat, the GBU-43 Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) is one of the most powerful non-nuclear weapons in the possession of any military worldwide. The 21,000-lb MOAB’s sheer destructive power has earned it the nickname ‘Mother of All Bombs’. Neither India nor Pakistan nor even China possesses non-nuclear bombs that are in the league of MOAB, developed in the early 2000s. In fact, their stockpile doesn’t come anywhere close to MOAB-like munitions. Read | US drops GBU-43 bomb in Afghanistan: What we know about the ‘mother of all bombs’ The rare strike against Islamic State fighters with a weapon of this size has turned the spotlight on the world’s biggest and largest contemporary non-nuclear bombs, primarily held only by the militaries of Russia and the US. Here’s a quick look at some of these deadly air-delivered monster munitions whose efficiency and power almost match nuclear weapons, and the smaller bombs that the air forces of India, China and Pakistan hold in their inventories: Aviation Thermobaric Bomb of Increased Power: Also known as the ‘Father of All Bombs’ (FOAB), it is the Russian answer to the American bomb. Moscow successfully tested the weapon in 2007; four years after the US developed the MOAB. It is reportedly the world’s most powerful non-nuclear bomb, capable of unleashing 44 tons of explosives compared to 11 tons in the GBU-43 MOAB. At 15,650 lb, the FOAB is lighter than the American bomb but the former’s significantly higher blast yield makes it far more lethal. GBU-43 MOAB: Designed to destroy underground facilities, caves and tunnels, the US had developed the GPS-guided bomb for the 2003 invasion of Iraq but it was never used in combat until Thursday evening. Just like the Russian bomb, the 30-foot MOAB detonates before hitting the ground and causes unthinkable destruction by sending deadly shockwaves up to a distance of over a mile in all directions. The GBU-43 MOAB, however, is not the heaviest conventional munition in the American arsenal. GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator: Known by its acronym MOP, the 30,000-lb American bomb is perhaps the heaviest conventional weapon in the world. However, the bunker buster bomb’s explosive power doesn’t match that of the MOAB or the FOAB. Manufactured by US defence giant Boeing, the GBU-57A/B MOP is designed to obliterate underground nuclear facilities and deeply buried enemy targets. GBU-28 Hard Target Penetrator: The air forces of Israel and South Korea have the 5,000-lb GBU-28 bunker buster munitions supplied by the US in their inventories. The bombs were deployed by the USAF during Operation Desert Storm to carry out strikes against Iraqi bunkers, military installations and high value strategic targets in 1991. The GBU-28, a variant of the Paveway III bomb, can reportedly blast through six metres of concrete. Read more Trump says he ordered Syria missile strike during dessert with Chinese President Xi Syrian president Bashar al-Assad says news of gas attack ‘100% fabrication’ GBU-24 Paveway II bombs: The French Air Force’s Rafale omni-role fighters can carry a number of bombs from the US Paveway family of munitions. The heaviest air-to-surface conventional weapon the fighter can be equipped with is the GBU-24 Paveway II 2,000-lb laser-guided bomb. INDIA SPICE: The Israel-manufactured SPICE (smart precise impact and cost effective) bomb is the biggest conventional bomb that can be delivered by the Indian Air Force. Manufactured by Israeli firm Rafael Advanced Defence Systems Ltd, the 2000-lb precision guided bombs are used on the French-origin Mirage 2000 fighters. The IAF’s Jaguar deep-strike penetration aircraft can be fitted with 1,000-lb bombs for destroying the enemy’s ammunition dumps during combat. In one configuration, a Sukhoi-30 MKI fighter can carry 26 bombs of 550-lb class to destroy a concentration of enemy armour and personnel. The fighter can also carry 1,000-lb HSLD (high speed, low drag) bombs to destroy enemy airfields. Indian fighter planes can also drop indigenously produced 1,000-lb bombs fitted with Israel Aircraft Industries-produced Griffin laser-guided systems CHINA AND PAKISTAN The People’s Liberation Army Air Force has a variety of conventional bombs ranging in the 500 lb to 3,000-lb class. Most of these general purpose bombs have been developed by the China’s North Industries Corporation. Most of the designs are reportedly based on bombs earlier imported from Russia. Some of the designs also reportedly draw inspiration from the US Mk 80/82/83/84 bombs. Some other bombs in the Chinese inventory are also suspected to have been copied from Western designs. The conventional bombs with Pakistan Air Force are in the 250 lb to 2,000-lb class, with the design again based on the US Mk 80 series bombs and mated to laser guided systems of American origin. Former IAF vice chief Air Marshal KK Nohwar told HT on Friday, “India, China and Pakistan largely have a similar stockpile of lighter non-nuclear bombs. It’s nowhere close to the mega bombs that the Russians and the Americans can deploy in combat.” Read more Syria happy with India’s ‘balanced’ stand on crisis: Riad Abbas, Syrian ambassador to India Syria gas attack: Those who use sarin can’t escape justice | Opinion tags US GBU 43 India military India ammunition India missiles more from india BJP MLA Sangeet Som gets clean chit in inflammatory video case Apr 15, 2017 09:41 IST Live: Eight coaches of Meerut-Lucknow Rajya Rani Express derail in UP, railways says no casualties Apr 15, 2017 09:47 IST Worth a Thousand Words- Make Your Smartphone Photography Smarter Promotional Feature Recommended for you Read more India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Blogs Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Health & fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper HT Indepth Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

The White House announced late Friday that Trump plans to nominate Scott Garrett, a former Republican congressman from New Jersey, to serve as president of the credit agency, which helps overseas buyers get financing to purchase U.S. exports. Trump will also nominate Spencer T. Bachus III of Alabama, another former House member, to serve as a member of the bank’s board of directors. Garrett voted against renewing the bank’s charter while he was in Congress, denouncing it as “corporate welfare.” “I opposed the House’s vote to reauthorize the corporate welfare program known as the Ex-Im Bank. #CronyCapitalism,” he tweeted in 2015. It’s a view he used to share with Trump — at least until this week. During his campaign, Trump criticized the credit agency as an unnecessary giveaway to politicians and certain companies. “I don’t like it because I don’t think it’s necessary,” he told Bloomberg, describing it as “sort of a featherbedding for politicians” and “a few companies.” “And these are companies that can do very well without it. So I don’t like it. I think it’s a lot of excess baggage,” he added. But this week Trump announced he’d changed his mind, telling The Wall Street Journal in an interview that he now supports it. “It turns out that, first of all lots of small companies will really be helped, the vendor companies, but also maybe more importantly, other countries give it,” he said. “And when other countries give it, we lose a tremendous amount of business.” The bank has been hobbled in recent years without enough board members to produce a quorum, blocking it from approving transactions exceeding $10 million. Much of the bank’s financing benefits large corporation such as The Boeing Company, General Electric and Caterpillar Inc. Republican groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support the bank. But vocal opponents, including many Republicans and outside groups such as the Heritage Foundation, have said it practices crony capitalism, awarding most of its financing to well-connected corporations.

Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed – Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Search 18 C Harare Saturday, April 15, 2017 About Us Contact Us Advertising Listen to Radio Privacy Policy Who is Who News Alerts Nehanda Radio Home News Politics Business Opinion Bizarre Courts Local Diaspora World Showbiz Sports Home Opinion Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed Opinion Popular Letter from America: If South Africa goes, we are doomed Apr 13, 2017 1 7287 By Ken Mufuka My research interest was in finding the Methodist connection with early African nationalism. From South Africa came Enoch Sontonga, a Shangani who bequeathed to us the anthem: Nkosi Sikelela iAfrica. Another giant who walked on this earth was Chief Albert Lithuli, president of the African National Congress (ANC), 1952-1967. Born in Zimbabwe at Hope Fountain Mission, Lithuli and his widowed mother settled at Endendale Methodist Mission in Natal. Both served as teachers and lay pastors in the Methodist faith. Lithuli biographer says that he was intolerant of hatred and adamant that the struggle for human dignity in South Africa should follow a non-violent path. His book, Let My People Go (1960) was regarded as offering a bridge between his native African culture and the Eurocentric culture, which dominated the world at the time. His acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize (1960) further alienated the Dutch racists in South Africa, who plotted his murder. It was Lithuli’s insistence against hatred of the Dutch racists that led to a breach in the ANC and the formation of the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC). The PAC’s appeal to the African youth was the belief that the only thing that a Dutchman understood was a bullet in the head. Here is the connection between the old and the new, personified in the person of South African President Jacob Zuma whose appeal and ideology, solidified in the Umkonto weSizwe, is expressed in his anthem: Bring me my machine gun. None of my hosts were familiar with Sontongo and Chief Lithuli who seemed to them like shadowy figures in the distant past. My taxi driver was enthusiastic about Zuma and was acquainted with the Economic Freedom Fighters. Events in South Africa inexorably diverted my attention to the bitter narrative that hangs on Zuma like an albatross. The narrative is that blacks (called Bantus in whispers) are indifferent to economic husbandry and that anybody other than an African will do well to handle the treasury. Therefore, the presence of Pravin Gordhan, of Asian origin, at the South African treasury, was a must, otherwise one day South Africa will wake up to find the treasury has been emptied. Gordhan made his entry into South African politics through the Natal Indian Congress, an offshoot of Mahatma Gandhi’s Indian Congress. If there is truth in this supposedly self-evident truth, and South Africa goes the way of Zimbabwe, then Africa is doomed. One of my hosts was a youngish white business couple that had migrated to Australia, in their wisdom, to escape the coming doom. They confirmed that there was a huge “capital migration” from South Africa — he was, but one example. Zuma has been implicated in the defence procurement scandals of 1999. When his financial advisor, Shabir Shaik, was thrown in jail for corruption in 2005, then president Thabo Mbeki removed Zuma from the vice presidency of the Republic. Zuma’s trial in 2006 for sexual abuse lasted several months further blackening his name. The Zulus have a different interpretation. There was bad blood between Mbeki and Zuma partly because Mbeki took liberties (assumed to be of a sexual nature) with Nkosazana Zuma (Zuma’s wife) who was foreign minister then. Mbeki, who saw himself as a philosopher king, despised Zuma, whose formal education is, but a bare thread. Zuma, married to four wives and with 20 children, claims to have a philosophy. This is the heart of the contention, that Afrocentric leaders are incapable of appreciating a constitutional form of government, which places limits on the ruler. That these nepotistic politicians serve their families and friends comes with the territory. State of Capture is a report by the Public Protector on the relationship between Zuma, son Duduzane and three Indian migrants, the Guptas. Within a short time, the Gupta brothers acquired a bank, a television station and an investment instrument. It is their non-transparent financial transactions that have provoked a crisis of confidence in the country itself. The Public Protector concluded that their influence on the Zuma family amounts to a stranglehold and that affairs of State are filtered through this nefarious family first, by-passing State institutions and the ANC. One example will suffice. Vytjie Mentor claimed that she was offered a job by the Guptas on condition she cancelled the South African Airways (SAA) flights to India. This story explains why Nick Bezuidenhout (35) a whiz kid at SAA was forced to leave and also why the parastatal engaged in unprofitable ventures. SAA’s collaboration with Lufthansa is profitable to the Germans, but drains passengers away from SAA. A Charlotte-Johannesburg ticket bought through SAA costs US$1 000 more than one bought through Lufthansa. As a result, a SAA 350-seat 747 Boeing from Munich to Johannesburg had less than 100 passengers. The Public Protector cites examples of similar style management at the electricity commission (Eskom) where Gupta Teget officials are in an incestuous relationship with Eskom managers. The narrative surrounding the management of South African parastatals reads like an old story to Zimbabweans. Eskom is like ZESA Holdings. SAA is like Air Zimbabwe. South African Railways is like the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ). Let us start by sending a girlfriend or a relative to such and such parastatal. Just for the heck of it, we can send another relative of a chef to ZESA. At NRZ, the board chairperson, Alvord Mabhena is informed by the national radio that he has been replaced by someone else. I woke up in Munich. It was all a dream.

The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration said on Thursday that the U.S Air Force completed the first qualification flight test of the B61-12 gravity bomb on March 14 at Tonopah Test Range in Nevada. According to the National Nuclear Security Administration, the non-nuclear test assembly was dropped from an F-16 based at Nellis Air Force Base. The test evaluated both the weapon’s non-nuclear functions as well as the aircraft’s capability to deliver the weapon. This event is the first of a series that will be conducted over the next three years to qualify the B61-12 for service. Three successful development flight tests were conducted in 2015. “This demonstration of effective end-to-end system performance in a realistic ballistic flight environment marks another on-time achievement for the B61-12 Life Extension Program,” said Brig. Gen. Michael Lutton, NNSA’s principal assistant deputy administrator for military application. “The successful test provides critical qualification data to validate that the baseline design meets military requirements. It reflects the nation’s continued commitment to our national security and that of our allies and partners.” The flight test included hardware designed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories, manufactured by the Nuclear Security Enterprise plants, and mated to the tail-kit assembly section, designed by the Boeing Company under contract with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center. The B61-12 consolidates and replaces four B61 bomb variants in the nation’s nuclear arsenal. The first production unit is scheduled to be completed by March 2020, the National Nuclear Security Administration said. ← Justice Deferred: 15 Year Anniversary Of Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission Verdict – OpEd USS Stethem Operates In South China Sea → You May Also Like Ralph Nader: ‘Making America Great’ At Americans’ Expense – OpEd March 14, 2017 Ralph Nader 0 White House Accused Of Censoring French President Mentioning ‘Islamist Terrorism’ April 4, 2016 RT 0 Iraq: 11 Killed, Including Two US Soldiers June 14, 2011 Al Bawaba News 0 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Become a CEO, then he'll talk. By Matthew Rozsa / Salon April 14, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Evan El-Amin / Shutterstock The feud between President Donald Trump’s top two advisers, chief strategist Steve Bannon and son-in-law Jared Kushner, may reflect a deeper dynamic: When it comes to the struggle between populism and business thinking in shaping his policies, the business thinkers are winning. For instance, Trump has stopped insisting (as he did during his presidential campaign) on calling China a currency manipulator due to the waning influence of anti-globalism populist Bannon, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Similarly, Kushner has joined Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn in urging Trump to take a more moderate approach in handling Mexico. Cohn and Kushner joined Ross when he met Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo at a joint March 10 press conference to proclaim that they were starting the “beginning of a working relationship to help bring progress and development to both our nations.” Just as Bannon’s diminishing influence has softened Trump’s tone toward China, so, too, has the departure of former national security adviser Michael Flynn apparently caused Trump to shift tactics on Mexico. Finally, Trump has even changed his views on one of his signature issues, trade, due to the intervention of an outside CEO. Although Trump had long opposed the Export-Import Bank, the Journal reported that a conversation with Boeing Co. CEO Dennis Muilenburg helped him not only understand how the bank functions, but also conclude that it plays an important role in helping small businesses. As a result, Trump is now going to start filling positions at the bank that had previously been left vacant.   Matthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
