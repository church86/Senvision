پارسی العربية اردو کوردی Türkçe English Mehrnews English Mon 12 June 2017 × Economy Home All News Iran World Politics Economy Culture Technology Sports Photo Cartoon Video Opinion Aseman inks final deal to purchase 60 B737-Max jets News ID: 4001237 - Sun 11 June 2017 - 11:14 Economy TEHRAN, Jun. 11 (MNA) – The contract to buy 60 Boeing 737 Max planes within two 30-jet batches was finalized between Boeing and Iran Aseman Airlines on Saturday in Tehran. At the presence of Iranian Minister of Cooperatives, Labor and Social Welfare Ali Rabiei, the contract was inked between Iran’s third largest airline, Aseman Airlines and the American plane maker Boeing in Tehran on Saturday for buying 30 Boeing 737 Max passenger jets while following delivery of the first batch, the company will order additional 30 jets. The official noted that five percent of the deal will be paid by the Iranian airline while the remaining 95%, which is a considerable amount, will be financed by the American giant; “I am pleased that the measure can upgrade the country’s air fleet in order to capture regional markets.” “Fortunately, Iran Aseman Airlines is becoming increasingly stabilized as evidenced by the rise in number of its operating planes from 8 to 21.” Rabiei maintained that foreign airlines are annually selling tickets in Iran worth about four billion dollars and called for fundamental changes in the country’s airline in an effort to boost revenues. Iran’s labor minister also slammed the twin terrorist attacks in Tehran emphasizing “in the absence of martyrs of Holy Shrines, terrorist governments would be ruling the region.” Also at the ceremony, Aseman CEO Hossein Alaei said a US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) permit is expected to be granted in a month. He further underscored that the deliveries will start in 2022 and within two years, the carrier will receive all 30 planes of the first batch. The deal for 30 Boeing 737 Max jets would be worth $3 billion while room exist for ordering 30 more aircraft of the same type. The deal is the first contract between an Iranian airliner and the American giant since President Donald Trump took office in January this year. Boeing 737 MAX is an American narrow-body aircraft series being developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes as the fourth generation of the Boeing 737, succeeding the Boeing 737 Next Generation.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon (Reuters) Reuters REUTERS Saturday, June 10, 2017, 8:00 AM LONDON (Reuters) - Aseman Airlines has signed a final deal to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets in Iran's first new business with the U.S. planemaker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance toward the country. Aseman and Boeing had signed a tentative deal in April. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that representatives of Aseman and Boeing signed the final agreement in the capital Tehran on Saturday. "I am very pleased that after a year of negotiation with Boeing, the contract to buy 30 Boeing 737s was signed today," Aseman CEO Hossein Alaei was quoted as saying by IRNA after the signing ceremony. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Alaei said Aseman was ready to order another 30 of the same planes once the delivery of the first order was finished. IRNA reported that the deal for 60 jets would be worth $3 billion, saying Aseman would pay 5 percent and seek financing for the rest. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord. The U.S. aerospace industry says they support Trump's agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs. (Reporting by Bozorgmehr Sharafedin; editing by David Clarke) (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

Chicago-based Boeing accuses Bombardier of violating antidumping and anti-subsidy laws by selling planes at below fair prices. On Friday, the US International Trade Commission voted 5-0 that there is enough evidence of harm to the US aviation industry to let the Commerce Department go ahead with its investigation. The Commerce Department is expected to have final decisions over the next four months. It could impose duties on Bombardier CSeries jets that hold 100 to 150 passengers. Boeing argues that the new planes rely on illegal government subsidies, which allowed Bombardier to sell 75 jets to Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines at below-cost prices. Bombardier said Friday that it was confident Boeing’s claims will be rejected after more detailed review by US officials. Last month, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland warned that Canada could cancel a planned $2 billion purchase of 18 Boeing military jets over the dispute. Boeing said “trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules,” and it predicted that its business with Canada “will continue to thrive long after this commercial trade matter is resolved.” A Boeing spokesman declined to say if the company was pleased with the ITC decision, instead emphasizing its support for Canada as a “customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defense businesses.” Spokesman Dan Curran said by email that Boeing’s near century-old relationship with Canada “will continue to thrive after this commercial trade matter is resolved.” Coupled with Canada’s pledge to move ahead with an interim fighter purchase, Boeing’s reaction indicates the careful path the US planemaker must tread in challenging Bombardier while trying to preserve a lucrative military contract with the country. Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alex Lawrence reiterated that Canada would defend its aerospace industry. “We are reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing,” Lawrence said by email. Boeing has argued that the CSeries program would not exist without hundreds of millions of dollars in launch aid from the governments of Canada, Quebec and Britain, or a $2.5 billion equity infusion from Quebec and its largest pension fund in 2015. It warned that Bombardier’s actions could upset the wider market and erode future sales of its best-selling 737. Boeing wants the US government to investigate the 2016 sale of 75 CSeries aircraft to Delta Air Lines for what it calls the “absurdly low” sum of $19.6 million each, despite the jet costing $33 million to build. Bombardier, which described Boeing’s $19.6 million figure as “absurd,” has countered that the 110-seat CS100 plane it sold to Delta does not compete with Boeing’s smallest 737 model, the 130-seat 737 MAX 7. The Commerce Department must now determine any preliminary anti-subsidy duties by around July 22, with a deadline for preliminary anti-dumping duties around Oct. 3. The ITC will have a final say on whether to reject any duties. In a separate ruling, the World Trade Organization largely cleared the United States of unfairly supporting Boeing, but noted it had failed to withdraw a tax break in Washington state, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft. — Agencies SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleMobily adds more free balance to Haj, Umrah package Next article35,000 aircraft valued at $5.3trn needed in next 20 years: Airbus Mohammed Ahmed Al Aidroos RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR House of Allah is open for all Muhammad, Tillerson discuss efforts to block terror financing Spike in MERS cases this month NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply June 2017 S M T W T F S « May       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,649,807FansLike 44,422FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts House of Allah is open for all June 12, 2017 Muhammad, Tillerson discuss efforts to block terror financing June 12, 2017 Spike in MERS cases this month June 12, 2017 Humanitarian gesture for mixed Qatari families June 12, 2017 Qatar willing to listen to Gulf concerns: Kuwait June 12, 2017 Archives June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Published on: June 10, 2017 | Last Updated: June 10, 2017 5:16 PM EDT The U.S. Navy F/A 18 Super Hornet at the 67th annual Canadian International Air Show. Jack Boland/ Postmedia Jack Boland / Jack Boland/Toronto Sun Share Adjust Comment Print The Liberal government seems to be ready to change course on the interim fighter jet replacement program. Last week Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said Canada was still in discussions with the U.S. government over the purchase of Boeing Super Hornets as an interim fighter jet. This was despite the government’s anger and disappointment with Boeing who has filed a complaint about Bombardier. Steven MacKinnon, parliamentary secretary to Public Services and Procurement Minister Judy Foote, also told journalists that despite the Boeing complaint, the Liberal government was not talking to any other fighter jet companies. (But it had broken off any discussions with Boeing itself). Now the interim fighter jet project looks like it could change again. Sajjan has suggested other fighter aircraft options could be examined. He told CTV’s Evan Solomon that, “Right now we are looking at many different options.” “Keep in mind this all just happened,” he said in the interview with Solomon. “It does take time to be able to develop some various options.” “We are committed to making sure that we have this capability gap filled,” Sajjan added. When the Liberals announced that they would buy the Super Hornet as an interim fighter jet they argued that the plane was selected because a U.S. fighter was needed for the role. No other country could provide the needed aircraft, was the argument. So based that, these new options Sajjan is looking at would only come down to something like the F-35 (which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised Canada would not purchase) or perhaps another U.S.-built fighter jet. Is Sajjan bluffing? Would Canada buy 18 F-35s on an interim basis?

Boeing and Iran's Aseman finalise $3bn deal for 30 jets Money Saturday 10 June 2017 - 2:58pm File: An Iranian Aseman Airlines jet sits on the runway at the Rasht International Airport in Iran. Photo: via Wikimedia Commons TEHRAN - Iran's Aseman Airlines has finalised an agreement to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets for $3.0 billion, the company said Saturday, with an option to buy 30 more. The deal, announced in April, was signed at a ceremony in Tehran and the first 30 planes are due for delivery between 2022 and 2024. "I'm glad that we can... upgrade the air fleet in an appropriate manner so they can take over regional markets," said Labour Minister Ali Rabii at the signing, according to the ISNA news agency. However, the deal could be scuppered if US President Donald Trump goes ahead with threats to reimpose sanctions on Iran. The White House is in the midst of a 90-day review to decide if it will stick by the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, in which Tehran agreed curb on its nuclear programme in exchange for an easing of sanctions. Washington must renew sanctions waivers every few months to keep the deal alive, and another set of renewals is due in the coming days. Even if Trump sticks by the nuclear deal, the Boeing sale must be cleared by the US Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC). "We have finalised the deal and now we are waiting for OFAC permission within the next month," Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told AFP.

The deal, announced in April, was signed at a ceremony in Tehran and the first 30 planes are due for delivery between 2022 and 2024. “I’m glad that we can… upgrade the air fleet in an appropriate manner so they can take over regional markets,” said Labor Minister Ali Rabii at the signing, according to the ISNA news agency.

As per the deal, Aseman is going to receive 30 Boeing 737 MAX aircrafts as of 2022 over the course of two years, ISNA reported.  The deal would also provide the airline with purchase rights for 30 additional 737 MAXs, the report added. In early April, Aseman said it had signed an agreement with Boeing on the purchase of 30 planes model 737 MAX worth $3 billion.  Shortly after Iran’s nuclear deal with the world major powers in January 2016, the country inked an $18 billion deal with France-based Airbus for 46 Airbus A320 planes, 38 A330 planes and 16 A350 XWB aircraft. It was finalized last December. That same month, state-owned Iran Air signed a $16.6 billion agreement to purchase 80 new Boeing 777 and 737 passenger planes, to be delivered over a period of 10 years.

By AFP Saturday 10 Jun 2017, 3:14 PM Sat 3:14 PM 36,899 Views 24 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3437330 Share Tweet Email File photo of a Boeing 737-700 belonging to Germania airlines. Image: DPA/PA Images File photo of a Boeing 737-700 belonging to Germania airlines. Image: DPA/PA Images IRAN’S ASEMAN AIRLINES has finalised an agreement to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets for $3 billion, the company said, with an option to buy 30 more. The deal, announced in April, was signed at a ceremony in Tehran and the first 30 planes are due for delivery between 2022 and 2024. “I’m glad that we can… upgrade the air fleet in an appropriate manner so they can take over regional markets,” said Labour Minister Ali Rabii at the signing, according to the ISNA news agency. However, the deal could be scuppered if US President Donald Trump goes ahead with threats to reimpose sanctions on Iran. The White House is in the midst of a 90-day review to decide if it will stick by the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, in which Tehran agreed curb on its nuclear programme in exchange for an easing of sanctions. Washington must renew sanctions waivers every few months to keep the deal alive, and another set of renewals is due in the coming days. For Trump, the deal creates a problem. He has vowed to both pull out of the deal and support American job creation. Boeing currently employees nearly 150,000 people. Even if Trump sticks by the nuclear deal, the Boeing sale must be cleared by the US Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC). “We have finalised the deal and now we are waiting for OFAC permission within the next month,” Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told AFP. He said Aseman would pay 5% of the contract in cash, with the remainder paid through a financing deal organised by Boeing. Boeing, which is also building 80 planes for national carrier Iran Air, faces heavy criticism from US lawmakers who say Iranian airlines have been used to ship weapons and troops to Syria and other conflict zones. The aerospace giant has therefore emphasised the employment potential of the deals, saying in April that the Aseman contract “creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States”. Iran has been desperate to renew its ageing fleet of planes, but was largely blocked from dealing with major aircraft manufacturers until the 2015 nuclear accord. The US has maintained its own sanctions, which block almost all trade with Iran, but plane manufacturers were given a specific exemption under the nuclear deal. OFAC approved the sale of the 80 Boeing as well as 100 Airbus planes to Iran Air. The first few Airbus jets have already arrived in Tehran. Aseman currently has a fleet of 36 planes — half of them the 105-seat Dutch Fokker 100s. Its three Boeing 727-200s are almost as old as the Islamic revolution, having made their first flight in 1980. - © AFP 2017 Read: Dutch police arrest ‘radical’ filming outside stadium during concert Read: London attack: Men ‘tried to use 7.5 tonne lorry’ Get breaking news from TheJournal.ie via Facebook.

The MC-21 is a twin-jet airliner, developed by the Yakovlev Design Bureau and produced by Irkut. The first MC-21-300 rolled-out on June 8, 2016 and made its maiden flight on May 28, 2017. Short- and medium-haul airliners with passenger capacity of between 130 and 220 and a range of up to 6,000 kilometers (3,728 miles) are the most mass-produced type of passenger aircraft around. A representative of the Irkut press service told Sputnik that even though the MC-21 is a single-aisle plane, it is actually a wide-bodied design with six seats on each side giving it the most spacious cabin to be found on the planes of its class. The MC-21 also boasts bigger windows, more comfortable cabin air pressure and improved climate control. Even better, the MC-21 is fully compatible with the existing 4C ICAO- and III FAA-approved runways currently used by Boeing and Airbus airliners. The MC-21 is designed to be faster, more efficient and less expensive than its Western counterparts, incorporating the latest in the field of airframe, engine and avionics systems technology in its design, including a composite wing design, which improves fuel efficiency. Irkut was the first to employ composite materials on narrow-bodied planes repeating the breakthrough solutions Boeing and Airbus earlier used with their jumbo-class aircraft. © Sputnik/ Alexandr Astafiev 'We'll Be Working Very Hard': Russia's Vnesheconombank to Promote Export of MC-21 JetlinersThe MC-21s will be powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1000G or Russian-made PD-14 turbofan engines, which meet and exceed global safety, noise, and fuel efficiency standards. All these innovative solutions will make the MC-21s 15 percent cheaper in operation compared with their foreign analogs. According to the Irkut press service, an MC-21-300 made its successful maiden flight on May 28, 2017 in Irkutsk. The first flight ran for 30 minutes at an altitude of 1,000 meters at 300 kilometers an hour. “Amazing! The plane is so easy to fly that you just don’t need to get used to it!” one of its two test pilots, Roman Taskayev, enthused after the plane had made a perfect landing. When asked whether Irkut planned to open MC-21 assembly plants and service centers in the BRICS countries or elsewhere in the world, a representative of the press service said that they want to sell the plane abroad, including to Brazil. With Latin American air carriers expected to need about 2,000 medium-range airliners of the MC-21 class before 2035, Irkut expects to supply an estimated 150 MC-21s to the region.  Hungary, Bangladesh and India have aklready shown interest in interested in purchasing MC-21 planes, Russia's United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) President Yuri Slyusar said. ...

(CTV) Laura Payton, Ottawa News Bureau Online Producer @laura_payton Published Saturday, June 10, 2017 8:32AM EDT OTTAWA -- Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan says he's looking at all options when it comes to finding 18 fighter jets to bridge Canada into a new fleet to replace its aging CF-18 Hornets. Sajjan announced last fall that Canada was entering talks to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornets to cover a "capability gap" created when the government changed how it counts the number of planes the country needs to fill its NATO and NORAD obligations. But Boeing this spring initiated a U.S. Commerce Department complaint against Canadian aircraft manufacturer Bombardier, leading Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland to say in an open letter that Canada is reconsidering its Boeing procurement. The trade dispute has raised questions about how the government will handle its fighter jet procurement. In an interview with Evan Solomon, host of CTV's Question Period, Sajjan wouldn't rule out purchasing Lockheed Martin's F-35 fighter jets as an interim solution, in addition to considering it among the possibilities to fully replace the current fleet. "Right now we are looking at many different options," Sajjan said. "Keep in mind this all just happened. It does take time to … be able to develop some various options," he added. "We are committed to making sure that we have this capability gap filled." Tom Lawson, Canada's former chief of the defence staff, says the fact the government's new defence policy review said very little about fighter jets suggests "a retrenchment on a wrongheaded policy." The policy review said Canada would increase the number of jets it will buy, from 65 to 88. "There really is no one except the government that believes that 18 interim fighters will be useful to Canada, let alone the RCAF [Royal Canadian Air Force],” Lawson told Solomon. "This conflict that's going on with Boeing right now regarding the Bombardier issue provides them an opportunity to gracefully step back from that and go right to the competition [for the permanent fighter jet]." Lawson, a long-time supporter of the F-35, has provided paid advice to Lockheed Martin since retiring from the Canadian Forces. His support for the F-35 dates back to his time as assistant chief of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Richard Fadden, a former deputy minister in the Department of National Defence, says he has always argued Canada should buy the F-35. "One of the most important components of our military policy is we have to be interoperable," Fadden said. "The F-35 has been purchased by a large number of allies. I think the government should try and find a way to accept that and move forward with the F-35s."

The deal, announced in April, was signed at a ceremony in Tehran and the first 30 planes are due for delivery between 2022 and 2024. "I'm glad that we can... upgrade the air fleet in an appropriate manner so they can take over regional markets," said Labour Minister Ali Rabii at the signing, according to the ISNA news agency. However, the deal could be scuppered if US President Donald Trump goes ahead with threats to reimpose sanctions on Iran. The White House is in the midst of a 90-day review to decide if it will stick by the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, in which Tehran agreed curb on its nuclear programme in exchange for an easing of sanctions. Washington must renew sanctions waivers every few months to keep the deal alive, and another set of renewals is due in the coming days. Even if Trump sticks by the nuclear deal, the Boeing sale must be cleared by the US Office of Foreign Assets (OFAC). "We have finalised the deal and now we are waiting for OFAC permission within the next month," Aseman spokesman Amir Reza Mostafavi told AFP. He said Aseman would pay five per cent of the contract in cash, with the remainder paid through a financing deal organised by Boeing. Boeing, which is also building 80 planes for national carrier Iran Air, faces heavy criticism from US lawmakers who say Iranian airlines have been used to ship weapons and troops to Syria and other conflict zones. The aerospace giant has therefore emphasised the employment potential of the deals, saying in April that the Aseman contract "creates or sustains approximately 18,000 jobs in the United States". Iran has been desperate to renew its ageing fleet of planes, but was largely blocked from dealing with major aircraft manufacturers until the 2015 nuclear accord. The US has maintained its own sanctions, which block almost all trade with Iran, but plane manufacturers were given a specific exemption under the nuclear deal. OFAC approved the sale of the 80 Boeing as well as 100 Airbus planes to Iran Air. The first few Airbus jets have already arrived in Tehran. Aseman currently has a fleet of 36 planes -- half of them the 105-seat Dutch Fokker 100s. Its three Boeing 727-200s are almost as old as the Islamic revolution, having made their first flight in 1980.

The ruling added another page to an exhausting 13-year-old battle between the transatlantic plane giants just as a US tribunal agreed separately to investigate Boeing's concerns about alleged price-dumping by Canada's Bombardier. The WTO said the United States had failed to remove aid for Boeing, as alleged in a trade complaint brought by the European Union, but ruled that few of the subsidies hurt EU interests. It found that one US subsidy programme, a business tax rate reduction in the state of Washington, where Boeing builds most of its aircraft, had "adverse effects", involving customers from the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Iceland. Both sides claimed victory after the ruling, which is about whether Boeing complied with a 2012 decision that it had received billions of dollars of subsidies including aid from space agency NASA and tax breaks from Washington State. "The panel found only one state-level program, which had an average value of $100-110 million in the 2013-2015 period, to be contrary to WTO rules. The United States disagrees and plans to appeal this limited finding," the office of the US Trade Representative said. European planemaker Airbus insisted the United States had not complied with the WTO's earlier decisions in the case and claimed it had suffered $100 billion of harm when combined with a follow-up complaint. "The amount of money involved completely distorts trade ... and the WTO should make it clear that no government or company can escape from their international responsibilities," Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders said in a statement. The WTO said Boeing had failed to comply with part of the earlier 2012 ruling relating to tax breaks in Washington state. Those tax breaks are now the subject of a new case, having been extended to cover Boeing's newest wide-body jet. In November, the WTO defined the tax break to help Boeing develop its new 777X jet as a prohibited subsidy. That decision, contested by the United States, is now working its way through the WTO's appeals tribunal. The ruling is part of a series of tit-for-tat transatlantic complaints about aircraft subsidies that together make up the world's largest trade dispute, involving mutual accusations of support for Airbus and Boeing. Bickering over financing for the $120 billion a year civil aerospace industry has widened in recent months as Brazil took Bombardier to the WTO and Boeing asked a faster US tribunal to deal with its pricing complaint against the same company. < Previous PageNext Page > STAY UPDATED Subscribe to our newsletter and be the first to know all the latest news Sign Up More in Business GCC bond issuance touched $22b till May 2017 Weak sentiments drag Oman shares lower Credit Suisse to cut roughly 1,500 jobs in London by the end of next year Gallery Recommended for you Customer focused approach key to banking sector growth Sezad sets up new department to boost SMEs, CSR initiatives PREVIOUS ARTICLE Bullish trend continues NEXT ARTICLE L'Oreal set to sell The Body Shop to Brazil's Natura in $1.1b deal Oman #OmanPride Ramadan World Sports Opinion Business Technology Lifestyle Entertainment Advertising RSS Feeds Subscription TOO Apps Classifieds E Paper About us Blog Jobs Contact us Request a Quote Copyright © 2017 Muscat Media Group.

The deadline for submitting bids ended on Wednesday. UK-based aircraft leasing company 12 Star Aviation and Bhutan Air have submitted proposals to lease aircraft, according to the corporation. “The documents submitted by the companies will be evaluated by management and tabled at NAC’s board for approval,” said Sugat Ratna Kansakar, managing director of NAC. The corporation had invited bids for the wet lease an Airbus A319, A320 or A321. It said that a temporary replacement was needed so the flight schedule would not be affected when the Boeing was sent for a long maintenance. The lease contract will begin on July 16 and last for 45 days, and it can be extended to 60 days, NAC said. The corporation plans to operate scheduled flights with the aircraft on the Kuala Lumpur, Doha, Delhi and Bangalore or other sectors.  On April 10, the corporation put one of its two Boeing 757s up for auction. However, it did not receive a single bid for the 30-year-old jet. The deadline for bids has been extended till June 12.  The minimum sale price for the 757 named Karnali and bearing registration number 9N-ACA has been set at $1.71 million. The aircraft has been sitting outside the NAC hangar at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) since April 2016 following the corporation’s policy to phase out its Boeing fleet. NAC decided to retire the aircraft after conducting a cost-benefit analysis. Based on the operational cost analysis, it does not make sense to fly the aircraft, it said. The Boeing 757 burns 4 tonnes of fuel per hour compared to 2.5 tonnes for new aircraft. The move is also part of the national flag carrier’s plan to have an all-Airbus fleet for its international operations. The corporation plans to retire its second Boeing 757 by 2019. The 9N-ACA arrived in Nepal in 1987 and flew on long-haul routes, displaying the national flag at world airports. The 757 holds 190 passengers. The Boeing 757 is a mid-sized, narrow body twin engine jet built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It debuted in the late 1980s and was in production until 2004. NAC currently flies two A320 and one Boeing 757.

American aerospace giant Boeing and France's Dassault Aviation are among the four entities that have responded to Indian Navy’s 'Request for Interest, (RFI)' to provide 57 multi-role carrier borne fighters, industry sources said. The other two are Sweden's SAAB and Rosoboronexport of Russia. While Boeing has pitched its F/A-18 Super Hornet, Dassault has briefed the navy on its Rafale. SAAB has offered the maritime variant of its Gripen single-engine fighter jet. Naval Chief Sunil Lanba confirmed the development. "We will examine the RFI and take it forward," he told this newspaper. The deal is valued at over Rs 50,000 crore. Sources say it is now mainly between Boeing’s FA-18 and Dassault’s Rafale, as the navy would prefer a twin-engine aircraft against SAAB’s single-engine Gripen. “While the navy did not specify a variant, there is a clear preference for a twin-engine model,” a senior industry executive said. As it had earlier done a deal with the Indian Air Force (IAF), Dassault is seen as having an upper hand. The government signed an $8.7-billion deal with France last year for 36 Rafale warplanes for the IAF. Dassault, defence ministry sources say, has argued it makes sense to equip IAF and navy with the same platform, for better logistics, maintenance and industrial support. "It would help in cost control like manpower training, pilot training, simulators and make it easier to get spare parts,” sources said. All the four companies refused to comment on queries sent to them. “Dassault with joint venture partner Reliance has a Make in India proposal already in place and envisages all 57 aircraft to be delivered from its facility at Mihan (near Nagpur),” a company executive said on condition of anonymity. The navy had on January 25 put out an RFI for the 57 fighter planes, giving manufacturers four months to respond. In the technical evaluation, the foreign companies had to answer queries on technical parameters, budgetary estimates, likely level of indigenisation, transfer of technology and schedule of deliveries after a contract is inked.

This is a monumental task. Many industries are dominated by two players — Microsoft and Apple, Coca-Cola and Pepsi — but the stranglehold Boeing and Airbus have on the aviation industry is hard to overestimate. The two companies account for a majority of the market share for single-aisle passenger planes. Their competitors, if the term even applies here, such as Bombardier and Embraer are very far behind.  Yet the new partnership is not shy about its intentions. Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) and Russia's United Aircraft Corp want their new, as yet unnamed aircraft, to compete with the most successful passenger planes in existence. © AP Photo/ Xinhua, Chen Fei South Pole Bromance: China Interested in Cooperating With Russia on Antarctic Exploration Aware of its late entry into the race, Craic is looking to cut costs to compete. COMAC's assistant president, Guo Bozhi, has said that the new plane will have 10 percent lower operating costs along with an "advanced aerodynamic design" and "engines with low fuel burn." This might be encouraging if Boeing and Airbus did not pour billions into R&D of their own. A glance at Airbus' technology plans for the future turns up faster braking, low-noise, free glide approaches, using big data to streamline maintenance. Furthermore, the Craic plane is not scheduled to be ready for a decade. By then, aircraft advances will have moved on in leaps and bounds. The alliance will be developing an airliner while playing a long-term catch-up game.  But there is far more than engineering at stake here. It is understandable that observers have latched on to the above narrative. A new Chinese rival to Boeing and Airbus is a sexy story to write but the reality is different. As the US and Europe have their airplane giants, it makes complete sense for China and Russia to have their own. However, the building of a global supply chain, of reliable, long-term engineering and testing, of figuring out what added value to bring, are all tasks Craic needs to address immediately.  It has some advantages on its side. Some titans of the aviation supply chain collaborated on the C919, including General Electric, Honeywell, and Safran. Furthermore, even with a long-term approach, a new player with the money that Craic will be throwing around will stir the aviation industry.  The Chinese aviation market will become the largest in the world in terms of passengers by 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association. As the obvious breeding ground for any planes Craic cranks out, suppliers will want to bet in on the ground floor. While China's C919 has already taken to the skies, success will not come easily. Dominance in the aircraft industry comes with a backdrop of industry benchmarks, from active sales to a track record of safety. Building the plane is only step one out of 100.  This should be a long-term objective. The natural starting point is to convert the Russian and Chinese domestic markets to the C919 and its successors from within Craic.  There has been some international interest. In 2011, Ryanair signed a memorandum of understanding "to participate in discussions on the development" of the C919, with its CEO Michael O'Leary stating that "we are pleased that there is now a real alternative to Boeing and Airbus, and we are seriously interested in the development of a 200-seat variant of the C919 aircraft." This interest was confirmed after the aircraft's maiden flight, contingent on a 199-seat model of the plane being sold at a competitive price. © AP Photo/ Zha Chunming/Xinhua Russia, China Deepen Military Cooperation With 'Mutually Beneficial' Road Map  More competition is always good. But expectations need to be managed. It is all but impossible for Craic to disrupt the Boeing-Airbus twosome in the short or medium-term. If expectations are set in China and Russia for it to do that, good money after bad will be wasted and any plane the alliance produces will stall out of the gates. However, should Craic be given the time and finances to grow, it will have the opportunity to be what would truly benefit China and Russia: a long-term, reliable pillar of the aviation industry.

WTO ruled in its appellate body report that "the European Union established that the effects of the Washington State tax rate reduction are a genuine and substantial cause of significant lost sales of A320neo and A320ceo families". The U.S. tax break is also "a threat of impedance of imports of the A320ceo to the United States" and a threat of impedance of exports to the United Arab Emirates, the report said. Acting on behalf of Airbus, the EU requested consultations with the U.S. in December 2014, alleging that Washington's conditional tax incentives relating to the development, production and sale of Boeing's 777X jetliner were prohibited under WTO trade law. However, WTO rejected the EU's claims that the original adverse effects of the pre-2007 aeronautics R&D subsidies and some other subsidies continue as significant price suppression and lost sales for Airbus. Since more than a decade ago, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have been in a trade battle, in which each company accuses the other of taking billions of illegal state aid. The EU requested the WTO to establish a panel to probe into alleged U.S. subsidies of up to 19.1 billion U.S. dollars through tax and non-tax incentives by various municipalities to its largest aircraft maker Boeing in January 2006. The panel report over the case came out in March 2011. Both of them later on decided to appeal to the appellate body, which released its final report in March, 2012. The U.S. said afterwards that it intended to implement the recommendations and rulings in the Boeing case within six months. However, in October 2012, the EU requested the establishment of a compliance panel, after reviewing U.S. measures to comply with the rulings and considering that it maintained a series of subsidies.

(Xinhua/AFP) GENEVA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO) upheld on Friday its decision that Washington provided illegal tax breaks to aircraft maker Boeing in a trade ruling that favors European Union rival Airbus.

It also rejected the claims that the original adverse effects of the pre-2007 aeronautics R&D subsidies in respect of the A330 and Original A350 continue in the post-implementation period as significant price suppression for Airbus.

(Ian Terry / The Herald) At Snohomish City Council, officials always get an earful Caitlin Tompkins Sat Jun 10th, 2017 10:00pm News You must sign in or register to continue reading content. SNOHOMISH — As the clock neared 10 p.m., Snohomish City Council members listened to an ever-so familiar voice. Morgan Davis, 75, stood behind a lectern for the seventh time that December night. He was testifying on every item on the council’s agenda. He talked about how the city should fight crime and allocate its money. He is a chronic critic. Davis, a Boeing Co. retiree, owns an apartment building in Snohomish, but lives about six miles outside of town. He said he is looking out for his tenants’ interests. The council is his hobby, Davis said. He spends a half hour handwriting comments before every meeting. He reads from yellow pages ripped from a legal pad. Bill Betten, 59, testified six times that same night. His home is 300 feet outside city limits. “It’s very hard to get people engaged,” Betten said. ‘They won’t step up and be a voice, so I have to be two peoples’ voices and I may have to speak louder.” Vocal critics More then 9,000 people live in Snohomish, which was named after a local Native American tribe. The town takes pride in its history, which dates back to 1890 when it was first incorporated. A couple of the city’s most vocal critics don’t live in town and can’t vote on issues. For some, calling Snohomish their home is less about city boundaries and more about the high school they attended. Davis graduated from Snohomish High School. His grandfather, who fought in the Civil War, homesteaded a property near Thomas Lake, which is now part of Mill Creek. Back then, the house had a Snohomish address. “They very much see Snohomish as their hometown,” Councilwoman Lynn Schilaty said. “But the reality is, they are not voters. It’s always a dilemma for a council member to respect the community at large, but our responsibility is to our constituents foremost.” The council sets a three-minute timer with a buzzer to keep comments brief. If that doesn’t work, the mayor bangs a gavel on the desk. A consultant was hired in 2015 to boost community engagement and government transparency. She worked with an open-government committee of nine people from the community who provided recommendations, such as a revamp of the city’s website and additional public forums. She was paid $12,090 for the seven-month project, City Manager Larry Bauman said. At the end of this year, the city plans to evaluate its outreach efforts. So far, City Council meetings seem dominated by critics focused on catching Snohomish leaders in mistakes. “These gotchas get old after awhile,” Schilaty said. “If we made a mistake, point it out. We’ll rectify it.” Schilaty has served on the council for nearly 10 years. Davis has sat in on meetings for as long as she can remember. Betten, a newcomer to council meetings, said the city lacks transparency. Others in the past have thought so, too. Rocky history In 2012, the city attorney sent letters to more than a dozen homeowners informing them they had two weeks to pay outstanding fees — ranging from $3,000 to $20,000 — connected to the purchase of their houses. The city had failed to collect fees from the developer who built the homes, a requirement before any final building permits can be issued. Bauman and other city officials had known about the unpaid debt since 2008, before some of the new homes were sold. Bauman told homeowners the city was legally obligated to collect the fees from the current property owners. His hands were tied. People called for the fees to be dropped and Bauman to be fired. A criminal investigation uncovered a city inspection document for a home with no outstanding fees that appeared to be forged. Records also showed the city did not disclose the fees to title companies. The council unanimously voted to waive the fees. Now, Betten and others are working to weaken the city manager’s role. For decades, the city operated under a council-manager form of government. The council appoints one of its own to serve as mayor while a city manager handles the day-to-day operations. Last fall, Betten introduced Proposition 2, a bid to replace that structure with one led by an elected strong mayor. He couldn’t vote for his own ballot measure. It passed by nine votes in November. Schilaty wondered whether people understood what the change in government entailed. There were 4,445 votes cast, but more than 400 people opted not to vote on Prop. 2. A recount confirmed the city’s future transition in governance. A new mayor is expected to take office after the general election in November. Lots of talking Proposition backers argued the change would save money. Depending on who is elected into office, it may prove more expensive. “They’ve never been able to articulate their long-term vision and how it’s going to be better through the form of government that’s now going to take place,” Schilaty said. Betten and proposition supporters have dominated public testimony, especially around the time of the November 2016 election. Davis spoke 18 times in the span of four meetings, amounting to about 54 minutes. Betten spoke 11 times. Councilwoman Karen Guzak introduced the three-minute timer when she was mayor as a way of trying to make sure more people would have the chance to testify. Instead, Davis has just opted to speak more often, she said. “A lot of times, I don’t get enough time,” Davis said. “They cut me off.” During a May meeting, a woman was telling the council about a noise problem in her neighborhood when Davis shouted a comment from the back of the room. “Thank you for your silence, Mr. Davis,” Mayor Tom Hamilton said. Davis said his criticism is constructive. Guzak served as mayor for seven years before stepping down in February. Early on, she invited Davis to address his concerns. She called their discussions “fruitless.” “He enjoys criticizing us,” Guzak said. “If we were to run the city as Morgan Davis wants to, I think we would have an impoverished and dysfunctional city.” Geoffrey Thomas, mayor of Monroe, said people living outside of his city sometimes attend council meetings. However, “I’ve never had to gavel somebody down,” he said. If someone reaches the time limit for public comment, Thomas said he politely asks the speaker to wrap up. For the most part, that works. Everett City Council President Judy Tuohy said some people attend weekly meetings simply to grouse. One person drives in from Lynnwood. Demanding answers Schilaty has noticed a difference in the type of comments in Snohomish as of late. There are more questions for city staff. “Public comment is an incredibly important part of the public process. It’s something I value very much,” Schilaty said. “But this idea that it should be interactive is, I don’t think it’s productive or a direction I would like the council to go down.” Davis and Betten have asked the council for answers on the spot. Outside of meetings, Hamilton and other government officials are peppered with emails. Betten has sent text messages to the deputy city manager at 8 p.m. on a Friday. He and others once went knocking on Hamilton’s door, demanding to talk about the timing of the mayoral election. Most recently, Betten is concerned about Snohomish’s Carnegie building. It was built in 1910 and served as a library until 2003 when a new library opened. Plans were made to convert the Carnegie building into an education center. The project entails removing an annex that was added to the front of the building in 1968. A leak in its roof caused the property to be closed as a safety precaution. Betten thinks the drippy roof will be used as an excuse to demolish the annex, so he formed the “105 Cedar Avenue Foundation” in hopes of preserving it. During a May council meeting, Betten read from Washington’s Open Public Meetings Act. He alleged that former City Council members had made a decision years ago to remove a deed that required the building to be used as a library. He said the decision was not discussed openly. “I’m going to keep reading this every two weeks until you understand,” Betten told the council. Hamilton provided Betten with minutes from public meetings in 1994 and 1995 when the council directed staff to remove the deed restriction, giving the city latitude in terms of how the library property could be used. A new law that takes effect next month requires local governments to host a public hearing prior to removing any covenants associated with city-owned property. The Snohomish Carnegie Foundation has been drafting plans for the education center at the former library for years. Anarchy or democracy? There is a “history of these folks coming in with their negative viewpoint and trying to undo the work of so many community groups and foundations without thought to the bigger picture — what our community needs,” Guzak said. The message is one of “anarchy,” rather than democracy, she said. “This is my opinion, that they’re actually abusive of the council and the council’s decisions,” Guzak said. Last year, John Kartak, who lives in town and is now running for mayor, attempted to seek an injunction to block the council from voting on a mayoral election date. Kartak wrote the petition himself. He thought the council was moving too quickly. “When something is voted in, there is an expectation that it will be implemented in a timely manner. We need to move forward,” Schilaty said in a December meeting. A hearing was scheduled for the same day the council planned to vote. The judge threw out Kartak’s request because the paperwork targeted the Snohomish County auditor instead of the City Council. In July, Betten attempted to recall Guzak from office when she was still mayor. The paperwork he filed with the county auditor listed an address for Betten inside the city. Anyone who files a petition to recall a public official must be a resident where that official serves. Within three weeks, Betten withdrew the petition, alleging his family had been harassed. He filed another petition in August to alter the language in the voters pamphlet explaining Prop. 2. This time, his home address outside the city was listed. The petition was denied. Prop. 2 supporters have criticized Bauman for living in north King County. Davis demanded an investigation into a former city councilman who had moved outside of Snohomish last year. Zachary Wilde resigned in December. He moved to take care of his parents who were dealing with health problems. Wilde returned more than $4,000 he had earned during his time on council and submitted a written apology. Davis called it fraud. Schilaty said the city’s critics have a tendency to hover around the same issues, which often resurface every two weeks in council meetings. She hopes people will focus on positive efforts to move the city forward. Candidates have filed for the city’s strong mayor position and five council seats. Guzak, Kartak, Councilman Derrick Burke and Elizabeth Larsen are running for mayor in the August primary.

With political food fights brewing from St. Paul to D.C. I'm trying new ways to remain partially sane. I watch "House of Cards" on Netflix to relax.

Another reason to love weather? No matter how much money you make, what you believe - or who you voted for you're still 'gonna get wet. We live in our bubbles and hang with our tribes, but weather is a uniquely shared experience. Heavy T-storms bubbling up along a tropical frontal boundary may spark flash flooding today, but cooler heads prevail (low 80s feels like sweet relief). We may top 90F again Tuesday with a high risk of T-storms into midweek. Instability showers may sprout next weekend, but at least we get a break from the 90s. Not good enough? La-la-la. Mindi Abair is playing saxophone. I can't hear you! Enhanced Risk. NOAA SPC has outlined a chunk of central and southern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin into an "enhanced risk" of severe storms, suggesting a very good chance of 1 or 2 rounds of strong to severe storms capable of hail, damaging winds and flooding rains today. Squall lines are forecast to fire along a tropical warm front; some 1-3"+ rainfall amounts are possible with some of these storms. Monsoon Season. With this much water in the air and a warm frontal boundary to help focus moisture convergence the die is cast for excessive rainfall amounts today, as much as 2-3" or more in some communities, with the heaviest rains east of the St. Croix. Have a Plan B. Slight Risk of Excessive Rains. NOAA WPC has outlined much the same area for a risk of flash flooding from "training storms"; thunderstorms redeveloping over the same counties, each passage capable of 1-2" rains. At some point soil won't be able to soak up the rain, and it will run off into streets and streams. Severe Squall Line Upper Mississippi Valley Today. NOAA's 12 KM NAM model spins up a line of severe storms from Sioux Falls to the Twin Cities and much of Wisconsin later today. The primary risk is large hail and damaging straight-line winds, but a few isolated tornadoes can't be ruled out. Heavy showers and T-storms are prevalent from northern California and Nevada (where snow mixes in, believe it or not) to the northern Rockies and Plains. Lighter, showery rains and a few embedded storms flare up across the Gulf Coast. Future radar loop: NOAA and Tropicaltidbits.com. Gradual Cooling Trend. The hottest weather is in our rear-view mirror, at least for the short term. We may top 90F in the Twin Cities Tuesday before an eastbound cool front shifts winds around to the northwest later in the week. Upper 70s by next weekend? I wouldn't be at all surprised. Twin Cities ECMWF forecast numbers: WeatherBell. Late June Sizzle. Excessive heat is forecast 2 weeks out, from California and Arizona into much of the southern and eastern states. A significant heat-pump high pressure ridge is forecast to temporarily stall over the southeast, amplifying the heat. Only the northern Rockies and Upper Midwest may escape the heat as a lingering cold trough above sparks cooler temperatures and more numerous showers. Building Heat Wave. Here are predicted maximum heat indices for Tuesday, showing a heat index close to 100F across much of the eastern half of the USA, maybe 105F from the Quad Cities and Rockford to Chicago and Peoria. The Dog Days of Summer have come early this year. Heat-Related Ailments. Dry skin, rapid breathing and pulse, along with slurred speech and disorientation are all symptoms of heat stroke, which can prove fatal if not treated quickly and effectively. If in doubt, call 9-1-1. Life Before Air Conditioning. Here's an excerpt of the Mental Floss story I referenced in today's column. Our ancestors were tough - no question. I fear we've gotten soft: "...Ceiling fans accentuate the effect by pulling air up during the summer, and pushing warmer air down in the winter. Older homes with more than one story took advantage of the stack effect, as open stairwells vented heat upstairs. That's why upper floors were only used at night, with the windows open. Some houses even had a tower or turret to act as a windcatcher or heat exhaust vent. Shade trees planted on the east and west sides of a home block the summer sun before it warms the home exterior. They also cool down breezes slightly before they enter the porch area. Awnings and window overhangs provide the same effect, and let more sunshine in during the winter, when the sun hangs lower..." Excessive Heat Predicted for the Coming Week Could Affect Your Medication. Not only the heat, but sunlight can impact the efficacy of certain medications. Dr. Marshall Shepherd explains at Forbes: "...According to information on the Baystate Health organization website, there are standards for storing medications that have been set by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. The guidance on the website One of the standards established by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention is to keep medications stored at room temperature, which is defined as between 68 to 77 degrees F. However, most pharmacists will agree that they are still safe between 58 to 86 degrees F. Medications can also be affected by direct sunlight. Excessive heat or direct sunlight can render some medications less potent. Baystate Health organization experts suggest that medications taken for diabetes and heart disease are particularly vulnerable...Other particularly heat sensitive medications include those used to treat the thyroid and for birth control. Medications with hormones, albuterol inhalers, diazepam, and lorazepam are also listed..." (file image: AFP). Hot Start to June. After a minor cooling correction in May June is trending warmer than average again. Here's a clip from this week's Minnesota WeatherTalk, courtesy of Dr. Mark Seeley: "After a cooler than normal May, June has begun much warmer than normal, with most southern and western communities reporting multiple daytime highs in the 90s F so far. Places like Browns Valley and Milan have already reported highs of 96 degrees F, and temperatures will go higher than that this weekend in many places. Observers across the state are reporting average temperatures for the month so far that are from 5 to 8 degrees F warmer than normal. Also unlike last month, bright sunny skies are dominant, and the landscape has dried out quite a bit. Many areas are in need of a good rain. In fact portions of northwestern and north-central Minnesota have seen deficits in precipitation since March 1st. Some are as much as 5-7 inches below normal in precipitation since that date. As a result the Drought Monitor shows these parts of the state to be in moderate drought..." Dress for Hot Weather Success. Although survival is probably a good place to start. Thanks to HealthTalkUMN at the University of Minnesota. Avoid a Heat-Related Vehicle Disaster. Keep in mind your vehicle quickly becomes an oven, a hyper-local greenhouse effect during the summer months. According to NOAA studies an outside air temperature of only 80F can translate into 99F after only 10 minutes; 109F within 20 minutes. Don't even think about leaving a child (or pet) in a car or truck. Pitchers More Likely to Hit Batters in Hot Weather. Yes, hot weather seems to have all of us on edge, according to a post at Yale Climate Connections: "...That’s Rick Larrick of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. He studies decision-making, and says hot weather has been linked to more aggressive behavior. He studied baseball statistics and found that pitchers are slightly more likely to retaliate when it’s hot. He speculates it’s because people are already on edge. Larrick: “Once you are uncomfortable and irritable, you are just more easily agitated, and the same kind of insult or offense seems bigger...” Photo credit: "Rick Larrick at the Cardinals Hall of Fame in St. Louis." Florida Tech Study Confirms Lightning More Powerful Over Water. Here's a clip of another article that caught my eye, courtesy of Florida Tech: "...Nag and Cummins found that with strikes over water in western Florida, the median stepped-leader duration was 17 percent shorter over ocean than over land, and in eastern Florida the median durations were 21 and 39 percent shorter over two oceanic regions than over land. Using a relationship between leader duration and lightning peak current derived in this study, the authors estimate that lightning with peak currents over 50 kilo amperes is twice as likely to occur in oceanic thunderstorms. These findings suggest that people living on or near the ocean may be at greater risk for lightning damage if storms develop over oceans and move on-shore. This new understanding of the nature of lightning could inform how off-shore infrastructure and vessels are to be built to minimize the risk of super-powerful lightning bolts from thunderstorms formed over the sea..." Intense Storms May Diminish Protective Ozone in Central U.S. Are super-sized thunderstorms doing more than increasing flash flood risk? Here's a clip from Daily Climate: "More frequent, powerful storms in the Great Plains are penetrating deep into the atmosphere, risking ozone loss and increased dangerous UV radiation, scientists warn...Harvard researchers found that this stratospheric ozone layer above the central U.S. gets depleted during the summer, most likely as intense storms send water vapor into the atmosphere. The vapor can cause the types of chemical reactions that have spurred ozone loss in Arctic and Antarctic regions.  The stratosphere, which extends from about 7 miles above the surface to nearly 30 miles above the ground, is one of the most “delicate aspects of habitability on the planet,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. The Great Plains' more frequent and violent storms get that extra energy in large part from warming waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The Harvard study shows that, in addition to storm damage, the loss of ozone threatens food security and human health..."

A number of converging factors are in play, as explained at Plaquemines Parish Coastal Erosion: "Louisiana contains 30% of the total marshland within the lower 48 U.S. states, but unfortunately leads in coastal erosion and wetland loss, making up 90% of coastal marsh loss. Currently Louisiana has lost 1,900 square miles since the 1930's and continues to lose an estimated 70 square kilometers/year, or a football field of land every 38 minutes, due to a combination of natural processes, such as storms, sea-level rise, and subsidence, as well as man made alterations to the Mississippi River and wetlands over the past 200 years, i.e. the construction of levees and canals, and the development of the oil and natural gas industry..." An Entire Town in the US is Sinking Because of Climate Change. It's actually due to a combination of land subsidence and rising seas, as explained at Futurism: "Isle de Jean Charles, a small island in southeastern Louisiana’s bayous, is drowning as the Gulf of Mexico rises. Twenty-nine homes remain, housing 100 people, but they are all being relocated because the flooding is unstoppable. The island has already lost 98% of its land since 1955, making it one of the most visible victims of climate change — so far. The residents can either leave their homes or die in them, and they are leaving. “Now there’s just a little strip of land left,” resident Rita Falgout tells Quartz. “That’s all we have. There’s water all around us. I’m anxious to go...” "Coal is Dead" and Oil Faces "Peak Demand", Says World's Largest Investment Group. ThinkProgress has the story: "Coal is dead,” Jim Barry, the global head of BlackRock’s infrastructure investment group, explained in a recent interview. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment group, with $5 trillion in assetsâ—âmore than the world’s largest banksâ—âhas begun to bet on clean energy. Why? “The thing that has changed fundamentally the whole picture is that renewables have gotten so cheap,” said Barry. No, the world’s coal plants are not going to all down shut tomorrow, Barry noted to The Australian Financial Review (subscription required). “But anyone who’s looking to take beyond a 10-year view on coal is gambling very significantly...” Graphic: U.S. Energy Information Administration. 9.8 Million People Employed by Renewable Energy, According to New Report. Roughly 3 million of those jobs are in the USA. Here's a clip from CNBC.com: "Nearly 10 million people were employed in the renewable energy sector last year, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said on Wednesday. IRENA's report, Renewable Energy and Jobs – Annual Review 2017, states that global renewable energy employment in 2016, excluding large hydropower, hit 8.3 million. If direct employment in large hydropower is included, that figure climbs to 9.8 million..." File image: GreenTech Media. Minnesota Moving Up in Rankings for Solar Energy. Star Tribune reports: "Minnesota’s national ranking for solar energy capacity has climbed significantly after a flurry of new projects have come online. During the first quarter, the state ranked fourth nationally for new solar power installations compared with the same period a year ago, according to data released Thursday by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), a trade group. The state added 140 megawatts of solar power capacity in the quarter, continuing a growth spurt that started in last year’s fourth quarter and reflects long-planned developments being switched on..."

Speaking of job disruption. Here's an excerpt of an artlce at Fortune that made me do a double-take: "Boeing is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world's biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, "the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available," said Mike Sinnett, Boeing's vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years..." India's First Solar Satellite Television Service Brings "Magic" to Villages. Reuters reports: "An Indian social business has launched the country's first solar satellite television service, bringing clean energy powered entertainment to households and businesses through a pay-as-you-go payment scheme. Simpa Networks, which began operations in 2011, is one of thousands of social enterprises in India tapping into the renewable energy market in a country where one-fifth of the 1.3 billion population has no access to electricity. With the majority of those without power from poor communities in countryside, the company focuses on selling solar powered products such as LED lights, phone charging points and fans on financing to rural homes and shops in northern India..." Even Tesla's Elon Musk Makes Mistakes. Here's a clip from an article at Fortune: "...The CEO said he made the decision to significantly pare down the configurations for the Model 3—Tesla's most affordable vehicle yet, starting at $35,000—after learning from mistakes he made with Tesla's SUV known as the Model X, which Musk called "hubris extraordinaire." "The big mistake we made with the X, which primarily was my responsibility, was having way too much complexity right at the beginning. That was very foolish," Musk said. "It had way too many cool things in it that really should have been rolled in with version 2, version 3," he continued. "We got overconfident and created something great that probably will never be made again, and perhaps should not be..." We're Not in a Civil War, But We Are Drifting Toward Divorce. The urge to "self-segregate" probably won't end anytime soon, argues the author of a National Review Op-Ed: "...If we seek to preserve our union, we’re left with a choice — try to dominate or learn to tolerate? The effort to dominate is futile, and it will leave us with a permanently embittered population that grows increasingly punitive with each transition of presidential power. There is hope, however, in the quest to tolerate. Our Constitution is built to allow our citizens to govern themselves while protecting individual liberty and providing for the common defense. It’s built to withstand profound differences without asking citizens or states to surrender their strongest convictions. We can either rediscover this federalism, or we may ultimately take a third path — we may choose to separate..." Crispr May Cure All Genetic Disease - One Day. Here's an excerpt from WIRED.com: "...When I think about where we are likely to see the biggest impacts in the shortest amount of time, I really think it’s going to be in agriculture,” she said. Plant breeders have always been geneticists at heart. And with the precision and ease of Crispr, identifying and separating out desirable traits has the potential to speed up new crop development by several orders of magnitude. Agro-giants DuPont and Monsanto have invested in Crispr licenses to accelerate their R&D efforts toward creating crops that can withstand changing climates and new disease and pest burdens. In test plots around the world gene edited crops are already growing—from longer-lasting potatoes and flood-resistant rice to drought-hardy corn and mildew-proof wheat, to name just a few..." Livemint has a very good explainer on the principals behind Crispr. Here's What Will Happen To America's Dying Department Stores. Call it Mall-apocalypse. Shopping habits and expectations are rapidly changing; many people now relying on online options, argues a story at Business Insider: "...And when department stores die, the mall itself sometimes follows, since the former pays a large percentage of the building's rent. In a new report, Credit Suisse analysts expect that 20% to 25% of malls — about 220 to 275 shopping centers — will shutter over the next five years, largely due to department store closures. Retail experts attribute the traditional mall's decline to changing habits of American consumers, who increasingly prefer to spend money online or on experiences rather than objects. Department stores at malls of the future have an opportunity to fulfill other community needs besides commerce, June Williamson , an architecture professor at the City College of New York and an author of "Retrofitting Suburbia," tells Business Insider. She says the US simply has built too many malls (and thus, department stores)..." Photo credit: Rolling Acres Mall Nicholas Eckhart Fortune 500 CEOs Still Optimistic About the Future.

An article at The Des Moines Register explains: "At first, people who reject predominant scientific findings that humans are the main cause of climate change may be glad that new public-school science standards don’t require teachers to teach that. But if inquiry-based teaching guides under development in the Iowa K-12 Climate Science Education Initiative are used, students may reach that determination on their own, educators say. The Climate Science Education Initiative, a project of the University of Iowa’s Center for Global and Regional Environmental Research and College of Education, will help teachers apply in class Next Generation Science Standards that do not take the step of telling students what to think about climate change..."

Once Again Climate Change Cited as Trigger for War. A recent report highlights 12 epicenters worldwide,  where a rapidly changing climate could contribute to destabilization and conflict. Scientific American has details: "...Many of the risk epicenters stem from resource shortages and dislocated populations, but the experts also consider an increased likelihood of nuclear war, more pandemics and tensions in the Arctic. Any one of those factors is enough to cause serious problems, but together they threaten to undermine the international order, said Francesco Femia, one of the authors of the report, titled “Epicenters of Climate and Security: The New Geostrategic Landscape of the Anthropocene.” “The humanitarian effects of [climate change] are massive,” he said. “But what we’re saying is that those humanitarian consequences are likely to spill over into broader security problems that speaks to the heart of how the world organizes itself...” Photo credit: "The Mosul Dam in Iraq."

Rochester's Post Bulletin has details: "Minnesota's governor is committing the state to upholding the Paris climate change accord by joining an alliance set up by other states with the same goal. Gov. Mark Dayton says he signed onto the U.S. Climate Alliance which was formed after President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement reached by 195 countries last year. California, New York and Washington started the alliance. Minnesota, Puerto Rico and eight other states signed on Monday. Alliance members pledge to reduce emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels..." File photo: U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Pittsburgh and Paris Join Over 200 Cities and States Rejecting Trump on Climate. Here's an excerpt from The Guardian: "...Yesterday, the mayors of Pittsburgh and Paris co-authored a New York Times editorial rejecting Trump’s efforts to pin the two cities against each other on climate change. Additionally, 12 states (California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia) plus Puerto Rico created the US Climate Alliance, committed to upholding the Paris accord. These states represent 97 million Americans – 30% of the national population. More than 1,000 U.S. governors, mayors, investors, universities, and companies joined the “We Are Still In” campaign, pledging to meet the goals of the Paris agreement..."

I remember going on business trips to Pittsburgh with my dad, and white dress shirts turning orange from all the grit in the air. Street lights were often turned on at high noon. Sometimes we fail to grasp how far we've come. Here's a clip from Atlas Obscura: "...Conditions were so bad, white-collar workers often had extra pairs of shirts to change into during the day. And when Frank Lloyd Wright was asked how to fix the city, he glibly said, “Raze it and start over.” In 1946, the newly elected mayor proposed a less extreme plan to clean up the city and improve the standard of living. Over the next two decades, the surfaces of buildings were cleaned, new, cleaner industries slowly came up, and the level of pollution dropped by nearly 90 percent. But some buildings wanted to keep a reminder of the city’s smoky past to warn future generations about the consequences of filthy air, and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was one of them..."

Here's a clip from The Guardian: "Americans are “under siege” from disinformation designed to confuse the public about the threat of climate change, Nasa’s former chief scientist has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Ellen Stofan, who left the US space agency in December, said that a constant barrage of half-truths had left many Americans oblivious to the potentially dire consequences of continued carbon emissions, despite the science being unequivocal. “We are under siege by fake information that’s being put forward by people who have a profit motive,” she said, citing oil and coal companies as culprits. “Fake news is so harmful because once people take on a concept it’s very hard to dislodge it...” Why Conservatives Have Always Distrusted Science. Not all conservatives. And there's a place for both, faith in absolutes and the scientific method; they are not mutually exclusive. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg View: "...If "technology becomes the god by which we live," warned the National Review columnist Frank Meyer, then the Communists would win, because their system pursued "to its logical conclusion the positivistic glorification of control and power as the end of man’s existence." To go down that route was to worship the false god of "scientism," the philosopher Eric Voegelin wrote, and to make mathematics and physics "substitute for the religious order of the soul." After all, it was the scientific method, what Friedrich Hayek called the "religion of the engineers," that had created the gas chambers in Nazi Germany and the planned economy and labor camps in Stalin’s Russia..." File image: Catholic World Report. Your Country is Flooding? Tough Luck. There will be blowback. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg: "...The irony of U.S. antipathy to funding climate projects overseas is that withdrawing from those efforts hurts Americans. Matthew Kotchen, a Yale economics professor who represented the U.S. on the fund’s board under Obama, says that higher emissions overseas mean worse storms, floods, and wildfires at home. Just as important, natural disasters in poor countries, caused or amplified by climate change, lead to increased conflict and migration. “Trump himself, and maybe many of his supporters, believe that focusing on just your own national interest is sufficient,” Kotchen says. “There isn’t a recognition that we actually depend on other countries and other people for our security, stability, and prosperity.” While that debate continues, the problems that the climate fund is meant to address get worse. A recent study found that the number of people exposed to storm surges has increased more than 20 percent since 2000, to 162 million. More than 1 billion people are exposed to floods, the vast majority of them in the developing world..."

Makes perfect sense to me. Walk outside and you instantly feel all that moisture suspended in the atmosphere, which will manifest itself in the form of very heavy rains today, along with a severe outbreak capable of large hail and damaging winds. Something for the entire family. If it's any consolation we cool off later in the week. "Average" will feel like sweet relief after yesterday's heat spike.

Or see go see a movie and loiter an extra 8 hours at your favorite store or mall. Or just grin and bear it. Not sure we'll set any records, but today will probably be one of the 2 or 3 hottest days of 2017. Storms rumble in tomorrow; a few could pack strong winds, hail and flooding rains. Some relief from the heat and humidity is likely by late next week. Staff Directory June 8 Heat Index Tops 100F Saturday - Strong Storms by Sunday PM Thursday felt like prime-time summertime with temperatures well above average and plentiful sunshine. Today will still be reasonable, but the combination of mid/upper 90s + high dew points + high winds will create a heat spike on Saturday. A heat index of 100 degrees or higher is likely by mid-afternoon. T-storms are most likely Sunday, and heat and thunder will linger into at least the first half of next week.

The court decision allows Boeing to continue pressing for tariffs against its Canadian competitor. The US International Trade Commission (ITC) on Friday ruled that there is reasonable indication that Boeing’s business might have been hurt or threatened by Bombardier sales in the US of its C Series jets. The US Department of Commerce is investigating separately whether to impose duties on the Bombardier planes. A negative ruling by the ITC would have ended the two investigations. Before the US imposes any duties, the ITC would still have to issue a final ruling on how Boeing’s business was affected. Boeing has accused Bombardier of selling its C Series jets in the US at “absurdly low” prices, while benefiting from unfair government subsidies in Canada. The US planemaker asked the ITC in April to find that the company has suffered injury to its business at the hands of Bombardier, and to recommend that the commerce department slap duties on the C Series. The tussle echoes longstanding US-Europe disputes stemming from the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus SE. A WTO panel on Friday found that billions of US dollars in government subsidies that flowed to Boeing now comply with international rules, except for tax breaks from Washington State that continue to disadvantage Airbus. Bombardier spokesman Mike Nadolski said in an e-mail that the company had expected the preliminary ITC decision given “the very low bar for Boeing in this first step of the process” and that a more detailed review would show Boeing’s claims are baseless. The allegations opened a new front in trade tensions between the US and Canada, which have intensified since US President Donald Trump took office vowing to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The US earlier this year imposed duties on Canadian lumber, reigniting a longstanding dispute, and Trump has complained about Canadian protections for dairy farmers. Talks to revamp NAFTA are expected to start after mid-August. Following Friday’s ruling, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said the government would defend Bombardier’s interests, adding that a review is underway over military procurement that relates to Boeing. Tariffs could hurt Bombardier’s efforts to win customers for its largest-ever jetliner. The last major order for the plane — Delta Air Lines Inc’s for at least 75 jets — was in April last year.

 Iran's Aseman signs final deal for 30 Boeing 737s: IRNA Reuters Jun. 10, 2017, 9:00 AM 1,054 facebook linkedin twitter email print Boeing's logo is seen during Japan Aerospace 2016 air show in Tokyo Thomson Reuters LONDON (Reuters) - Aseman Airlines has signed a final deal to buy 30 Boeing 737 MAX jets in Iran's first new business with the U.S. planemaker since President Donald Trump took office vowing to take a tougher stance toward the country. Aseman and Boeing had signed a tentative deal in April. Iran's state news agency IRNA reported that representatives of Aseman and Boeing signed the final agreement in the capital Tehran on Saturday. "I am very pleased that after a year of negotiation with Boeing, the contract to buy 30 Boeing 737s was signed today," Aseman CEO Hossein Alaei was quoted as saying by IRNA after the signing ceremony. Owned by Iran's civil service pension foundation but managed as a private company, Aseman is Iran's third-largest airline by active fleet size, according to the CAPA consultancy. Alaei said Aseman was ready to order another 30 of the same planes once the delivery of the first order was finished. IRNA reported that the deal for 60 jets would be worth $3 billion, saying Aseman would pay 5 percent and seek financing for the rest. Boeing has already agreed to sell 80 aircraft to flag carrier IranAir under a deal between Tehran and major powers that led to the lifting of most sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear technology development activities. Trump has said he opposes the nuclear sanctions pact but has not stated a public view on the aircraft deals reached under the accord. The U.S. aerospace industry says they support Trump's agenda for protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs.

Anjali Bisaria June 10, 2017 461 SHARES Boeing is working on plans to build planes that require no pilots - something that won't go down very well with those who have flight phobia.  The company is aspiring to test the new technology next year. Jetliners are already taking off, landing, and cruising with the aid of computers. Flight management systems also help detect the best flight route after the flight plan is fed in by the pilot. Boeing So, what's really there to be scared about? Pilots dropping out is becoming a reality and the pilotless planes will only aid to the cause of meeting that shortage.  Boeing's Vice-President, Mike Sinnett said they will start testing the technology in a cockpit simulator over the summer next year, before flying a plane with “some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make". australian aviation Of course, pilotless planes would require to successfully pass safety standards and even though Boeing has no idea how that will happen, the company will work on developing algorithms to that end.

The last major firm order for the plane -- Delta Air Lines Inc.’s for at least 75 jets -- dates to April of last year. Boeing said that sale set a “new, low price ceiling” that was depressing its U.S. jetliner prices. The Atlanta-based carrier agreed to purchase the cutting-edge Bombardier jets for $19.6 million apiece, less than the $33.2 million cost of manufacturing the airplanes, Boeing said. Bombardier disputes the $19.6 million figure. The Canadian government earlier this year pledged C$372.5 million ($275 million) to Bombardier to finance two jet programs, including the C Series. Last year, Quebec’s provincial government invested $1 billion in the jetliner.

Iranian Labor Minister Ali Rabiei attended a ceremony this morning in Tehran for clinching the contract with the American airplane maker, the report added. Earlier this year, Aseman Air and the US company negotiated a MoU on the deal for the 60 Boeing 737 aircraft which are expected to be gradually delivered since 2019. In a separate development, Boeing and Iran Air, the country’s flag carrier, concluded a deal on purchasing 80 aircraft. The delivery of Iran Air aircraft will begin next year and will be completed within 10 years. After Washington announced it was reviewing licenses for aircraft manufacturers to do business with the Islamic Republic, Boeing told Trend on May 30 that its deals with Iran depend on the US government approval.

PHOTO: BOEING Boeing Co is looking ahead to a brave new world where jetliners fly without pilots and aims to test some of the technology next year, the world’s biggest plane maker said in a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow. The idea may seem far-fetched but with self-flying drones available for less than $1,000, “the basic building blocks of the technology clearly are available,” said Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product development. Jetliners can already take off, cruise and land using their onboard flight computers and the number of pilots on a standard passenger plane has dropped to two from three over the years. Sinnett, a pilot himself, plans to test the technology in a cockpit simulator this summer and “fly on an airplane next year some artificial intelligence that makes decisions that pilots would make”, he said. Airbus unveils modular, flying car concept Self-flying aircraft would need to meet the safety standards of air travel, which had its safest year in 2016, according to the Aviation Safety Network. They would also need to convince regulators who don’t yet know how to certify such planes. “I have no idea how we’re going to do that,” Sinnett said. “But we’re studying it right now and we’re developing those algorithms.” Airlines are among those backing the idea, in part to deal with a projected need for 1.5 million pilots over the next 20 years as global demand for air travel continues to grow. But a self-flying plane would need to be able land safely as Captain Chesley Sullenberger did in the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Sinnett said. “If it can’t, then we can’t go there.” Airbus offers a peek at its flying taxi A U.S. Airways plane hit a flock of geese shortly after taking off from New York in 2009 knocking out its engines but Sullenberger managed to glide the Airbus A320 to a safe landing on the Hudson River, saving all 150 passengers on board. Boeing is also inching closer to creating its next new aircraft to plug a gap in its product line between its best-selling narrow-bodied 737 and its larger 787 Dreamliner. It aims to bring the new jet to customers around 2025. After in-depth talks with nearly 60 customers it concluded that current wide-body planes have too much range for most of the routes narrow-body planes fly, Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a separate briefing. “This is a market that cannot be served by narrow-bodies – not by ours or our competitors'” he said, referring to rival Airbus. “It can be served by wide-bodies, the question is can it be more efficiently served by a targeted airplane?” Read more: aviation , Boeing , Latest Read full story Recommended Stories World's largest plane unveiled Project backed by billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen Made-in-China jet takes maiden flight Plane represents nearly a decade of effort in a government-mandated drive to reduce dependence on imported aircraft Non-stop flights from Australia to London almost a reality As long as oil prices don't go much higher than around $70 per barrel, the 20-hour flight can be financially viable Facebook Conversations Reader Comments (1) All Comments Reader's Recommendations Haji Atiya Jun 10, 2017 - 9:00PM Reply Thanks but no thanks.

Most of us will gripe as we dart from one air-conditioned space to the next. Such tough, first-world problems. How on Earth did our ancestors keep their cool before 1902, when Willis Carrier invented a contraption that would "condition the air"? A Mental Floss story explains how people coped, when they weren't wading into their favorite lakes. They slept on porches, used ceiling fans, only staying in upper rooms at night. They slept in their basements, which stayed comfortable. A few tormented souls slept in refrigerated sheets and kept underwear in the freezer. I have to try that, and hope my wife doesn't freak out. Expect mid-90s today with a heat index near 100F. Heavy T-storms sprout Sunday, keeping us noticeably cooler. I see another surge of 90s Tuesday before midweek T-storms mark the approach of cooler, less humid air. A heat wave builds across the USA in the coming weeks, but a series of cool puffs from the Canadian Provinces will take the edge off our heat. A free Minnesota cool front by late June? Frozen undies optional. Life Before Air Conditioning. Here's an excerpt of the Mental Floss story I referenced in today's column. Our ancestors were tough - no question. I fear we've gotten soft: "...Ceiling fans accentuate the effect by pulling air up during the summer, and pushing warmer air down in the winter. Older homes with more than one story took advantage of the stack effect, as open stairwells vented heat upstairs. That's why upper floors were only used at night, with the windows open. Some houses even had a tower or turret to act as a windcatcher or heat exhaust vent. Shade trees planted on the east and west sides of a home block the summer sun before it warms the home exterior. They also cool down breezes slightly before they enter the porch area. Awnings and window overhangs provide the same effect, and let more sunshine in during the winter, when the sun hangs lower..." Heat Advisory Posted. The combination of heat + humidity will create a heat index close to 100F by mid-afternoon. Take it easy out there. Details from the Twin Cities National Weather Service. 100-Degree Heat Index Today? It doesn't seem like much of a stretch if the sun stays out most of the day, meaning at least mid-90s with a dew point well up into the 60s, making it feel like 100F from the Twin Cities metro to Mankato and Fairmont/Albert Lea by 3 pm or so. Excessive Heat Predicted for the Coming Week Could Affect Your Medication. Not only the heat, but sunlight can impact the efficacy of certain medications. Dr. Marshall Shepherd explains at Forbes: "...According to information on the Baystate Health organization website, there are standards for storing medications that have been set by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention. The guidance on the website One of the standards established by the U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention is to keep medications stored at room temperature, which is defined as between 68 to 77 degrees F. However, most pharmacists will agree that they are still safe between 58 to 86 degrees F. Medications can also be affected by direct sunlight. Excessive heat or direct sunlight can render some medications less potent. Baystate Health organization experts suggest that medications taken for diabetes and heart disease are particularly vulnerable...Other particularly heat sensitive medications include those used to treat the thyroid and for birth control. Medications with hormones, albuterol inhalers, diazepam, and lorazepam are also listed..." Hot Start to June. After a minor cooling correction in May June is trending warmer than average again. Here's a clip from this week's Minnesota WeatherTalk, courtesy of Dr. Mark Seeley: "After a cooler than normal May, June has begun much warmer than normal, with most southern and western communities reporting multiple daytime highs in the 90s F so far. Places like Browns Valley and Milan have already reported highs of 96 degrees F, and temperatures will go higher than that this weekend in many places. Observers across the state are reporting average temperatures for the month so far that are from 5 to 8 degrees F warmer than normal. Also unlike last month, bright sunny skies are dominant, and the landscape has dried out quite a bit. Many areas are in need of a good rain. In fact portions of northwestern and north-central Minnesota have seen deficits in precipitation since March 1st. Some are as much as 5-7 inches below normal in precipitation since that date. As a result the Drought Monitor shows these parts of the state to be in moderate drought..." Dress for Hot Weather Success. Although survival is probably a good place to start. Thanks to HealthTalkUMN at the University of Minnesota. Severe Flooding in Wyoming. All that snow that fell is now melting in a hurry, confirming official's worst fears. The language used in the warning above underscores the gravity of the situation in Wyoming and  much of the western USA. Avoid a Heat-Related Vehicle Disaster. Keep in mind your vehicle quickly becomes an oven, a hyper-local greenhouse effect during the summer months. According to NOAA studies an outside air temperature of only 80F can translate into 99F after only 10 minutes; 109F within 20 minutes. Don't even think about leaving a child (or pet) in a car or truck. Pitchers More Likely to Hit Batters in Hot Weather. Yes, hot weather seems to have all of us on edge, according to a post at Yale Climate Connections: "...That’s Rick Larrick of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. He studies decision-making, and says hot weather has been linked to more aggressive behavior. He studied baseball statistics and found that pitchers are slightly more likely to retaliate when it’s hot. He speculates it’s because people are already on edge. Larrick: “Once you are uncomfortable and irritable, you are just more easily agitated, and the same kind of insult or offense seems bigger...” Photo credit: "Rick Larrick at the Cardinals Hall of Fame in St. Louis." Spring Was 8th Warmest, 11th Wettest. NOAA NCEI has details on spring weather across the USA in relation to a 123 year weather record: "The spring (March–May) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 53.5°F, 2.6°F above the 20th century average, driven in large part by warmth during the early and middle part of the season. Much-above-average spring temperatures were observed in the Rockies, Southern Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. The May average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 60.6°F, 0.4°F above average, and ranked near the middle of the 123-year period of record. Parts of the West and Southeast were warmer than average with near- to below-average temperatures in parts of the central and eastern U.S..." Starting Hurricane Season Without Leaders of NOAA and FEMA Should "Scare the Hell Out of Everbody". CNN.com has details: "...The two agencies that protect the country's coast lines and its residents, NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) are still without leaders -- positions that must be appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate. "That should scare the hell out of everybody," retired US Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré told CNN. "These positions help save lives." Honoré knows all too well the value that leadership plays during a crisis, as he commanded Joint Task Force Katrina. He coordinated military relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré talks to his soldiers at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, on September 8, 2005. Despite concerns, FEMA and NOAA say they are prepared for the hurricane season and the aftermath of any storms that make landfall and cause damage..." (File image of Hurricane Dennis: NASA). 2016 State of U.S. High Tide Flooding. With slowly rising seas many cities no longer require a major storm for storm surge flooding as reported by NOAA NCDC: "...This month's State of the Climate report includes an annual update of the state of coastal high tide flooding. Sometimes called nuisance or sunny day flooding, this type of flooding occurs when water levels measured at a NOAA tide gauges exceed locally established heights associated with minor impacts, such as water on low-lying streets or infiltration into storm-water systems. Such coastal flooding is increasing in frequency, depth and extent in many areas of the U.S. due to on-going increases in local relative sea level. Decades ago, coastal flooding mostly occurred during strong storms. Today, it occurs more frequently during high-tide cycles and calmer weather. Though high tide flooding today is rarely life threatening, it is a serious concern in several communities, such as Norfolk, Virginia, Charleston, South Carolina and Miami, that are not protected by flood control structures that cities like New Orleans have in place. Several cities experienced more than a month (30 days) of daily flooding in 2016: Wilmington, NC (84 days); Charleston, SC (50 days); Honolulu, HI (45 days); Annapolis, MD (42 days); Savannah, GA (38 days); Washington D.C. (33 days); and Port Isabel, TX (31 days) due to a combination of low-lying coastal topography and high sea levels during 2016..." U.S. Coastal Cities Will Flood More Often and More Severely, Study Warns. More perspective at InsideClimate News: "...Oppenheimer says he's most concerned about chronic, but less-extreme flooding along the East Coast, including the south shore of New York's Long Island, the low country around Charleston, S.C., and south Florida, where tidal flooding already has become an everyday occurrence. "These areas have terrain that's gently sloped," Oppenheimer said. "South Florida is really in trouble. Not only are they having a lot of nuisance flooding, but they sit on limestone, which makes it extremely difficult to build coastal defenses. These places really have to get on the ball and decide what they have to protect." But adapting for the risk takes time, political will and money..." Map credit: Nature Climate Change. Science Says: Weather Forecasts Improve, Under the Radar. It's far from perfect, but the weather forecast continues to improve over time, according to new data highlighted in an Associated Press story: "Make fun of the weatherman if you want but modern forecasts have quietly, by degrees, become much better. Meteorologists are now as good with their five-day forecasts as they were with their three-day forecasts in 2005. Both government and private weather forecasting companies are approaching the point where they get tomorrow’s high temperature right nearly 80 percent of the time. It was 66 percent 11 years ago, according to ForecastWatch , a private firm that rates accuracy of weather forecasts..." Report: National Weather Service Meteorologists "Fatigued" and "Demoralized" by Understaffing. Just in case you missed this from Angela Fritz at Capital Weather Gang: "The employees of the National Weather Service are demoralized, according to a recent report by the Government Accountability Office. They are understaffed and spread thin, covering shifts and positions beyond what they were hired to fill. The weather never sleeps, and apparently neither does the Weather Service. Between 2014 and 2016, the number of vacant staff meteorologist positions increased 57 percent. In the same time, management vacancies decreased by 29 percent. The mission of the Weather Service — to protect lives and property — is critical, so the employees are completing the tasks. But it comes at a cost. The GAO used some pretty gloomy language to describe the employees’ current state of mind..." Florida Tech Study Confirms Lightning More Powerful Over Water. Here's a clip of another article that caught my eye, courtesy of Florida Tech: "...Nag and Cummins found that with strikes over water in western Florida, the median stepped-leader duration was 17 percent shorter over ocean than over land, and in eastern Florida the median durations were 21 and 39 percent shorter over two oceanic regions than over land. Using a relationship between leader duration and lightning peak current derived in this study, the authors estimate that lightning with peak currents over 50 kilo amperes is twice as likely to occur in oceanic thunderstorms. These findings suggest that people living on or near the ocean may be at greater risk for lightning damage if storms develop over oceans and move on-shore. This new understanding of the nature of lightning could inform how off-shore infrastructure and vessels are to be built to minimize the risk of super-powerful lightning bolts from thunderstorms formed over the sea..." The Forecast for D-Day and the Weatherman Behind Ike's Greatest Gamble. James Martin Stagg. Not exactly a household name in the USA. But he should be. A fascinating article at HuffPost explains what may be the most consequential weather forecast in history: "...When Royal Navy and Met Office forecasters predicted stormy weather for the date originally set for D-day, USSTAF meteorologists adamantly disagreed. Circumventing Stagg, they pressed their case with General Carl Spaatz, U.S. Army Air Force commander in England, who attempted to bring their views to Ike’s attention. Had Ike listened to his countrymen’s predictions and launched D-day on June 5, it would have failed with catastrophic consequences for the Western Allies and world history. Instead, he held the invasion in abeyance for 24 hours, and as rain and high wind pounded his advanced headquarters on the night of June 4, just as Stagg had predicted, he listened to his chief meteorologist report that the weather would clear, and gave the word to “go” for June 6, 1944." (File image: army.mil). Intense Storms May Diminish Protective Ozone in Central U.S. Are super-sized thunderstorms doing more than increasing flash flood risk? Here's a clip from Daily Climate: "More frequent, powerful storms in the Great Plains are penetrating deep into the atmosphere, risking ozone loss and increased dangerous UV radiation, scientists warn...Harvard researchers found that this stratospheric ozone layer above the central U.S. gets depleted during the summer, most likely as intense storms send water vapor into the atmosphere. The vapor can cause the types of chemical reactions that have spurred ozone loss in Arctic and Antarctic regions.  The stratosphere, which extends from about 7 miles above the surface to nearly 30 miles above the ground, is one of the most “delicate aspects of habitability on the planet,” the researchers wrote in the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences this week. The Great Plains' more frequent and violent storms get that extra energy in large part from warming waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The Harvard study shows that, in addition to storm damage, the loss of ozone threatens food security and human health..."

Here's an excerpt of a press release from Risk Management Solutions: "...A key insight of the updated RMS model is that it captures what is now understood to be the potential for larger and more correlated seismic events in California, as well as new views of risk across all the regions of the U.S. The model now includes induced seismicity, making it the first available tool on the market for analyzing property risks from man-made earthquakes across Oklahoma, Kansas, Ohio, Arkansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Alabama. This functionality will allow clients of RMS to consider risks from earthquakes linked to oil and gas extraction..." Louisiana Coast Loses a Football Field of Land Every 38 Minutes. A number of converging factors are in play, as explained at Plaquemines Parish Coastal Erosion: "Louisiana contains 30% of the total marshland within the lower 48 U.S. states, but unfortunately leads in coastal erosion and wetland loss, making up 90% of coastal marsh loss. Currently Louisiana has lost 1,900 square miles since the 1930's and continues to lose an estimated 70 square kilometers/year, or a football field of land every 38 minutes, due to a combination of natural processes, such as storms, sea-level rise, and subsidence, as well as man made alterations to the Mississippi River and wetlands over the past 200 years, i.e. the construction of levees and canals, and the development of the oil and natural gas industry..." "Coal is Dead" and Oil Faces "Peak Demand", Says World's Largest Investment Group. ThinkProgress has the story: "Coal is dead,” Jim Barry, the global head of BlackRock’s infrastructure investment group, explained in a recent interview. BlackRock, the world’s largest investment group, with $5 trillion in assetsâ—âmore than the world’s largest banksâ—âhas begun to bet on clean energy. Why? “The thing that has changed fundamentally the whole picture is that renewables have gotten so cheap,” said Barry.

Minnesota Moving Up in Rankings for Solar Energy. Star Tribune reports: "Minnesota’s national ranking for solar energy capacity has climbed significantly after a flurry of new projects have come online. During the first quarter, the state ranked fourth nationally for new solar power installations compared with the same period a year ago, according to data released Thursday by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), a trade group. The state added 140 megawatts of solar power capacity in the quarter, continuing a growth spurt that started in last year’s fourth quarter and reflects long-planned developments being switched on..."

Even Tesla's Elon Musk Makes Mistakes. Here's a clip from an article at Fortune: "...The CEO said he made the decision to significantly pare down the configurations for the Model 3—Tesla's most affordable vehicle yet, starting at $35,000—after learning from mistakes he made with Tesla's SUV known as the Model X, which Musk called "hubris extraordinaire." "The big mistake we made with the X, which primarily was my responsibility, was having way too much complexity right at the beginning. That was very foolish," Musk said. "It had way too many cool things in it that really should have been rolled in with version 2, version 3," he continued. "We got overconfident and created something great that probably will never be made again, and perhaps should not be..." How to Fall To Your Death and Live to Tell the Tale. It's not the snow and ice - it's the slipping, sliding and falling that strikes fear into people, especially older Americans. Here's an excerpt of an eye-opening story at Mosaic: "...Falls are one of life’s great overlooked perils. We fear terror attacks, shark bites, Ebola outbreaks and other minutely remote dangers, yet over 420,000 people die worldwide each year after falling. Falls are the second leading cause of death by injury, after car accidents. In the United States, falls cause 32,000 fatalities a year (more than four times the number caused by drowning or fires combined). Nearly three times as many people die in the US after falling as are murdered by firearms. Falls are even more significant as a cause of injury. More patients go to emergency rooms in the US after falling than from any other form of mishap, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly triple the number injured by car accidents. The cost is enormous..." Fortune 500 CEOs Still Optimistic About the Future. The greatest concern? The pace of technological disruption and AI, artificial intelligence.

Dayton Signs Into States' Climate Goal Alliance. Rochester's Post Bulletin has details: "Minnesota's governor is committing the state to upholding the Paris climate change accord by joining an alliance set up by other states with the same goal. Gov. Mark Dayton says he signed onto the U.S. Climate Alliance which was formed after President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement reached by 195 countries last year. California, New York and Washington started the alliance. Minnesota, Puerto Rico and eight other states signed on Monday. Alliance members pledge to reduce emissions 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels..." File photo: U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. Pittsburgh and Paris Join Over 200 Cities and States Rejecting Trump on Climate. Here's an excerpt from The Guardian: "...Yesterday, the mayors of Pittsburgh and Paris co-authored a New York Times editorial rejecting Trump’s efforts to pin the two cities against each other on climate change. Additionally, 12 states (California, New York, Washington, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Virginia) plus Puerto Rico created the US Climate Alliance, committed to upholding the Paris accord. These states represent 97 million Americans – 30% of the national population. More than 1,000 U.S. governors, mayors, investors, universities, and companies joined the “We Are Still In” campaign, pledging to meet the goals of the Paris agreement..."

I remember going on business trips to Pittsburgh with my dad, and white dress shirts turning orange from all the grit in the air. Street lights were often turned on at high noon. Sometimes we fail to grasp how far we've come. Here's a clip from Atlas Obscura: "...Conditions were so bad, white-collar workers often had extra pairs of shirts to change into during the day. And when Frank Lloyd Wright was asked how to fix the city, he glibly said, “Raze it and start over.” In 1946, the newly elected mayor proposed a less extreme plan to clean up the city and improve the standard of living. Over the next two decades, the surfaces of buildings were cleaned, new, cleaner industries slowly came up, and the level of pollution dropped by nearly 90 percent. But some buildings wanted to keep a reminder of the city’s smoky past to warn future generations about the consequences of filthy air, and the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research was one of them..."

Here's a clip from The Guardian: "Americans are “under siege” from disinformation designed to confuse the public about the threat of climate change, Nasa’s former chief scientist has said. Speaking to the Guardian, Ellen Stofan, who left the US space agency in December, said that a constant barrage of half-truths had left many Americans oblivious to the potentially dire consequences of continued carbon emissions, despite the science being unequivocal. “We are under siege by fake information that’s being put forward by people who have a profit motive,” she said, citing oil and coal companies as culprits. “Fake news is so harmful because once people take on a concept it’s very hard to dislodge it...” Why Conservatives Have Always Distrusted Science. Not all conservatives. And there's a place for both, faith in absolutes and the scientific method; they are not mutually exclusive. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg View: "...If "technology becomes the god by which we live," warned the National Review columnist Frank Meyer, then the Communists would win, because their system pursued "to its logical conclusion the positivistic glorification of control and power as the end of man’s existence." To go down that route was to worship the false god of "scientism," the philosopher Eric Voegelin wrote, and to make mathematics and physics "substitute for the religious order of the soul." After all, it was the scientific method, what Friedrich Hayek called the "religion of the engineers," that had created the gas chambers in Nazi Germany and the planned economy and labor camps in Stalin’s Russia..." File image: Catholic World Report. Politics, Culture or Theology? Why Evangelicals Back Trump on Global Warming. Here's a snippet from Religion News Service: "...In an interview with RNS, Schwadel explained that on environmental concerns, party affiliation played as large a role in influencing the views of Americans overall as did their religious beliefs, and both those factors outstripped every other variable, such as education, sex, income, race and geography. But when comparing evangelicals to some other religious groups, the evidence indicated that religious views were far more important for evangelicals than for other Christians. The chief theological marker of their beliefs, he said, is that evangelicals tend to have a literal view of the Bible – they believe that in Genesis the “earth was given to them to do as humans will” and that the prophecy at the end of the New Testament that Jesus will return in glory to rapture his followers is soon to be fulfilled..." Your Country is Flooding? Tough Luck. There will be blowback. Here's an excerpt from Bloomberg: "...The irony of U.S. antipathy to funding climate projects overseas is that withdrawing from those efforts hurts Americans. Matthew Kotchen, a Yale economics professor who represented the U.S. on the fund’s board under Obama, says that higher emissions overseas mean worse storms, floods, and wildfires at home. Just as important, natural disasters in poor countries, caused or amplified by climate change, lead to increased conflict and migration. “Trump himself, and maybe many of his supporters, believe that focusing on just your own national interest is sufficient,” Kotchen says. “There isn’t a recognition that we actually depend on other countries and other people for our security, stability, and prosperity.” While that debate continues, the problems that the climate fund is meant to address get worse. A recent study found that the number of people exposed to storm surges has increased more than 20 percent since 2000, to 162 million. More than 1 billion people are exposed to floods, the vast majority of them in the developing world..."

Extreme Warmth Has Dominated U.S. Weather Records Since 2010. This Is Climate Change. Jason Samenow reports at Capital Weather Gang: "If it seems as if America’s record heat is in the news much more so than record cold in recent years, it is not a media conspiracy to ignore extremely cold weather. There is a simple and scientifically sound reason for it: Record warmth is happening much more often. Record-warm weather has occurred five times as frequently as record cold in U.S. cities since 2010, according to a new analysis. The imbalance represents a striking example of climate change affecting the nation’s extreme weather in a clear and tangible way..."

The farmers I've talked to may not want to mention "climate change", but almost to a person they describe big changes in their fields over the last generation. Here's a clip from NPR: "...Clayton is a Midwesterner and agricultural policy editor at DTN/The Progressive Farmer. He's also the author of The Elephant in the Cornfield: The Politics of Agriculture and Climate Change, which describes in detail how farmers and farm lobbyists have dealt — or, more often, refused to deal — with a changing climate. It has sometimes put Clayton in an awkward spot, as he acknowledged when I reached him this week in his office in Omaha, Neb. Does it make you nervous, as a reporter at a farm publication, talking about climate change? All the time. I feel like the guy who has to tell people things they don't want to hear. But if I simply ignore the topic or ignore the issues, am I doing anybody any favors?..."

Federal News Radio has details: "...The Defense Department is revising its unified facilities code to adjust to climate change issues. In addition, the Navy is writing into its policies and construction code that all new buildings take into account the possibility of sea level rise, said Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Fleet Readiness and Logistics Vice. Adm. Dixon Smith during the June 6 hearing. “We are taking sea level rise into consideration in our projects. We started this a few years ago as we realized it is changing. So now whenever we design any project that’s within the 100 year flood plain we look at it and analyze ‘Do we need to make adjustments to a standard project to accommodate for [sea level rise],’ said Smith said. Dixon said the Navy’s fueling depot on Craney Island in Norfolk, Virginia was built 10 feet higher to account for climate change effects..." (File image: AP). Climate Change is Here to Stay - So Deal With It. We're already dealing with it - and there's no question that adaptation has to be part of the equation. Here's an excerpt from Axios: "Everyone who wants to keep pushing climate policies in the vacuum of Washington leadership should start thinking more about how to adapt to a warmer world instead of focusing most political will on ways to stop it. Why it matters: The chances of reversing climate change are slim regardless of U.S. involvement in the Paris agreement. Countries, companies, U.S. states and cities and non-governmental organizations pursuing policies to address climate change should refocus their high-level political efforts on ways to prepare for the impacts that are already here and those still to come..." Graphic credit: Lazaro Gamio / Axios. Unfriendly Climate. Kudos to climate scientists (and evangelical Christian) Katharine Hayhoe for swimming upstream and trying to frame climate volatility in a way that resonates with a more conservative audience. Here's a clip from Texas Monthly: "...But the most revealing part of her talk centered on why Christians should care about climate change. To lead into this subject, Hayhoe flipped to a slide with a quote from John Holdren, President Obama’s science adviser: “We basically have three choices: mitigation, adaptation, or suffering. We’re going to do some of each. The question is what the mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.” Suffering, Hayhoe said, is not a word often deployed by scientists. “As scientists we don’t know a lot about suffering, but as Christians we do. And we know that part of the reason we’re here in this world is to help people who are suffering.” And that suffering will not be meted out proportionally: if global warming continues unchecked, the poor—whether they’re in Houston’s Fifth Ward or in low-lying areas of Bangladesh—who have contributed least to carbon emissions will feel the most pain, from enduring more-intense heat waves to paying the higher food prices that will accompany failed crops..."

Print Story X Print Story Business June 10, 2017 Share Advertisement Airbus predicts $5.3 trillion jet demand, trims traffic outlook TOULOUSE, France: Airbus raised its forecast for deliveries by 6 percent to 34,899 aircraft worth $5.3 trillion over the next 20 years, creating jobs for more than a million pilots and technicians as China surges past the United States to dominate air travel. The number of people taking a plane is expected to triple over the same period as the size of the world´s middle class doubles to 5 billion people, Airbus sales chief John Leahy said. But Airbus trimmed its forecast for air traffic growth to 4.4 percent a year from 4.5 percent on Friday, taking a more cautious view on the Americas while boosting the Middle East, despite political disruptions in the Gulf. Even at the lower growth rates, Airbus said its forecasts contained more traffic and deliveries thanks to more tourism, liberalisation and a surge in private consumption. "It´s the tyranny of large numbers," Leahy said of the lower growth forecast, adding the estimate might be conservative. The world´s second largest planemaker after Boeing also predicted a surge in repairs, training and upgrade work for manufacturers as the world´s fleet tops 40,000 jets by 2036.The 20-year rolling forecast for airplane deliveries, which includes 733 freighters, was up from 33,070 aircraft a year ago as a further year of strong deliveries gets swept in. Demand will be led by narrow jets like the Airbus A320neo family or the Boeing 737 MAX, for which Airbus expects 24,807 deliveries worth $2.4 trillion, buoyed by low-cost airlines. Leahy said that budget carriers could reach half of the market, and supported their long-haul drive. "Low-cost long-haul will work," he told a media briefing at the planemaker´s Toulouse headquarters. Airbus sharply revised up its estimate for demand for small twin-aisle aircraft but lowered its forecast for very large planes like its A380 superjumbo, where demand is weak. A battle is looming in the 220-270-seat market as Boeing fine-tunes plans for a mid-market wide-body jet, which Leahy dismissed a re-run of a poor-selling early Airbus model. Airbus is pushing its hot-selling A321neo narrowbody for many missions targeted by Boeing´s proposed new mid-market jet. For the A380, Leahy acknowledged that a reduced forecast for 1,184 very large passenger planes contradicted a gap in sales, but insisted the mammoth jet would come into its own as traffic and congestion make bulk travel unavoidable. Rival Boeing says that segment is on the way out as airlines switch to smaller and efficient twin-engined planes. Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier said Airbus is considering improving the A380 with vertical wingtips to make it cheaper to fly, as reported by Reuters in March. The boom in aircraft demand and a step-up in engine technology has led to some bottlenecks and delays and Bregier warned suppliers that they risk a group-wide boycott if they fail to come up to standard. Airbus officials reaffirmed a target for more than 700 deliveries in 2017, but said a higher target of more than 720 given by the company´s finance chief was also achievable.   Advertisement Comments Comment Advertisement Topstory JIT issues summons, PM appears on Thursday JIT extends probe to Shahbaz family News of sending 20,000 troops to Qatar a conspiracy: FO PM chairs envoys moot on Gulf crisis today Three cops killed in Quetta check-post firing: Daesh claims responsibility View more... see all opinions Opinion Syed Talat Hussain A boxed-in Sharif Zaigham Khan ANP and the ghosts of Mashal and Bacha Khan Mushtaq Rajpar KP finances: a review Dr A Q Khan Treasures of knowledge Suljuk Mustansar Tarar A soft image Aban Marker Kabraji World Oceans Day see all opinions Newspost Incredible ideas Terror in Tehran All work and no play Transportation cost Living in Thar View more... see all opinions Editorial Qatar crisis Fifty years of occupation View more... see all opinions National Scotland Yard chief says anti-Muslim hate crimes unacceptable after spike UK 2017 snap polls: Nastiest ever campaign fails to defeat Naz Shah Liberalised UK doesn’t deserve it PPP won’t let PM become Amirul Momineen, says Bilawal Indian growers want to export potato to Pakistan View more... see all opinions World South Africa’s pre-teen queen with ‘rainmaking’ powers No explosives found on easyJet plane diverted to Germany India’s Maharashtra state waives off all farm loans, averting strike Netanyahu urges UN to dismantle its Palestinian aid agency Two Serbian ex-spy chiefs back on trial for Balkans wars View more... see all opinions Sports Pakistan hope to conquer SL in bid to secure last-four spot India march into CT semis with crushing win against SA We are gelling together as a team, says Hafeez ‘SL will need to give their best to beat Pakistan’ Zaheer, Chappell feel for hapless bowlers in batsmen-friendly world View more... see all opinions Business see all opinions Karachi Frenzied three-way race for PS-114 by-polls expected No relief for child workers due to lax implementation of laws: Sparc Renovated portion of University Road inaugurated Cops told to be vigilant in wake of Quetta attack Crates for wickets, traffic on pitches, and a tournament for a martyr View more... see all opinions Lahore Crackdown on profiteers, hoarders intensified Missing boy found dead in Baghbanpura US media slates Trump on worsening Gulf crisis PAT chief terms JIT election cell of PML-N Fruit sellers using different ways to cheat consumers View more... see all opinions Islamabad Hepatitis B, C patients need advice while fasting to avoid complications Fruit sellers using different ways to cheat consumers Discriminatory social mindset biggest hurdle in way of women’s political participation Parliamentarians attend ‘iftar’ dinner with orphans Voluntary blood donation advocated View more... see all opinions Peshawar Opposition members see no relief for poor 65,000 litres of adulterated milk seized, 8 held in DI Khan Two teenagers injured in firing Journalist shot dead in Haripur Road victims seek compensation View more... see all opinions Advertisement PRIVACY POLICY | CONTACT US | BACK ISSUES © 2017 THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL Back To Top

Testing of the Arrow-3 missile system will begin in 2018, the Kodiak Daily Mirror reported. The system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Boeing Co., and is co-managed by the Missile Defense Agency and the Israel Missile Defense Organization. It will be part of the five– to six-year, $80.4 million contract between Alaska Aerospace Corporation and the Missile Defense Agency, which was announced last summer, Alaska Aerospace CEO Craig Campbell said. "One of the better places to test is in Alaska, from Kodiak, and we plan to do that next year," Navy Vice Adm. James Syring said. The system is being developed to support Israel's ballistic missile defense system. There are no plans to integrate the missiles into the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. Syring said the system could be used by Israel deter potential missile threats from Iran. Testing of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is also set to take place in Alaska in the summer. This system has been touted as a possible defense against North Korean missiles.   article continues below   Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More 0 comments Join the conversation and share your voice!   from around the web more top news Bitburg High School closes doors after 60 years US war veteran now fighting to save Africa's elephants 3 US soldiers killed, 1 wounded in Afghan commando attack Air Force announces pilot bonus tiers Missing WWII veteran's remains return home after 73 years Army veteran fatally stabbed on train remembered as hero news videos editors' picks Bitburg High School closes doors after 60 years Navy, Coast Guard call off search for Normandy sailor who went overboard Submarine officer found guilty of sex charges involving teen he met on Italian base trending read commented Submarine officer found guilty of sex charges involving teen he met on Italian base Search for missing USS Shiloh sailor suspended after exhaustive effort ‘Apathetic safety mentality’ cited in Fort Hood wreck that killed 9 Melania Trump, son Barron move into the White House Air Force again considering grounding some A-10s, congresswoman says stripes rewards Stripes Book Club follow us on: recent tweets Tweets by @starsandstripes Rewards Store Classifieds Newsletters ePaper Mobile Apps SUBSCRIBE: Digital Print © 2017 Stars and Stripes.

That's what Richard Branson accomplished at the Young Leaders of the Americas (YLAI) entrepreneurship event in Kingston last week when he sat with nearly 100 entrepreneurs from over 15 countries across the Caribbean. He set the stage for marvel by sharing that he was with former US president Barack Obama the day before and tried persuading him to return to Jamaica for this inaugural staging of Obama's very own regional entrepreneurial legacy initiative, YLAI conference and workshop on entrepreneurship in the Caribbean. It was a timely reminder that had it not been for the former US president's vision for youth of the Americas to take the lead in transforming their region via enterprise we would not have been meeting as we were. One of the most profound lessons Branson imparted was that the greatness of the Caribbean must not be underestimated as it was the driving force for his own global entrepreneurial fame, birthing the renowned Virgin Atlantic.   VIRGIN BIRTH   Branson never planned on starting an airline in the 1980s. Instead, he was determined to travel to see "a very beautiful woman", who was waiting for him in the British Virgin Islands when American Airlines bumped him and several other passengers from a flight because they did not have enough passengers to fill the plane. He went to the back of the airport, chartered a plane, borrowed a writing board and scribbled the sign "Virgin Air - one way $39", then walked around to the other stranded passengers and extended the offer. That, he said, was how he filled his first flight. The next day, he called Boeing and asked whether they had any second-hand 747 aeroplanes for sale, and the rest is history. Over 30 years later, Virgin Atlantic remains an innovator in the airline industry. Branson's top tip for business success, for which he said even some critics have eventually thanked him, left many young entrepreneurs at a loss for words. He suggested that entrepreneurs walk away very early from running the business and hire someone smarter than themselves to do so. "The best advice I can give is to find the time to find someone better than you to run the business on a day-to-day basis," he said. In some cases, he insisted, the business is limited by the entrepreneur's lack of people skills and ability to motivate people. It's a recommendation I've made in this column several times, and I was appreciative of his affirmation. Delegating the everyday tasks frees the entrepreneur to think about the bigger picture, diversify to other areas, problem shoot the critical challenges and make big deals that the company needs to expand, and so on. While he conceded that surrendering power over a business you started is no easy feat, it may be the best choice for many entrepreneurs once the right leader has been recruited. Don't be motivated by money but by achieving something great, is another entrepreneurial philosophy Branson encouraged the Caribbean entrepreneurs in attendance to live by. He believes that the only way to build a successful business is to deliver something of great value to your customers rather than packaging mere fluff.   CLIMATE CHANGE   Branson strongly encouraged regional entrepreneurs to focus on climate change, considering the fragility of environment and the severe implications continued degradation is likely to have on the ecosystem and environs in the region. He reminded the entrepreneurs that their fortunes and the future for them and their children were inextricably tied to our efforts to safeguard our environment. Finally, when it comes to starting and operating a business, Richard Branson stressed that simple is always best. It is, perhaps, the most unassuming strategic advice. However, the possibilities and rewards of practically application are limitless. He shared that Virgin Money was started out of his own experience with financial experts who were overly complex in their explanation of money matters, and who used technical jargon to mask exorbitant fees and confuse customers. In his view, complications don't turn most people on; in fact, it does the opposite, especially when it comes to prospective partners and customers. Keep the solution simple, the process easy, communicate in simple terms, and you may not only find the impetus to start a business, but the formula for growth and long-term success.

The cloak is not like the one seen in fictional content like Harry Potter movies but can be a crucial defence technique of the future as enemy troops will not be able to detect soldiers in hiding. By using radio-absorbing properties it will allow soldiers in ordinary uniforms to be invisible to the enemy's radar devices Trending: Self-flying plane: Boeing to test pilotless jetliners in 2018 "It will allow to impart radio-absorbing properties of any fabric practically without changing its mass and other parameters, in other words — it allows to make fighters dressed in ordinary uniform invisible to radar reconnaissance devices," said a statement from the scientists accessed by Sputnik. The cloak consists of a sophisticated membrane that uses nano-processing technology. Tiny light-sensitive cells embedded can detect surrounding colours and electrical signals then trigger the top layer to imitate those colours by using heat-sensitive dyes. Using this technology, military gear can be developed to suit a wide range of temperatures and loads. The technology was first developed by the University of Illinois and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) which other military research tanks have advanced. The US and the UK military has already tested a range of these cloaks since 2015 but continue to develop advanced technology to master the art of camouflaging.

He prodded Cook to manufacture his iPhones and other gear at home rather than outsource them to China. “One of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants,” Trump said he told Cook. That sums up the economic vision of the Trump administration. The president and his advisers are convinced more factories can cure the trade deficits, lackluster growth, and (supposed) joblessness plaguing the U.S. economy. Trump has vowed to lure back plants that departed for cheaper locales such as China or Mexico and sanction companies that dare to leave. The result, he claims, will be investments that revitalize down-on-their-luck communities and American economic vitality. “We will bring back our jobs,” he pledged in his inauguration speech. “We will bring back our dreams.” The president, though, is plain wrong. Factories won’t restore the American dream. That’s because they don’t contribute as much to the economy as they once did, despite all the fuss politicians make over them. Chasing them with pro-factory policies will not only fail to bring the benefits Trump has promised but could also hurt the very middle-class families they’re designed to help. A die-hard conviction remains among many Americans that the more an economy manufactures, the stronger it is. Some workers feel that making steel or cars is more respectable than stacking shelves at a Gap, and the Trump administration readily agrees. Calling steel “critical to both our economy and our military,” the president signed an executive order in late April that in all likelihood will lead to curbs on imports to protect U.S. mills. Peter Navarro, one of Trump’s key economic advisers, argues that bringing factories back from foreign countries will shore up the nation’s growth and security. “One of the goals of the Trump administration is to reclaim all of the supply-chain and manufacturing capability that would otherwise exist if the playing field were level,” he recently said. This strategy is based on flawed thinking. Manufacturing is certainly not as important to the U.S. economy as it once was, declining to less than 12 percent of gross domestic product in 2016 from 26 percent 50 years earlier. But the whole idea that “we don’t make anything,” as Trump himself has put it, is a fallacy. The U.S. remains a production powerhouse, accounting for almost 19 percent of global manufacturing, behind China’s 25 percent but bigger than Germany’s and Japan’s shares combined. U.S. manufacturers are still extremely competitive in high-tech and hard-to-duplicate products—think Boeing Co. aircraft. And even as some factory work has moved abroad, the U.S. economy remains remarkably strong. Home to many of the world’s most important and innovative companies, from Facebook Inc. to Tesla Inc., the U.S. boasts an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent, less than half the euro-area level. What Trump fails to appreciate is that the true value in making something is no longer in making it. Companies figured out long ago that they can capture most of the value of a product by focusing on its design and research and development, its branding, and the services that support it after it’s been sold. Stan Shih, the founder of Taiwan’s Acer Inc., illuminated this phenomenon in the early 1990s with his “smile curve.” The middle of the smile—the lowest point of value—is where the fabrication takes place; the highest value is found at the corners—the R&D at the beginning and the customer service at the end.© AP Photo/Evan Vucci   Manufacturing is at the lowest point on a curve that plots where companies profit most Load Error That simply reflects supply and demand. The talent necessary to conceive, brand, and market a new product is much scarcer than the skills to manufacture it. The integration of giant emerging economies such as China and India into global supply chains increased the number of available hands to screw or sew things together, dropping the cost of making a product even further. There’s “a lot of supply for the actual manufacturing, but not a lot of supply for creating the next Google or Apple,” says Ann Harrison, management professor at the Wharton School and co-editor of the book The Factory-Free Economy. That disparity shows clearly in the apple of Trump’s eye: the iPhone. In a 2010 study, the Asian Development Bank Institute pulled apart an iPhone and figured that the process of assembling it in China accounted for 3.6 percent of its production cost. The remaining 96.4 percent was paid to the parts suppliers, and Apple, as the creator, claimed the big profits. Net income at Apple, which does almost no manufacturing, was an impressive 21 percent of revenue in its last fiscal year, and its shares trade at 18 times earnings. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., one of the companies to which Apple outsources its manufacturing, recorded net profit of 3.5 percent of sales; investors value its shares at 12 times earnings. Apple also creates lots of jobs without big factories: It directly employs 80,000 people in the U.S. and plans to add thousands more. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans Based on Cook’s reaction to Trump’s nagging, he fully understands where the real profits lie. Although Cook in early May made a surprise announcement that Apple was earmarking $1 billion to invest in advanced manufacturing, the savvy CEO never said his company would build and operate factories itself. (Apple’s first investment was $200 million into Corning Inc., a supplier that makes the glass for iPhones.) Of course, more factories mean more jobs, and more jobs are always good. Studies show that workers who lose their job when a plant closes take a long-term hit to their standard of living. Unfortunately, the 21st century factory won’t create the jobs that yesterday’s did. With advancing technology in robotics and automation, a modern plant can churn out a lot more stuff with fewer workers. That’s why U.S. manufacturing output continues to swell while employment in the sector has withered. Trump’s fixation on factories could lose, not gain, jobs for Americans. There are some measures he can take to woo factories home. A corporate tax cut, for instance, might make the U.S. more attractive to some manufacturers. But to entice supply chains back en masse from China and Mexico, where it’s cheaper and more efficient to make certain things, he’d have to intervene in market forces to overturn those cost advantages—for example, by imposing taxes and tariffs on imports lofty enough to render manufacturing outside the U.S. much more expensive, as he’s already threatened to do. But whenever government tries to outmuscle the market, the result is almost always extra costs that have to be borne by the greater economy. A border tax being contemplated in a Republican tax plan could hurt shareholders, by decreasing corporate profitability and share valuations, and consumers, by hiking prices at their local Walmart or Target. That suppresses consumption, which is bad for growth and jobs. A major effort by the administration to force factories home could destroy lots of other jobs. Raising the price of imports would likely decimate the already struggling retail industry, which supports 1 of 4 American jobs, with slower sales and slimmer profits—almost certainly causing store closings and layoffs. By obsessing over factory jobs that no longer exist, Trump may cost Americans the jobs of the future. The logic of the “smile curve” suggests he should focus on developing and supporting the parts of the manufacturing process that hold the real value—in other words, fostering more Apples. That would entail upgrading the skills of the U.S. workforce by devoting more resources to education and reducing the financial burden of a college degree, while encouraging foreign talent to start their next big ventures in Silicon Valley, not Shanghai. Rather than restricting trade, Trump should press for an even freer global exchange of goods and services so U.S. corporations can best organize their operations to maximize profits. Unfortunately, he and his team aren’t headed in that direction. Describing his talk with Cook, Trump called an Apple factory in America a “real achievement for me”—not Apple, the American worker, or the economy. By rallying political support, his obsession with factories may be good for him, but it isn’t necessarily great for the rest of us.

Testing of the Arrow-3 missile system will begin in 2018, the Kodiak Daily Mirror reported (http://bit.ly/2rX3vuM ). The system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Boeing Co., and is co-managed by the Missile Defense Agency and the Israel Missile Defense Organization. It will be part of the five- to six-year, $80.4 million contract between Alaska Aerospace Corporation and the Missile Defense Agency, which was announced last summer, Alaska Aerospace CEO Craig Campbell said. "One of the better places to test is in Alaska, from Kodiak, and we plan to do that next year," Navy Vice Adm. James Syring said. The system is being developed to support Israel's ballistic missile defense system. There are no plans to integrate the missiles into the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. Syring said the system could be used by Israel deter potential missile threats from Iran. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: SpaceX Scores Another First With Its Dragon Spaceship SpaceX has reflown rockets before -- but a spaceship? That's something new. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Jun 10, 2017 at 10:13AM Eleven times now, SpaceX has launched Falcon 9 rockets into space, then landed their first-stage rockets back on Earth (or sometimes on water). At this point, the trick has almost become old hat. So what's the company to do for an encore? Try on a new hat, of course -- or rather, another old one. Much like the old Space Shuttle, SpaceX's Dragon spaceship can now launch, land, and launch again. Image source: SpaceX. SpaceX changes the language of space flight For some months now, I've been talking about how SpaceX is trying to change not just the economics of spaceflight, but the very language we use to describe it. By flying rockets and recovering them for later reuse (did I mention that they've already reused one rocket?), SpaceX has demonstrated that it's entirely feasible to build a rocket to such high standards that it can be reused on multiple missions. Having demonstrated this, SpaceX has now taken to calling each of its first-stage rockets that's been used at least once "flight-proven." The implication being that rockets built by the Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) United Launch Alliance venture, by Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) Arianespace subsidiary, and by Roscosmos, are not flight proven; they're mere disposable rockets, incapable of use for more than a single mission. Now, more and more often, SpaceX is working to "prove" the "flyability" of its rockets' other components as well. Dragon gets its wings Case in point: The mission that SpaceX flew just last week -- launching an unmanned Dragon spaceship to resupply the International Space Station (ISS) for NASA -- aimed to prove that SpaceX's Dragons are also capable of making multiple trips to orbit and back. On June 3, SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A. The Falcon wasn't "flight proven" at the time, but the Dragon that it carried was -- having previously been used on a similar supply run to ISS in September 2014. (By the way, SpaceX did also land the Falcon 9 first stage. So that rocket part, too, is now flight proven -- the 10th such designee in SpaceX's rocket fleet.) For those keeping score, SpaceX has now: launched 35 Falcon 9 rockets into space in eight years landed 10 first-stage rockets once landed one first stage rocket twice and lost two rockets -- one that exploded after launch in June 2015, and another that exploded during pre-flight testing in September 2016. What's next for SpaceX? Let's tally up the successes. Eleven times, SpaceX has landed Falcon 9 first stages back on Earth (and one of those has landed twice). In April, SpaceX recovered a used nose cone. Now, it's recovered and reused a Dragon capsule. So what will SpaceX pull out of its bag of tricks next? Logically, the recovered nose cone should probably be reused on a future flight. With that rocket part costing an estimated $6 million, learning to reuse the nose cone should allow SpaceX to shave the cost of its rocket launches by nearly 10%, increasing the price pressure on Boeing, Lockheed, and all the rest. An even bigger deal, though, would be landing a Falcon second-stage rocket back on Earth for later reuse. That'll be tricky, because as currently designed, the second stage has only one engine to work with, and an extremely limited fuel supply. (Its first-stage rockets have more fuel capacity and use three engines for reentry.) Then again, SpaceX has done the impossible before. I wouldn't put it past them to figure out this trick as well.

Xconomy Xperience EXOME National Regions Channels Events Boston Angel Investors → Seattle Week in Review: The A.I. Driver/Psychiatrist Will See You Now Benjamin Romano June 9th, 2017 @bromano @xconomy Like Us Xconomy Seattle —  If the TV show Frasier, which aired from 1993 to 2004, were rebooted and set in Seattle of, say, 2037, Dr. Frasier Crane would be an artificial intelligence avatar that would pick you up in a driverless, all-electric luxury sedan, and, after confirming your destination, inform you in an approximation of Kelsey Grammer’s dulcet tone: “I’m listening.” The reboot would be called FrAIser, of course. That’s one potential future suggested by this week’s mobility-as-a-service news flurry. We’ll explore why below, and review other Seattle-area tech developments including: partnerships for Kymeta and Cray; expansions for Crowd Cow and Coding Dojo; the University of Washington’s 2016 patent performance; and a look ahead to events next week including Tech Inclusion Seattle and Xconomy’s own What’s Hot in Cancer Immunotherapy 2017 conference. —Washington state added its square to the emerging patchwork quilt of state-level regulations encouraging development of the autonomous vehicles industry this week. Gov. Jay Inslee signed an executive order authorizing pilot programs, among other things, for self-driving cars on state roads. Our coverage included Intel’s new market forecast of a $7 trillion autonomous transportation industry by 2050. That represents not just the consumer and business shift from vehicle ownership to a model of mobility as a service, but also new services. You won’t just order a Lyft, you’ll order a lift with onboard fast-casual dining options, short films tailored to the length of your ride, and perhaps a quick A.I.-mediated mental-health screening. Some of this is already happening, as a tweet from Textio CEO Kieran Snyder illustrates. Lyft driver advises: Go with the flow, do what you can, leave the rest to God, case closed. Even if you’re an atheist, guy has a point. — Kieran Snyder (@KieranSnyder) June 8, 2017 Of course, taxi drivers have been dispensing on-the-go advice forever. Maybe all this time they should have been marketing it as a modern value-added mobility service. —And the mobility service business is only getting more competitive. ReachNow—which rents BMW vehicles on-demand in Seattle; Portland, OR; and Brooklyn, NY—has launched a beta version of its ReachNow Ride service in parts of Seattle, using some of the same vehicles it rents. A competitor to on-demand transportation providers such as Lyft and Uber, ReachNow touts VIP features such as premium vehicles, advanced scheduling, controls over the vehicles entertainment and climate systems, and a “Do Not Disturb” button—in case you don’t want any advice from your driver. The company offers fixed pricing—as compared to the supply-and-demand driven “surge” pricing of its competitors—but, as the premium pitch suggests, it’s not exactly cheap transportation. Passengers are charged 30 cents a minute and $1.80 a mile, plus a base fare of $1, and taxes and fees. —Washington is looking beyond just autonomous cars. In his executive order, Inslee tasked an interagency work group with developing policies to explore autonomy in a number of other modes of transportation, including aviation. Boeing (NYSE: BA), naturally, is on it. The company is researching pilotless commercial passenger jets, reports The Seattle Times’ Dominic Gates. Of course, the term autopilot has pilot in it for a reason. Computers take the controls during the cruising phase of many long flights, and even auto-land in certain circumstances. A looming pilot shortage and the maturation of A.I. and automation technologies provide the impetus to explore a move from autopilot to pilotless, but the Boeing executive in charge said that autonomous jets will happen only “if we can do that with the same level of safety,” adding, “That’s a really big if.” Inslee signed the executive order at the headquarters of Echodyne, a company making metamaterials radar systems for autonomous vehicles including cars and drones. —Speaking of Echodyne, its metamaterials sister company, Kymeta, announced a major distribution partnership with e3 Systems, a Spanish company, focusing on the yacht market. Redmond, WA-based Kymeta—like Echodyne, a spinout from Intellectual Ventures, backed handsomely by investors including Bill Gates—makes flat-panel satellite antennas to provide global connectivity to vehicles. —Seattle-based supercomputer maker Cray (NASDAQ: CRAY) signed a sales, marketing, and development deal with Virginia-based technology services provider Leidos (NYSE: LDOS) aimed at security-conscious customers in government and industry. The deal focuses on Cray CS supercomputers and multi-level security features that can allow teams with different levels of security clearance to use the same systems while limiting access to data, the companies said in a news release. —Crowd Cow, the Seattle-based startup selling beef portions from sustainably raised animals, expanded its market to the entire U.S. It opened a distribution facility in Lancaster, PA, to ship to customers on the East Coast. —Coding Dojo, the Bellevue, WA-based coding school, will open its seventh location, in Tulsa, OK, with support from the George Kaiser Family Foundation. “Tulsa is a unique city as the shortage of skilled tech workers is large in comparison to the market,” Michael Choi, Coding Dojo’s founder and CEO, said in a news release. —Datapoints: The University of Washington ranked 22nd on the 2016 list of universities worldwide granted U.S. utility patents with 83. The UW’s partner in the Global Innovation Exchange, scheduled to formally open its doors in Bellevue later this year, is Tsinghua University (sometimes referred to as the M.I.T. of China) which ranked fifth on the list, with 181, the highest position for a non-U.S. university. As we’ve reported, the Global Innovation Exchange, an innovation and entrepreneurship-focused international graduate program, is pursuing some novel intellectual property arrangements. Meanwhile, the M.I.T. of the U.S.—M.I.T.—ranked second with 278. The National Academy of Inventors and the Intellectual Property Owners Association compiled the list (PDF). —We profiled BridgeCare Finance, a fintech startup taking a novel approach to a challenge for middle-income families that has direct impacts on women’s participation in the work force: paying for childcare. The company is setting up to make unsecured loans to families to help them through the pre-school years, when average annual childcare costs can match or exceed college tuition. BridgeCare is also one of the startups scheduled to pitch Wednesday afternoon at Tech Inclusion Seattle, produced by Change Catalyst, Galvanize (which is hosting the conference at its Pioneer Square location), Include Seattle, and Tech Inclusion. —Also coming up on Wednesday, Xconomy’s What’s Hot in Cancer Immunotherapy 2017 event here in Seattle. The lineup for this event is, once again, fantastic, assembled by Xconomy’s national biotechnology editor Alex Lash, who introduced his weekly news roundup with this: “The biomedical world was like a postprandial python this week.” Speakers include Juno Therapeutics (NASDAQ: JUNO) CEO Hans Bishop, and other luminaries from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center—where the event takes place, beginning at 1:30 p.m.—Eli Lilly, Oregon Health and Science University, the Institute for Systems Biology, University of Washington, Seattle Children’s Research Institute, Alpine Immune Sciences, and many more.

Liz Kaszynski Bloomberg News Business June 09, 2017 3:09 PM Some Air Force F-35s grounded after pilots deprived of oxygen By Roxana Tiron Bloomberg News LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The U.S. Air Force has ordered a stand-down of its F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft at an Arizona base after pilots there said they suffered oxygen deprivation while flying the plane built by Lockheed Martin Corp. Since May 2, five F-35A pilots assigned to Luke Air Force Base have reported physiological incidents while flying. According to a service press release, those pilots experienced hypoxia-like symptoms. Hypoxia is a deficiency of oxygen reaching the body’s tissues. It’s a potentially life-threatening problem, and one that the U.S. Navy has also been wrestling with on its Boeing Co. F-18 fighters. So far, the Air Force’s F-35 problem has occurred only at Luke; other pilots flying the service’s newest fighter plane haven’t reported any incidents, according to the release. “In order to synchronize operations and maintenance efforts toward safe flying operations we have canceled local F-35A flying,” said Brigadier General Brook Leonard, commander of the 56th Fighter Wing. “The Air Force takes these physiological incidents seriously, and our focus is on the safety and well-being of our pilots.” “We are taking the necessary steps to find the root cause of these incidents,” Leonard said. Lockheed employs about 14,000 in west Fort Worth, where it builds the F-35, including 8,800 who work on the stealth fighter program. This isn’t the first time a high-performance Air Force aircraft that flies at high altitudes has run into such episodes. In 2012, the Air Force had to track down a mystery after at least a dozen pilots flying Lockheed’s F-22 Raptor fighters became dizzy and disoriented. The service eventually determined a valve that regulated oxygen flow into the Raptor pilot’s pressure vest was too weak to prevent the vest from inflating unnecessarily and restricting the pilot’s ability to breathe. During the F-35 grounding, wing officials will educate pilots on the situation, increase their awareness of hypoxia symptoms, and review training to deal with reduced oxygen breathing, according to the release.

Waist-Deep Mud At The Somme Behind The Golden Boughs ﻿ 19 June 2017 Business Air India A Bird’s Past, And Future... The Praful Patel years, which all but grounded AI, come under the lens just as privatisation looms Bhavna Vij-Aurora Photograph by Soumik Kar Mail Print Share A A A increase text size Around Christmas time in 2010, Praful Patel, the then civil aviation minister, hosted a party for top employees of Air India at his upscale Mumbai house. An exo­tic tree—the centerpiece in his rooftop garden—elicited a lot of interest. Praful reportedly told everyone that he had it transported from Bali on board a special Air India flight. A relatively minor act of misdemeanour by the suave Praful, it may not have found its way into the scathing report put out less than a year later by the government’s auditor. There was already eno­ugh for the CAG to sink its teeth into: its 2011 report came down heavily on Air India, its management and the ministry of civil aviation for various acts of omission and commission that landed the national carrier in a morass of debt that has now swelled to over Rs 50,000 crore. Praful was the minister in the cockpit from 2004 to 2011—the major duration of the UPA’s two terms in power. Advertisement opens in new window The chickens have now come home to roost. Three separate FIRs—all naming Praful as the man at the helm—have been registered by the CBI. This follows a Sup­reme Court directive in January 2017, based on a PIL filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan, regarding the purch­ase of 111 aircraft at a cost of Rs 70,000 crore. Air India had purchased 68 aircraft from Boeing, and Indian Airlines had picked up 43 from Airbus Group SE. “There’s no point harping on debt. It’s a valued brand. The Maharaja will be valued much higher than Kingfisher.” In a parallel, seemingly unrelated deve­lopment, the debt-ridden AI is back in the market with the government annou­ncing an intent­ion to disinvest/privatise. AI employees and officials are surprised by the sudden move, coming as it does at a time when the airline had stabilised and started registering an operational profit. Recently, it announced seven new flights to Washington, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Houston, Los Angeles, Tel Aviv and Nairobi. In 2016, it star­ted flights to Vienna, San Francisco, Madrid and a flight to Newark via London from Ahmedabad. AI’s return to profitability was even acknowledged by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his 2016 I-day speech. “Air India was infamous for incurring losses. My government has succeeded in bringing Air India to a situation of clocking operational profit,” he had said. The airline had posted an operational profit of Rs 105 core for the year 2015-16. The buzz within AI is that the government was perhaps waiting for the natio­nal carrier to become profitable so that it could get buyers easily. “A dead organisation was just beginning to show signs of revi­val. It is unfair to try and sell it in such an unceremonious manner just when things were looking up,” says a senior AI official. Advertisement opens in new window In a letter signed collectively by emplo­yees as ‘Team Air India’ on May 29, they wrote to Union finance minister Arun Jaitley: “You have chosen to attack my company at a time when we were rebuilding its broken hull. Broken, I might add by a twisted bunch of politicians who ruled this country from 2004 to 2014 (UPA I-II).” The employees claim they are being targeted for no fault of theirs. The EGoM document that cleared AI’s costly purchase order In the letter, a copy of which was sent to the PMO, they lament that no one registered their dissent when they opposed the UPA governme­nt’s decisions at that time. It was a longish list: “…the largesse of the then civil aviation minister bestowing our routes to other nations without reciprocity or allowing Cabotage and Fifth Freedoms to other carriers…the wanton purchase of such a large number of aircraft on government debt…gifting away our bilaterals and routes and, most importantly, the illogical and questionable merger of AI and Indian Airlines.” Advertisement opens in new window Coincidentally, it’s on the same day, May 29, that the CBI registered the three FIRs against “unknown officials of ministry of civil aviation, government of India, Air India, and unknown private pers­ons”, investigating all the decisions the AI employees say they had opposed. The cases pertain to purchase of 111 aircraft, leasing of aircraft, and handing over of lucrative international routes to private airlines. The AI-IA merger is also being investigated in a separate case registered as a preliminary inquiry. Praful’s name figures in all three FIRs as part of allegations made by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation before the Supreme Court. According to one of the FIRs, “It has been alleged by the petitioner that (the) ministry of civil aviation under Shri Praful Patel…by abusing (his) position as public servant in conspiracy with other public servants and private domestic and foreign airlines, made the national carriers give up profit-making routes and profit-making timings of AI in favour of national and international private airlines, causing a huge loss of marketshare.... Such acts of commission were made on extraneous considerations, causing immense loss to the national carriers and pecuniary benefit to private domestic/foreign airlines.” Advertisement opens in new window Another FIR, pertaining to the purch­ase of aircraft, says the CBI is probing allegations that AI, with only a slender profit of Rs 100 crore to show on its books, simply did not have the capacity to purchase even a few aircraft and immediately went into huge losses on account of that decision—now mounted to tens of thousands of crores. “The decision benefited foreign aircraft manufacturers and caused loss to national carriers,” it says. The CAG report had also red-flagged the purchases, saying the “acquisition appears to be supply-driven”. Since the entire acquisition was to be funded through debt (to be repaid through revenue generation), except for a relatively small equity infusion of Rs 325 crore for IA, “this was a recipe for disaster ab initio and should have raised alarm signals in MoCA, PIB (Public Investment Board) and the Planning Commission,” it said. No alarm bells rang. In fact, all bodies with a regulatory mandate seem to have gone along with the acquisition. Praful, contacted by Outlook, simply reiterates that all decisions were taken “collectively and by multi-tiered processes”. Not bot­hered about the probe, he says it is actually a good move. “There has been speculation for long. It will be good to have an investigation and put the issue to rest.” Advertisement opens in new window “They were all major decisions, consci­ously taken. The purchase order was cle­ared by an empowered group of minist­ers headed by P. Chidambaram and approved by Pranab Mukherjee, and ratified by the cabinet. A sovereign guarantee had to be given by the government for purchase of the aircraft. Not a single decision was mine alone. The decision does not even have my signature. It was signed by Chidambaram,” he says. On AI’s privatisation, Praful says he too had proposed this but then prime minister Manmohan Singh had shot it down saying it must continue as a public undertaking, and even the Left that supported the UPA would not have agreed to it. “I think the government should privatise it if it gets a good buyer,” he says. Former AI executive director Jitender Bhargava, who wrote The Des­cent of Air India, feels the government should not act in haste. “There is no point in harping over a Rs 50,000 crore debt. The assets of AI—and that is excluding its aircraft—would be more than Rs 50,000 crore. It’s still a valued brand. The Maharaja will be valued much higher than Kingfisher,” he says. It has assets, brand value and is a running comp­any. Bhargava says all options should be expl­ored, including putting the company on the stockmarket and making it a public limited company like ITC and Coal India, or debt restructuring by turning part of it into equity and renegotiating terms with banks. “The government must have a hands-off policy with AI; it should be managed professionally keeping commercial interests in mind,” suggests Bhargava. It’s a thought. After all, most business acumen that went into AI was apparently about shoring up the commercial interests of other entities.

Vice Admiral Paul Grosklags explained to the House Armed Services Committee that two tactics had been deployed to deal with the jets' problem of oxygen shortages mid-flight. The Marines' and Navy's short-term plan is to equip T-45 Goshawks with "alerting and protective measures" to ensure pilots can continue their training programs on schedule, the commander said. Secondly, they will try to pin down the exact issue with the On-Board Oxygen Generation Systems (OBOGS). In March, pilot instructors in the service said the planes weren't suitable for flying because of the problems with the OBOGS. Suddenly losing oxygen is, after all, less than optimal for an inexperienced airman learning how to fly at multiple Gs. Nevertheless, the US Navy chose to put the jets back in the air in April after applying some quick fixes, Sputnik reported. Finding and addressing the root of the problem has proven difficult, however. Insufficient oxygen supply aboard the planes "has plagued the service's fleet of T-45s for years now," Sputnik reported. A top Navy official said the service had taken an "unconstrained resources" approach to fixing the jets, but even that hasn't worked. Mechanics from Boeing and the OBOGS manufacturer have been hard at work on fixing the issue. They've also had the full power and expertise of NASA engineers and scientists to contribute to their efforts. To date, the armed forces don't have anything to show for it. What mystifies military personnel is that OBOGS has been used on their Harrier jets without issue. Lt. Gen. Jon Davis remarked in wonder, "It's the same box in the Harrier. It's the same OBOGS box and we don't have a problem in Harriers. So what's different? What is different in the T-45s?" Even more confusing for military leaders is that negative physiological responses are on the rise in the Navy's fleet of Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, as well as in their EA-18 Growlers, too. "The system has worked for 20-plus years," Davis noted. "Something happened." Meanwhile, on Friday, a 55-plane strong fleet of fifth-generation F-35 combat aircraft was grounded after five pilots endured oxygen deprivation incidents. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Raising its previous forecasts for the next two decades, the European aircraft maker also said a slowdown in orders over the past several months did not signal a drop in the market. "The trend is positive," said Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier. Airbus last week had warned it expects slow orders this year and perhaps next year, too, but said it was a normal part of the business cycle. The planemaker predicts the need for 35,000 new planes worth $5.3 trillion over the next two decades, an increase from last year's estimates. "Air travel is remarkably resilient to external shocks and doubles every 15 years," said its chief operating officer for customer relations, John Leahy. "Asia Pacific continues to be an engine for growth, with domestic China to become the world's largest market." The numbers released Friday, as the industry gears up for the Paris Air Show later this month, show a six percent increase from last year's forecasts in terms of numbers of aircraft and a two percent increase in value. Airbus last year already raised its 20 year forecasts, which it publishes each year, as does its US rival Boeing. The number of aircraft worldwide that count over 100 seats should reach more than 40,000 while airline traffic will increase by 4.4 percent per year over the time period, according to the Airbus estimates released Friday. This means hundreds of thousands of new jobs, the planemaker said, estimating the need for 530,000 more pilots and 550,000 new maintenance engineers. The planemaker Friday cited more first time flyers and rising disposable income for air travel as other reasons for its forecast. Emerging markets in China and India as well as other parts of Asia and Latin America are growing nearly twice as fast as North America and Western Europe. Airbus is also hoping the expected demand will feed appetite for its superjumbo jet A380 model. "The A380 is the solution for future traffic growth" said Leahy Friday.

Testing of the Arrow-3 missile system will begin in 2018, the Kodiak Daily Mirror reported (http://bit.ly/2rX3vuM ). The system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Boeing Co., and is co-managed by the Missile Defense Agency and the Israel Missile Defense Organization. It will be part of the five- to six-year, $80.4 million contract between Alaska Aerospace Corporation and the Missile Defense Agency, which was announced last summer, Alaska Aerospace CEO Craig Campbell said. "One of the better places to test is in Alaska, from Kodiak, and we plan to do that next year," Navy Vice Adm. James Syring said. The system is being developed to support Israel's ballistic missile defense system. There are no plans to integrate the missiles into the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. Syring said the system could be used by Israel deter potential missile threats from Iran. Testing of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is also set to take place in Alaska in the summer. This system has been touted as a possible defense against North Korean missiles. ___ Information from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Testing of the Arrow-3 missile system will begin in 2018, the Kodiak Daily Mirror reported (http://bit.ly/2rX3vuM ). The system was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Boeing Co., and is co-managed by the Missile Defense Agency and the Israel Missile Defense Organization. It will be part of the five- to six-year, $80.4 million contract between Alaska Aerospace Corporation and the Missile Defense Agency, which was announced last summer, Alaska Aerospace CEO Craig Campbell said. Latest news videos "One of the better places to test is in Alaska, from Kodiak, and we plan to do that next year," Navy Vice Adm. James Syring said. The system is being developed to support Israel's ballistic missile defense system. There are no plans to integrate the missiles into the U.S. ballistic missile defense system. Syring said the system could be used by Israel deter potential missile threats from Iran. Testing of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system is also set to take place in Alaska in the summer. This system has been touted as a possible defense against North Korean missiles. ___ Information from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The Saturday, June 10 report said that the planes will be delivered in two batches and the first batch will consist of 30 737 passenger planes to be delivered in 2019. This is the second deal between the Chicago-based Boeing and an Iranian airliner since a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers went into practice in 2016. In December Iran Air, the country’s flag carrier, finalized a $16.6 billion deal with Boeing to purchase 80 passenger planes. In September, Washington granted permission to Boeing and its European competitor Airbus to sell billions of dollars worth of aircraft to Iran. Related links: AP.

She had been told that NASA would call May 25 to tell her whether she had made the final cut among 18,300 applicants for the 12 positions as an astronaut candidate. Barron, a Navy lieutenant who considers Richland her hometown, was at work at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., where she’s the flag aide to the academy’s superintendent. It was the busy graduation and commissioning week. She looked down at her phone at 12:04 p.m. and saw a missed call from the Johnson Space Center in Houston at 12:03 p.m. “I had a very tense hour waiting for them to call me back,” she said. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced Wednesday that Barron, 29, a 2006 graduate of Richland High School, was picked for two years of astronaut candidate training. Barron is looking forward to the aviation training she will receive in the T-38 jet trainer. The jets make pilots and mission specialists think quickly in changing situations, which is critical practice for the rigors of space flight, according to NASA. She’s also excited about space walk training underwater at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, which simulates conditions close to the weightlessness of space. The training that makes her a little nervous? Learning Russian. “I’m not a big linguist,” she said. “That part is a little intimidating.” NASA has a strong relationship with the Russian space program, including depending on the Russian spacecraft Soyuz to carry American astronauts to the International Space Station. After Barron finishes training, she expects to be assigned to contribute to a team supporting astronauts. She became interested in working for NASA as she worked at the Naval Academy, meeting graduates who served in the astronaut office, she said. During the application process, she traveled to the Johnson Space Center twice and met engineers, scientists and technicians who support astronauts in space, she said. It likely will be several years before she can expect to be assigned to a mission, she said. She’s been told it could be on the Soyuz or on rockets and space capsules under development. NASA is partnering with Boeing and SpaceX to take astronauts into space on rockets they are building. NASA also is developing the Orion spacecraft. Vice President Mike Pence mentioned the possibility of travel to Mars at the ceremony introducing the new candidates in Houston. “It is absolutely appealing to everyone down here at the Johnson Space Center,” Barron said. “It appeals to our sense of adventure and everyone is excited to push the envelope of what NASA has done before and move on deeper into the solar system.” Barron will continue serving as a naval officer during her NASA career. She graduated from the academy with a systems engineering degree and also has a nuclear engineering masters. She served on the USS Maine submarine as the first class of women commissioned to be a submarine officer. She credits the support she received growing up in Richland with helping her launch her career, including her teammates, coaches and teachers at Richland High. The daughter of Scott and Lauri Sax, she ran cross country and track and played basketball for three years. She gave a specific shout out to her Richland High chemistry teacher, Reed Spencer. His advanced placement chemistry class was tough. “But he had a way of making concepts understandable and teaching us no matter how complicated a subject was, there was a way to understand it,” Barron said. Spencer helped inspire her to study engineering, building on her passion for math and science. “I wouldn’t be here without the amazing community who taught me to chase my dream and be confident and go out there and do the best that I could,” Barron said.

Dr Juliet Dinkha, Chair of ABCK, welcomed the guests to the Election Night and recapped for the guests how busy and active the ABCK has been the past year and the drive to further grow ABCK in the community.  Dr. Dinkha introduced Oswaldo Rueda, Nominating Chair and Vice Chair of ABCK, who introduced the candidates. Each candidate had 3 minutes to tell the members about what they would bring to the board of ABCK. All of the candidates gave very fervent speeches and it made the choice for the members very tough. It was a very close election and the final selections for the board of directors are: Hasan AlMatrouk of Jadeite Group, Jared Willis of Berkeley Research Group, Najmah Brown of Al-Adwani Law Firm and Pete Swift of KGL. Then the current board of directors voted on the corporate members of the board of directors and selected AIG, Boeing, Fluor, Honeywell, and Raytheon for the board for 2017-2019. The Officers of the Board of Directors for 2017 – 2018 were selected by the new board and they are: Dr Juliet Dinkha, Chair; Oswaldo Rueda, Vice Chair; Alok Chugh, Treasurer; Hasan AlMatrouk, Secretary. Dr Dinkha thanked the board of 2016-2017 for all of their work and commitment in achieving the goals of the ABCK. It was also a very special night because ABCK said good-bye to Joey Hood, Charge d’Affaires at the US. Embassy in Kuwait. Joey has been a very strong supporter of ABCK during his three years in Kuwait. Joey thanked ABCK for their role that they play in the community to help grow American businesses in Kuwait and the many events and activities that they do to support the business community. Dr Dinkha stated that the event would not have been possible without the support of ABCK’s sponsors: Boeing as Platinum Sponsor, KGL as Silver Sponsor and Marafie Kuwait as Bronze Sponsor.

Purporting to reveal "hundreds of documents from an anonymous source within the White House," the Pentagon-Papers-like fake trove covers over 20 categories of files in boisterous, excruciating detail, incorporating executive orders, secret recordings, classified briefings, CIA reports, communications between staff and family, children's letters to the president, and musings on knotty security issues, like where did all these lighthouses come from anyway? They range from Trump's secret demands to Boeing for the design of Air Force One - marble everywhere - and Pence's daily schedule - brisk jog through Stations of the Cross, look out the window for the Rapture - to Ivanka's instructions for putting little Donny to bed, Applebee's color-by-number kids' placemats to help him find North Korea, and the executive order allowing Bannon to execute him when none of us can take it any longer.

CHAMPAIGN — The Champaign Public Library is taking its "The Sky's the Limit" summer-reading program to extremes with a new exhibition opening this weekend. "The NASA Space Exhibit," to be unveiled Sunday, will feature 18 objects from NASA displayed at nine stations throughout the library, rather than gathered in one spot. "We want people to be able to move through the library and explore it, and it's an excellent way to do that," said events intern Emily Hoch. The highlight among the NASA objects most certainly will be a fist-sized "moon rock" from the 12-pounder collected by astronauts on the Apollo 16 mission in 1972. "People's eyes light up when they hear about the moon rock," said Evelyn Shapiro, promotions manager for the library. The moon rock is being kept secure in a locked safe at the library until it is put on display near the children's services desk on the first floor. The NASA objects on view through Aug. 11 are not part of a traveling NASA exhibit. "We're borrowing a set of objects that were available this summer that fit with our theme," Shapiro said. "They were not sent to us as a complete exhibit. It's not an off-the-shelf NASA exhibit." Upon entering the library, visitors will be able to pick up a self-guided tour of the NASA objects — most will be under clear plastic cases. Among them: — A spacesuit, which will be uncovered. — The Solar System Scale. People may weigh themselves on the scale to see how much they would weigh on the moon and the planets. (Pluto remains listed among them.) "Already, it's my favorite object in the show," Shapiro said. "It just gets your imagination going." "It's a fun, interactive experience, and it contextualizes how things are different in space," Hoch said. — Another interactive piece: a life-size cardboard depiction of an astronaut in a spacesuit, with the face empty so people may pose behind it for photographs. — To-scale models of space vehicles such as the Mercury-Atlas, Gemini-Titan II, space shuttle, a Boeing V-22 Osprey and Mars Exploration Rover. — A real (Michelin) space shuttle tire. It's huge. "They can use them only once because of the weight and the speed that the shuttle comes in on to land," Hoch said. — NASA posters. Because they are text-heavy, they will be on display in the adult section on the second floor of the library. The solar eclipse coming up Aug. 21 helped inspire this summer's theme. The library will have eclipse-related programs through the summer, including on Aug. 21. The library will open its "NASA Space Exhibit" with a "launch party" at 3 p.m. Sunday, following a 2 p.m. concert by Amasong, Champaign-Urbana's Premier Lesbian/Feminist Chorus. The library commissioned musician David Howie to write a children's song for the party. He will perform "Moon Rock," plus other moon-related songs, from 3 to 3:30 p.m. on the front porch of the library. As part of its summer reading program, the library also has space-related books on display and will give away space-related prizes to children and adults, among them a telescope valued at $400. "We're having fun with this," Shapiro said. "We're going to satisfy people's curiosity."
