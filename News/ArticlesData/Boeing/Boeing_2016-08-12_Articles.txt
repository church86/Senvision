Pages Home About Contact Commercial Aviation Defense Space Privacy Policy Disclaimer Saturday, August 13, 2016 USAF approve KC-46A tanker production U.S. Air Force approved production of its newest strategic tanker aircraft- the Boeing KC-46A Pegasus, after successfully completing several aerial refueling demonstrations. KC-46 refuels a A-10 aircraft using the boom The Milestone C approval was granted by Frank Kendall, the under secretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics. The USAF will soon award the first two low rate initial production contracts to Boeing, totaling 19 aircraft, and associated spare parts for a pre-negotiated $2.8 billion combined value. The approval was granted after successful aerial refueling demonstrations of multiple platforms operated by USAF, to include refueling an F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter, C-17 Globemaster III airlifter and A-10 Thunderbolt II off the boom, and an AV-8 Harriar II and F/A-18 Hornet off both hose and drogue systems. The KC-46 also proved its receiver capability by taking fuel from a KC-10 Extender tanker. Some demonstrations were delayed due to higher than expected axial loads in the boom. Boeing installed hydraulic pressure relief valves to alleviate loads and last month all remaining demonstrations were quickly completed. The first aircraft deliveries will be to McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas, and Altus AFB, Oklahoma. A total of 18 tankers are scheduled to be delivered by early 2018. The Pegasus is based on a Boeing 767 commercial jet platform and can also configured to carry passengers, cargo and patients. It will replace the ageing fleet of KC-135 tankers, which first entered USAF service in 1956. The tanker can offload 212,299 lbs (96,265 kg) of fuel through its centerline boom and two wing-mounted hose and drogue systems. A total of 179 KC-46 aircraft will be built for the Air Force.

Consider the following analysis. Low Orders Are Not Indicative Of Possible Peril: As of the latest quarter, Boeing’s commercial business had a robust backlog of about $472 billion with close to 5,700 orders in the pipeline. The company can also count  on the $55 billion backlog at Defense, Space & Security. [1] This means that, at the current rate of production, the company can continue uninterrupted production for the next 7 years. So far in the year, Boeing has secured only 334 orders. [2] But one must not fret as history has proven that airline orders are cyclical in nature. Relevant Articles Boeing: Will The Iran Deal Be Successful? What Lies Ahead For Boeing? Why We Revised Our Price Estimate For Boeing Downwards What Can We Expect From Boeing Under Trump’s Presidency Boeing Q3 Earnings: Earnings Beat As Future Seems Clearer What Can We Expect From Boeing’s Q3 Earnings? What has happened is that with fuel prices so low, airlines can afford to wait on buying new planes. Unless the world spirals into recession, we can expect the orders to bounce back within the next five years. For instance, orders for the 787 Dreamliner has slowed for the third year in a row. That said, CEO Dennis Muilenberg has confirmed that delivery slots for the 787 in 2018 are fully assigned. Furthermore, for 2019 and 2020, delivery slots are almost 75% full at the current production rate. With so many delivery slots open after 2020, airlines need not place orders immediately. This indicates that we can expect deliveries to pick up in the next few years as old planes will need retiring. Until then, the heavy backlog can help sustain operations. [3] Additionally, let’s not forget that Airbus (Boeing’s main rival) is also pretty much in the same boat as Boeing. While Boeing orders are down 8.4% year over year, Airbus orders are down 8.6% year over year. [4] The 737 Is A Clear Winner: The 737 is seeing increasing demand with every quarter. Since the introduction of the 737 MAX, the model has bagged close to 3,200 firm orders. The aircraft is powered by the newly designed CFM International LEAP-1B high-bypass turbofan engines that are 20% more fuel efficient. Currently, the program has a strong backlog of 4,400 orders. The company has revealed that due to the high demand, the production for the aircraft will be heavily ramped up and the entry into service will be accelerated. [5] Boeing is on track to increase production of the 737 from the current 42 per month to approximately 47 in 2017. Additionally, the company plans to push production to a further 52 per month in 2018 and then 57 per month in 2019. This esteemed airframe is generating significant demand, as per our calculations, even at the 2019 production rate, the program will continue to remain oversold. Business At Defense, Space & Security Could See Increased Demand: Boeing has seen good demand for all defense programs in the year so far. Not accounting for the one-time charge on the KC-40A tanker program, the company has performed solidly in the last quarter. As mentioned previously, the defense segment boasts of a $55 billion backlog, 37% of which is from international customers. Domestically, the Obama administration’s budget request for FY 2017 highlights advances in key BDS programs. The company anticipates a period of modest growth in defense spending over the next five years. Additionally, most technical glitches on the KC-46A tanker have been mended. Unless Boeing runs into more problems into the fuel tanker program, we expect the company to move on to low-rate initial production (LRIP) despite the delays and recurring cost overruns (paid for by Boeing). [6] In conclusion, we can say that Boeing is far from doomed as can be seen from its robust order backlog, and the heavy demand in the 737 program and Defense, Space and Security segment.

Frank Kendall, the Pentagon’s acquisition head, declared the program has successfully cleared Milestone C review late Friday. The Air Force expects to award the first two Low Rate Initial Production lots within the next 30 days. Those contracts will cover 19 and associated spare parts, for a pre-negotiated $2.8 billion combined value. "The KC-46 is ready to take the next step," Gen. Dave Goldfein, Air Force Chief of Staff, said in a service release. "Our Air Force and Boeing team stepped up to meet the recent challenges.  I'm especially proud of the employees on the floor of the Boeing plant, and employees of all our industry partners, who work every day to deliver game-changing capability to the warfighter.  My hat's off to them and our program leads."  As part of the Milestone C requirements, the KC-46 had to prove it could refuel an F-16, C-17, and A-10 off of its boom, as well as use the hose and drogue systems on an AV-8 and F/A-18. The KC-46 also had to take in fuel from a KC-10. Those tests were delayed, however, after the discovery that the KC-46 boom struggled to deliver fuel to heavier aircraft such as the C-17. While Boeing was able to design a bypass to help better regulate the fuel flow, that problem contributed to a delay that pushed a Milestone C decision from June to August, and the delivery of the first 18 certified tankers to the Air Force from August 2017 to January 2018. Boeing is operating under a development contract that caps taxpayer costs at $4.9 billion, and the company has already taken $1.9 billion in pre-tax charges due to cost overruns. Entering the production stage is the first step towards recouping some of those losses. The Air Force plans to procure 179 KC-46A models over the life of the program. The service has long-term plans for KC-Y and KC-Z programs, which Boeing hopes to secure as additional buys of the KC-46. "Production approval is an important, positive step for the program and the Boeing/Air Force team has worked extremely hard to get to this point," a Boeing spokesman said in a statement. ?We expect the first low-rate initial production contract to follow shortly, and look forward to continuing our progress building the world's most capable tanker."

November 23, 2016 0751 GMT Home Iran Africa Asia Europe International U.S. Middle East Culture Business Health Sport Society Video News ID:166772 Publish Date: Sat, 13 Aug 2016 18:54:50 GMT Service: Iran Minister: Boeing reps in Iran for jet sales Boeing representatives are currently in Tehran, discussing the US plane maker's planned sale of commercial aircraft to Iran, Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi said on Saturday. “Right now, Boeing representatives including three financial, legal and technical groups are in Tehran and negotiating” the sale of jetliners to Iran, Akhoundi said in remarks carried out by Tasnim News Agency. Those negotiations with Airbus have concluded and the two sides were waiting for the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to issue a license for the purchase to go ahead, he added. The two aviation rivals have signed initial accords with the flag carrier Iran Air to sell about 200 aircraft worth more than $50 billion to the country which is seeking to renovate its aging fleet after decades of sanctions. However, they are facing stiff opposition from pro-Israeli members of US Congress who are seeking to block the planned sales. The lawmakers plan to debate a raft of measures, including one that would prohibit the US Treasury from licensing the sales. US President Barack Obama and his allies are expected to oppose the legislation, but if the bills are written into law, they would prevent other firms from selling aircraft to Iran as well. US equipment allegedly accounts for more than 10% of the content used in almost all modern jets, requiring export licenses from the American government for any contract to be implemented. Akhoundi expected deliveries by Airbus to start in the Iranian month of Aban which begins on October 22 if OFAC issues a license within the next two or three weeks. “As for Airbus, all technical, contractual and financial negotiations have finished and we are waiting for OFAC’s license in which case all work will be wrapped up in time,” he said. “Everything depends on this license and politicians are saying that OFAC’s licenses for Airbus and Boeing are interrelated,” Akhoundi added in remarks quoted by the Tasnim News Agency. As regards Airbus, most of the technical specifications have ended and only the time of the authorization remains to be announced by OFAC, the minister said. Iran Air agreed in January to buy 118 jets worth $27 billion at list prices from Airbus. Another MoU was signed in June, calling for Boeing to sell a total of 80 aircraft to Iran and help the country lease a further 29 in a deal worth $25 billion. Boeing has proposed to sell its 737, 777 and 787 models and promised after-sales support, according to Iranian officials who have said the country needs as many as 500 jets for its fleet. Iran’s current civil aviation fleet consists of 248 aircraft with an average age of 20 years, of which 100 are grounded. Some media reports have said US Treasury might be putting off its decision on the sales until after the Nov. 8 presidential election in the US, where both Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican candidate Donald Trump are stalwart supporters of Israel. Amid those speculations, Iranian carriers have begun talks with Canada's Bombardier and Brazil’s Embraer as well as Japan's Mitsubishi Aircraft for its regional passenger jet currently under development.  China’s single-aisle C919 airliner which rolled off the assembly line last November is another option, but neither choice is without hurdles. While none of the companies has an aircraft for delivery in its inventory, both rely on the US and Europe for key parts in their manufacturing.         KeyWords Boeing Iran sales   Comments Comment Name: Email: Comment: Security Key: Latest News Slovenia reopens embassy in Iran’s capital after nearly four years KNVB president visits Iran’s Football Academy Iran-Indonesia economic commission to meet today NISOC, Pergas Consortium sign oil deals Bank Pasargad elected ABA board member Iran to buy new fighter jets to boost defense capabilities: Senior commander Armenian Ambassador: Yerevan interested in AFZ investment Italian minister supports trade deals with Iran Iran to hold tender for Azadegan oilfield development US grants second Airbus license to sell planes to Iran Most Visited Obama vows to veto bill seeking to block Iran plane sales US House renews sanctions on Iran, sets sanctions on Syria Trump not going to ‘hurt’ Clinton www.irandailyonline.com All rights reserved by iran Daily Online Copyright Page Generated in 0/3513 sec

Over the next two years, NASA will work with six companies to produce prototypes for deep space habitats. Among the collaborators are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Bigelow. Boeing is also working with NASA on the SLS, and Bigelow recently sent up the BEAM inflatable space hab module to the ISS. NASA and CubeSats are really a thing lately. They’re Facebook official. NASA’s Dellingr satellite, named for the Norse god of the dawn, launched this week to study the Earth’s atmosphere and mind its weather patterns. Dellingr is a 6U CubeSat, which makes it about the size of a cereal box. It’s a really powerful cereal box, with a magnetometer and a tiny mass spec. Credit: NASA NASA’s work with Lockheed is also giving NASA a chance to wedge in a little CubeSat science around the edges of the Orion mission. The connector ring that links Orion to the rocket is built with 13 bays for CubeSats. Lockheed is sending up a 6U CubeSat named SkyFire, which has a sweet new thin-and-light infrared camera as part of its science package. For the low, low price of a ride to space, NASA gets a bunch of data out of the SkyFire mission. Skyfire. Credit: Lockheed Martin Also from NASA’s R&D elite: work on the new SLS rocket engine led to the development of a high-dynamic-range (HDR) camera called, in their usual imaginative style, HiDyRS-X. It’s capable of balancing exposure between the incredibly bright plume of fire coming out of a rocket engine, and the comparatively cool, dim metal of the engine itself. This is what it sees when it looks at an SLS test burn: Top panel: without HiDyRS-X. Bottom panel: with HiDyRS-X. Images: NASA Elsewhere in the universe… It’s not too late to catch the Perseids! They peak in about a five-day window centered around the wee morning hours of August 12th this year, so there’s still time to catch the tail end of this year’s meteor shower. Your best chance to see a fireball is after the waxing moon sets, but before dawn begins to break. It’s even cooler if you think about it in 3D: the meteor shower is actually us passing through the enormous network of debris trails left in the orbital wake of the comet Swift-Tuttle. Perseid Meteors Over Ontario. Image Credit: Darryl Van Gaal (via NASA) Researchers sifted through Kepler’s entire catalog and found twenty rocky exoplanets that really beg for further observation. Based on size, composition and distance from their host star, we think they’re the most like Earth of any we’ve found yet: temperate, rocky planets with liquid water, orbiting Sun-like stars. Speaking of Kepler’s recent exploits, researchers discovered that the “alien megastructure star” is dimming, and we don’t know why. None of the natural mechanisms scientists have presented can completely explain the way this star’s light output is dropping over time at a non-linear rate: it’s not a planet, and it’s not behaving like it should if it’s going to explode. We’ve observed fluctuations in brightness of up to 20%, along with a gradual dimming across years. What could possibly be going on? My favorite hypothesis is that it’s a Dyson sphere, à la Pandora’s Star… Tagged In space nasa kepler solar system lockheed martin this week in space cubesats perseids Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Newsletter Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

This week Nasa named its six partners for developing crafts to house a human crew in deep space. Concept habitats will be built here on Earth, to help the space agency gain a better insight into the needs and opportunities for extensive manned missions around the moon and beyond.  Nasa has named its six partners for developing crafts house a human crew in deep space. Included in the mix is a design from Bigelow Aerospace (illustrated is its XBASE module docking with the International Space Station), the Nevada-based firm behind the inflatable pod recently installed on the International Space Station Nasa has released artists' impressions from its six contenders, which come from well-established aerospace firms already working with space agencies on satellite and probe technology. Included in the mix is Bigelow Aerospace, the Nevada-based firm behind the inflatable pod recently installed on the International Space Station, as well as long standing partners Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

Share this article Share The partnerships are part of Nasa's 'NextSTEP' programme, which will see a mix of private and public expertise and resources combined to push the existing boundaries of manned space exploration, initially testing a manned habitat near the moon as a testing ground for Mars and beyond. ‘The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit,’ said Jason Crusan, Nasa’s director of Advanced Exploration Systems. Boeing Aerospace's design for a habitation module illustrates the interior.  The partnerships are part of Nasa's 'NextSTEP' programme, which will see a mix of private and public expertise and resources combined to push the existing boundaries of manned space exploration DESIGNS FOR DEEP SPACE HABITATS Nasa has put out the call for design proposals for deep space habitats which astronauts will call home on the long-haul journeys.  For manned missions to Mars and beyond astronauts will need a safe and relatively comfortable space to live for deep space missions. The outbound leg of a trip to Mars could take anywhere from 150 to 300 days, depending on the positions of the planets, so the crew will need room to stretch their legs and enough shielding to protect them from high levels of DNA-shredding radiation. The rise of private space ventures, such as Space X and Bigelow Aerospace, is opening up space exploration to collaborations which marry the expertise of state agencies with the business drive of the private sector. Earlier this year, Crusan highlighted the importance of collaboration in pushing the boundaries of space exploration. He said: 'Nasa is increasingly embracing public-private partnerships to expand capabilities, and opportunities in space.'  All of the habitat designs incorporate the same core components, including a pressurised space for the crew to live, along with environmental control and life support systems.  They will also include propulsion technology, docking capability as well as sufficient radiation shielding, to protect the crew inside from the harsh environment of space. Building prototypes on the ground will enable extensive testing and provide Nasa and its partners crucial data on how the various systems interact. Lockheed Martin is working on a prototype of a refurbished logistics module (pictured), the general purpose modules used to deliver cargo to the ISS. The concept artwork illustrates an air lock hatch through which the crew can access the exterior to carry out maintenance work Another of the partners, Orbital ATK, will continue development of a habitat based on its unmanned Cygnus spacecraft (illustrated), which has also made successful delivery runs to the ISS  Boeing will develop a modular habitat based on the firm’s experience gathered from working on the ISS for more than 15 years.  The full-scale prototype will be built on the ground to test the systems and the suitability as a habitat for astronauts for extended periods. A second approach will see Lockheed Martin refurbish a multi-purpose logistics module, similar to the ones which carry cargo to the space station, while Orbital ATK will continue development of a habitat based on its unmanned Cygnus spacecraft, which has also made successful delivery runs to the ISS. Sierra Nevada Corporation plans to use its Dream Chaser spacecraft along with an inflatable module, testing all systems together (illustrated)  One of the partners is basing its prototype of a low-Earth orbit plane to transport up to seven passengers.  Sierra Nevada Corporation plans to use its Dream Chaser spacecraft along with an inflatable module, testing all systems together. The inflatable approach is already being tested in space, with Bigelow’s expandable BEAM habitat installed aboard the space station.  The firm aims to expand on this success further with an even larger 330 cubic metre pod called the XBase. The final partner is the Ixion Team, a conglomerate of three small aerospace space firms which will look at converting a rocket’s launch stage into a pressurised habitat.  Ixion Team is a conglomerate of three small aerospace space firms which will look at converting a rocket’s launch stage into a pressurised habitat (illustrated) more videos 1 2 3 Watch video Touching commercial shows family waking up with tiger in home Watch video Justin Bieber leaves fan bloodied after throwing a punch Watch video Strip club performs the Mannequin Challenge with customers Watch video Chrissy Teigen's underwear-free American Music Awards look Watch video Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Watch video Disgusting moment man squeezes ingrown hair on his friend's back Watch video Middle-aged man's sad step-by-step guide to microwave meal Watch video Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Watch video PBS special explores USS Arizona 75 years after Pearl Harbor Watch video Breastmilk champion shares tandem feeding with her two sons Watch video Embarassed Prince Harry turns down dance in Antigua Watch video President Obama awards his last Presidential Medals of Freedom Share or comment on this article e-mail 175 shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation The moment a 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Fukushima Kanye West hospitalized 'for his own health and safety' Six rebel electors have signed an agreement to try to block...

Domestic flights for national carrier Garuda began operating in the morning from Soekarno-Hatta airport's steel and glass $560 million Terminal 3. Its international flights will shift to the new terminal next month. Other airlines will gradually move their flights to the terminal and the airport company plans to start refurbishing two old terminals, built in 1984 and 1992, later this year. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 250 million people, is one of world's fastest growing air travel markets. But many international airlines bypass the capital Jakarta in favor of modern, high-capacity airports at Bangkok, Singapore or Kuala Lumpur for their Southeast Asian stopovers. Passengers wait for their flights on the first day of operation of the new terminal of Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Tangerang near Jakarta on Aug. 9, 2016. The Indonesian capital's airport opened its $560 million, steel and glass Terminal 3 Tuesday after years of operating at far above its passenger capacity.  (Photo: Tatan Syuflana, AP) The airport operator and government hopes the new terminal, and a third runway that is under development, will change that. Budi Karya Sumadi, Indonesia's transport minister and former president of the airport company, said "this terminal was built to change the image of the capital Jakarta." Soekarno-Hatta airport will be able to handle 62 million passengers a year once the renovated terminals are fully operational again in early 2018. The airport handled about 54 million passengers last year, making it the 18th busiest in the world, according to Airports Council International. An electric train from the airport to the city is slated for completion in early 2017.

Speaking in her first interview, Linda Candler, who was an international affairs prosecutor with the Justice Department at the time of the crash that claimed 520 lives, said she persuaded Boeing to submit its repair team to voluntary written questioning by Japanese authorities. “Look, the Justice Department is supporting this request,” Candler recalls telling Boeing. “We are prepared to go to court, to get a court order, to seek answers from Boeing, in response to those questions. I’m hoping that won’t be necessary. I am asking for your cooperation,” she said. “And they agreed.” Candler, currently a California attorney, was speaking ahead of the 31st anniversary Friday of what remains the world’s deadliest single-aircraft accident. JAL Flight 123, a Boeing 747 bound for Osaka with 524 passengers and crew, crashed into the Osutaka Ridge in Gunma Prefecture after suffering an explosive decompression. Only four survived. In 1987, a Japanese government investigation panel concluded the accident was caused by improper repairs that Boeing conducted on the pressure bulkhead, a problem JAL did not detect in maintenance checks. While Japanese prosecutors sought to question and charge Boeing workers with professional negligence, it was difficult to do so because of the U.S. legal system’s tendency not to charge people for acts committed unintentionally. The two countries had no mutual treaty for criminal investigation cooperation, meaning the United States was not obliged to assist Japanese authorities with their probe. But the U.S. government eventually agreed to ask Boeing to cooperate, resulting in written questions being sent to more than 40 people who were involved in a faulty repair that was made in 1978 after the same plane sustained damage from a hard landing when its tail struck the runway at Osaka airport. “This was not my decision, personally,” Candler said. “This was a decision that the Department of Justice made, together in cooperation with the Japanese. And we decided to cooperate and seek assistance from Boeing to the extent possible. We would see if we could assist even though there was no treaty and there was no requirement that we provide assistance.” “It was a very important case, and the Japanese people were looking for answers. If we could help with that, I was happy to help. I argued strongly that we should assist, if we could,” she said. In 1988, the Gunma Prefectural Police referred papers on 20 people, including four Boeing employees, to prosecutors on suspicion of professional negligence. The Maebashi District Prosecutor’s Office, which covers the prefecture, tried to charge everyone on the list, including 16 people from JAL and the Japanese transport ministry. Japanese prosecutors traveled to Washington in May 1989 to negotiate for face-to-face questioning of the Boeing employees, according to sources in the U.S. and Japanese governments and at Boeing. After the attempt hit a snag, however, the Japanese changed tack to seek written questioning and managed to secure it with U.S. government help, with one source saying the Americans took an “uncommon step” in Japan’s favor. This contrasts with a 1976 investigation in which Japanese prosecutors had asked the U.S. side to interview Carl Kotchian, vice chairman of Lockheed Corp., in connection with a bribery scandal over which former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka would be arrested. The interview via U.S. judge as proxy was allowed in return for immunity for Kotchian, a deal the Japanese accepted to get to Tanaka, who for them was the more important target. In the JAL case, however, it wasn’t an option to grant immunity to Boeing workers because Japan considered the company’s responsibility to be greater than that of the Japanese inspectors who failed to detect Boeing’s faulty repair. Under Japanese law, people can be punished for professional negligence. But such cases are commonly treated as civil lawsuits in the United States, and the general view is that punishing individuals for an unintentional mistake cannot contribute to preventing aviation accidents, according to former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board official Ron Schleede, who investigated the accident in Japan. Of this Candler said: “I think you have to respect each country’s judicial system. But I can’t really second-guess it. Every country has its own laws and offenses and prosecutions based on different statutes, and you can’t really say what U.S. law allows is better or worse than what Japanese law allows.” As for the lingering argument in Japan that the U.S. government secretly assisted Boeing in view of its importance to U.S. industry, Candler unequivocally denied it. “Absolutely wrong,” Candler said. “To my knowledge, Boeing never came to the Justice Department and asked for any kind of special treatment.” Former officials familiar with the investigation said the questionnaires yielded no answers because the Boeing workers refused to cooperate fully. In 1989, Japanese prosecutors officially dropped the case concerning all 20 people, including one from the Japanese transport ministry who committed suicide.

Here's how these two peas in a pod are using Azure data technologies to make commercial flights more efficient and even (gasp!) more pleasant. By Andrew Brust for Big on Data | August 11, 2016 -- 13:00 GMT (06:00 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Boeing 787 Dreamliner Last month, in a keynote at the Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference (WPC), Microsoft demonstrated on stage how Japan Airlines is using HoloLens to improve the technician training experience, bringing jet engines to life in 3D, hologram-based augmented reality. Neat stuff. read this Delta outage highlights how airline industry needs new IT approaches The airline industry is plagued by legacy systems and single points of IT failure. How'd we get here? Mergers, bankruptcy restructurings, and falling behind the cloud curve. Read More But a week after WPC, Microsoft announced that it and Boeing are partnering around Azure and data. I wanted to know more about that. Given that commercial airplanes are described by some as "flying data centers" and considering the number of inefficiencies that exist in commercial air travel today (just ask anyone who flies more than once a year), the potential for analytics in commercial aviation seems immense, and so do the potential benefits. Talking to both companies I asked Microsoft if I could learn more and the company was kind enough to set me up to speak with Andrew Gendreau, the director of advanced information solutions in Boeing's Digital Aviation division, and Greg Jones, Microsoft's global industry director for travel & hospitality. Although we only had a short time to speak, I found out a lot. For one thing, Microsoft and Boeing already had a partnership in place and have already worked together using Microsoft's application development stack, especially its tools for mobile applications. One output of that collaboration: tablet-based Electronic Flight Bag software that replaces paper-based flight bags, containing books and documents, often weighing as much as 40 lbs! Predictive Examples Under the existing partnership, things like Maintenance Optimization, Crew Planning, and Crew Training were already being addressed. Fuel optimization was in motion as well, and it's fascinating. By observing fuel usage over all of its flights, an airline can build predictive models which predict fuel usage needs over time. These models can account for the idiosyncrasies of certain routes (and their typical air traffic delays), seasonal anomalies, equipment, passenger load, and so forth. These models can then be used to drive policy, performance targets, financial aspects of fuel procurement (potentially including hedging strategies), and the necessary change management to make all of these procedures and systems work better. All in But now the two companies are moving beyond these specific initiatives, with an eye towards a thorough re-platforming that would build and host all efficiency applications on Azure. The scope of this is huge, and it benefits not just the airlines, but passengers too. Have you been on a flight that seemed to be running on-time only to encounter a maintenance issue at the last minute? Ever waited for the part and the technician to arrive and fix the problem or, worse yet, have to deplane and switch aircraft? When such things happen, it infuriates passengers. It's also expensive and disruptive to the airline -- the delays are costly and the impact on flight crews' morale and performance is non-trivial. Multiple contingencies, in model form The good news is that predictive models can help here, in many ways. Predictive maintenance can avoid operational maintenance incidents overall. And where they can't do that for specific aircraft, they can still assist greatly in making sure the right parts and personnel are on-call, in the locations where such issues are most likely. Special Feature Cloud: How to Do SaaS Right Software as a Service offers irresistible benefits for organizations of all sizes — from cost savings to scalability to mobile accessibility. We offer guidance on avoiding the pitfalls of the cloud and choosing your SaaS partners well. Read More This overall discipline is called (I kid you not) "disruption management" and encompasses things such as schedule execution, equipment utilization optimization, and performance of crew. Another important component of this work is determining the optimal set of actions required to mitigate outages and equipment failures. These outages include not just the aircraft and its navigational components but hardware and services in support of the customer journey, including things like climate control, overhead lights, and the in-flight video system. All together Of course, all of these services are delivered by the airlines (or "operators") and not Boeing, per se. But in addition to manufacturing aircraft, Boeing offers management systems for these operational needs to its airline customers. As Microsoft builds out its data cloud with services like Azure Machine Learning, HDInsight (with Spark and R), Azure IoT Suite, and Power BI, Boeing thinks it's got a full-on platform on which it can standardize. Microsoft is a database company, an enterprise software company, and a cloud computing company. It seems that combination is exactly what a company like Boeing needs as it establishes such a wide-ranging partnership.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured NASA asks Lockheed Martin, 5 others to develop habitats for Mars mission By Zeba Anwer - 13/08/2016 NASA: NASA has selected Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems and NanoRacks for development of Mars habitats NASA has asked six US companies to develop concepts for the design of space habitats for future deep space missions including manned missions to Mars. The habitat will help man to survive the hazards of space travel including radiation and other threats which will be encountered during such long journey in deep space. Jason Crusan, chief of NASA Advanced Exploration Systems said that NASA is embarking on a futuristic and ambitious journey to Mars, and the full potential of the private and government sectors will be used in this endeavor. The next odyssey into deep space will essentially involve Space Launch System and Orion capsules, which are being designed for deep space journeys involving long-duration habitation and in-space propulsion. The selected corporations include Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, Boeing and Bigelow Aerospace. The corporations have been given 24 months to develop ground prototypes and conduct concepts for deep space habitats. The process will cost about $65 million and will finance work in 2016 and 2017. The selected parties will be asked to contribute 30% of the total cost of the project. The ground prototypes will then go through a tough evaluation process which includes testing the different supporting integrated systems, human factors, and operation testing to help define the functioning of the overall system. The tests are crucial for setting design standards, common interfaces and requirements and reducing the risk factors for the final flight which will happen in the end. The step is a part of a process to involve private commercial investment in the low earth orbit for operational deep space habitation capabilities for missions to the Moon which will be used as a springboard for missions to Mars during the 2020’s.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor NextSTEP-2 companies to develop deep space habitat prototypes Derek Richardson August 13th, 2016 NASA selected six companies to design and develop prototype deep space habitats to be used sometime in the future as part of the agency’s journey to Mars. Image Credit: NASA Earlier this week, NASA selected six U.S. companies to develop deep space habitat ground prototypes under the second Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement. The goal of these partnerships is to advance commercial development of space while supporting human spaceflight missions to beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO). The six companies selected are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), and NanoRacks. According to NASA, each company will have up to 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The agency has estimated the total cost of NextSTEP-2 will be around $65 million over the next two years. Specific amounts awarded to each company will be dependent on contract negotiations. However, each partner is expected to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors, said Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long-duration habitation, and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The habitat prototypes developed must integrate systems and components that include a docking capability, environmental control and life support systems, logistics management, radiation mitigation and monitoring, fire safety technologies, and crew health capabilities. The ground prototypes the companies will be developing will be used for three main purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. All of this will be done to help define standards, common interfaces, and other requirements as well options for using SLS and Orion as well as commercial spacecraft. Risk reduction for final flight systems is expected to come after this phase. Bigelow Aerospace Image Credit: Bigelow Aerospace Bigelow already has three prototype expandable modules in space: Genesis 1, launched in 2006; Genesis 2, launched in 2007; and the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), launched in early 2016, attached to the International Space Station (ISS). The company will build upon those modules and the work they have already done for their future large modules – the 330 cubic meter B330. Under NextSTEP, Bigelow will develop and test their Expandable Bigelow Advanced Station Enhancement (XBASE). It is essentially a modified version of their B330 design with a specific mission of being attached to the ISS as a visiting vehicle. Boeing Image Credit: Boeing Boeing already has experience in designing, building, and assembling many of the already-in-orbit modules of the ISS. Additionally, the company is developing the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to ferry crews to and from the outpost. Using this experience, the company will produce a full-scale ground prototype that will provide design analysis as well as high fidelity demonstration and test capability. According to NASA, as part of the NextSTEP goals, the demonstrator will test and validate interface standards, systems functionality, and critical exploration technologies. Lockheed Martin Image Credit: Lockheed Martin By refurbishing a multi-purpose logistics module, which the Space Shuttles used to resupply the space station, Lockheed Martin will transform it into a full-scale habitat prototype. It will include integrated avionics and environmental control and life support systems. The company hopes the high-fidelity module will reduce the risk involved in creating a habitat, as this module design has flown in space before. The prototype will also demonstrate data communication can go between the habitat and Orion. Additionally, docking and crew interfaces will be modified to support Orion. Orbital ATK Image Credit: Orbital ATK Orbital ATK is expected to mature the architecture currently utilized on the company’s Cygnus spacecraft that currently services the ISS. Features of the prototype spacecraft will be modified to support testing of critical interfaces with Orion and other modules. Additionally, the Cygnus-derived habitat will be designed for long-term operations in deep space, as opposed to a couple of months in LEO at ISS. Sierra Nevada Corporation Image Credit: Sierra Nevada Corporation Utilizing the design of the cargo module from the company’s in-development Dream Chaser Cargo System, SNC will study and refine a flexible architecture that utilizes three to four commercial launches to construct a small, modular, long-duration habitat. “This program is a perfect opportunity to showcase the heritage of our 25 plus years supporting space missions,” said Mark Sirangelo, vice president of SNC’s Space Systems business area, in a statement. “This habitat will combine our experience in space technologies, satellite systems, propulsion and environmental control system from our subsidiary ORBITEC, as well as our work with the Dream Chaser spacecraft under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program (CCP) and Cargo Resupply Services 2 (CRS-2) contract to support the International Space Station.” According to SNC, while details will depend on final contract negotiations, the company’s proposed habitat also includes: significant pressurized volume for long-duration human activity, docking capabilities with NASA’s Orion spacecraft and other systems, life support and environmental control, airlocks, crew health monitoring and support systems, and propulsion systems for transportation as well as maneuverability. As far as propulsion, Aerojet Rocketdyne is working with SNC to produce a fully-functional prototype PowerTrain solar electric propulsion system (SEP). “We look forward to working with our industry partners on an architectural study for a habitat system that will allow humans to live in space farther from Earth and for longer durations than ever before,” Aerojet Rocketdyne CEO and President Eileen Drake said in a press release. The PowerTrain SEP is designed to deliver power from solar arrays to thrusters on the spacecraft using peak-power a tracking capability that is compatible with current as well as future advanced Hall-effect thruster systems. The company already built and tested a prototype of the system last year, 2015. NanoRacks Image Credit: NanoRacks NanoRacks is part of a team of companies called the Ixion Initiative Team and includes NanoRacks, Space Systems Loral, and the United Launch Alliance (ULA). Their project includes a feasibility study on the conversion of rocket upper stages into habitats. It is seen as a potentially more affordable and less risky pay than fabricating modules on the ground before sending them to orbit. The goal would be to demonstrate the conversion of a Centaur rocket upper stage that could be attached to the International Space Station. “Our plan is to dramatically lower the proposed costs for habitats to allow for the largest customer base, both commercial and government,” said Jeffrey Manber, CEO of NanoRacks, in a press release. “With Loral and NanoRacks working together, we have the knowledge base to assure a solid commercial use of tomorrow’s habitats via re-purposed ULA Centaur platforms.” NanoRacks already does commercial work on the space station. The company has sent and deployed over 130 satellites from the ISS and visiting vehicles. After proving the concept in LEO, the Ixion Team believes future habitats from this approach could be used to create deep space habitats from any future rocket upper stages including the Space Launch System. Commercial Investment The first NextSTEP selections occurred in 2015 and included Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, and seven other companies. They were tasked with advancing concept studies and technology development projects in areas of advanced propulsion, habitation and small satellites both for deep space and LEO. This current round will attempt to use commercial investment that could ultimately lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions near the moon, which is expected to serve as the “proving ground” for NASA’s Journey to Mars. It is hoped that those missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment, while still being close to Earth. According to Space News, many of the concepts put forward by the companies could be re-purposed as commercial space stations. At least one company, Bigelow, already has plans to develop stations with or without NASA help. XBASE was announced in April 2016 as a potential addition to the ISS to be utilized by both NASA and other commercial entities.

He is currently the managing editor of the student run newspaper, the Washburn Review. He also writes a blog, called Orbital Velocity, about the space station. His passion for space ignited when he watched space shuttle Discovery leap to space on Oct. 29, 1998. He saw his first in-person launch on July 8, 2011 when the space shuttle launched for the final time. Today, this fervor has accelerated toward orbit and shows no signs of slowing down. After dabbling in math and engineering courses in college, he soon realized that his true calling was communicating to others about space exploration and spreading that passion.

Reply Brian Breitag August 15, 2016 9:12 am And no mention of artificial gravity, incredible. Reply Jeffrey August 15, 2016 3:21 pm Remember when they were going to try to convert the Space Shuttle’s external fuel tank into space habitat modules? It looks like Nanoracks is going to try to start that idea back up. I wonder what the decontamination process would look like when trying to clean up the unused fuel left in the tank. Do you just launch an internal skin separately and inflate it inside of the tank so you don’t have to worry about cleanup? Reply Dick Eagleson August 16, 2016 12:03 am The Centaur runs on liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, neither of which are going to leave any sort of “bathtub ring” that has to be scrubbed off. Just open the purge valves and wait awhile. Reply SC September 8, 2016 5:20 pm Hello. Do not forget about the fire…..er…explosion hazard! Reply G. Papadatos November 3, 2016 8:17 am I’ve just read this article, in early November. I look forward to reading what has happened since this article was posted (in August). I don’t think cleaning up unused fuel inside a used rocket upper stage will be a big problem. If the fuels used were liquid oxygen, hydrogen, or methane, then venting the tank will allow those substances to simply boil away into space, leaving nothing behind. I don’t think LEO or cislunar space is quite cold enough for solid oxygen to form, and it’s definitely not cold enough for solid hydrogen. I’m not sure about methane or kerosene, though. What I wonder is how anybody can attach or install usable airlocks or docking modules to a structure that doesn’t already have them, and wasn’t designed for them.

The space agency awarded the design contracts, with a combined value of $65 million, as part the public-private partnership Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships 2 (NextSTEP). The full-size deep space habitats will be designed and built here on Earth where the agency can test them against the needs of astronauts on missions to the moon or Mars, Jason Crusan, director of NASA’s Advanced Exploration Systems, said in a statement. “The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” The six companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, NanoRacks, Orbital ATK, and Sierra Nevada Corp. They’ll be expected to contribute 30 percent of the development costs themselves. The companies will have 24 months to design and build their deep space habitation prototypes so NASA can test them for safety, durability, and ease of use. They’ll be used first on the moon before moving deeper into space, Crusan said in a statement. “We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep-space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth.” All of the designs will include the core components of a pressurized living area for the crew, environmental controls, and life support systems, but they’ll also be equipped with propulsion and docking technology.

NASAHabitat OrbitalATKSpaceTravel SierraDeepSpace Boeing will develop its module using technology employed on the International Space Station while Lockheed Martin plans on refurbishing a logistics module like the ones used to carry cargo into orbit. Orbital ATK will base its plans on its unmanned Cygnus spacecraft, and the Sierra Nevada Corporation will use its low-Earth orbit plane along with an inflatable module like the BEAM being tested on the ISS. Ixion Team, a joint venture of three aerospace firms, plans to repurpose a rocket’s launch stage as long-term living quarters capable of supporting astronauts in deep space. NASA has plans to launch a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s, and Elon Musk intends SpaceX to colonize the red planet, but there’s no guarantee human life can survive the harsh conditions. The Earth Mars transit would take anywhere from 150 to 300 days depending on the location of the planets, and that causes a few problems for NASA. No one has spent that much time in space before, so the agency isn’t sure how humans will react to the cramped quarters, low gravity, and high levels of radiation. Then, when the astronauts land on the red planet, they’ll need to deal with the completely alien environment. NASA’s Journey to Mars is behind schedule and over budget, but if the engineers at the space agency intend for it to go forward, they’ll need to find a way to comfortably house the astronauts in deep space. That’s where Next-STEP and cooperation with private space companies come in. The space agency is increasingly relying on public-private partnerships to develop the technology and prototype systems needed for future space missions beyond Earth’s orbit, Crusan said in a statement. “NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and we’re utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors.” The Next-STEP program is designed to encourage private companies to develop deep space exploration technology. The private sector is surging ahead with their plans for commercializing space, and an asteroid mining company has already announced plans to launch the first interstellar prospecting mission in Earth’s history.

By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on August 13, 2016 The end of the hydrocarbon/fiat currency world or magnificent video fakery, Keshe device heads by backroads to White House confrontation By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor The device you are seeing, done by one of five teams testing new Keshe technology to end all dependence on wind, solar and nuclear energy, oh yes, we mean oil and coal too, is, if we can believe our eyes, powering enough appliances to run an entire house. Bari murder suspect photographed in Paris There are issues here that tie to secret societies, police informants and “crisis actor” recruiters, the terror attacks in Paris and a “Boston brakes” murder in Italy only a few weeks ago, but we are getting ahead of ourselves. The video above was requested by me after seeing the first one where everything was on a table. I am the kind of person who believes people will do anything for attention including drill holes and hide wires. I was raised “bad.” There is a massive effort out there to discredit Keshe technology as “fantasy” even though DARPA and Boeing are confirmed to be getting excellent results using Keshe MagRav units they hope will power naval vessels. Rumor has it that Boeing has a Keshe powered drone circling the planet now running on “fantasy.” This second video could be faked too so we have a well known Washington law firm aided by top scientists, doing their own. A little snip here, it seems “top scientists” are all to familiar with the technology being used. I then ask myself, if they knew about this all along, technology valued now (in a written offer I have seen from the government of China) at $1.5t, why didn’t they take the money? VT Science Editor and particle physicist Jeff Smith says that this is the coverup of all time, that as far back as 1880, according to his research in the secret archives of the US Department of Energy, everyone knew electricity was free. Then we go back to the real or imagined discussion between Tesla and financier (read criminal) J.P. Morgan. Tesla had, if the story is accurate and we believe it is, just told Morgan he was looking for financing in order to set up a worldwide grid for the delivery of wireless electrical power…through the air. Morgan’s answer: “Can we put a meter on it?” As history shows us, Tesla was crushed, his inventions claimed by Edison and hydrocarbon slavery has ruled the world.  A century later 17% of the world has no electricity whatsoever and 38%, according to World Energy Outlook, and powerplant projects, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, are mysteriously crushed, IMF roadblocks or the “unseen hand.” Organizing and financing these is not only frustrating but it can be bad for your health as well, if you get what I am not saying, personal experience here in a dozen countries. We are noting a ground wire being used and note that devices in the loop, the refrigerator compressor in particular, have capacitors in the circuit. What you see in the video is now loaded into the back of a rusty pickup truck and heading across Kentucky, into Ohio, then Pennsylvania, down into Maryland and into the District of Columbia. For those of you who don’t know of Keshe, I will keep this short. He was born in Iran, trained as a nuclear engineer in Britain and worked for their power company until recruited by the Ministry of Defense for some unknown reason. Keshe left the MOD and went on his own, announcing astounding technology. Britain tried to bring him back into the fold, inviting him to a private “show and tell” at a “pre-day” for the Farnborough Air Show, a major defense exhibition. Oddly, I was in attendance that day as well, a curious coincidence. Keshe then received an invitation through the Belgian Royal family. There, a group of human barnacles attached themselves to him, members of a pedophile ring working with Belgian police, all Freemasons. The head of the group runs an anti-Keshe website and, according to French intelligence sources, is directly tied to terror recruiting for the recent Paris attacks including the Bataclan holocaust. Here he is “burned” Working with them is another “anti-Keshe blogger” out of Paris who claims to be a journalist. Our sources, highest level, say this is a police informant, a Tunisian, who “shops” activists to the police and helped recruit the Bataclan killers. The police are protecting him and may well have killed one of their own to protect his role in the Hebdo incident as well. The entire group ties together with a network of bogus companies in Paris controlled by Freemasons, companies which all tie to a shady Brussels “investment bank.” Quickly finishing up the Keshe background; when Keshe turned out to be uncooperative even after threats, local police, off duty of course, in Belgium tried to run Keshe and his wife off the road, mind you while firing their service weapons at him like something out of a TV show. Keshe then left for Italy where he remains. However, a few weeks ago, 24 year old Fabio Alonzo and his fiance, Natalie, were run off the road by 3 semi-trailer trucks driven by Albanians who were allowed to flee Italy without questioning. When private forensic investigators were hired to review the scene, local police threatened Keshe. Fabio is dead, after what appears to be more of a beating with a tire wrench than car accident. Natalie is in a coma under police protection, for what that is worth. Sources (highest) at a NATO counter-terrorism organization opened their files for us. Local police in Bari, Italy, where the accident occurred, run the smuggling port there, part of a Mafia organization, and are contracted with ISIS through the Tunisian consulate in Milan (and Israeli intelligence). Milan makes documents to move Tunisian “refugees,” read “terrorists” into Italy under special arrangement between the two countries, who are then given instant citizenship in the EU through the Milan document factory. Then the terror cells, with perfect papers and weapons, travel this “ratline” to Paris and beyond, ready to bring down the EU. Who are the players here? Who do you think? As this moves on and on, our young man is still in his truck, picking up a security detail now, heading into Eastern Ohio. For those who saw the video, did he hide a power cable under his walkway or is this going to mean and end to it all? Please remember, nobody involved in this is an expert and certainly no one has the power to oppose the incredible forces arrayed to crush what we hope is the first pure “more than simple over-unity” power system. _____________ Related Posts: ANNOUNCEMENT: Keshe to make birthday gift to mankind, August 2nd NEWS FLASH!

Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 18, 2016 at 8:05 pm The Keshe demos & meetings in Washington DC were successful — but nowhere near as successful as Keshe & Co. credibly expect to be in very near future — with U.S. military, U.S. industry, U.S. media & U.S. consumers (who are tired of paying big bucks for electricity that can be cheap if not free). Mehran T. Keshe himself spoke & answered questions at the National Press Club via video conferencing. The video of this event is or will be at Keshe Foundation website. Keshe staffers will soon return to Wash DC to do additional presentations & demonstrations of Keshe energy, medical & other tech — with smaller & more advanced stand-alone devices soon to be available. Veterans Today & other media will soon post additional articles, audio & video about these events and additional Keshe tech. Keshe staffers recently achieved major advances in Washington DC, Arizona, Iran, Syria, Russia, Italy, Ghana & China. More advances & tech coming soon — to a home near yours. For +/-$100, you too can build some Keshe tech. Simple blueprints/plans available at the Keshe site.

If Keshe Tech is really true, i think his doing the rigth regarding strategic/politics. He is using the Internet , another invention, but it mostly used protocol , the HTTP, created in early 90s. Using Internet to widespread his Tech , giving the blueprints freely to everyone who has access to the Internet, we will reach a point that everyone will know about Keshe, it´s the viral effect of Internet. This is the reason the elite tried and still try to control the Internet.

There was a chap in NY who lived so close to a substation that he lit his apartment with flourescent bulbs that stayed on all the time due to all the stray RF. At night he simply bundled them into his closet and closed the door. Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 15, 2016 at 8:06 am The Keshe Generator is now at the White House. See http://www.KesheFoundation.org (live video). A basic blueprint for the Keshe Hybrid Magrav Generator (version 1.0) is at http://www.KesheFoundation.org. Log in to Reply nawlins  August 15, 2016 at 6:58 am Any boy scout who has built a home-made crystal set knows that you can get electricity (a small amount) over the air. The idea was to get electricity of sufficient current to do useful work. Tesla could do this, but since the earth was the returning conductor it tended to have side-effects, such as the grains of sand arcing under your feet as you walked as you got close to his tower. As for this stuff, I think most of your commenters do not realize this is an amplification device, not a source generator. I will still go with the Aussies design. It is clunky and doesn’t put out great gobs of power, but it is completely independent and it is as reliable as an electric motor. What’s more, it’s output is mechanical. Log in to Reply markurban  August 15, 2016 at 6:32 am You would think that a simple, well laid out diagram with decent instructions would be available. I would love to see a simple proof of concept schematic we could all use to build the mechanism. Years ago I saw a video of a green sprite bottle producing varying amounts of voltage as time passed. The device in the above video appears to be putting out 120 volts ac at an amperage necessary to power household appliances. That is quite a leap forward. By my estimation, you could put the above device in the trunk of a Tesla P85D and lock the steering wheel so it would make a decent size turning circle and switch the car on autopilot and watch it run until either the tires went flat or the suspension parts wore down to the point of failure. Somebody has to contact Elon and make it so!

Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 14, 2016 at 7:23 pm Theus: Yes, good find. The title of the video is “The First Magrav Unit — Completely Independent 5KW Generator!” Posted by a Romanian (thus, the title on YouTube is in Romanian). Mehran Keshe & Douglas do the presentation in English (with Romanian subtitles). Very good. Gordon asked Douglas to take the Keshe MagGrav unit outside onto a concrete block; so, he did. Thus, the above video. You will learn a lot from both videos. Leno  August 14, 2016 at 12:18 pm Keshe is still streaming live on JouTube. Log in to Reply Todd Marshall  August 14, 2016 at 11:20 am What a silly video! With the obvious questions everyone should have (what does the circuit look like; what is known about the principles involved), why all the nonsense of hanging all the loads on it. Why shooting the temperature of the wires (is that to prove the so-called “nano coating” is delivering zero resistance?). And my most obvious question: Why is this thing putting out 120VAC at 60 Hz? Log in to Reply jamesjohnson  August 14, 2016 at 11:36 am I think the grid input of 120 vac is the trigger voltage, not the source of the current output. e.g., 10 watts in 1000 watts out. RogerBall1962  August 14, 2016 at 2:16 pm Silly video and silly people who do not understand fundamental electrical principles, you are right Todd Marshall. The Facebook crowd is taking it hook, line and sinker. Keshe has some insight into plasma fields, and quantum physics is starting to explain gravity and superconductivity, like graphene (which will indeed change our lives) but the fact remains that the Keshe Foundation is recalling every generator they ever sold. Wish VT would recall every article they wrote about science, aliens and the metaphysical. Hard to believe that investigative minds can be so ignorant. Displaced envy again I guess. Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 14, 2016 at 2:39 pm Todd: Your questions are silly. For such a serious subject, the video is amateur — but certainly not silly. IF it works, who cares WHY it works? Although I am curious about the technologies, design & construction, my primary question is WHETHER it works. Conventional physics & EE does not explain it. James & Todd: Your question about 120VAC is interesting. We’ll probably find out the answer to the 120VAC question before or during the Keshe demos in Washington DC. Regardless, this is a Keshe generator (not the earlier Keshe device with which you might be familiar) — which does NOT require any electrical INPUT. Zero volts, zero amps & zero watts input — with 4,000 watts at 120VAC output. If true, that’s impressive. Jeff Smith  August 14, 2016 at 3:29 pm Good question. In mode one it is a poly phase toroidal current transformer that stores excess magnetic energy by spinning the magnetic field. Only poly or more than one phase currents can do this. This is done by using a split phase capacitor to kick start it with single phase 110 volt ac systems. The original device was designed by Tesla and was use to balance peak loads in electrical street car systems. Circa 1900. In this mode very large units will store excess energy from the grid at night when load is at a minimum and return it during the day. Thereby allowing utilities to double there daytime output capacity with no new infrastructure costs. In mode two it draws linear wave radiated from high voltage power line and acts as a tuned Tesla radiant energy system. 30% of all power line energy is lost by linear wave radiation. The device just simply tunes into the wasted energy field and returns it to the customer wirelessly. All HV power lines are basically Tesla transmitters emiting linear electrostatic waves. RogerBall1962  August 14, 2016 at 10:07 pm VT keeps ‘moderating’ my comments out. You are absolutely right Todd. Trakkath  August 14, 2016 at 10:59 am Life is motion and none can stop it, not even those old static Goldman sacks in power Log in to Reply Jim W. Dean, Managing Editor  August 14, 2016 at 9:52 am There is one down side to this “area” which a friend outside of Palm Springs exposed me to. Some of the less expensive bedroom communities near there had jumped on board putting the investment into solar with the buyback guarantee and price from the city utility. But so much is being produced for buy back now that the city can no longer afford it and cut the pay rate by 60%, protected by a clause where they can’t be sued. With the Keshe technology being affordable and not dependent on recovering high start up cost where “buy back” is needed. So there appears to be a market to replace solar, or be used as a co-generating system so those who have solar and can sell back into the grid and and recoup their investment much faster. This leaves room for “installers” to make a living doing this for people, which could be a nice cottage industry for middle class workers.

Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 14, 2016 at 3:04 pm LC: Yes, Keshe stuff is a Tesla-type wet dream. However, every once in a while, such dreams come true. At the Washington Keshe demos, we’ll soon see. Keshe is open-sourcing his technologies — no patents & no restrictive development. This is the only way that Tesla-type energy tech can be introduced to the public, manufactured, marketed & widely used. P.S. Please send us a pic of your gold medal & you in Rio. OK? ;-).

Log in to Reply Lee1117  August 13, 2016 at 10:56 pm Hi folks! I;m new here. I have been waiting since my highschool days in the late sixties for the end of the “grid”. I thought it was going to go a few years ago when Mazda built prototype RX8’s that burned hydrogen in a a rotary engine. The “exhaust” is water! Mazda was “convinced” to abandon their plans but it worked just fine. I searched Keshe MagRav and found plenty of hits. One very interesting story reported an application of Keshe MagRav technology was from March 24, 2015. It is here: http://beforeitsnews.com/eu/2015/03/how-the-new-iranian-russian-technology-magrav-checkmates-the-us-navy-2580478.html “How the New Iranian-Russian Technology “Magrav” Checkmates the US Navy” I’m not familiar with the site and the source of the story came from whatdoesitmean.com and they are kind of “out there” but if true then Mr Keshe’s work might have already saved humanity last year. Please keep the great work and thank you! Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 14, 2016 at 2:56 pm Lee: The sites you reference contain a lot of disinfo & B.S. A better article about the possible use of Keshe tech in Russian non-lethal defensive weapons is at Veterans Today: “AEGIS Fail in Black SEA, Ruskies Burn Down USS Donald Duck”. Google the title or do a site search at VT, and you’ll have better info. The 2015 Before-It’s-News article (about an early 2014 event) that you reference is full of disinfo, B.S., deceptive hyperlinks & blatant falsehoods. I stopped reading that site a long time ago. Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 14, 2016 at 6:30 pm Lee: For example, please notice that the Before-It’s-News link that purports to take you to the Keshe Foundation (i.e., “www.keshefoundation.org/” in the article) is actually hyperlinked to some other bogus site. This is the type of crap that I found to be unacceptable, therefore stopped visiting that site. Lee1117  August 15, 2016 at 2:27 pm Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta Thanks for the heads-up! I did mention in my post that I thought that “I’m not familiar with the site and the source of the story came from whatdoesitmean.com and they are kind of “out there”.

Khalid Talaat  August 16, 2016 at 2:42 am Dr. Abu Bakr… I am with you. Neil  August 13, 2016 at 4:15 pm Toby, I’m with you on this one. Hate to be a naysayer, but unless proven otherwise, I say you’re right on the puzzling source of AC current. Also, the gauge of the power (source) wire seems awfully thin considering all the amperage gobbling appliances hooked up to it. In addition, I can’t see how the ground connection (and the earth ground itself) could absorb enough current to make all this run so smoothly as it appears. Also don’t understand the need for pliers on the outlet strip switch, since those type of breaker switches normally require someone to reset them manually. I’ll admit I don’t a degree in electrical engineering, but have worked and played with electricity enough to know when something doesn’t add up. I would love to see someone prove me wrong, but please, do it in a clear way that is both understandable and plainly evident. A maze of wires, a loud hairdryer running in the background and a shaky video don’t make for a clear presentation in my view. I want to learn like the rest of us but understand in doing so I have to weed out the “chaff” at the same time. Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 13, 2016 at 3:37 pm Toby: The Keshe device was designed & built to generate 120V AC (alternating current). Otherwise, the refrigerator & some of the other devices would not work. The Keshe device is straight from original Maxwell equations (NOT modified & truncated by Heaviside) — most of which no one can find, but the Russians have them (captured in Germany at WW2’s end). NO conventional scientist or EE will understand Keshe tech — including you. Education ‘dumbed down.’ Tesla understood some of this stuff (and more); however, even Tesla might have difficulty with this stuff.

Edward Dodge  August 13, 2016 at 3:09 pm Was this a joke?The guy sounds like an “oak tree mechanic” in the video. The way he ran the cords to and from the power strips was completely sloppy, not to mention the vise grips used to lock the power strip overload from tripping. The “magrav” unit looked more like three old heating coils stacked in plexiglass boxes, and if his bare ground wire was used as one side of the circuit, it looked woefully undersized to handle the total current of all the running appliances. Log in to Reply Dr. Abu-Bakr Susta  August 13, 2016 at 3:25 pm ED: In Washington DC, we will soon see the device work — or not work. If we waited for conventional scientists to understand & do things, then men & women would never fly; Earth would still be flat; and Earth would still be the center of the universe. If you heard the Kitty Hawk NC accents of the Wright Brothers, YOU might never get on a plane. Also especially if you saw how the first Wright Brothers plane was put together. With vise grips. ;-).

It’s called induction, and it ain’t pretty. Log in to Reply PeterAG  August 13, 2016 at 12:55 pm Tesla did not grasp the basic concept of diffraction then widely known among physicists. It is a basic property of all waves and cannot be circumvented. This can be easily deduced from his promise to build a narrow beam (1 micron) capable of destruction at 250 miles. No laser nor any other entity may be used in that manner. Appart from diffraction athmospheric turbulence and fluctuations add to the difficulties. But he was a truly great inventor and all inventors make mistakes and learn from them. Had he ever had a go at it he would have learnt and discarded it. The free energy idea is based on a basic misunderstanding of quantum mechanics and in particular how to deal with the energy concept with respect to atoms. Zero-point energy is not accessible for extraction only differences relative to excited energy states. Tesla wasnt young when quantum mechanics came along and he read too much into it. He would have changed his mind if he had dealt more with it and interacted with those in the know. Still no free lunch folks!

Emma Yacht  August 13, 2016 at 12:40 pm Currently it’s possible that only those who continue to pay their loyalty dues to the matrix are allowed to go “off the grid”; and that to go off the Grid/matrix, one has to continue to pledge allegiance to certain covenants, regardless. In this fractal greenscreen of the matrix (why are grass and trees green? why is chlorophyll green? It’s easier to do a greenscreen projection, as in the movies), humans seem to have been pledged to certain monopolies. If were to all wake up and, together, state our declaration for a better deal, that would be a different story, sort of like the Indians did with Custer. It would happen with our just thinking about it. That’s what scares the bejeebers out of them… because Man is next to God, and they are not even close.

Credits: NASA NASA has selected six U.S. companies to help advance the Journey to Mars by developing ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats. Through the public-private partnerships enabled by the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships-2 (NextSTEP-2) Broad Agency Announcement, Appendix A, NASA and industry partners will expand commercial development of space in low-Earth orbit while also improving deep space exploration capabilities to support more extensive human spaceflight missions. The selected companies are:         Bigelow Aerospace of Las Vegas         Boeing of Pasadena, Texas         Lockheed Martin of Denver         Orbital ATK of Dulles, Virginia         Sierra Nevada Corporations Space Systems of Louisville, Colorado         NanoRacks of Webster, Texas Habitation systems provide a safe place for humans to live as we move beyond Earth on our Journey to Mars. NASA is on an ambitious expansion of human spaceflight, including the Journey to Mars, and were utilizing the innovation, skill and knowledge of both the government and private sectors, said Jason Crusan, director of NASAs Advanced Exploration Systems. The next human exploration capabilities needed beyond the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion capsule are deep space, long duration habitation and in-space propulsion. We are now adding focus and specifics on the deep space habitats where humans will live and work independently for months or years at a time, without cargo supply deliveries from Earth. The six partners will have up to approximately 24 months to develop ground prototypes and/or conduct concept studies for deep space habitats. The contract award amounts are dependent on contract negotiations, and NASA has estimated the combined total of all the awards, covering work in 2016 and 2017, will be approximately $65 million, with additional efforts and funding continuing into 2018. Selected partners are required to contribute at least 30 percent of the cost of the overall proposed effort. The ground prototypes will be used for three primary purposes: supporting integrated systems testing, human factors and operations testing, and to help define overall system functionality. These are important activities as they help define the design standards, common interfaces, and requirements while reducing risks for the final flight systems that will come after this phase. NASA made the first NextSTEP selections in 2015, which include deep space habitation concept studies that also advance low-Earth orbit commercial capabilities. Four companies were selected under that solicitation: Bigelow Aerospace LLC, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. This round of NextSTEP selections are part of a phased approach that will catalyze commercial investment in low-Earth orbit and lead to an operational deep space habitation capability for missions in the area of space near the moon, which will serve as the proving ground for Mars during the 2020s. These missions will demonstrate human, robotic and spacecraft operations in a true deep space environment thats still relatively close to Earth and validate technologies for the longer journey to Mars. The activities of these NextSTEP awards will inform the acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space including important aspects, such as standards and interfaces, module configurations, and options for deployment using SLS and Orion and commercial vehicles. In addition to U.S. industry, NASA is in discussions on collaborative opportunities with our international partners to enable fully operational deep space habitation capability. NextSTEP is managed by the Advanced Exploration Systems Division (AES) in NASAs Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. AES is pioneering innovative approaches and public-private partnerships to rapidly develop prototype systems, advance key capabilities, and validate operational concepts for future human missions beyond Earth orbit.

REUTERS/Jim Young/File Photo WASHINGTON Boeing Co's KC-46A refueling plane has been approved for production, with work underway for the first two low-rate initial production lots to be awarded in the next 30 days, the U.S. Air Force said on Friday. "The KC-46 program has made significant strides in moving the Air Force toward the modernization needed in our strategic tanker fleet," Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement announcing the approval. The Air Force added it would soon award Boeing contracts for the first two batches, 19 aircraft in total, with a pre-negotiated combined value of $2.8 billion. Last month the KC-46 refueled an A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft in flight, passing the final test needed to begin initial low-rate production. The Air Force said in June that it was seeking compensation from Boeing for delays in the program. Boeing already has taken $1.3 billion in pretax charges for cost overruns. Boeing expects to deliver a first batch of 18 tankers in January 2018 instead of August 2017. "Production approval is an important, positive step for the program, and the Boeing/Air Force team has worked extremely hard to get to this point," Boeing spokeswoman Caroline Hutcheson said.

(Image: Wikimedia Commons) A recent New York Times article (8/7/16) detailed, in often scathing terms, what many media critics already knew: that think tanks are frequently not objective, neutral arbiters of information, but corporate- and government-funded agenda-promoters with an academic veneer to give the appearance of impartiality. One of the two think tanks the Times’ Eric Lipton and Brooke Williams raked over the coals was the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which published a report advocating the expansion of drone sales while being funded by drone makers, namely General Atomics (emphasis added): As a think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies did not file a lobbying report, but the goals of the effort were clear. “Political obstacles to export,” read the agenda of one closed-door “working group” meeting organized by Mr. Brannen that included Tom Rice, a lobbyist in General Atomics’ Washington office, on the invitation lists, the emails show. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, drone makers that were major CSIS contributors, were also invited to attend the sessions, the emails show. The meetings and research culminated with a report released in February 2014 that reflected the industry’s priorities. “I came out strongly in support of export,” Mr. Brannen, the lead author of the study, wrote in an email to Kenneth B. Handelman, the deputy assistant secretary of State for defense trade controls. But the effort did not stop there. Mr. Brannen initiated meetings with Defense Department officials and congressional staff to push for the recommendations, which also included setting up a new Pentagon office to give more focus to acquisition and deployment of drones. The center also stressed the need to ease export limits at a conference it hosted at its headquarters featuring top officials from the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps…. “CSIS will not represent any donor before any government office or entity, including congressional lawmakers and executive branch officials,” Mr. Hamre, the chief executive, said in his statement to the Times. “We do not lobby.” The result was a victory for General Atomics. As the Times also notes, CSIS is funded largely by Western and Gulf monarchy governments, arms dealers and oil companies, such as Raytheon, Boeing, Shell, the United Arab Emirates, US Department of Defense, UK Home Office, General Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, Northrop Grumman, Chevron and others. Anyone with a seven-year-old’s understanding of causality can conclude that CSIS would, in the aggregate, promote the expansion of the military and surveillance state, since that’s who pays their bills; what the Times did was reveal a specific, rather direct example, using heretofore secret documents. New York Times readers didn’t need a smoking gun in any event, since CSIS’s agenda can be seen with simple inference. Since it was the Times that broached the topic, let’s use what CSIS fellows have written or said in the Times over the past year, and see if they ever called for the defunding or de-escalation of the military state: CSIS op-ed (12/3/15) hyping the threat of ISIS and by implication calling for more surveillance of Americans CSIS op-ed (2/18/16) calling for an “international precedent” for an encryption backdoor CSIS op-ed (2/23/16) calling for an encryption backdoor CSIS senior fellow (5/17/16) helping the US military with its pro-LGBT (a/k/a “woke imperialism”) rebranding efforts CSIS fellow (5/27/16) saying that Africa was no longer seen by the US through a “peacekeeping lens” but was now a battlefield with enemies that could potentially threaten the US CSIS “military budget expert” (6/10/16) criticizing Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter for not moving fast enough on its new cybersecurity recruitment initiative CSIS op-ed (7/5/16) calling for more biometric security and dismissing privacy concerns as “irrational” “nervous dystopian projections” CSIS fellow (7/8/16) saying the White House hasn’t “fully acknowledged” the shift in Europe and how it could damage NATO CSIS senior fellow (7/9/16) insisting nuclear weapons remain in Europe due to increased threats from Russia CSIS fellow (8/5/16) insisting Boko Haram is “increasingly unstable” One of the starkest examples, one that FAIR noted at the time, was a New York Times article (8/20/15) last year, warning about the US “lagging behind” Russia in the Arctic Ocean, that was based almost entirely on a CSIS report warning of “Russia’s strategic reach” near the north pole. As we noted in September, the piece failed to mention Russia has 14 times the Arctic coast of the US, and thus it made sense it would have roughly that many more icebreaker ships. The “gap” was just asserted, based primarily on US military say-so and a CSIS report that breathlessly insisted Russia was getting the better of the US in the Arctic. The New York Times even helped out, using a wildly deceptive map implying Arctic parity where none existed: In May, the torrent of media articles hyping the “Arctic gap” asserted by CSIS and the US military paid dividends, with Congress allocating an additional $1 billion to the Navy’s budget to pay for icebreaker ships. Another bill, the Icebreaker Recapitalization Act, calling for Congress to fully fund “six heavy-duty polar icebreaker ships,” has been introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D.–Wash.). While the contracts are not awarded yet, Lockheed Martin—one of CSIS’s top donors–is said by market analyst The Motley Fool to be an “obvious choice” to build the new fleet. Their runner up to build the new icebreakers? Huntington Ingalls Industries, who also donated generously to CSIS. No instances of CSIS calling for the defunding or de-escalation of the military state in the New York Times could be found by FAIR. FAIR reached out to CSIS spokesperson Andrew Schwartz, asking him to cite any examples of CSIS ever saying the threat of Russia or Islamic extremism was overestimated, or advocating for less surveillance or military spending. He did not respond at the time of publishing. It could be a coincidence that CSIS always errs on the side of more military spending, more surveillance, more hyping of threats from Russia and ISIS, and that these conclusions were reached based on a dispassionate examination of the facts. Or the New York Times could read its own reporting, and treat deep-state think tank war-boosters as just that. At the very least, if they are to be cited, the paper could note that they are funded by interests heavily invested in promoting the expansion of a NATO/GCC-led military apparatus, so the reader can know that the bespectacled quasi-academic being interviewed or proffering charts and maps is not entirely without strings. (Noting that someone commenting on war is funded by those who profit from war seems entirely reasonable, no?). The media would understandably be hard-pressed to drop think tanks altogether. Their insta-pundits lend gravitas to articles for writers on deadline and, just as they do for lawmakers, think tanks do much of the research heavy-lifting. But the think tank industry, as the internal emails New York Times revealed make clear, is often based on laundering influence through ostensibly neutral-sounding “institutes” or “centers,” with the fact that the average media consumer won’t know who funds them being part of the service offered to donors. This is true not just in the military field, but in every policy area that affects corporations’ bottom lines, as is suggested by the Times‘ reporting on the even more ubiquitous Brookings Institution promoting the JPMorgan bank’s image: JPMorgan, in a document dated a month before the agreement was signed, said the pending donation to Brookings “deepens/extends relationships with important client base among business and civic leaders both in the US and abroad.” And Brookings was ready to do its part. “Our events, which in part target these audiences,” said an internal 2014 Brookings memo, referring to the Global Cities Initiative and federal and state leaders, “have yielded 100+ media hits, with 97 percent of them referencing GCI and 90 percent referencing JPMorgan; by the end of this year, we will have held events in 13 domestic markets and nine international markets.” At times, Brookings officials seemed worried they were not doing enough for the bank. “No one wants to create overt marketing opportunities for JPMC, but we need to carve out roles and thought leadership opportunity for market presidents,” said a 2013 Brookings memo, referring to a dinner with the bank’s executives. “We need to do a better job tying it back to JPMC.” These “media hits” would not be possible if the corporate agenda wasn’t laundered through the pseudo-academic credibility of a think tank, whether it’s a giant bank trying to improved its image via Brookings or an arms manufacturers trying to promote the war industry via CSIS. “John Smith, funded by Raytheon, the Department of Defense and Chevron, says Russian aggression is unprecedented” sounds far less credible than “John Smith, senior fellow at CSIS, says Russian aggression is unprecedented”—even though they are, in effect, the same thing. In light of the New York Times report, perhaps it’s time for media to start spelling out what’s happening for readers. © 2016 Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting (FAIR) Adam Johnson Adam Johnson is an associate editor at AlterNet and writes frequently for FAIR.org.

(Notre Dame Univ., IN, United States); Bush, Robert H. (Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, East Hartford, CT, United States); Mani, Mortaza (Boeing Co., Research and Technology, Saint Louis, MO, United States) Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other advanced modeling and simulation (M&S) methods are increasingly relied on for predictive performance, reliability and safety of engineering systems. Analysts, designers, decision makers, and project managers, who must depend on simulation, need practical techniques and methods for assessing simulation credibility. The AIAA Guide for Verification and Validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations (AIAA G-077-1998 (2002)), originally published in 1998, was the first engineering standards document available to the engineering community for verification and validation (V&V) of simulations. Much progress has been made in these areas since 1998. The AIAA Committee on Standards for CFD is currently updating this Guide to incorporate in it the important developments that have taken place in V&V concepts, methods, and practices, particularly with regard to the broader context of predictive capability and uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods and approaches. This paper will provide an overview of the changes and extensions currently underway to update the AIAA Guide. Specifically, a framework for predictive capability will be described for incorporating a wide range of error and uncertainty sources identified during the modeling, verification, and validation processes, with the goal of estimating the total prediction uncertainty of the simulation. The Guide's goal is to provide a foundation for understanding and addressing major issues and concepts in predictive CFD. However, this Guide will not recommend specific approaches in these areas as the field is rapidly evolving. It is hoped that the guidelines provided in this paper, and explained in more detail in the Guide, will aid in the research, development, and use of CFD in engineering decision-making.

companies they will team up with to realise their dreams of building residential homes on the Red Planet.     The six companies are Bigelow Aerospace, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital ATK, Sierra Nevada Corporation’s Space Systems, and Colorado NanoRacks, with whom they have agreed to manufacture prototypes of deep space habitats.   Although in their infancy, there have plans to have manned colonies on Mars for decades.  These recent developments fall under the Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) programme that was created as an programme to ‘expand knowledge, commercial capabilities and opportunities in space’.   There are many hurdles with creating habitable conditions on Mars, discounting the extreme hostile environment that is devoid of oxygen, getting a spaceship there and back is still impossible with the fuel needed for a return trip currently unfeasibly high, ensuring any trips would be one way.   The ambitious and long-term plans would play a part in the wider, if somewhat challenging, programme that would see humans colonize Mars and develop settlements that astronauts could live in for long periods of time.   Explaining the programme in more detail, Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters had this to say: “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit.” The first manned trip to Mars, by NASA, is currently scheduled for 2030.

Back To Top[*] 31st anniversary of JAL jumbo jet crash observed Aug. 13, 2016 - 05:50AM JST Relatives of the 520 victims of the 1985 crash of a Japan Airlines jumbo jet on Friday marked the 31st anniversary of the accident in Gunma Prefecture. In the morning, bereaved relatives climbed to the crash site on Mt Osutaka, at a height of 1,565 meters, where the JAL Boeing 747 with 524 people aboard crashed on a flight from Tokyo to Osaka. Only four survivors were found when the first rescue workers arrived 12 hours later. The relatives gathered at a cenotaph, offered prayers and rang a “bell of safety” installed at the site. JAL President Yoshiharu Ueki joined relatives in climbing the trail in the afternoon. He paid his respects to victims and pledged thathis company would do its utmost make sure such a tragedy never happened again. At 6:56 p.m.—the exact time of the crash—a ceremony was held in Ueno village at the foot of the mountain, attended by about 200 relatives and JAL officials. A moment of silence was observed. JAL Flight 123 took off from Tokyo’s Haneda Airport at 6:12 p.m. on Aug 12, 1985. Twelve minutes into the flight, a bulkhead is believed to have blown in the tail, creating over-pressurization that severed the four sets of hydraulic-control lines and blew part of the tail section off. With a total loss of hydraulic pressure, the captain attempted unsuccessfully to regain control of the aircraft as it descended uncontrollably in a flight condition known as the “Dutch roll.” At 6:56 p.m., the plane crashed into the mountain. Since 2006, JAL has been displaying messages written by passengers and a cabin attendant before they died, at its Safety Promotion Center at Haneda Airport. A government-appointed investigation panel blamed the accident on improper repairs to the rear bulkhead seven years earlier. In 1988, local police served papers on 20 people from JAL, the transport ministry and Boeing on suspicion of professional negligence resulting in death and injury. But prosecutors decided not to indict anyone. Back To Top[*] Switch to full browser version © 2016 GPlusMedia

Rough Cut (no reporter narration). ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) Two U.S. astronauts left the International Space Station on Sunday for a seven-hour spacewalk to install communications and navigation aides for new commercial space taxis. Station commander Barry "Butch" Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts floated outside the station's Quest airlock shortly after 7 a.m. EST/1200 GMT to begin their third spacewalk in eight days, a NASA Television broadcast showed. The purpose of the outings is to prepare berthing slips for spaceships being developed by Boeing and Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX. The astronauts are scheduled to install more than 400 feet (122 meters) of cables and a pair of antennas that the new vehicles will use to navigate toward and dock with the station, a $100 billion laboratory that flies about 260 miles (418 km) above Earth. Sunday's outing follows two spacewalks last week to rig power and data cables for a pair of docking port adapters that are due to arrive later this year. One adapter will be installed at the berthing slip once used by NASA's space shuttles, which were retired in 2011. The second docking system will be located at an adjacent hatch on the Harmony connecting node. Since the shuttles' retirement, the United States has been dependent on Russia to fly crew to and from the station - a joint project in which 15 nations are involved. NASA aims to break Russia's monopoly before the end of 2017 by buying rides from Boeing and SpaceX.

"I think starting this round of a new nuclear arms race is extremely foolish and it is based on a lack of understanding," Perry said. "We are talking about huge expenditures here and it is hardly being discussed or debated and we’re just going ahead with it." In October 2015, Northrop Grumman, a US global aerospace and defense technology company, was awarded a development contract to build the next generation B-21 strategic bomber, while Lockheed Martin and Boeing said they planned to submit proposals to develop the GBSD ICBM. "Nobody really knows what the cost is [for these systems] but people drop figures like $1 trillion," Perry stated. "But I don't know what the right number is — if anything, it [$1 trillion] is on the low side." © Photo: maxpark.com Guess Where the US Will House Its New Modernized Nuclear Arsenal?Cost considerations are secondary in the new nuclear arms race, Perry noted. "I'm trying to make people aware of just how dangerous, how really dangerous, this damn business is," Perry said. "People don't relate to that and they think it is just another issue of whether we should build these bombers or build these missiles or not." The weakness in the US nuclear Triad is the silo-based ICBM's providing adversaries with known target locations and would be most likely to precipitate a nuclear war, Perry observed. "If there is a nuclear war, they [ICBM's] would be the first targets and the problem here is that we know all that and therefore in our alert system, if we see an indication of a launch coming we have to decide whether to launch those ICBM’s right away," Perry stated. "The ICBM’s are the only ones that pose that particular problem."  Nuclear Security Tougher Than Cold War Era Due to Cyberthreats Ensuring the security of nuclear weapons is harder today than during the Cold War years because of the looming cyberthreats that might compromise nuclear weapons command and control systems or lead to an accidental launch.  "It is harder today than it was during the Cold War and there is the danger of cyber confusion or some cyber mistake," Perry said. "Or someone playing malicious games with cyber and going after our command and control systems." © REUTERS/ Carlos Barria Obama Official Announces Color-Coded Cyber Threat Plan in Wake of DNC LeaksThe reappearance of Cold War-era nuclear brinkmanship, Perry observed, combined with emerging cyber vulnerabilities makes the likelihood of human or software errors, false alarms, and accidental launches more likely. "The danger was, and is… that we will go to war by accident," Perry said. "During the Cold War, one [accident] which looked very, very real and had people convinced it was the real thing was caused by an operator putting a training tape in the computer system and, of course, the training tape was designed to look real, so that was a human error." Human errors and false alarms will happen again, and when they do, the president will have just a few minutes to decide whether he or she is going to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), Perry noted. Perry was the 19th US Secretary of Defense, serving from February 1994 to January 1997. He is also the author of "My Journey to the Nuclear Brink" and director of the Preventative Defense Project at Stanford University in the US state of California. ...

Earlier this week, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said it was unlikely that the plane's captain glided the plane into the sea, and instead said engine failure due to lack of fuel had sparked a sudden "death dive" into the southern Indian Ocean, Xinhua news agency reported. ATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood told The Australian daily that the agency had come to a consensus with a number of other agencies about the theory, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, the US National Transport Safety Board and the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation. At the time, he said analysis of satellite data by Defence Department scientists concluded the plane made a sudden and rapid descent at more than 10 times the usual descent rate. But on Friday, independent investigators noticed the ATSB had withdrawn the claim from its website without explanation. Richard Godfrey from an independent group of MH370 expert observers told News Corp that he noticed the "consensus" claim had been deleted after it was picked up by computer tracker. Godfrey said the deletion of the consensus theory could mean that not all experts on the strategy group agree with the "death dive" consensus. "Another possibility is that it was assumed there was a consensus, but then some party complained and the published report had to be changed," he said. MH370 was carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared on March 8, 2014. --IANS ksk SEARCH About Us Data Center Cloud Computing Servers Cloud Applications Hosting MPLS VPN Network Services Disclaimer Privacy Policy Careers Feedback Advertise Digital © Copyright Sify Technologies Ltd, 1998-2016.

(Photo: David J. Phillip / AP file photo) United Continental Holdings Inc. won approval for a new contract with flight attendants and reached an “agreement in principle” with mechanics, setting the stage for labor peace for the first time since the 2010 merger that created the airline. The Association of Flight Attendants voted 53 percent in favor of a five-year pact that raises top pay rates as much as 31 percent, according to a joint statement with the carrier Friday. United also reached a proposed deal with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters covering 9,000 technicians and related employees, which will be voted on once the language is finished. The results bolster Chief Executive Officer Oscar Munoz’s strategy of winning over a disgruntled workforce, even if it means accepting higher costs. United reached new agreements or extensions of existing ones with pilots, ground workers and dispatchers during the past year. “Upon ratification, this will be the first time in almost a decade that all United work groups will have labor contracts in place,” Munoz said in a joint statement with the Teamsters. “When I took this job last year, I promised to turn the page and write a new chapter in our approach to labor and management relations at United,” he said in the statement with flight attendants. Flexible Scheduling Maximum pay for flight attendants with at least 13 years of experience will be set at $62 an hour, according to the contract ratified by the 25,000-member union. United had failed to reach a joint flight-attendant contract since its October 2010 merger with Continental Airlines. The new deal will allow the carrier to put attendants from United and Continental on the same planes for the first time. A combined group of flight attendants should give United more flexibility in scheduling, especially when a cabin crew runs up against federally mandated allowable work hours and must be replaced.Until now, for example, a Continental crew could only be replaced by another from the same predecessor airline. Attendants were further split by jet type. For example, Continental employees worked on Boeing Co. 737 jets, while United crews staffed jumbo 747s. Both camps got a piece of the 787 Dreamliner, with former Continental crews working on the first 25 to join the company’s fleet and United the next 25. Cost Increase Mechanics overwhelmingly rejected an earlier deal that would have given them a 25 percent raise, an average bonus check of $9,000 and other benefits, with 93 percent of voters opposing the company’s contract offer. While many analysts see the labor pacts generally as positive, the deals will boost costs significantly. JPMorgan Chase analyst Jamie Bakerin June estimated that the new agreements would increase United’s costs by about $900 million annually.Those expenses could hinder Munoz’s plan to find $3.1 billion in extra revenue or savings by 2018, analysts have said. Leaders of the flight attendants union overcame significant opposition over the past six weeks to get members to support the deal. Some from the Continental camp complained that the contract was more generous to United attendants because Continental workers have had a slightly higher wage scale in recent years. Other attendants wanted a signing bonus. The union countered that the airline would have offset any such provision with lower wages. 16 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2bg3KrZ TOP VIDEOS Pistons return to Detroit 2:35 American Center for Mobility breaks ground at historic Willow Run plant 2:42 Mary Barra, Michiganian of the Year 2:39 GM opens new Company Store at Renaissance Center 1:54 Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55

It’s all part of the space agency’s latest project known as NextSTEP-2, which involves the selection of six U.S. companies “to help expand knowledge, commercial capabilities, and opportunities in space by developing full-sized ground prototypes and concepts for deep space habitats.” NASA says that the goal is to provide support for lengthier and more involved human space flight missions, which will lead to Mars missions. This will also advance commercial development of space while moving forward with deep space exploration capabilities. The result will be more extensive human space flight missions by the moon that will be the proving grounds for Mars. “The NextSTEP partnerships are a large contribution to the dual objectives of advancing deep space habitation development and stimulating commercial activities in low-Earth orbit,” said Jason Crusan, Director of Advanced Exploration Systems at NASA Headquarters. Related: NASA adds five novel ideas to its initiative to cut planes’ fuel usage in half An appropriate deep space habitat requires a few key components, including docking capabilities, environmental control and life support systems, and radiation mitigation and monitoring processes. By building the proposed habitats on Earth first, NASA and its partners will have the opportunity to evaluate the configurations and observe how the systems interact with one another. Additionally, tests can be run to determine the viability of the prototypes. Included in the six selected partners are major players like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which are designing various modules for space exploration and habitation. Based on its findings and those of its partners, NASA will determine its “acquisition and deployment approach for the next phase of flight systems for deep space.” The current estimated budget for this research and development stands around $65 million, and hopefully, it’ll lead to the development of a real-life space habitat.

The world's fastest-growing major aviation market is grappling with a paucity of traffic controllers to meet growing demand, as many of them shun employment with the state-run Airports Authority of India, where starting monthly salaries can be as low as $250, and choose monetarily rewarding jobs with private airlines. Photographer: Prashanth Vishwanathan/Bloomberg Profit up at Etihad Indian partner Jet August 13, 2016 Updated: August 13, 2016 07:24 PM Topics: Etihad Airways Frank Kane India airline Jet Airways, a member of the Etihad Airways partnership, reported a surge in operating profit in the first quarter of the 2016-17 financial year, but warned intense competition in the air travel market would continue into the second half. The operating profit leapt by 124 per cent to US$33 million in the three months to June end for India’s second-largest carrier, boosted by a jump in the number of passengers and revenue delivered by its Etihad connection. Naresh Goyal, the chairman, said: "Jet Airways has strengthened its core operations and achieved better capacity utilisation and greater efficiency. We have been able to report lower non-fuel costs in spite of inflationary increases and the almost 6 per cent weakening of the Indian rupee against the US dollar." The strategic partnership with Etihad continues to be strong, he said. Code-share traffic delivered by Etihad and its other partner airlines to Jet grew by 41 per cent, while revenue from the Etihad alliance was up by 38 per cent. Mr Goyal, however, pointed to a tightening of aviation market conditions, which has put profits under pressure for American and European airlines. "Because of the intense competitive environment, industry yields were under pressure in the first quarter and the trend is expected to continue in the second." At the net level, profit fell to $19m compared with $33m last year, when there was an exceptional item on account of a contribution from aircraft lessors, the results stated. James Hogan, the vice chairman of Jet Airways and chief executive of Etihad Aviation Group, said: "Jet Airways is a key player in the Indian aviation market offering a full service product and a robust network. "We will continue to strengthen the partnership between Jet and Etihad by driving further synergies, along with other partner airlines. In a competitive market, we have together created a winning combination of a wider combined network and exceptional guest experience for travellers to and from India. "Jet continues to grow its traffic over the Abu Dhabi gateway, complementing the Etihad Airways network. "Together, we are the largest combined scheduled operator of flights to and from India with a 20 per cent market share. Our robust partnership continues to go from strength to strength," he said. Jet’s focus is on operational efficiency, reducing costs per available seat kilometre by 7 per cent and increasing aircraft use across its fleet of Boeing 737s to among the highest levels in the industry. Its passenger numbers increased by 4.4 per cent to 6.6 million. The UK’s Brexit vote, economic worries, fears of terrorist attacks and over-capacity on some transatlantic routes have all led to an increasingly negative view among investors on the big global airlines. Airberlin, another Etihad partner, last week announced widening losses and ongoing restructuring as terrorist attacks in Europe discouraged air travel in "challenging and volatile" conditions. Its second-quarter loss totalled €62.7m (Dh257m) before interest and tax, up from €15.9m in the comparable period last year. fkane@thenational.ae Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Super Hornet fighter jets order for Canadian military Maiden Airbus A350-1000 flight set for tomorrow Abu Dhabi Airports all geared up for F1 fans deluge Emirates A380 blossoms at Dubai Miracle Garden – video MOST VIEWED Business | All RAK opens unique Via Ferrata on Jebel Jais, the UAE’s highest mountain BlackBerry Dtek60 review: Phone maker returns to the fray Database for Dubai buildings set to complete next year Dubai granted land decree a catalyst for city building, says official Maiden Airbus A350-1000 flight set for tomorrow Can Dubai property owner terminate deal with real estate agency for not fulfilling duties?

Share story This week, let’s look at the state in the Pacific Northwest with one of the nation’s best economies, where its biggest city is seeing the country’s fastest housing-price appreciation — and no, this is not about Washington. Welcome to Oregon, 2016. With its dependence on durable-goods manufacturing and housing, Oregon suffered in the Great Recession. In May 2009, the unemployment rate nearly touched 12 percent, a high not seen since the nasty downturn of the early 1980s. Fast forward to this year. In May its unemployment rate was 4.5 percent, the lowest since modern record keeping began in the 1970s. June’s rate ticked up 0.3 points, a modest rise signaling discouraged workers re-entering the rising labor force.

By contrast, Washington’s June unemployment rate stood at a seasonally adjusted 5.8 percent. Nationally, unemployment was 4.9 percent in June. Other yardsticks are impressive, too. The state’s labor force is at a record high and jobs are keeping pace with population growth. Real gross domestic product rebounded early past its pre-recession peaks and has reached new records, too. It grew by 3.9 percent in the first quarter, tied with Washington and Arkansas for the fastest growth in the nation. According to the Census Bureau, real median household income shot up to $58,875 in 2014, the latest year for which data are available. That’s just shy of Washington’s number. It’s a convergence not seen since the end of the 1990s boom; historically Oregon trailed Washington. Nationally, median household income was $53,657. It’s also worth noting that while income for Oregonians hit a record in 2014, Washington was down nearly $9,800 from its peak in 1998. The epicenter of the Oregon boom is Portland, which has seen the hottest housing market in the nation for months. Last year, 11 percent of the metropolitan workforce was in advanced industries, the 15th strongest out of 100 metros nationally. This is no longer simply “the city where young people go to retire,” if it ever was. I don’t want to compare apples and cattle. Washington and Oregon share many characteristics but are not economic twins. Oregon is less populous, 4 million in 2015, vs. 7.1 million for Washington. Although Portland is nearly as large as the city of Seattle (632,309 vs. 684,451 in 2015), metro Seattle is much larger. The Seattle area also boasts two of the most valuable companies in the country, Amazon and Microsoft, as well as such major headquarters as Starbucks, Nordstrom, Weyerhaeuser and Expedia. It is home to one of the nation’s leading public universities, a major biomedical cluster and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. And don’t forget Boeing and the aerospace sector. Portland lost container shipping service while Seattle and Tacoma remain major seaports. Beyond Nike and Columbia Sportswear, PDX’s headquarters are less well known. Its big deal is semiconductor engineering and manufacturing, especially with Intel and its approximately 19,500 workers. But this undersells a shift in Silicon Forest to a constellation of younger homegrown tech companies, according to a 2014 report in The Oregonian. Like Seattle, Portland has also been a beneficiary of Silicon Valley companies opening outposts there. It’s more affordable than the Bay Area, but growth and rapidly rising house prices are causing local angst (sound familiar?). The housing-cost problem is made worse by the little new construction seen after the recession. So, what’s driving Oregon’s economy? Population growth is a big factor, especially of college-educated young people. Job increases are broad-based, but especially in health care, business and professional services, and leisure and hospitality. Still, the state has a history of volatility, especially in construction and manufacturing jobs, including those connected to chipmaking. In May, Intel warned employees they could see more layoffs if enough don’t take buyouts. Which state has the better wine? That’s beyond my tippling expertise: I enjoy both. Like all states, Oregon shows sharp differences among its regions, especially between metro and rural areas. For example, nonmetro areas in southern Oregon “still have a long way to go to regain all of their lost jobs,” according to Josh Lehner, an economist in the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, who writes an illuminating blog on the state economy. Most of rural Oregon is growing again but still suffers from the decline of the timber industry that started in the 1980s. The population is older and less likely to be of prime working age. On the other hand, nearly all of the state’s counties have seen population growth. The resort-retirement area of Bend, savaged by the housing crash, is booming again. Without the cushion of the Puget Sound aerospace cluster, Oregon manufacturing remains weak. Among its head winds are loss of demand for material in the Oil Patch because of falling petroleum prices and a strong dollar. Job polarization — the loss of middle-wage jobs — is another common problem found in Oregon. For example, factory employment remains well below pre-recession levels. The workforce in accommodations and food services, which typically pays less, has been at record highs. Lehner told me the state’s fast growth should ease off as it reaches close to full employment. “The problem is the economy does not typically then transition down to something sustainable,” he said. “It slams down into recession and you start the cycle over. But we are approaching full employment and there aren’t too many worrisome things on the horizon at the moment.” You may reach Jon Talton atjtalton@seattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Do you really want a world in which the U.S. makes all its own shirts, and Bangladesh tries to build its own planes? Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday gave a virtual mirror image of the speech that Donald Trump gave earlier this week. Trump went to Detroit to tell a story of the decline of U.S. manufacturing. Clinton went to a high-tech factory in the suburbs to talk about its rebirth. There’s one area, though, where Clinton and Trump have some points of agreement: trade. The Hillary Clinton of a few years ago was an advocate of free trade. The campaign has pushed her toward protectionism. The implicit message of Clinton’s speech was that we could make great things in the U.S. and ship them abroad. And we can! But that’s the funny thing about trade discussion these days: They all take place on Trump’s terms, and the discussion is largely about how the U.S. can make more stuff at home and buy less from abroad. And if every country acted that way — well, you can guess the result. The protectionist bandwagon is getting pretty full now. There will still be plenty of time to climb on it if you want. But before you do, some questions that may help you gauge if that wagon is really headed in the direction you want to go: Clinton visited an advanced auto parts factory, right? No, not exactly. She spoke at the plant of a company called Futuramic Tool & Engineering. Futuramic once made parts for the auto industry, but that’s no longer its focus. It’s now, Clinton said in her speech, an aerospace company, making parts for the F-35 fighter plane and the tools that will be used to assemble the next generation Space Launch System Rocket (NASA’s replacement for the space shuttle). The F-35, that’s a military program, isn’t it? What does that have to do with trade? Yes, the F-35 is indeed a military program. The fighter airplane is also likely to become one of the biggest U.S. exports. A number of partner countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and several other NATO members are also supplying parts for the plane. They are now testing it, and will be future buyers when it hits final production. Another buyer? Japan. Japan has already ordered parts from the U.S. that will be used to assemble F-35s in a factory overseas. Got that? We are buying parts from Europe for F-35s to build here, some of which will be exported back. We are also sending parts to Japan for F-35s that will be built there. Trade gets complicated that way. Every country plays the “make it here if you want to sell it here” game to some degree. That’s part of the reason large-scale projects like the F-35 source components from around the world. The idea, hopefully, is that in the end the best companies in each place get a piece of the business, not that one country will “win” by building everything. What about private aerospace? The U.S. does have a big private aerospace industry. Most of it, however, is headquartered on the West Coast. In fact, Futuramic recently opened an office there, to be close to Boeing and other companies like Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s rocket company. Going to California or Michigan wouldn’t present the same contrast with Donald Trump’s speech, which portrayed Detroit as a desert of failure and decline. Ironically, Michigan has actually been a quiet success story. It’s unemployment rate is now 4.6% —lower than the national average, and lower than those of California or Washington. Hey, what about cars? Don’t they still make them in the United States? Why didn’t Clinton go to that kind of plant? Yes, there are definitely cars still made in the U.S. Like the Toyota Camry. Cars.com, which compiles an “American Made” index each year, found eight cars in 2016 that were composed of at least 75% U.S.-made parts. Five of those were made by Toyota or Honda. (Did we mention that trade was complicated?) In 2015, it was just seven. A decade ago, it was more than 20. So, basically: Fewer cars are made primarily in the United States. Most of the ones that are are what many folks still think of a “Japanese cars.” Didn’t Clinton say Trump could make his suits and shirts here? She did, and he could. On her campaign website, Clinton provided a list of U.S. makers for all the stuff sold under the Trump name. (Incidentally, Trump doesn’t really make it all; he just licenses his brand.) There are a lot of great manufacturers on that list, some venerable names you might have heard of. It’s a clever conceit, but here’s the big caveat: A lot of the U.S.-manufactured apparel is pretty high-end items. Trump collection suits run from $144 to $280 at Amazon.com; a typical Hickey Freeman suit is about $547. Many of the shirts made in the U.S. are finely tailored, intriguingly designed — and much, much more expensive than you are probably used to paying. Dress shirts from Mizzen+Main in Dallas, are priced at $125; ones from O’Connell’s in Buffalo, N.Y. will generally set you back about $125 to $165. Nothing wrong with that. There are good reasons to make shirts domestically. For instance, you can maintain an extensive catalog of styles, then quickly make and deliver a new batch of the most popular one. If you can afford these shirts, great. But most Americans don’t spend that much (and even most of those who do probably get some cheaper ones, as well). What’s left of the U.S. apparel industry specializes in a fairly high-end product. If you think it’s better that all our apparel should be made in the U.S., be prepared for much higher prices. You may wonder, by the way, about those countries that do make cheaper apparel, like Bangladesh. Do they buy anything from the United States? Oh, yes, they do. And at this point you might even guess what: Biman Bangladesh Airlines is waiting for a delivery of new Boeing 787 Dreamliners. But all that only works if other countries don’t put up barriers to U.S. products, right? And do things like protect our intellectual property? Sigh. Yes, that’s right. Actually, the Trans-Pacific Partnership was about taking down those barriers. It would facilitate the kind of trade in which a U.S. maker buys some parts from Asia, others from the United States, and ships the finished, high-tech product around the world — just like that F-35. In Michigan, Clinton unequivocally promised to kill it: “I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as president.” It would be hard for her to step back from that in the Oval Office. It’s really a read-my-lips-no-trade-deal moment. Does that mean the infamous TPP is dead in a Clinton presidency? Well, maybe. But in the business world there’s a huge amount of backing for something like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Sure, it might get chopped up, renamed, and partially “renegotiated,” but there’s a good chance we’ll have a trade deal of some sort, just called something else.

Spaceflight Insider Search Search Home Archive Gallery Launch Calendar Mission Monitor SpaceX’s rate of launch set to accelerate with launch of JCSAT-16 Jason Rhian August 12th, 2016 An archive photo of a Falcon 9 rocket inside the company’s Horizontal Integration Facility. JCSAT-16 is slated to launch Aug. 14, 2016, from Space Launch Complex 40. Photo Credit: SpaceX CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — With the year more than half over, SpaceX is ramping up launch operations at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station’s Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) in Florida. Not one but two launches are planned between now and Sept. 3. While not as exciting as a mission to the International Space Station, these commercial flights are helping SpaceX demonstrate it can rapidly send payloads into orbit. The first flight, that of the JCSAT-16 telecommunications satellite, is currently set to take to the skies at 1:26 a.m. EDT (05:26 GMT) Aug. 14 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Space Station’s SLC-40. When the Space System Loral-built comm sat launches, it will mark the eighth mission this year carried out by Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX. Weather conditions currently provide an 80 percent chance of favorable conditions for launch. The primary weather concerns for this mission are cumulus and thick clouds. JCSAT-16, nearly identical to the JCSAT-14 satellite launched May 6, 2016, is seen during tests at Space Systems Loral. Photo Credit: Space Systems Loral This particular flight will mark the second time SpaceX has lofted a payload on behalf of Japanese Corporation Sky Perfect JSAT Corporation. The first was JCSAT-14, which launched May 6 of this year (2016). SpaceX has approximately two hours in which to launch the satellite. Once in orbit, JCSAT-16 will be controlled by the JSAT telecommunications firm. According to an article posted on NASASpaceFlight.com, JCSAT-16 is based on the SSL-1300 bus and was constructed by Space Systems Loral. According to a report appearing on Spaceflight Now, the satellite will serve as an on-orbit spare for the JCSAT fleet and is targeted to reside at 162 degrees east longitude in a geostationary orbit. It will employ its array of Ku and Ka-band transponders and antennas to provide communications services across Asia. In its role as a spare, the new spacecraft will work to serve as a back-up for JSAT’s Superbird B2 satellite (which was launched on an Ariane 4 booster in 2000). The launch vehicle successfully carried out a static hot fire test at approximately 11 p.m. EDT August 10 (03:00 GMT Aug. 11). This is the last major milestone that all of the roughly 229.6-foot (70-meter) tall Falcon rockets undergo before being sent aloft. The two-stage “Full Thrust” Falcon 9 is the latest version of SpaceX’s highly-successful rocket. First flown in 2010, the rocket has been modified to include capabilities no other in-service rocket has achieved in the nearly 60 years since the start of the Space Age. SpaceX stunned long-time space analysts on Dec. 22 of last year (and again on July 18, 2016) by having the first stage of the Falcon 9 conduct a controlled landing back at Cape Canaveral’s Landing Zone 1 (LZ-1, formerly Space Launch Complex 13). However, as any naval aviator will tell you, it is far more difficult to land on a moving platform out at sea – but this is something SpaceX has also become adept at achieving. The NewSpace firm has managed to have the first stage of its rocket land on what are known as Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ships (ASDS) three times so far. SpaceX is hoping that Sunday’s launch attempt will mark the fourth time the Of Course I Still Love You ASDS will transport another stage back to Port Canaveral. The company has stated it plans to reuse one of the flown stages as early as this fall (according to reports on Space.com and Space News). If and when SpaceX successfully demonstrates the ability fly pre-flown stages again, the paradigm and associated cost of launching payloads to orbit should drop significantly. An archive photo of the JCSAT-14 satellite prior to its encapsulation in the Falcon 9’s payload fairing. Photo Credit: SpaceX To date, only SpaceX has demonstrated the ability to return the first stage, and more importantly, the stage’s expensive nine Merlin 1D rocket engines back safely to Earth. The “Full Thrust” Falcon 9 has a mass of some 1,207,920 pounds (549,054 kilograms). Measuring an estimated 12 feet (3.7 meters) in diameter, the rocket is described by SpaceX as being able to send some 50,265 pounds (22,800 kilograms) to low-Earth orbit (LEO) or 18,300 pounds (8,300 kilograms) to a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO). Nine Merlin 1D engines along with aluminum-lithium alloy tanks, which contain the launch vehicle’s liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene (RP-1) propellant, are incorporated into the Falcon 9’s first stage. According to SpaceX, the amount of thrust the Merlin 1Ds provide is more than what five Boeing 747s aircraft produce – at full power. The Falcon 9 is capable of producing an estimated 1.7 million pound-force (7,607 kilonewtons) of thrust at sea level and 1.85 million pound-force (8,227 kilonewtons) in vacuum. Flight computers ensure the rocket is in prime health before it is released from the pad and allowed to get the mission underway. After lifting off, the engines in the rocket’s first stage are throttled at the close of the stage’s flight. This is done so as to restrict the rocket’s acceleration as the Falcon 9’s mass diminishes with the burning of its fuel. While the flight of a comm sat might not seem all that important for the 14-year-old launch service provider, for SpaceX, JCSAT-16 should serve to increase a key metric for the company – its rate of launch. As noted, this will mark the eighth time a Falcon 9 has taken to the skies, either from the Cape or from Vandenberg Air Force Base’s Space Launch Complex 4E (East). Two flights, the CASSIOPE and Jason 3 missions, have launched from Vandenberg, with the remainder launching from the Cape’s SLC-40. SpaceX’s launch operations are also set to expand to Florida’s Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A) in 2017 and the under-construction Boca Chica launch complex in Texas sometime in 2018. The company was looking to see the first flight of the NewSpace firm’s giant Falcon Heavy occur at LC-39A late this year. However, according to NASASpaceflight, that has been pushed to early 2017. Additionally, earlier plans had called for the SpaceX to conduct, sometime in 2016, an in-flight abort of their Crew Dragon spacecraft. However, last year, NASA announced this test would take place sometime after their first unpiloted test flight of the capsule – currently scheduled for May 2017. The abort test would utilize the same capsule used in the uncrewed test flight. After this weekend’s flight, next up for SpaceX is the Sept. 2 launch of the AMOS-6 satellite, which is being flown to provide broadband coverage to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The communications payload is built by Canadian-based company MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. (MDA) and is being launched to replace the aging AMOS-2 satellite.

The company, based in Mountain View, California, plans to launch the small, 110-pound Prospector-1 spacecraft as part of their ambition to mine near-Earth asteroids, Grant Bonin, Deep Space Industries chief engineer, told Space.com. “This is intended to be a very low cost first commercial mission to an asteroid.” The mission is an important first step in the company’s plan to mine near-Earth asteroids for resources it can sell to other space-based companies. The small mining spacecraft is designed to visit asteroids and look for deposits of ice or water that other spacecraft could use as fuel. Every asteroid is different, so the space mining satellite will probably need to visit a few different space rocks before it finds one with the right minerals, Bonin told Space.com. “We’ve got about half a dozen very, very attractive targets, which as you might imagine we’re playing very close to our vest.” The Prospector-1 will launch into low-Earth orbit as a secondary payload aboard a space shuttle and then use its own fuel to break out of Earth’s orbit and head for deep space. It will use water as fuel to approach the selected asteroid and maintain its orbit around the space rock as it looks for ice deposits. The spacecraft will be equipped with infrared cameras and a neutron spectrometer it will use to map the asteroid’s surface and probe its interior. Then, it will attempt to land on the asteroid at a site likely to contain water so it can conduct additional experiments and claim the space rock for the private mining company. Deep Space Industries hasn’t announced specific mission dates yet as the timing will depend on which asteroid the company chooses to visit first, but it has promised to launch by the end of the decade, Bonin told SpaceNews. “We have mission concepts of operation that give us departure windows every year from 2019 to 2022.” Before that happens, the asteroid mining company will launch a technology demonstration mission using their Prospector-X spacecraft in 2017. Space Mining Company Unveils First Asteroid Prospecting Spacecraft For Interplanetary Mission 5 4 3 AsteroidMiningSpace Asteroid Mining Prospector Follow-up missions will use the water and ice extracted from asteroids as fuel to power other mining spacecraft and as a commodity to sell to other space travel companies, Bonin told SpaceNews. “Water is going to be a key enabler of the cislunar economy. It’s a grand vision, but it’s predicated on the use of space resources.” A number of companies plan to develop cislunar space, the area between the Earth and the moon commonly called low-Earth orbit, by creating a space transportation system. The plan, put forward by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co., involves using a form of water as fuel to dramatically cut down on the cost of space travel, ULA Spokesman George Sowers, told Space.com. “I want to buy propellant in space. Once I have a reusable stage and can buy my fuel, then I have the potential to dramatically lower costs to go elsewhere. I can potentially do that whole mission cheaper if I can get propellant cheap enough in low Earth orbit.” A rocket lifting off from Earth would only need to carry enough propellant to reach orbit if there was a gas station in space where it could refuel before continuing on its mission. The ULA venture envisions 1,000 people working in space by 2045. The plan involves mining the moon for valuable resources and construction of a lunar tanker to transport the minerals into orbit. The first private customer looking to buy space-mined resources and their budget for buying resources would set a standard that other space companies could use to develop their own operations.

If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen As the Canadian government continues to come under fire for exports of armoured personnel carriers to countries like Saudi Arabia and South Sudan, our own military is looking to augment its capabilities with an entirely new type of ground vehicle. Story continues below Related Drug trafficking charge laid against Canadian Forces member Following in the footsteps of the American military, Canada has issued a call for tender for 52 new ultra-light combat vehicles, or ULCVs. READ MORE: Dion approved $11B in export permits for armoured vehicles destined for Saudi Arabia The ULCVs will be four-passenger, Jeep-like vehicles that are small and light enough to fit inside a Canadian Forces’ CC-177 Globemaster aircraft, a CC-130 Hercules aircraft or a CH-147 Chinook helicopter (or to be lifted externally by helicopter). According to the tender documents, published earlier this week, they must also be designed “to be air dropped with a 900 kg payload” from either the Globemaster or the Hercules, and detached/offloaded from the helicopter within five minutes. WATCH: Auditor General finds Canadian military struggling to recruit They need to be able to operate in extreme temperatures (-32C to +49C), handle a combination of urban and rural environments (mountainous, plains, jungle and woodland) and will be off-road 75 per cent of the time, the documents note. “The Department of National Defence (DND) will be using the ULCV as a complimentary vehicle to increase mobility across a spectrum of operations,” confirmed department spokesperson Ashley Lemire in an email to Global News. “The ULCV is a new type of vehicle and will be used in concert with the current fleet of DND ground vehicles to increase mobility on operations.” Increasing ground mobility The ULCV can be used for a variety of different missions and tasks, Lemire noted, extending the “tactical mobility needs” of troops in the field. In plain English, that could mean providing quick deployment into a hostile area, cutting down on the distance soldiers need to walk before reaching an active battle zone. The ULCVs may also give troops an easier entry and exit during reconnaissance or surveillance missions, and help avoid putting helicopters within the range of enemy fire that could shoot them down. “The range and maneuverability of (the) ULCV is an increase over portions of the current fleet of vehicles,” Lemire said. The call for tender notes that DND will have the option of adding 26 more vehicles to the total within two years. There are several possible options in terms of the model of ULCV Canada may acquire. U.S. defence firm Polaris could be a contender with its DAGOR model, as could aerospace giant Boeing with the Phantom Badger. The total cost of the new acquisition will depend on the bids received, but Polaris’ DAGOR models for example, run around US$150,000 apiece. That’s around CAD$194,000 at the current exchange rate. Tight timeline Much like their American counterparts, department officials are moving quickly to add ULCVs to the roster of available ground vehicles as the role of special operations groups becomes more prominent. Among other missions, Canadians special forces are currently carrying out training work in Iraq with local Kurdish troops fighting the so-called Islamic State. WATCH: PM Trudeau outlines Canada’s new role in fighting ISIS This week’s call for tender comes just under a year after an initial request for information, which went out last August, and the first 52 vehicles are expected to be delivered by Nov. 15, 2017. Asked if the American move to purchase a fleet of ULCVs prompted the Canadian tender, Lemire said that “while we must ensure our equipment remains compatible with other nations with whom we frequently work, the equipment we acquire must also meet the essential requirements … needed for the (Canadian Armed Forces) to achieve the missions assigned by the Government of Canada.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

On August 24th, a giant Ariane-5 rocket is scheduled to carry Intelsat-33e and Intelsat 36 into geostationary transfer orbit.  It will be Ariane’s overall sixth mission this year, and the fourth by the heavyweight Ariane rocket. Intelsat 33e – the first of the two payloads to arrive in French Guiana – has completed its initial checkout, and during preparations, was installed on the launch vehicle’s SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system, and which automatically discharges the satellite from the rocket’s payload bay. The latter step was performed in the Spaceport’s Final Assembly Building and positions Intelsat 33e for the upper slot of Ariane 5’s payload arrangement. I-33e was built by Space Systems/Loral. As the second spacecraft of the next-generation Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e – which was produced by Boeing – integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission earlier this year in January.

Clinton said Trump has “made a career of stiffing small businesses from Atlantic City to Las Vegas.” On taxes, Clinton hit the pass-through part of Trump’s corporate tax reform plan as well as his proposal to end the inheritance tax and reduce the top rate to 33 percent: “He would give trillions in tax cuts to big corporations, millionaires, and Wall Street money managers. That would explode our national debt ... He’d pay a lower rate than millions of middle class families.” Story Continued Below She also sought to portray Trump’s vision of America as out-of-step with reality: “I just wish my opponent in this election saw the same Michigan I do. When Donald Trump visited Detroit on Monday, he talked only of failure, poverty, and crime. He’s missing so much.” WEAKEST POINT: TRADE — Clinton flip-flopped on TPP during her campaign against Bernie Sanders and her criticism of the deal still sounds like the worst kind of inauthentic pandering. Where she is strong: “[T]he answer is not to rant and rave — or to cut ourselves off from the world. That would kill even more jobs. The answer is to finally make trade work for us, not against us. Where she isn’t: “So my message to every worker in Michigan and across America is this: I will stop any trade deal that kills jobs or holds down wages — including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. I oppose it now, I’ll oppose it after the election, and I’ll oppose it as President." What’s missing here? Any explanation for how TPP would kill jobs and hold down wages. Perhaps Clinton’s transition from TPP as “gold standard” to TPP as unacceptable was a political necessity. But it’s still pretty pathetic to watch. CLINTON CAMPAIGN LETS TRUMP BE TRUMP — POLITICO’s Eli Stokols: “In what was billed as a major economic policy speech .. Clinton drew a sharp contrast between her plan and ... Trump’s — but she colored softly, content to do or say very little that would divert the media’s attention from her opponent. ... Clinton’s criticisms of the GOP nominee were notable in their cool, clipped delivery — not dripping with animosity or the urgency of a candidate in an actual fight. “It’s a deliberate strategy. As polls show Trump trailing by significant and widening margins in every swing state, the Democratic nominee and her team are eager to keep Clinton’s head down and allow American voters to watch Trump undercut his own economic agenda by spouting incendiary comments” http://politi.co/2bmld2t REACT — Bankrate’s Mark Hamrick: “Clinton clearly was trying to appeal to the sense of loss felt in Michigan and other areas historically reliant on manufacturing ... But it is unrealistic, and even misleading, to suggest their previous manufacturing strength can be restored.” The left loved the TPP stuff. Charles Chamberlain, Executive Director, Democracy for America: “In particular, the clear opposition ... voiced to the job-killing [TPP] ... is the strongest we've heard from her ... and will undoubtedly help build the support necessary to kill this miserable trade deal ... However, it's now more important than ever that the country and President Obama hear specifically from Secretary Clinton that a vote on the job-killing TPP during a lame duck session of Congress must not happen." MORE CLINTON TREASURY TALK — Per a former Treasury official: “It is important to think about whether Clinton sees Warren and Sanders' support for her Treasury Secretary pick as essential. Brainard is unlikely to be seen as any sort of give to the left. “She was central to pushing TPP and other big trade agreements going back decades. She kept China from being labeled as a currency manipulator. And she has done nothing at the Fed to push big banks to shrink. Clinton says regulators need to be tougher on big banks. If not Fed governors, who is she talking about?” Lew to stay on? Per MM’s mail bag: “I’ve heard rumblings about Dr. Brainard as well, but have also heard the Lew may stay on a while for continuity and one less nomination fight (esp if GOP keeps Senate)” TRUMP ADDS MORE ECON ADVISERS — Per release: “The newest additions to our economic team include, Diane Hendricks, Darlene Jordan, Betsy McCaughey, Brooke Rollins, Carla Sands, Anthony Scaramucci, Judy Shelton, Liz Uihlein, and Kathleen Hartnett White” Bios: http://bit.ly/2blTwXK MORE DONORS — POLITICO’s Shane Goldmacher: “[M]ore than half the additions have either already given Trump money or have pledged to help raise campaign cash for him and the Republican Party. One new addition, hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, contributed $100,000 to Trump's joint fundraising committee with the GOP, known as Trump Victory. Another, Carla Sands, hosted a multi-million-dollar fundraiser for Trump last month at her southern California home” http://politi.co/2b0b3DE GOP TO RNC: CUT OFF TRUMP MONEY — POLITICO’s Anna Palmer: “More than 70 Republicans have signed an open letter to [RNC] Chairman Reince Priebus urging him to stop spending any money to help ... Trump win in November and shift those contributions to Senate and House races. The letter comes as a number of Republican senators and high-profile GOP national security officials have come forward saying they cannot vote for Trump. “Former Sen. Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire and former Reps. Chris Shays of Connecticut, Tom Coleman of Missouri and Vin Weber of Minnesota are among the Republicans lending their name to the letter. Close to 20 of the co-signers are former RNC staffers” http://politi.co/2b1XQMu EMAILS KEEP DOGGING CLINTON — WSJ’s Peter Nicholas and Byron Tau: “The email controversy that ... Clinton hoped had died out when federal prosecutors closed their investigation last month now looks likely to shadow her campaign all the way through Election Day. Rolling releases of emails from Mrs. Clinton’s time as secretary of state, combined with her own failure to provide succinct, consistent answers on her email practices, have kept the issue simmering. .... “The drumbeat is undercutting Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy and hindering her efforts to seize fuller control of the presidential race by painting ... Trump as an unacceptable alternative. Last October, 42% of people polled said her use of a private email system while secretary of state was an ‘important factor’ in whether to vote for her, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed. A survey last month found that figure had jumped to 55%.” http://on.wsj.com/2aX62Pf TRUMP CONFRONTS LOSING — For CNBC, I looked at Trump’s comments about losing and going on a long vacation and asked the question: Does he really want to win?" http://cnb.cx/2aFH1sR GOOD FRIDAY MORNING — Last MM for me in August.

OLYMPICS BLAST — Yet more gold for Michael Phelps. But silver medal redemption for Aly Raisman and gold for the incredible Simone Biles really topped the day in Rio. What a pair of super stars. Yes MM shed a few tears when Raisman finished her floor exercise. We aren’t made of stone! Also incredible: Simone Manuel becoming the first African-American woman to win gold in an individual swimming event. What a moment. So proud. #USA http://bit.ly/2aPFsK4 TRUMP’S TAX CUT FOR TRUMP — WP’s Jim Tankersley: “A little-noticed provision in ... Trump’s tax reform plan has the potential to deliver a large tax cut to companies in the Republican presidential nominee’s vast business empire, experts say. Trump’s plan would dramatically reduce taxes on what is known in tax circles as ‘pass-through’ entities, which do not pay corporate income taxes, but whose owners are taxed at individual rates on their share of profits. “Those entities are the most common structure for small businesses and increasingly popular for larger ones as well. They are also a cornerstone of the Trump Organization. On his 2015 presidential financial disclosure report, Trump listed holdings of more than 200 limited liability corporations, which is a form of pass-through. ... [T]he provision highlights the tensions between Trump’s policy proposals and his personal financial interests. He would also benefit from his proposals to cut top income tax rates and eliminate federal taxes on inherited wealth” http://wapo.st/2b20aTK GOOGLE IS THE NEW GOLDMAN (IN D.C.) — Bloomberg View’s Justin Fox: “You remember ‘Government Sachs,’ right? It’s the nickname that gained currency during the financial crisis for the Wall Street firm and its alumni, who seemed to occupy every crucial position in Washington. Well, now there’s Govergle. Or maybe it’s Googlement. Alphament, anyone? ... Google/Alphabet’s annual spending on lobbying, for example, went from less than $1 million a decade ago to $16.7 million in 2015, putting it behind only Boeing and General Electric ... “But there is also a weirdly tight relationship between the company and the Obama administration. Since Obama took office in January 2009, at least 250 people have left Google and related companies for jobs in the administration or vice versa. Oh, and in 2012 Schmidt actually helped recruit the Obama campaign technology team and spent election night in the campaign 'boiler room' in Chicago” http://bloom.bg/2bmCdpl NO TAX TRUMP? — NYT’s James B. Stewart: “Mitt Romney was excoriated during the 2012 presidential campaign for paying $4.9 million in federal income tax, or an average of just 14 percent of his adjusted gross income, in the two years for which he released returns. No one should be surprised, though, if Trump has paid far less — perhaps even zero federal income tax in some years. Indeed, that’s the expectation of numerous real estate and tax professionals I’ve interviewed in recent weeks. “Even with hundreds of millions in gross revenue from his vast real estate empire, ‘it’s both possible and legal that Donald Trump would pay little or no income tax,’ said Len Green, an accountant and chairman of the Green Group, a tax and accounting advisory firm. ... ‘I would expect he’s paying little or no tax,’ agreed Steven M. Rosenthal, a veteran tax lawyer and senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy center.” http://nyti.ms/2b16WHm STOCKS PARTY LIKE IT’S 1999 — WSJ’s Corrie Driebusch and Aaron Kuriloff: “A troika of stock indexes hit highs in tandem for the first time since 1999. The question is whether the party is just getting started. On Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite all rose to new highs on the same day, an alignment that hasn’t occurred since Dec. 31, 1999. ... “The Dow is up 6.8% this year, the S&P 6.9% and the Nasdaq Composite 4.4%. For some traders, the trend suggests stocks could enjoy a sudden surge. The bump could happen once investors return from summer vacations and begin taking some cash off the sidelines, they say. U.S. stock-trading volumes have been below the 2016 average in recent weeks. The consensus one-year target for the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now more than 20000” http://on.wsj.com/2aKJFJu MACY TO SHUTTER 100 STORES — NYT’s Rachel Abrams and Sapna Maheshwari: “The great American consumer is very much alive. It’s just that people aren’t shopping like they used to, reluctant to pay full price or even leave the couch ... For legacy stores, the fallout from this shift has been profound, perhaps never more apparent than this week. Macy’s, the country’s largest department store, said on Thursday that it would close 100 stores, saying they were more valuable as real estate properties. “Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, announced on Monday that it would buy a small online rival for more than $3 billion. The hope is that the deal will reverse its sputtering online growth. Other retailers have taken aggressive action, too, trying to turn their fortunes around. Billions of dollars have been poured into e-commerce efforts. Stores have turned to sharp discounting, temporarily lifting sales but hurting profits and upsetting partners. But almost always, these efforts have led to mediocre results” http://nyti.ms/2aFFraj BANK LAWYER FIRED OF FANNIE MAE RELATIONSHIP — FT’s Ben McLannahan: “The largest bank in Ohio fired its top lawyer last month after she said she was in a romantic relationship with the chief executive of Fannie Mae, the government-backed mortgage company — who has been allowed to keep his job. The case highlights differing views of the best way to handle relationships between executives at connected companies. “Like many banks in the US, Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp has a big business supplying Fannie Mae and its sibling company, Freddie Mac, with mortgages that are later bundled into securities guaranteed by the government. When Timothy Mayopoulos, chief executive of Fannie Mae, told an internal office of compliance and ethics in March that he was in a relationship with Heather Russell, former chief legal officer at Fifth Third, his employer had no problem with it ... But Fifth Third considered the relationship represented ‘a conflict of interest’” http://on.ft.com/2aPjofP CHINA FALTERS — Bloomberg: “China’s recent economic stabilization faltered in July as factory output, retail sales and investment all slowed. Industrial production rose 6 percent from a year earlier in July, the National Bureau of Statistics said Friday. Retail sales climbed 10.2 percent last month, while fixed-asset investment increased 8.1 percent in the first seven months of the year. All three readings missed economists estimates. “Bloomberg’s monthly gross domestic product tracker slipped to 6.94 percent in July, from 7.13 percent a month earlier. The slowdown sharpens the dilemma facing the nation’s policy makers — boost growth with cheap credit that risks undermining financial stability, or curb debt expansion even if that slows the economy.” http://bloom.bg/2b19zsY Mohamed A. El-Erian on Bloomberg View on the coming retirement crisis: “With interest rates extremely low and the prices of stocks and bonds at historic highs, finding safe investments that can help guarantee a comfortable retirement has become increasingly difficult. “This has put the managers of pension funds and other institutions that invest on behalf of future retirees in a difficult position, driving them to take ever greater risks in hopes of meeting their performance objectives — targets that are unlikely to be met absent a major revamp of economic policies and corporate prospects. As a result, individuals are increasingly being exposed to the threat of losses that can not be recouped quickly” TIME FOR BETTER ONLINE LENDING DISCLOSURE — Brayden McCarthy in an American Banker op-ed: “Since 2000, the so-called Schumer box has been to credit cards what nutrition labels are to food. Instead of listing calorie and carbohydrate counts, the summary table requires disclosure of basic numbers like the interest rate and annual fee at the top of credit card solicitations. ... Yet when that same consumer applies for a small-business loan, he or she is left in the dark.” http://bit.ly/2blM29L « View Archives Authors: Ben White bwhite@politico.com @morningmoneyben About The Author Ben White is POLITICO Pro's chief economic correspondent and author of the “Morning Money” column covering the nexus of finance and public policy.

New payload preparation milestones bring Ariane 5's upcoming mission closer to liftoff by Staff Writers Kourou, French Guiana (ESA) Aug 12, 2016 File image. The two satellite passengers for Ariane 5's August 24 flight - both of which will be orbited at the service of global operator Intelsat - are advancing through their payload preparation phases during parallel activity at the Spaceport in French Guiana. Designated Flight VA232 in Arianespace's numbering system, the upcoming mission will loft Intelsat 33e and Intelsat 36 to geostationary transfer orbit. It is scheduled as the company's sixth launch to be performed in 2016, as well as the fourth this year using a heavy-lift Ariane 5. Arianespace's full launcher family is rounded out by the medium-weight Soyuz and light-lift Vega. Intelsat 33e - the first of the two payloads to arrive in French Guiana - has completed its initial checkout, and during preparations carried out yesterday, was installed on the launch vehicle's SYLDA dual-passenger dispenser system. The latter step was performed in the Spaceport's Final Assembly Building and positions Intelsat 33e for the upper slot of Ariane 5's payload arrangement. As the second spacecraft of the next-generation Intelsat EpicNG series, Intelsat 33e - which was produced by Boeing - integrates one of the most advanced commercially-available digital payloads in the world. The first Intelsat EpicNG satellite, Intelsat 29e, was successfully delivered to geostationary transfer orbit on an Ariane 5 mission performed in January. Flight VA232's Intelsat 36 co-passenger marked an important pre-launch milestone of its own yesterday with the loading of onboard propellant, which occurred in the S5A hall of the Spaceport's S5 payload preparation facility. Following its upcoming transfer to the Final Assembly Building, this spacecraft will be integrated as the August 24 mission's lower payload. Built by SSL (Space Systems Loral), Intelsat 36 will enhance Intelsat's premier direct-to-home neighborhood in Africa after reaching its final orbital position.

State Dept. approves $231 million munitions sale to NATO countries by Geoff Ziezulewicz Washington (UPI) Aug 11, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only The U.S. State Department has approved the proposed sale of $231 million in guided munitions to several European countries. Required notification was sent to Congress on Tuesday, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which oversees the U.S. Foreign Military Sales program, said in a statement Thursday. NATO's support and procurement agency requested the sale, which includes equipment and support, on behalf of Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, The Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain. The order includes 2,040 joint direct attack munition guidance kits of various iterations, as well as computer control groups, joint programmable fuzes and bomb fin assembly and airfoil groups. Also included in the deal would be laser sensors, proximity sensors, avionics kit interfaces, electronic bomb fuzes, repair and return services, transportation, engineering services and other support services. The sale would improve NATO members' ability to meet current and future ground threats and provide a deterrent to regional threats, the agency said. Boeing Corporation and Raytheon Missile Systems would be the prime production contractors. Swedish military orders Carl-Gustaf ammunition Linkoping, Sweden (UPI) Aug 11, 2016 - Sweden's Defense Material Administration has tapped Saab for the supply of ammunition for the Carl-Gustaf recoilless rifle. The ammunition, in a variety of types, will be delivered next year and is worth more than $14.3 million. "With this order, of both live and training ammunition, the Swedish Armed Forces continues its efforts to increase the capability of its army on the battlefield. The order is definitely a strong proof of the customer's trust in the system and in Saab as a supplier," said Gorgen Johansson, head of Saab's Dynamics business area. The Carl-Gustaf is an 84mm anti-tank that was originally introduced in 1948. Its modern version is used in anti-armor warfare as well as for clearing obstacles and engaging enemies in buildings. Additional details of the Swedish military order were not disclosed.

Showbiz Celebrity News Margot Robbie to play tragic trapeze artist Lillian Leitzel in Queen of the Air The actress is no stranger to acrobatics having received her “trapeze certificate” aged eight Emma Powell Friday 12 August 2016 09:28 BST New role: Margot Robbie will show off her circus skills Dave Benett Margot Robbie will play a trapeze artist in new film, Queen of the Air. The Australian actress has been cast as tragic circus star Lillian Leitzel in the film adaptation of Dean N. Jensen’s 2013 nonfiction book of the same name. The film will follow Leitzel’s volatile love affair with fellow acrobat Alfredo Codona up until their deaths. Leitzel was an acrobatic sensation in the 1920s who was famed for her signature move, the one arm plange. Read more 8 reasons why we want to be best friends with Margot Robbie At 4 foot 9 inches tall, she would turn up to 100 times and dislocate her shoulder at every turn. Leitzel – who was the first inductee into the International Circus Hall of Fame – died during a live performance in 1931 when her rigging snapped. Cat Vasko is penning the script while Andrew Lazar of American Sniper fame will produce. It is not yet know who will direct the film. Robbie is no stranger to acrobatics. The actress attended circus school as a child and received her “trapeze certificate” when she was eight. She most recently showed off her aerial maneuvers in David Ayer’s Suicide Squad as the fantastically psychotic anti-hero Harley Quinn. She starred alongside Will Smith, Cara Delevingne and Jared Leto - who played her love interest, The Joker.

Australian MH370 search agency secretly removes "death dive" theory from website But on Friday, independent investigators noticed the ATSB had withdrawn the claim from its website without explanation. FAMAGUSTA GAZETTE� The Australian government agency in charge of the search for missing Malaysian Airlines flight 370 has reportedly secretly retracted a published theory that the plane slammed into the sea after a "death dive." Earlier this week, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said it was unlikely the plane's captain glided the plane into the sea, and instead said engine failure due to lack of fuel had sparked a sudden "death dive" into the southern Indian Ocean. ATSB chief commissioner Greg Hood told The Australian newspaper that his agency had come to a consensus with a number of other agencies about the theory, including aircraft manufacturer Boeing, the U.S. National Transport Safety Board and the Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation. At the time, he said analysis of satellite data by Defence Department scientists concluded the plane made a sudden and rapid descent at more than 10 times the usual descent rate. But on Friday, independent investigators noticed the ATSB had withdrawn the claim from its website without explanation. Richard Godfrey from an independent group of MH370 expert observers told News Corp that he noticed the "consensus" claim had been deleted after it was picked up by computer tracker. Godfrey said the deletion of the consensus theory could mean that not all experts on the strategy group agree with the "death dive" consensus. "Another possibility is that it was assumed there was a consensus, but then some party complained and the published report had to be changed," he said. MH370 was carrying 239 passengers and crew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it disappeared on March 8, 2014. � (Xinhua) Sitemap { powered by bulletlink.com }

But with commercial deployment still a way off, it’s also starting to look less than unique. The project’s chief technologist, Chris Urmson, departed last week, the latest in a parade of talent to abandon the effort, which began in 2009 inside the Google X lab—now called just X and a subsidiary of the Alphabet holding company created to separate Google’s core business from its other projects last year. Alphabet and others that invested early in autonomous driving, such as Tesla Motors, have seen senior staff leave as competitors ranging from large automakers to Apple to well-funded startups have built up serious autonomous-car projects of their own. “Others have been catching up to Alphabet; I wouldn’t say they’re running away with it anymore,” says Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, a Palo Alto investment firm focused on transportation startups. “Investors and corporations are willing to put big money into developing that technology.” Recent advances in machine learning have made it easier to cover ground that took Alphabet's project years, says Garcia. And experienced engineers such as Urmson can be sure of strong backing even if they decide to go it alone, he says. (Urmson said in a blog post last week that he doesn’t have a new project lined up.) The $581 million General Motors spent earlier this year to acquire Cruise, a startup working on automated driving, has stoked confidence among entrepreneurs and investors that competing with Alphabet can be viable. One founding member of Google’s original autonomous-driving project, Anthony Levandowski, left the company in January. In May he launched Otto, a San Francisco startup working on autonomous driving for trucks. The company has already modified trucks to drive themselves in tests on California freeways. Otto has more than 60 employees, according to LinkedIn, including several veterans of Alphabet’s and Tesla’s autonomous-driving teams. Alphabet’s other competition includes Zoox, a startup based in Menlo Park, California, that is working on an autonomous vehicle intended to be used for a driverless taxi service. A June filing shows that Zoox has received $100 million in funding, and Business Insider reports it is set to double that figure. One reason investors are backing self-driving startups is a belief that despite Alphabet’s early lead, the company is not well positioned to commercialize the technology. The project’s leaders have said they are only interested in cars that can handle every type of driving without human supervision. To that end, they are developing cars that lack steering wheels and brake pedals for a human to ever use. And Alphabet wants to license its technology to a car manufacturer rather than make cars itself. Last year the former head of Hyundai’s American division, John Krafcik, was appointed as the project’s CEO. That strategy faces two big challenges, says Robert Seidl, managing director at Motus Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm focused on transportation. For one, “car companies don’t trust Google,” he says. “They don’t want to be left just bending metal and getting the low-margin part of the business.” And second, says Seidl, neither Alphabet nor the automakers are in a good position to launch a fleet of robotic taxis, which he and other investors argue would be the most plausible way to make money with fully autonomous vehicles. An on-demand ride service could quickly recoup the cost of developing and manufacturing the cars by putting them to work for many hours a day, says Seidl. A robot car service could also be viable even if its vehicles were limited to operating in a certain area, he says. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on detailed 3-D maps that must be kept up to date, so releasing a consumer car capable of driving anywhere would be a big challenge. Urmson said at MIT Technology Review’s EmTech Digital conference in May that he expected Alphabet's vehicles to come to certain urban pockets first. Shahin Farshchi, a partner at the venture firm Lux Capital in Menlo Park, which invested in Zoox, says that neither a company built around answering Web searches nor one that specializes in selling cars for private use is likely to build out a good transportation service. “The notion of Toyota and Honda going into the autonomous-transport business is like saying Boeing and Airbus are going to be effective as airlines,” says Farshchi. (GM’s decision to invest $500 million into Uber competitor Lyft and work on a trial of self-driving ride service could be recognition of that challenge; Alphabet has a stake in Uber, but the ride-sharing company is aggressively pursuing its own self-driving technology.) By insisting on waiting until fully autonomous passenger vehicles are ready, Alphabet could also miss a chance to capitalize on the early years of the technology’s emergence. Meanwhile, other companies could make money from selling self-driving technology for, say, highway driving, which is simple compared with getting a vehicle to cope with complex urban situations (see “Driverless Cars Are Further Away Than You Think”). Other companies, including Otto and Tesla, believe it’s possible to offer automated features for private or commercial driving—features that work only some of the time. Urmson has been a vocal critic of the idea that partial automation is safe, saying that Google employees loaned self-driving prototypes in 2012 quickly became dangerously trusting of them (see “Lazy Humans Shaped Google’s New Autonomous Car”). He has also said Alphabet’s project is closer to being road-ready than some may think. At EmTech Digital in May he repeated his frequent claim that he was aiming to make it unnecessary for his son to get a driver’s license. That would mean Alphabet’s cars will hit the road in 2020. Whether he still believes that, or whether those cars will have to share the road with other self-driving vehicles created with Urmson’s help, is unclear.

A pair of F-35 stealth fighters roared into British Columbia on Thursday in preparation for the annual Abbotsford International Airshow. The next-generation aircraft, whose development has been marred with delays and cost overruns, has been the source of ongoing angst in Ottawa as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government grapples with finding a replacement for the country’s long-outdated fighter jets. Trudeau told the House of Commons in June that the F-35 “does not work and is far from working,” two months before a surprise announcement last week that the aircraft is ready for combat. Lt.-Col. George Watkins, a pilot with the U.S. air force’s 34th Fighter Squadron, flew one of two operational planes to B.C. from Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Speaking on the tarmac in front of one of the aircraft, he described flying the F-35 as “awesome.” “I’m very confident in the combat declaration that we made, combat ready,” Watkins said. “Being a combat commander in a fighter squadron, I personally wouldn’t go to war with any other jet beside the F-35 right now. The stealth technology and the advanced radar and the threat detection system makes me more capable so I can strike first and it makes it so that my pilots are more survivable in war time.” The federal Liberal government promised during last year’s election campaign that it would hold an open competition to replace Canada’s aging CF-18 fleet, but it also pledged not to buy the F-35. Former prime minister Stephen Harper said in 2010 Canada would buy 64 of the stealth fighters, a commitment that was derailed when the Liberals came to power last year. Lockheed Martin, the U.S.-based defence contractor overseeing the F-35’s development, has since asked the Canadian government for the chance to compete in an open and fair competition to provide the next generation of airplanes to Canada’s military. Still, the federal government paid more than $30 million earlier this year to remain part of a consortium of nine countries backing the development of the fifth-generation aircraft. Canada has contributed more than $311 million to the group, which ensures it an eventual discount to buy the jet as well as access in the meantime to lucrative development contracts. The government said Canadian companies have received US$812 million in contracts since Canada’s first F-35 payment in 1997. The rival aircraft vying to become Canada’s next fighter jet is Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet, which was also scheduled to make an appearance at Abbotsford’s air show. A published report earlier this year said the Liberals had decided to purchase the Super Hornet as an interim measure to buy time for landing on a long-term fix for the Air Force. That prompted an outcry from the Opposition Conservatives over what they described as a rigged process that allowed Boeing to “jump the queue.” Canada bought its current fleet of CF-18s in the 1980s. The jets were designed to last 20 years, but the former Conservative government opted to spend $400 million to overhaul the fleet to keep the 77 aircraft in operation until at least 2025.

Every day. Wherever you are. Download our app here Show comments Hide comments (3) Controversial F-35 jets make an appearance at B.C. air show Trudeau’s pledge not to allow F-35 in a competition was illegal. The PM just can’t disqualify a firm from competing for a major contract “cause”, “cause Harper is for it” or “cause it polled well”. This is why they’ve now discovered how urgent an “interim” fighter is. If equipment is needed urgently different rules apply. If we will shortly have a “capability gap” then sole sourcing may be lawful. Just to make sure we don’t have NAFTA problems the GOC says it wants to but Boeing Super Hornets. That “gap” is false. A lie to cover a illegal campaign promise. A F-35A with an engine now costs about $ 153 million CAD. Lockheed says the price will come down by 2019 but will still be huge. That’s a lot and operating costs are likely to be higher than the competition. If we had a competition and the F-35 competition was substantially less expensive and performed the tasks listed in a fairly written Statement of Requirements (a stretch given the pull from the GOC and the air force to write the SOR so that their preferred candidate wins) then by all means buy it. The way we’re going will result in a massive law suit we will lose. For example we’ll probably get stuck with a ~ $160 million penalty for mischief involved in the recent army truck buy. A similar penalty for fighters would be over $ 3 billion. Reply ↓ Michael Shannon on August 11, 2016 at 10:33 pm It’s easy to get out of the F35 contract, and we should. Requirements have changed, drastically. The latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAVs) now bests human pilots, and ‘best’ is being nice to the humans. Even if the AI (named ALPHA, look it up) is flying a deliberately crippled aircraft (at this point simulated… don’t want these things flying around in real planes yet), it still stands a good chance of wining against top-gun humans. Oh, and the best part about this… the code runs on a Raspberry Pi. This isn’t IBM’s Watson were talking about here… it’s $35 for the real deal, and Chinese clones are cheaper. The university researchers that did this (UC’s Ernest and Cohen) published a paper with enough information on their process that others will be able to follow their lead. Human pilots are done. Seriously, this is a game-changing event. By the time we had a fleet of operational F35 fighters, Bombardier could probably build a fleet of UCAVs to take them out. The best approach right now is, if necessary, buying a few of the newer F18Es that we could integrate into the existing fleet. Just enough to keep the Americans happy. Just enough to tide us over before the UCAV arms race settles down to a predictable level. I understand how impressed the pilots are that get to fly the F35… but, sorry, you’re being automated out of a job, soon. If it’s any consolation, so are the truck drivers, and the taxi drivers, and the… Reply ↓ David English on August 12, 2016 at 2:46 am There is no contract to buy F-35s. There never was. One of the problems the Tories inflicted on themselves was saying there was when there was not. What the “requirements” are as stated in the final SOR will be contentious. Beyond the ability to replicate what a CF-18 does t’s a matter of opinion what they should be. The air force will want “stealth” to be included and the LPC will not.

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 13, 2016 at 11:15AM Huntington Ingalls stock hit the iceberg after releasing earnings last week. And there are a few things you might want to know about why. Image SOURCE: Getty Images. In a week of strong earnings reports from American defense contractors, and reports generally well received by investors, Huntington Ingalls (NYSE:HII) stock stuck out like the proverbial sore thumb. And shareholders are probably pretty sore as well. After Huntington missed on revenues, and just barely beat estimates for earnings, Huntington shareholders saw their stock price sink 4%. But was Huntington's news really bad enough to justify the sell-off? To try to figure that out, we listened in on Huntington Ingalls' post-earnings conference call. Here are five things they told us that we thought you'd like to know. Thing 1: Inflection point? "While positive performance continues at Ingalls, we'll continue to see volume and margin pressure in Newport News as we focus on delivering the three aircraft carriers. With that said, we continue to expect total revenues in fiscal year 2016 to be relatively flat to 2015 and segment operating margin in shipbuilding to be in the 9% to 10% range." -- CFO Christopher Kastner Huntington has been warning for some time that the 11%-plus operating profit margins we've been seeing of late are not sustainable over the long term. 9% to 10% margins, says Huntington, are much more likely to be the norm over long periods of time. That time may be now. But have you ever wondered why? Thing 2: Get to know the business "I'd just remind you what we've said about the 9% to 10% range. If you are operating outside of that range for any period of time you have to ask yourself why. If you are above the range, it probably means that you have a lot of mature programs and you're harvesting pretty well, but the fundamental thing you need to be focused on is what's the new work?" -- CEO Mike Petters It's useful for Huntington Ingalls shareholders to know that management regards 9% to 10% profit margins to be its norm. That alone injects a note of caution into the decision whether to buy a stock that's suddenly become more profitable than we've been accustomed to seeing. What's even more useful, though, for investors who may own other defense stocks other than just Huntington Ingalls, is knowing why margins in this industry tend to revert toward certain levels -- and why deviations from that norm are temporary. Huntington Ingalls' CEO thus does us a useful service when he explains the dynamics: It takes a lot of work to develop a new type of warship (or a new stealth fighter jet, a new tank, or a new variety of ICBM). That extra work -- risk reduction, bug stomping, and supply line unkinking -- adds costs to a weapons system and depresses profit margins for its maker. But as a weapons system matures, and enters full-rate production, the profit margins from producing it may likewise improve. That very improvement in profits, however, may act as a harbinger of eventual declines in sales, as the weapon becomes obsolete, and approaches its retirement date. Good to know. Thing 3: Free cash flow "Capital expenditures were $48 million or 2.8% of revenues in the quarter compared to $29 million in the second quarter last year. Our capex spend is typically back end loaded for the fiscal year, so we continue to expect capital expenditures for the year to be between 3.5% to 4.5% of revenues." -- Kastner Changing the subject abruptly, last week I dinged Huntington Ingalls for the lack of guidance on what to expect for its profits as this year rolls along. Let me walk back that chiding just a bit, though, based on this revelation. While Huntington Ingalls management hasn't provided investors complete guidance on its expectations for this year, it has at least told us something. Revenues, according to management, should be "relatively flat to 2015" -- so about $7 billion. At an operating profit margin of 9% to 10%, that works out to roughly $630 million to $700 million in operating profit this year. Meanwhile, analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence are still projecting operating cash flow of $740 million. Minus $280 million for CapEx (4% of $7 billion revenues), that leaves $460 million total free cash flow for the year. And now, with your forbearance, I'll abruptly change subjects once again, and turn to the broader prospects for defense spending as a whole. Thing 4: Where we're at with the defense budget "In Washington, House and Senate conferees have begun the process of reconciling FY2017 Defense Policy Bill and measured progress is also being made in the markup before consideration of respective appropriations bills. We are encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding programs in the various committee markups and bills. --Petters Revenues, management tells us, are likely to hold up pretty well through the rest of this year, relative to what we saw in 2015. Going forward, too, management seems confident that there is "strong bipartisan support" for continuing to give the Navy and Coast Guard the money they need, to buy the ships they need -- and the ships they intend to buy from Huntington Ingalls. That's good to know, but there's a caveat. Thing 5: "Sequester." Yes, that's still a thing "[We] remain concerned about the prospect of a long term continuing resolution as well as the implications of returning to a sequester top line for defense spending after the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 ends. Given the Navy's firm commitment to funding the higher replacement program, a sequester top line would create significant funding challenges across the Navy's budget that could severely impact a broad array of shipbuilding and ship repair programs. --Petters Four years ago, a divided Congress still scarred by the trauma of the Great Recession decided to solve its budget problems by "splitting the baby." Congress enacted a "sequester" that reduced spending on both social programs and defense spending. Now, there's no guarantee that Congress will resort to such drastic action again. But Huntington Ingalls isn't taking anything for granted. Unless and until Congress passes a defense budget, and President Obama signs it, there's still a chance Congress will revisit sequester, and that this could damage business prospects for Huntington Ingalls, and for other defense contractors as well. By no means is this certain to happen, but there's a non-zero chance that it will. If you're contemplating an investment in a defense stock today, this is a risk you need to be aware of. Especially because of ... Bonus thing: Caveat investor "Quite frankly what we're dealing with today is that ... valuations are pretty high and ... it's kind of challenging given some of the valuations that are out there today that we could really make the case that we're such a better owner that we would create the value that we need to create." -- Petters About halfway through last week's earnings call, Petters was asked -- kind of out of the blue -- whether he had any plans to make acquisitions of other companies in the defense space. His response was something that might give investors pause. While Huntington Ingalls continues to feel its own stock is undervalued, as evidenced by the 239,000 shares of stock it bought back last quarter, the CEO is hard pressed to see similar value in other companies operating in the defense space. If you're contemplating an investment in Lockheed, in Boeing, or even in Huntington Ingalls itself, these are words worth considering. If the CEO of one of the nation's biggest defense contractors, a man who lives and breathes defense-stock valuations, cannot find much of anything worth buying at today's high prices, then what are you seeing that he's not?
