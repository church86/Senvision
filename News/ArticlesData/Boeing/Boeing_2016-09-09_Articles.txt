Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Sep 10, 2016 at 10:13AM One day soon, United Launch Alliance could be operating a fleet of "trucks" in Earth orbit. Image source: Getty Images. The news is out, and the internet tubes are practically vibrating with excitement: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) are building a space truck. We actually first told you about this nearly half a year ago. But lately, a lot of other media outlets have discovered the story and begun writing about United Launch Alliance's (ULA, which is Boeing and Lockheed's joint space venture) plan to convert second-stage launch rockets into reusable space vehicles -- "space trucks" that can tool around the solar system under their own power. Naturally, in the perpetual motion machine that is the internet, this revived attention got our attention and inspired us to do a bit more digging into exactly how this will all work. How this will work The first step to understanding how ULA's plan will work is to understand how it won't work. Currently, there are two major paths to get to space: launching with a "disposable" rocket (such as Boeing and Lockheed, Orbital ATK (NYSE:OA), and Airbus' (NASDAQOTH:EADSY) Arianespace all use); or launching with a "reusable" rocket, a la SpaceX. The disposable path requires the construction of a brand-new rocket for each launch, which is discarded to burn up in the atmosphere after launch. It's worked well so far for ULA, which earned $400 million in operating profit last year. The reusable path hopes to produce even more profits -- by shedding costs and recovering launched rockets for later reuse. Focusing on the latter, there are currently three major theories on the best way to make rockets "reusable," with the goal of making space launches inexpensive. The first, pioneered by NASA's Space Shuttle and now being reborn at Airbus, launches a rocket vertically, then lands it back on earth horizontally -- like an airplane. A second approach, practiced by SpaceX (and soon to be imitated by Blue Origin) launches a rocket vertically, then attempts to land the first stage of that rocket vertically upon its own jets. Both of these approaches attempt to recover and reuse only the first stage of a rocket, which comprises about 70% of the total cost of the rocket. Boeing and Lockheed aren't taking either of these approaches with the "space truck" idea. Second verse, similar to the first Instead, ULA's "space truck" plan focuses on a means of reusing a rocket's second stage -- in space. (ULA also hopes to recover its first-stage rockets through a different process. I'll talk more about that in a later article.) ULA's space truck plan goes like this: In 2019, ULA plans to introduce a new launch vehicle called "Vulcan," comprised of a "Next Generation Launch System" first stage and utilizing an existing "Centaur" second stage. Four years later, ULA will replace Centaur with a more powerful second stage called "Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage" -- "ACES," for short. ACES, says ULA, will give Vulcan lift capability similar to that of "today's Delta IV Heavy rocket" (and superior to ULA's Atlas V). Additionally, the ACES second stage will form the basis for ULA's "space truck" project. Featuring a lightweight electrical system, insulated body, and four thrusters for maneuverability, an ACES space truck will function first as an ordinary second-stage rocket, lifting a payload into orbit. Once there, though, ACES will remain in orbit and assume its new role as an off-planet space truck -- accepting replenishment with additional fuel, and perhaps itself refueling other satellites in orbit, "towing" off-course satellites back into their proper orbits, or even shuttling cargo back and forth to the moon. (And if you're thinking at this point that ULA's space truck idea sounds a lot like Orbital ATK's Mission Extension Vehicle (MEV), which is scheduled to begin operations in late 2018, I had that same thought, too.) Like Orbital's MEV, ULA notes that ACES will have the ability to turn off and turn on its engines an "almost unlimited" number of times, allowing it to operate in orbit for "weeks." Indeed, ULA CEO Tony Bruno says that once in orbit, ACES could conceivably continue to operate in space "forever." And with its new capabilities, ACES can earn Boeing and Lockheed additional revenue from the rocket -- which otherwise would have been discarded as a mere used-up second stage. Where's the nearest gas station? Of course, in order for ACES to perform any of these missions -- particularly the turning on and turning off parts -- it will need fuel. But since ACES' fuel is currently located on Earth and needs to be brought up by rocket, doesn't that make orbiting "space trucks" superfluous? Where's the advantage in sending up one ACES rocket, loaded with fuel, only to transfer that fuel to an identical ACES in orbit? Curious to find the answer, I reached out to ULA for an explanation. What they told me was that an ACES designed to operate as a "space truck" would be specially fitted out with an "extended duration kit." Ordinary ACES would launch without such a supplement. And as for the economics of bringing up additional fuel, ULA clarified that this would not necessarily be brought up especially to fuel space trucks (at a current cost of $164 million per refueling mission, plus the cost of the fuel). Rather, a launch designed primarily to put one payload in space (a satellite, for example), if it had excess capacity, might fill out that capacity with extra fuel, sent up at "near zero" marginal cost -- then transferred to a waiting space truck. A far distant future That's the near-term plan. Further out, in the days when ULA envisions "1,000" humans living and working in space 30 years from now, ULA hopes to find more fuel that doesn't need to be lifted off Earth first to be used. Water ice extracted from the moon or asteroids, for example, could be broken down into hydrogen and oxygen and used to refuel ACES space trucks. It's discovering that fuel, and perfecting the space trucks to transport it and burn it, that will really enable the space economy to take off.

 Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could end jet lag as we know it Benjamin Zhang Sep. 10, 2016, 10:13 AM 121,141 facebook linkedin twitter email print A 787 Dreamliner being built for Air India in North Charleston, South Carolina. REUTERS/Randall Hill During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles. One of which was the decision to build much of the plane out of carbon-fiber reinforced plastics and other composite materials instead of the aluminum most commonly used on commercial airliners. While the engineering of the composite airframe may have been a challenge, it's a decision that allowed Boeing to make a major change to its aircraft that could greatly reduce the effect of jet lag on its passengers. "The Dreamliner has a composite fuselage and that allowed us to pressurize it at whatever altitude we wanted because the material is not as susceptible to fatigue," Blake Emery, director of differentiation strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told Business Insider in an interview. Currently, most airliners have cabin air pressure equivalent to that of an altitude of 8,000 feet. For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet. "To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin," Emery added. "It's a bit counterintuitive for most people." Why does air pressure matter to passengers? Boeing 787 cabin without seats. Boeing For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness. All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag. But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious. The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet. In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote: "Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness." The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called "increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours" of exposure. "The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level," Emery said. "So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet." At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself. Boeing 787-8. Wikimedia Commons According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system. Why haven't we had this all along? The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet. However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum. "Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet," Kent Craver, Boeing Commercial Airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. "In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level." In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners. Airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane. Boeing 777X. Boeing However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body. "We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well," a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. "We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude." The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019.

The aircraft manufacturer is analysing two potential designs for a plane that is expected to be called the 737 MAX 10 and would be the largest aircraft in the 737 line. Boeing has held recent discussions with airlines and aircraft leasing firms to gauge interest in such a plane, according to a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity and confirmed a Bloomberg News report. Such a plane would address an important gap between the 737 MAX 9, which can transport 200 travellers and the Airbus plane, which holds up to 240 passengers. The A321Neo has given the edge to the European giant in the lucrative market for middle-range planes, with orders running about 1 000 above those for Boeing's 737 line, according to data released by the companies. Boeing spokesperson Doug Alder says, "We continue to look at the higher end of the MAX family," "The needs of our airline customers, as well as the business case, will drive our decision and timing."

Until now, passengers traveling between Washington and Morocco had to fly through New York -- RAM's first US destination, or catch a different connecting flight abroad. "Royal Air Maroc is thrilled to launch the only non-stop service between Washington, DC and Casablanca. We are equally excited about deploying the state-of-the-art Boeing 787 on this important route," said Mr. Abdelhamid Addou, Royal Air Maroc's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in a release. "Royal Air Maroc's new Boeing 787 Dreamliner service to Casablanca, Morocco, provides passengers another important destination from Dulles International, the region's international gateway airport," said Mike Stewart, the Vice President of Airline Business Development at Washington Dulles International Airport. Seattle-based Boeing has had a presence in Morocco since at least 2001, when the company became a co-founder of Morocco Aero-Technical Interconnect Systems (MATIS) Aerospace, which produces parts and engines for Boeing jets and employs 850 people in Casablanca. Boeing is just one of many US companies with strong commercial ties to the United States. In fact export data pulled from the International Trade Administration (ITA) shows that average US exports to Morocco have more than tripled since the US-Morocco Free Trade Agreement (FTA) went into effect just over a decade ago. In the three years before the FTA (2003-2005), US exports to Morocco averaged $482 million; in the past three years (2013-2015), they increased 328 percent to $2.1 billion. The US's biggest exports to Morocco include petroleum, aerospace and automotive parts, and food products; and the US imports primarily fertilizer, electric machinery, and certain agricultural products from the country. In recent years, Morocco has successfully positioned itself as a gateway for US companies to African and European markets, and through aggressive economic reforms has become a top destination for foreign direct investment in Africa. Earlier this year, Morocco was named by the 2016 Bloomberg Innovation Index among the 50 most innovative economies in the world and one of just two such in Africa. The results echoed the findings of many industry reports of recent years. In 2014, the Wall Street Journal's Frontiers/FSG Frontier Markets Sentiment Index reported that Morocco is among the top ten frontier markets -- and the only one in the Maghreb -- most favored by foreign corporations. KPMG International and Oxford Economics' 2015 Change Readiness Index (CRI) ranked Morocco as the most "change-ready" country in the Maghreb, with particularly positive results in the category of "enterprise capability." The World Bank's Doing Business 2016 report ranked Morocco first out of 20 MENA countries in terms of "ease of starting a business" and placed it sixth overall in the region for "ease of doing business." "This direct connection has been centuries in the making. Morocco is quite literally the US's oldest friend, and houses the only US National Historic Landmark located in a foreign country. Morocco was the first country to recognize US independence and continues to be a strong ally and partner," said former US Ambassador to Morocco Edward M. Gabriel. The Moroccan American Center for Policy (MACP) is a non-profit organization whose principal mission is to inform opinion makers, government officials, and interested publics in the United States about political and social developments in Morocco and the role being played by the Kingdom of Morocco in broader strategic developments in North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. This material is distributed by the Moroccan American Center for Policy on behalf of the Government of Morocco. Additional information is available at the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.

News Business Business News British Airways; Bank of England; Thomas Cook: Business news in brief, Friday September 9 2016 Airline scales back expansion; Bank says it won't stifle burgeoning financial technology industry with rules; Travel agent shares boosted by Chinese venture  Ben Chapman Friday 9 September 2016 15:10 BST British Airways owner IAG is to scale back orders for new planes Reuters British Airways Owner IAG ponders reducing orders IAG, the owner of British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia, is considering reining in expansion plans as worldwide economic growth slows and the company grapples with the effects of the Brexit vote. “Without doubt all airlines, including airlines within IAG, are reassessing their requirements for new aircraft,” as the outlook for growth has “softened,” Willie Walsh, BA chief executive said on Thursday. “I don’t think we’re going to see growth rates that were anticipated.” The comments reflect a tougher sales environment for plane manufacturers. Airbus and Boeing racked up their lowest tally of aircraft orders in six years at the aviation industry’s annual showcase this summer. While both firms sit on huge order backlogs, that cushion could provide little protection if headwinds continue and airlines start to feel the pinch from lower fares. IAG, which also owns Irish carrier Aer Lingus, ordered 20 single-aisle Airbus A320neo planes a year ago, and Mr Walsh outlined plans earlier this year to buy used widebody Boeing 777s and lease Airbus’s double-decker A380s for British Airways.  Following the UK vote in late June to quit the European Union, Mr Walsh said IAG will have to cut spending amid a plunge in the pound’s exchange rate and a slowdown in traffic growth as business customers scale back travel. Corporate customers are still holding off on business trips as they analyse how the Brexit vote will affect Britain’s economy and currency, Mr Walsh said on Thursday. Another question carriers must consider with plane orders is the drop in the price of oil in recent years, and “whether it’s worth buying this new-technology aircraft to get the fuel-cost advantage,” he said. Bloomberg New fintech rules won’t stifle innovation, says BoE The Bank is grappling with how to regulate fintech(Getty) The Bank of England will not “stifle” innovation in financial technology with new rules as it seeks to get to grips with its impact, a senior central bank official said on Thursday. Victoria Cleland, the BoE’s chief cashier, said a priority for the central bank this year was devising its regulatory approach to so-called fintech. It was looking at the risks and benefits of applications including digital currencies and blockchain, a tamper-proof shared ledger that can automatically process and settle transactions using computer algorithms. Ms Cleland’s reassurances over regulation come at a time when British policymakers are looking for any signs that fintech firms in London, which has become a global hub for the sector, will move to mainland Europe. Fintech firms have expressed worries they could be cut off from the single market once Britain leaves the bloc. Berlin has already begun a marketing drive to attract fintech firms from the British capital. Ms Cleland said firms in the fast-growing fledgling sector want to know where the goalposts will be and the BoE was working with them. “It’s very difficult to decide how to regulate something you don’t quite know what it is,” she told a conference on peer-to-peer lending, adding fintech was a global industry and a similar approach was needed by other regulators. The Financial Stability Board, a global watchdog chaired by BoE Governor Mark Carney, is looking at whether using blockchain for processes such as settling transactions could undermine financial systems and if any new rules are needed. Reuters Thomas Cook shares surge on China travel venture The travel company is targetting the wealthiest chinese tourists (Getty) Thomas Cook, Europe’s second-biggest tour operator, set up a high-end Chinese travel agency with minority shareholder Fosun International in a bid to capture a more lucrative slice of China’s booming tourism market. The shares rose to their highest in more than three months. The agency will sell overseas holidays to the wealthiest 20 per cent of Chinese travellers, and guide them beyond Europe’s obvious destinations, as Thomas Cook aims to make China a “substantial” part of its business, Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook chief executive  said in an interview with Bloomberg News in Shanghai. Thomas Cook shares, which have lost 38 per cent this year, rose as much as 7.3 per cent yesterday, bringing the company’s market value to £1.2bn. The companies are betting that China’s outbound tourism market – the largest in the world – can help drive growth in Europe, where travel has been depressed by recent terror attacks and the UK’s vote to leave the EU. Fosun, a unit of a Shanghai-based conglomerate backed by billionaire Guo Guangchang, said it expects the number of Chinese travelling outside the country to grow by as much as 20 per cent annually. Fosun, which owns 8.2 per cent of Thomas Cook, will use its resources globally to support the tour operator’s online travel services. Its financial muscle will ease restrictions on Thomas Cook’s expansion plans, which have been hampered by stretched finances. In July, the 180 year-old company cut earnings forecasts for 2016 after a string of terror attacks across Europe depressed summer travel. Bloomberg Dixons Carphone shrugs off Brexit Dixons Carphone was positive about its outlook despite Brexit (Getty) Dixons Carphone, Britain’s biggest consumer electricals and mobile phone retailer, reported better than expected first-quarter sales on Thursday and said it had not seen any impact on demand from Junes Brexit vote. Shares in the company, which trades as Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse, have fallen 12 per cent in the past three months given its exposure to big ticket goods, and perceived vulnerability to any slide in consumer demand. In the 13 weeks to 30 July, Dixons Carphone, which also trades as Elkjop and El Giganten in Nordic nations and Kotsovolos in Greece, said sales at stores open more than a year rose 4 per cent, beating forecasts of 2.5 per cent, thanks to strong sales of mobiles, televisions and domestic appliances. Though the shock Brexit vote stunned markets, they have since recovered and consumers, who drove the country’s recovery after the financial crisis, appear to have largely taken the referendum result in their stride for now. Data has suggested the economy has not suffered the kind of devastating impact forecast by some Remain supporters in advance of the 23 June referendum, although some economists say it is heading for a sharp slowdown. “We’re not experiencing anything at the moment, we’re full steam ahead for peak [Christmas] and Black Friday (25 November). If the consumer environment changes then we’ll trim our sales to match,” Seb James, Dixons Carphone chief executive said. “We’ve just got to take the world as we find it. We’re absolutely on the lookout and preparing ourselves in case something like that should happen,” he told reporters. Reuters Zoopla earnings at top end of range despite market uncertainty Property website Zoopla said annual earnings would hit the top end of forecasts, boosted by a higher number of property listings and growth in its price comparison service, confounding predictions that Brexit would freeze the market. Zoopla’s positive update matched the confident outlooks from British house builders Barratt Developments and Redrow in recent days. Housing market strength was also apparent in data from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors which said on Thursday that its monthly house price index jumped to +12 in August, from July’s three-year low of +5, the first rise in six months.

Reuters Amazon adds Alexa to discounted Fire tablet  Amazon wants to be under lots of Christmas trees this year. It’s cut the price of its new Fire tablet almost in half and added its popular voice assistant, Alexa, in the hope of making it a hot holiday item, despite a slump in overall tablet sales. The new Fire HD8 tablet will cost £70, down from £120.

Businesses will be able to choose which countries they want to target, and can aim at customers in specific regions or the entire world. The features will be available to small businesses around the world.  Sixty million businesses have Facebook pages, and more than 1bn people using the social media site are connected to at least one business in another country, the company said. In the US, more than 60 per cent of Facebook users are connected to a company in another country. Catalysts for the expansion included data that showed Facebook users and small businesses are increasingly engaging in cross-border transactions, the company said.  AP Playboy can block picture links, landmark ruling says Playboy’s Dutch publisher can stop a news and entertainment website from posting links to its images without permission, a top EU court said in a ruling that could reverberate across the internet. The European Court of Justice in Luxembourg said GeenStijl, owned by GS Media, broke copyright laws when it published links to pictures of TV personality Britt Dekker without the permission of Sanoma Oyj’s Dutch unit, which runs Playboy in the Netherlands. Thursday’s ruling, which guides a Dutch court making a final decision in the dispute, says the website may fall foul of copyright rules because the links were posted for profit in the full knowledge that the photos were published online without consent. “An eye on profit, that’s something dirty, according to the European clowns,” GeenStijl said in a statement on its website. “The consequence is that from now on, you always run the risk of being sued, just for placing a hyperlink.” Bloomberg More about: British Airways Bank Of England Mark Carney fintech Thomas Cook Dixons Carphone Brexit Zoopla Amazon Facebook Playboy EU Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: User Policies Privacy Policy Cookie Policy Code of Conduct Complaint Form Contact Us Contributors All Topics Archive Newsletters Jobs Subscriptions Advertising Guide Syndication Evening Standard Novaya Gazeta Install our Apps Close We've noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Skip links Skip to primary navigation Skip to content Skip to primary sidebar Home Telecom Startups Gadgets Contact Confirmed: PIA to Get Eight New Boeing 787 Dreamliners 5.4kShares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint Aamir Attaa 2 months ago Pakistan International Airline has confirmed to induct eight new fuel efficient 787 Dreamliners to its fleet with deliveries starting as early as mid next year. This started when President and CEO of Boeing wrote a letter to Prime Minister of Pakistan earlier in August and offered the lease of multiple 787 Dreamliners. Boeing had then invited Pakistani government to get its latest flagship 787 Dreamliner jets. The airliner maker had also extended all sorts of support for a smooth transition and adoption of new jets. Now we are getting reports that PIA is determined to get eight 787 dreamliners as a BBC journalist confirmed the news on his twitter. Breaking: PIA to get 8 @boeing 787 dream liners with deliveries due from mid next year. The chairman just told me exclusively. — Tahir Imran Mian ✈ (@TahirImran) September 5, 2016 Boeing 787 Dreamliners are billed as most fuel efficient jets and are used for both long and mid-range routes. It maybe recalled that PIA just retired its five A310s with an aim to replace them with better airliners. PIA has been making efforts lately to revive its glory by targeting both economy and premium customers. PIA’s Premier Service, with all modern in-flight facilities, is particularly an effort to bring back premium flyers. Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner is a long-range, mid-size widebody plane that comes with up to 335 passenger capacity in various configurations. PIA will use these new aircraft for its long-haul routes to Europe, US and East Asia. It won’t be out of mention that Boeing has struggled selling its 787 Dreamliners due to a battery fiasco that it claims to have fixed now. 5.4kShares FacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsappLinkedinPrint HassaanM Apart from the battery issues the Rolls Royce engines used by 787 are prone to engine failures due to the fatigue cracking of turbine blades. Only a week ago Japan’s biggest airline, ANA, grounded all 100 Dreamliners in its fleet because of incidents of engine failure. So, I don’t think it is prudent to invest in these planes until Boeing has sorted out all the kinks. No wonder they are being all cozy about this deal. Raja Maja Hassaan news is not “Japan’s biggest airline, ANA, grounded all 100 Dreamliners in its fleet because of incidents of engine failure”. News would be if all the current orders of 787 got cancelled due to this a week ago engine failure. Do you think they are stupid enough to let this problem go with new production? HassaanM They don’t make their engines. They just put them into the plane. As of now there are three variants with the 787 – RR Trent 1000. RR Trent 1000 TEN, and General Electric GEnx. Its the Trent 1000 that has been causing all the problems while the 1000 TEN is in testing phase. Lets see which engine comes with our planes. Mr U Asar Besides engine issues are not of Boeing, but of Rolls Royce, Pakistani engineers prefer General Electric, so expect GE-NX coming with 787’s delivered to Pakistan, not Trent 1000’s HassaanM Don’t about the individual preference of our engineers but GEnx is a way better choice than the Trents because General Electric has been working with Boeing for eons and are their primary engine provider. Jawad Nazir ✈ That’s not right, ANA is still operating 787’s. I just saw one parked at SYD. Raja Maja Aamir Atta would be in dilemma (being PoTIan) “Oh yeh taraqqi kahan say agai” ha ha ha :o aamir7 Jee Waqayi, I am about to commit suicide :D Bilal Iqbal suicide or suicide attack … :P Detective go for suicide attack , atleast paisay tw milein gey Ishtiaq Koi aur nahi bas “shairrrrrr…. Shair…. Shairrr”. Gabbar to crash in yet another building in US?? Bilal Iqbal jets are Built … NOT Billed… :P Muhammad Zaman If the world is grounding these planes then why these are being inducted in PIA only on request letter from Boeing? Why not to induct 10 years old 20 Boeing 777 for the same price and put surplus PIA employees on job? We have the capability of overhauling 777s. Can somebody please elucidate? Mr U Asar It’s not buying, actually trading the 777 with 787, refer to the letter sent to PM by Boeing. Kazim Nice design.

At first light, it looks like Mexico would be the big loser. Exports and imports represent 64 per cent of GDP. Exports are 31 per cent of GDP, and 77 per cent of these embarkations go to the United States. There is no doubt that the end of NAFTA would be a blow. However, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the US stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico was US$107.8 billion in 2015, while the Mexican stock of FDI in the US was US$17.7 billion. The interesting thing is that the stock of FDI is valued at historical levels. The current market value is probably much higher. Therefore, which country is going to be the big loser? The answer is not Mexico. Looks are deceiving These two candidates point to the huge amount of Mexican exports that enter the US, but what they don't explain is that much of this trade is intercompany. In other words, Boeing's plant in Queretaro sells airplane components to the company's main assembly facility in Everett, Washington. The exports appear to be Mexican, but they really belong to Boeing, an American firm. Indeed, many US companies are competitive on a global scale, thanks to low-cost Mexican operations which provide essential components for their high-tech products. Losing these inputs would make these US firms uncompetitive, thus leading to the loss of high-paid jobs. What Trump and Sanders don't say is that US firms have been the main beneficiaries from the vast array of trade treaties. The US automotive industry was one of the main drivers behind NAFTA. The concept was born out of the Automotive Products Trade Agreement (APTA) that was signed with Canada in 1965. Although labour productivity and the education levels of these two countries are similar, Canada had been gravitating towards universal health care during the early 1960s. By moving labour-intensive activities north of the border, US automobile companies were able to slash costs - given that the Canadian government had assumed responsibility for the provision of health benefits. Soon, the Big Three automotive groups were the most powerful lobbyists fighting to support Canada's universal health-care programme. Unfortunately, the auto sector suffered an expensive setback during the early 1970s, when US President Nixon passed legislation enacting the Environmental Protection Agency. The new agency introduced sweeping regulation to clean up the environment, which became an onerous burden for many industries. This created an impetus for the Big Three to move the environmentally challenging parts of the manufacturing process to friendlier locations. Fortunately, Mexico was close by and ready to welcome the factories. Once the operations relocated south of the border, the companies took advantage of other favourable factors, such as cheap labour costs, compliant unions and lower health/pension benefits. US the big winner Hence, US companies have been the winners from the various trade agreements and they will have the most to lose if they are abrogated. Mexican factories are fully integrated with US industry. The end of NAFTA will deliver a debilitating blow to these operations, triggering a massive downgrade of earnings and a punishing writedown of assets. What Trump and Sanders fail to understand is that bringing back a handful of low-paying jobs will not justify the debilitating blow that will be delivered to the US economy. At the same time, Mexican businessmen will have a unique opportunity to buy top-of-the-line facilities, with cutting-edge technologies and well-trained employees at cut-rate prices. It would also be an opportunity for Mexico to delink itself from the US and open its trade relations with the rest of the world. Less than a decade ago, the Mexican economy was pushed into an unnecessary recession because of the collapse of the US housing bubble, even though there was nothing wrong at home. There is a saying among Mexican economists that when the US sneezes, Mexico catches pneumonia. Delinking itself from the US would allow Mexico to diversify across a wider spectrum of trade partners where it is no longer considered to be a second-class citizen. There is no doubt that the end of NAFTA would be painful, but the floating exchange rate regime would mitigate the blow. Therefore, the US should be careful what it wishes for, because it might just come true. - Dr Walter T.

ROS LBoard 1 ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Three abandoned planes in Senai airport up for auction FMT Reporters | September 9, 2016 The Boeing aircraft, which have been ‘parked’ at the airport for the last 10 years, are being auctioned off for RM5.3 million each. PETALING JAYA: Three Boeing 747 aircraft, which have been sitting idle at the Senai International Airport in Johor Bahru for the last 10 years, are being auctioned off for scrap. The 30-year-old planes – two cargo and one commercial – could be yours for “only” RM5.3 million each, reported The Star today. According to the report, the aircraft, which belonged to an American-based company were brought in to the state for an aviation venture that never took off. The planes were previously worth about RM120 million each, but have gathered dirt and soot after 10 years of being exposed to the elements. Its owner also owes the airport more than RM1 million in parking charges. The airport had taken the planes’ owner to court and won the case, hence the auction. A Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) spokesperson told the daily that the planes could be foreign-registered and there were guidelines to be fulfilled if the registrations were to be changed to a Malaysian one. Senai airport officials declined to comment when contacted by the daily. This is not the first time planes have been found abandoned at airports. In December last year, Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd (MAHB) put up advertisements in newspapers to trace owners of three Boeing 747-200F cargo jets parked at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for more than a year. The ads said that if the owner failed to “collect” the aircraft within 14 days of the date of the notice, MAHB reserved the right to sell or dispose of the aircraft under Malaysian regulations. Swift Air Cargo Chief Executive Officer Capt Blue Peterson subsequently came forward to claim ownership of the planes, and, according to The Star report, a legal settlement over the case was still pending. There was another similar case in Subang Airport, in 2014, but the MAHB managed to trace the plane’s owner and returned it, after necessary payments had been made.

The deal covers the systems engineering and logistic support planning required for production acceptance testing and evaluation of the DSU-42/B precision laser guidance set and the KMU-558 series guidance set of the GBU-56(V)4/B PGM as well as integration for Navy and USMC F/A-18. GBU-56s are cleared for carriage on the Boeing F-15E Strike Eagle, F-16, F/A-18, McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier, Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, Rockwell B-1B Lancer, Boeing B-52H Stratofortress, Panavia Tornado, and Eurofighter Typhoon. The DoD’s chief weapons buyer has estimated that a new intercontinental ballistic missile to replace the Minuteman III will cost at least $85 billion to develop and field. In a memo to USAF Secretary Deborah James, Frank Kendall cited figures generated by the Pentagon’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation office, which are about 36% more than a preliminary estimate by the service. The figure will be reassessed in “March 2018 once missile designs are more advanced, technical risks are reduced and the service has a better understanding of overall costs.” Raytheon has received an $8.8 million DoD contract to upgrade the Center Display Unit (CDU) on 130 F-16 fighters. The retrofit is expected to be completed by September 2017. Raytheon’s CDU won the favor of the USAF in late 2012, when it was endorsed as the F-16’s primary flight reference (PFR) system. Middle East & North Africa Lockheed Martin Mission Systems and Training has received a $39 million contract modification in connection to two Jordanian F-16 training centers. Under the deal, the company will provide at least two Fighting Falcon air combat training centers and logistical support with completion of contract due for September 2020. Israel’s Space Communications (Spacecom) Ltd and Beijing Xinwei Technology Group have given themselves 30 days to salvage a deal that was contingent on the launch of a satellite destroyed in an explosion last week. The Chinese group had agreed last month to purchase Spacecom for $285 million, pending the successful launch and operation of Spacecom’s $200 million Amos-6 communications satellite. Instead, the failure of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last week has caused stock market turmoil and a reexamination of the future deal. Europe Russia’s Deputy Minister for Defense Yuri Borisov has said that the Sukhoi PAK-FA is ready for mass production with Moscow planning to acquire a squadron of aircraft in 2017. Equipped with advanced avionics and all-digital flight systems, the PAK-FA is set to become the first operational stealth aircraft of the Russian Aerospace Forces. An export version is expected to be available by 2025. Germany’s defense minister has called for a European “defense union” in the face of a more aggressive Russia and worsening conflicts in the Middle East. Ursula von der Leyen’s comments were made during a visit to Lithuania, where Berlin is preparing to lead a battle group of about 1,000 troops as a deterrence against neighboring Russia. Calling the union a “Schengen of defense,” von der Leyen added that such a union “is what the Americans expect us to do.” Asia Pacific BAE Systems is debuting its CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicle at this week’s Land Forces 2016 Exhibition in Australia. The company is working in conjunction with Patria to offer the IFV to Canberra as part of the government’s request for information on the LAND 400 Phase 3 program. Nine CV90 variants are currently in service, and more than 1,280 vehicles have been sold to seven European nations.

(PRNewsFoto/Royal Air Maroc) WASHINGTON - Yesterday, Royal Air Maroc, the award-winning national airline of Morocco, launched thrice-weekly non-stop service between Washington Dulles International Airport and Casablanca. Washington, D.C. becomes the airline’s third destination in North America, and its second U.S. destination, after New York (JFK) and Montreal (YUL). The Washington, D.C. and New York-to-Casablanca flights, which are operated with a new generation Boeing 787 Dreamliner, will increase the seats offered in the United States by more than 40 percent. Flight AT218 from Casablanca touched down at 9:55pm local time at Dulles Airport outside Washington, D.C. and was greeted with a water cannon salute. The return flight to Casablanca, flight AT219, departed at 11:40pm. The Washington, D.C.-to-Casablanca flight operates on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and offers a schedule and product perfectly connected to the domestic and international networks of Royal Air Maroc.

Steve Heller (TMFTopDown) Sep 10, 2016 at 11:30AM Boeing 737 MAX with LEAP engine. Image source: CFM International. General Electric's (NYSE:GE) aviation segment is off to a strong start this year. During the first six months of 2016, aviation revenue increased 7% year over year to $12.8 billion, while operating profits increased 11% year over year to nearly $1.4 billion. Overall, GE's aviation segment represented 23.4% of GE's industrial revenue and 38.6% of its industrial operating profit during this time, making it the company's most profitable segment by a wide margin. This isn't likely to change in the years ahead, as aviation has a massive backlog to work through and strong expected demand for new passenger aircrafts. What's driving the results? Year to date, services made up 56% of aviation's revenue, while equipment sales made up 44%. During this time, aviation's revenue benefited from higher prices in its commercial engines and spare parts business, increased military spare parts volume, and higher services sales. This was partially offset by lower GEnx engine shipments and military volume outside of spares. Operating profits were driven by an increase in services spending, improved productivity, and higher prices. All told, aviation's year-to-date operating margin increased 80 basis points year over year to 22.5%. By subsegment, commercial engines and services made up the lion's share of GE's aviation revenue, accounting for 74% of the segment's total revenue during the first half of the year. On a unit basis, GE delivered 1,401 commercial engines in the first half, an increase of 5% year over year. Engine Family 2015 First-Half Unit Volume 2016 First-Half Unit Volume Difference Commercial (excluding LEAP and GEnx) 1,197 1,259 62 GEnx 137 131 (6) LEAP 0 11 11 Military 343 302 (41) Data source: GE. A backlog bigger than a small country Through CFM International, a 50-50 joint venture with Safran, GE shipped the first 11 out of 11,000 next-generation LEAP engines during the second quarter, and ended the quarter with $156.1 billion in its aviation backlog, an increase of 9.8% year over year. The LEAP engine is the fastest-selling engine in aviation history and succeeds the tried-and-true CFM56. CFM has delivered over 29,500 CFM56s since its introduction. LEAP is 15% more fuel efficient than its predecessor and will be primarily featured on next-generation single-aisle aircraft from Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus. According to CEO Jeff Immelt, GE expects to ship about 110 engines this year and reach 1,900 LEAP engines shipped by 2019. In other words, delivering LEAPs to customers is a crucial component for GE to recognize revenue sitting in its aviation backlog. Image source: GE. Since the majority of GE's backlog is services-based, aviation's margins are likely to improve, as services tend to command higher margins than equipment orders. These services can range from scheduled maintenance and complete overhauls, to real-time monitoring that tap into the company's digital offerings as a way to reduce unscheduled disruptions. Currently, GE has 35,000 engines in service, but only a small fraction have subscribed to its digital services. By the end of 2020, GE hopes to have more than 44,000 engines flying across the world, giving the company an even greater opportunity to generate incremental services revenue. The view from 38,000 feet GE's aviation segment is benefiting from robust demand for more fuel-efficient aircrafts and the expectation that commercial aviation traffic will grow substantially over the next 20 years. Between 2016 and 2035, Boeing estimates that nearly 40,000 new commercial aircrafts will enter service. Image source: Boeing. As the sole source on Boeing's upcoming 737 MAX and 777X aircrafts, and winning over 50% of Airbus A320neo orders, GE's aviation segment likely has a long tailwind of growth ahead of it.

Everything you need to know here > Donald Trump's complicated and controversial history with 9/11 Before you go, we thought you'd like these... READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Aol.com Editors Sep 9th 2016 9:45AM Two days after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, a reserved and calm Donald Trump was asked in an interview to explain how it was possible that "two Boeing planes would be able to destroy the Twin Towers?" Without hesitation, the billionaire businessman attributed the destruction to "tremendous amounts of fuel," saying the buildings were hit with "more than anything could take." No blame was laid at the feet of President George W. Bush, no peddling of conspiracy theories, no claims that if he were president the attacks wouldn't have happened. Instead, Trump stood poised in front of the Manhattan backdrop and championed New Yorkers as "strong and resilient," saying "they'll rebuild quickly." Fifteen years later, Trump's relationship with 9/11 has evolved, and now perhaps more clearly resembles the Republican presidential nominee's current campaign -- controversy-laden and with a tendency to produce more questions than answers. The 2001 terror attacks have come up multiple times over the course of Trump's presidential campaign, with the GOP candidate's remarks usually sparking outrage. "The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign. Remember that," Trump said during a heated exchange with Jeb Bush at a February primary debate. This particular incident wasn't the first time Trump implied Bush was in some way to blame for the attacks. In October 2015, Trump told Bloomberg TV, "He was president, OK? Don't blame him or don't blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign."

Jeb Bush called Trump's comments "pathetic," saying that his brother "kept us safe." Fellow 2016 contender at the time Ben Carson also weighed in, calling the allegations against President Bush "ridiculous to suggest." One area, however, where Trump and Carson see eye-to-eye are the billionaire businessman's controversial claim that he witnessed "thousands" of people "cheering" in New Jersey following the September 11, 2001, attacks. Trump claims he "watched in Jersey City, New Jersey, where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down. Thousands of people were cheering." While PolitiFact and The Washington Post conducted fact checks both concluding there's little to no evidence in support of Trump, Carson corroborated the claim saying he saw "the film of it," adding that he thought Trump's remark "was an inappropriate response." RCP General Election Poll Average - Clinton vs. Trump | InsideGov Trump hasn't backpedaled on his attacks aimed at former President Bush, or his steadfastness regarding the existence of the infamous New Jersey celebration video. He did, however, recently delete a tweet from 2013 where he commemorated the 12th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by saying, "I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th." Trump's team removed the controversial tweet shortly after it started making the rounds online in 2015. When asked why the tweet was deleted Trump campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks told Business Insider "it is from several years ago."

Fuller Steady state and transient vibration in the Boeing H-47 Chinook is now more controllable after the final product qualification of LORD Corp.’s patented Improved Vibration Control System (IVCS). This IVCS technology has a triple-digit weight-savings benefit, creating performance buy-back for operators.  LORD Defense Business Manager Stuart Hartwell told R&WI product deliveries began in May, and the first aircraft off the line with the system installed is planned for delivery to the U.S. Army in early October. This will be followed by retrofit opportunities of Special Operations MH-47Gs, fielded CH-47Fs and Foreign Military Sales H-47s in 2017. The system uses accelerometers that measure vibration levels and a centralized computer process that sends commands to force generators located under the pilot’s seat. This counteracts the aircraft vibration, creating a more comfortable environment. The IVCS is a direct/drop-in replacement for its predecessor — heavy passive-tuned vibration absorbers — also located under the pilot’s seat. It’s made for easy installment, using mounts that already exist on Chinook aircraft. This upgrade has come to fruition after 12 yr of development.  Related News   Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. blog comments powered by Disqus Advertise with us Rotorcraft Jobs Search Jobs: Browse all jobs Post jobs Post Resume View Resumes Most Read Most Commented Panel to Focus on Most Daunting Certification Challenges Sikorsky Seeks Innovative Kids 2008 Buyer’s Guide Directory Listings: Directory Webinar Focuses on Rotorcraft Boom, Near-Term Prospects Summit Agenda, Speakers Now Online GoPro Unveils Camera Drone In Bid to Save Stock Prices EASA Revision of SPI Regulation Continues How Operators Will Be Impacted by ICAO’s CORSIA Agreement Supersonic Avionics to Fly on ‘Baby Boom’ in 2017 New Report Outlines Avionics Equipage Issues for NextGen Do you receive The Rotorcraft Collective?

India has left everyone guessing in regards to who it will choose to manufacture a new fleet of combat aircraft for its air force. Though it is evident that the government is in talks with Sweden’s SAAB, France’s Dassault Aviation, and Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US, it has not given any indications as to which of the contenders would be bagging the contract. © Flickr/ Alexander Babashov India's Deal for 36 Dassault Rafale Stealth Fighter Jets Reaches Final PhaseDuring Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar’s recent visit to the US, Boeing and Lockheed Martin made official proposals to manufacture F/A-18 and F-16 respectively under the ‘Make in India’ campaign, triggering speculations in favor of the US. But Defense Minister Manohar Parrikar’s upcoming visit to Linkoping of Sweden to inspect the production facility of SAAB where Gripen fighter jets are produced indicates that India is equally interested in Gripen. According to Defense Ministry sources, Parrikar is likely to visit Sweden this month. Earlier in June this year, Indian Air Force Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha inspected the SAAB production facility in Linkoping. © AFP 2016/ FABRICE COFFRINI India Rejects SAAB's Offer to Develop Tejas MK1A AircraftSAAB has offered to develop, manufacture and undertake the final assembly of its Gripen E fighter jet in India with actual Transfer of Technology under the Make in India project. This would be a big relief for SAAB as India has not signed any major deal with the Swedish firm after a political storm triggered by allegations of corruption in the purchase of Bofors howitzers in 1987. Recently, India rejected SAAB’s offer to set up a production line under 'Make in India' and to supply the latest Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for the indigenous fighter aircraft Tejas MK1A. In an interview to All India Radio in May this year, Manohar Parrikar said, “India will select a good fighter by the end of this financial year to be made domestically. It is not yet decided which aircraft it would be. It may be F-18, Rafale, Eurofighter or Gripen. The decision in this regard will be taken in this financial year.” ...

Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Vice President Joe Biden says he’s well aware that the last eight years haven’t been easy for the nation’s workforce. In remarks on Friday at a roundtable discussion at LanchCode in St. Louis, Biden says the economic downturn in the late 2000s  “clobbered” the middle class. And that had tangible consequences for struggling cities. “As Detroit was crumbling, basically the intellectual infrastructure of the city left,” Biden said. “I mean, it just got hollowed out.” But Biden said there are reasons for optimism. He said an improving economy and advancing technology provided opportunities to get people jobs in the technology industry. And he said groups like LaunchCode are helping meet an urgent need. “What you guys are doing here is translating the need into reality,” Biden said. “It’s like knowing how to know. Well, look around the table here. Look at the companies that are represented here. This is not the little league. These are serious outfits.” The vice president generally steered clear of any political overturns during his remarks at LaunchCode, which helps bolster the careers of computer programmers. The nonprofit organization has helped train and match hundreds of people in St. Louis with big companies like MasterCard and Boeing. Vice President Joe Biden speaks at LaunchCode alongside Jim McKelvey, founder of Square and co-founder of LaunchCode, on Friday morning. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Biden said the effort coincided with the Obama administration's focus on getting more women and minorities acclimated to coding and computer programming. “Now I will announce an additional $40 million in scholarship funds for women and minorities who are underrepresented in the tech sector to attend coding boot camps and to have a shot at these good paying jobs,” Biden said. “And the goal is to get $100 million in the private sector. And I think we’ll be able to do that in the next little bit. Attendees take pictures of Vice President Joe Biden at LaunchCode. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio “And it matters because these investments matter,” he said. Joining Biden in the roundtable discussion was Jim McKelvey, who helped cofound the nonprofit LaunchCode in 2013. The cofounder of Square said that his group doesn’t “ask the companies to do us any favors,” but, rather, they say “you have a need for talent and we have a source for talent.” “And on the other side we say to people who want these jobs they’re open to you,” McKelvey said. “And that anyone, and I truly mean anyone, can get one of these jobs if you work hard enough. And we never lowered the standards for that work, so we keep it all about talent.”   Felipe Naranjo was one of the people who linked up with LaunchCode – which eventually led to a job at Express Scripts. Vice President Joe Biden speaks alongside tech executives and employees – including Felipe Naranjo, at Biden's left – who got their start through LaunchCode. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio “I had a lot of time to spend on YouTube and I stumbled upon a video in which Bill Gates, Chris Bosh and Mark Zuckerberg were telling me, ‘You need to learn how to code. It’s great. We love it,’” Naranjo said. “I thought if two of the smartest men in the world and a NBA champion with a Georgia Tech degree could do it, why not me?” “I was very skeptical about my skills. I wasn’t sure I was ready,” he added. “So I waited a long time to apply. And I always regretted it. Because as soon as I applied, they were incredibly welcoming and they had a lot of guidance to give me. They were able to measure my skills and take that measurement and compare that to where I needed to be.” Vice President Joe Biden greets fellow panelists after speaking at LaunchCode on Sept. 9, 2016. Credit Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Biden said groups like LaunchCode help the U.S. fill a need for hundreds of thousands of IT professionals. He added that the federal government can play a role in closing job gaps. “There’s an awful lot of people out there that have capacities they don’t know they have,” Biden said. “And you know, neither Barack nor I think government is the answer. But government can be a catalyst.” Follow Jason on Twitter @jrosenbaum Tags:  Joe Biden LaunchCode Jim McKelvey Express Scripts 2016 Missouri elections Top Stories TweetShareGoogle+Email Related Content Biden: Federal Stimulus Has Brought Jobs, Infrastructure To 'Heart Of America' 2 years ago Biden Defends Withdrawal Of Troops From Iraq, Afghanistan 2 years ago St. Louis launches experiment to connect programmers with jobs 3 years ago McKelvey shares his thoughts on Square and St. Louis' tech sector 10 months ago Looking Ahead At 2014, What Can St. Louis Expect? 2 years ago Express Scripts CEO Paz to step down in May 1 year ago Labor activists hold protest rally at Express Scripts operation here 6 years ago View the discussion thread.

(NYSE: I), operator of the world's first Globalized Network, powered by its leading satellite backbone, today updated the in-service date for the Intelsat 33e satellite, successfully launched on 24 August 2016. The in-service date is being adjusted from fourth quarter 2016 to first quarter 2017. Due to a malfunction in the primary thruster used for orbit raising, the orbit raising will take longer than planned and the satellite will arrive on station for In Orbit Testing in December 2016. The satellite's solar arrays and antennas have been successfully deployed, and after completion of the In Orbit Testing, the satellite will be ready for service sometime in the first quarter of 2017. Boeing, the satellite's manufacturer, is presently working with the company to determine the cause of the thruster malfunction. About Intelsat Intelsat S.A.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter AnoraMahmudova Reporter U.S. stocks on Friday suffered the worst slide since the U.K.’s surprise decision to exit from the European Union, as hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials slammed bond and equity markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.08%  closed down 394.46 points, or 2.1%, at an intraday low of 18,085.45, with all 30 blue-chip companies in the red, led lower by 3.3% drops in shares of Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, +0.43% Boeing Co. BA, +0.10% and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, -0.71% The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.10%  plunged 53.49 points, or 2.5%, to close at its intraday low of 2,127.81 with all 10 main sectors finishing lower. So-called defensive sectors—utilities and telecoms, which both finished off more than 3%—led the losses, while energy shares declined 2.8% amid a steep drop in crude-oil futures. Oil prices US:CLV6  settled down 3.7% at $45.88 a barrel and eanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.07%  shed 133.57 points, or 2.5%, to close at an intraday low of 5,125.91. For the broader market, it was the worst session since June 24, when the Dow industrials cratered 3.4%, the S&P 500 plunged 3.6% and the Nasdaq Composite unraveled by 4.1%. On Friday, the S&P 500 and the Dow fell below their 50-day moving averages. Friday’s broad selloff puts the Dow industrials at a weekly loss of 2.2%, the S&P 500 at a 2.4% loss, and the Nasdaq at a 2.4% decline. For the month to date, the Dow is 1.7% lower, the S&P 500 is off 2%, and the Nasdaq down 1.7%. Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren—a voter this year on the Fed’s interest-rate setting board—helped to contribute toe the selloff. He said on Friday that the U.S. central bank could resume gradual rate increases as the risks facing the economy are more in balance, reigniting Wall Street’s fears about the end of easy-money policies. Rosengren’s comments drove the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.29%  firmly higher, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.65%  jumped to levels not seen since before the U.K. referendum, known as Brexit. A sharp jump in Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -1.57% which surged by 39% to 17.50, highlighted the worries on the day. The VIX marked its largest one-day jump since June 24, and hit its highest level since June 28. On the New York Stock Exchange, 19 stocks declined for each one advancing, with 98% of the session’s volume contributing to the selloff. Wall Street losses followed declines for European SXXP, -0.36%  and Asian markets, which were unsettled by North Korea’s confirmation that it has successfully carried out a fifth nuclear test. Read: Next time, Draghi should say the ECB has done all it can “When the market is near its top—as this market has been—any piece of bad news will results in a selloff,” said Thomas Siomades, head of Hartford Funds Investment Consulting Group. Some analysts think that a rate increase by the Fed in September could be greeted positively by the market. “If the Fed does it for the right reasons—that the economy is on solid footing—then, markets would welcome a rate increase,” said Joe Saluzzi, partner at Themis Trading. Other market participants suggested that investors are losing confidence in the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the European Central Bank held its interest rates pat and opted not to expand its quantitative-easing measures, which disappointed Wall Street. Read: Politicians need to take some of the burden off the world’s central bankers “With the ECB’s inaction sparking fears that central banks have lost confidence in the benefits of further monetary easing, Wall Street could find itself vulnerable to steeper losses,” said FXTM Research analyst Lukman Otunuga in a note. Other central-bank talk: Fed Gov. Daniel Tarullo, who’s viewed as dovish on monetary policy, said he couldn't rule out a rate increase this year, but would like to see more inflation, during an interview on CNBC. Read: Contender for Clinton’s Treasury secretary could send key Fed signal Fed officials will gather on Sept. 20-21 to set interest rate policy, and the quiet period before that meeting begins Tuesday. Corporate docket: Home builder HovnanianEnterprises Inc. HOV, +0.83%  shares closed down nearly 13% after disappointing results and a lowered outlook. Restoration Hardware Holdings Inc. RH, +2.68% shares advanced 3.1% after the home-furnishings retailer posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and per-share earnings late Thursday. Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc. LXRX, -0.89%  shares rallied 17%, as the company reported positive results from a late-stage trial of a treatment for Type 1 diabetes. Finisar Corp. FNSR, -0.03%  shares jumped 13% as networking company late Thursday posted earnings that surpassed expectations. A review deadline for the proposed merger between Dow Chemical Co. DOW, -0.57%  and DuPont Co. DD, -0.86%  by the European Union’s antitrust regulator has been suspended. The regulator said the companies haven’t submitted important information demanded of them. Shares of both companies fell nearly 2%. Logistics company CAI International Inc. CAI, +0.44%  shares fell 5.2% as the company expects its exposure to the bankruptcy of South Korean shipping company Hanjin Shipping Co. Ltd 117930, -3.74%  will be about $2.6 million. Other markets: Asian stocks dropped, with South Korea’s Kospi SEU, -0.30%  falling 1.3% as investors took in North Korea’s nuclear test. Gold futures GCZ6, -0.62%  settled down 0.5% at $1,334.50 an ounce, as the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.29% climbed 0.4%. North Korea Nuclear Test Is Its Biggest Yet, Seoul Says(1:25) North Korea confirmed it had conducted a nuclear test—its fifth since 2006—after South Korea's seismic monitoring agency detected an earthquake that was more powerful than those linked to the North's earlier tests.

Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com Updated at 3:30 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden lauded LaunchCode’s efforts to train computer programmers as a stepping stone to employment in a visit to the St. Louis nonprofit’s headquarters on Delmar Boulevard on Friday. Flanked by executives from local companies who have hired dozens of paid apprentices through LaunchCode and those who emerged from the free training to land jobs, Biden said, “I came for a simple reason, to try to amplify what you’re doing here.” Founded in St. Louis in 2013, LaunchCode has placed 485 people in apprenticeships with a 90 percent hiring rate into full-time positions. Sixty percent of these folks were previously unemployed, and 25 percent lack a college degree. LaunchCode, which employs 30 locally, has expanded to Kansas City, Miami and Rhode Island and plans to add offices in Seattle and Portland next year. Biden on Friday credited LaunchCode founder Jim McKelvey, who also is co-founder of Square, with helping inspire TechHire, a federal initiative launched last year by the administration of President Barack Obama. Like LaunchCode, TechHire is designed to get people with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds trained and employed in tech jobs, including software coding. Biden said there’s a demand for 1.2 million IT workers in U.S. by 2022 — and 40 percent of the jobs won’t require a college degree. “There are an awful lot of people out there who have capacities they didn’t think of before,” Biden told the crowd of about 150 people. In St. Louis, companies such as MasterCard, Boeing, and Express Scripts have been expanding the talent pool they draw on, working with initiatives like LaunchCode to develop talent.

Check our People in Business “We think LaunchCode is going to be in every city that has a talent shortage, which is pretty much every city,” McKelvey told the Post-Dispatch. At the Friday event, several St. Louis area employers offered testimonials about LaunchCode’s value, including Robert Reeg, president of Global Technology and Operations at MasterCard, who said the credit-card company has brought in 21 LaunchCode apprentices in St. Louis and Miami, and wants to expand the program to its New York office. Neal Sample, chief information officer for Express Scripts, credited LaunchCode with helping the pharmacy benefit manager shift to hiring employees with a desire to learn tech, not just those with degrees. Later Friday, Biden stopped by the Goody Goody Diner in north St. Louis to campaign for U.S. Senate candidate Jason Kander, Missouri’s Secretary of State. Biden and Kander, a Democrat, stopped at more than a dozen tables to shake hands with customers at the diner at 5900 Natural Bridge Avenue. Kander is running against incumbent Republican Roy Blunt for the Senate seat. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The multi-billion shilling loss is the difference between revenues earned from the sub-leasing contracts and payments to be made to primary lessors in the same period. Kenya Airways yesterday said that the prevailing business circumstances had made it prudent to reduce excess capacity through leasing, adding that the Sh4 billion loss is an accounting treatment covering the entire period of the sub-lease. The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ, as the airline is popularly known, signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. “The airline has sub-leased certain aircraft that are held on operating and finance lease at lease rentals that are lower than that charged by the primary lessors resulting into onerous lease provision,” the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm says in its latest annual report. KQ last year leased five Boeing aeroplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines in the middle of a liquidity crisis that it only navigated with the help of the government.   The airline recognised a Sh1.4 billion loss in the year ended March 2016, with the balance of Sh2.5 billion expected to filter through over the coming years as the contracts roll on in the medium term. KQ chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said at the time of signing the lease contracts that they would reduce fleet costs by Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss (which was not disclosed at the time) represents a lesser evil compared to maintaining a bloated fleet. “These actions will reduce our monthly fleet costs by over $7 million (Sh707 million), and improve our liquidity, and is part of our strategy to return Kenya Airways to profitability in the next 18 to 24 months,” Mr Ngunze said on a May 26, 2016 statement, adding that while it was sad to see brand new aircraft going to other airlines, it was important to understand the context in which the decision was made. READ: Kenya Airways board to share recovery plan with shareholders KQ leased two B787s to Oman Air for three years and is set to take a loss of Sh918 million in that transaction. Besides, its lease of three B773s to Turkish Airlines for four years is expected to result in a loss of 3.1 billion, bringing the total loss to Sh4 billion. Sub-leasing the aircraft, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several aeroplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 planes in the year ended March compared to 52 units the year before. The airline plans to further scale back its capacity in the current financial year to cut costs prevent a further decline into the negative capital position with the sub-leasing of more aircrafts to Omar Air and Turkish Airlines. Kenya Airways has said it is keen on reducing the number of empty seats on long haul flights and terminating some routes to further cut costs. “There will be further reductions in both fleet count and aircraft type with the initiative to have a lean and efficient fleet tailored to the company’s network requirements,” KQ said in the report. Two B787-8s are to be sub-leased to Oman Air for an undisclosed number of years, bringing the total number of aircrafts seconded to the Muscat-based carrier to four. Three B777-300ER will be sub-leased to Turkish Airlines for an undisclosed period, raising the number of airplanes sent to the Istanbul-based carrier to six. KQ did not indicate whether the upcoming sub-leasing deals with the same carriers will also leave it underwater or whether it will break even or book a profit. The national carrier also plans to sell two B777-200ERs and return two E170s (Embraers) to their owners at the end of their lease period. The mix of aircraft sub-leasing, sales and non-renewal of leasing will discharge a total of nine aeroplanes from its fleet that will shrink to 38 units. The B787 series, also known as Dreamliners, are among the most expensive airplanes in KQ’s fleet expansion programme that was based on a projection of flying to 77 countries and 115 destinations by 2021. Drafters of the Project Mawingu strategy addressed several risks including funding but did not take into account lack of demand for the enlarged capacity, a key factor in KQ’s woes as seen in massive debts unmatched by revenue growth. Paring down capacity fits into KQ’s broader turnaround plan that includes staff retrenchment, with pilots and cabin crew among employees to be rendered redundant by the capacity reduction. KQ says it let go of 41 pilots in the year ended March, a move that saw their count drop to 489 from 523 the year before. Its overall staff count dropped to 3,870 from 4,002 over the same period, with further retrenchments having commenced from July. The airline made a record net loss of Sh26.2 billion in the year ended March, widening the Sh25.7 billion net loss the year before. This saw its net worth worsen to negative Sh35.6 billion from negative Sh5.9 billion over the same period. -businessdailyafrica.com Tweet Filed under Habari za Nyumbani · Tagged with Comments are closed.

A 3D printed trim-and-drill tool, developed by researchers at the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to be evaluated at The Boeing Company, has received the title of largest solid 3D printed item by Guinness World Records. The lower cost trim tool was printed 30 hours using carbon fiber and ABS thermoplastic composite materials, which will be tested in building the Boeing 777X passenger jet. The 3D printed structure 17.5 ft long, 5.5 ft wide and 1.5 ft tall and weighs approximately 1,650 pounds. ‘The existing, more expensive metallic tooling option we currently use comes from a supplier and typically takes three months to manufacture using conventional techniques,’ said Leo Christodoulou, Boeing’s director of structures and materials. ‘Additively manufactured tools, such as the 777X wing trim tool, will save energy, time, labor and production cost and are part of our overall strategy to apply 3D printing technology in key production areas.’ Guinness World Records judge Michael Empric measured the trim tool, proved it exceeded the required minimum of 0.3m3, or approximately 10.6 ft3, and announced the new record title. ‘The recognition by Guinness World Records draws attention to the advances we’re making in large-scale additive manufacturing composites research,’ said Vlastimil Kunc, leader of ORNL’s polymer materials development team. Boeing plans to use the additively manufactured trim-and-drill tool in the company’s new production facility in St Louis, MI, USA. The tool will be used to secure the jet’s composite wing skin for drilling and machining before assembly. This story uses material from ORNL, with editorial changes made by Materials Today.

Shutterstock Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Just as oil and gas has raised the stature of countries like Saudi Arabia in the age of oil, countries that dominate the production of metals are set to benefit similarly in the rare metal age. Rare metals, which are produced in limited amounts and often in just a few countries, play critical roles in the next generation of products: they store power, provide luminescence and make products more efficient. Tesla vehicles, iPhones, Boeing 787s and even night vision goggles rely on the specific properties of a host of difficult-to-pronounce obscure metals. Because of the global explosion in high-tech wizardry, people rely on the production of more metals on the periodic table than ever before. And because of the high number of rare metals it takes to produce green products, it’s no understatement to say that the fate of the planet is tied to these materials. Over the Olympic season, countries rank their international stature on medal counts achieved during the games as a proxy for a country’s geopolitical stature. But the “real metal count” has a greater impact on the fate of nations. To give an idea of how countries are doing, we produced two infographics to show the most notable changes in global producers from 1970 and 2015. It tallies the first, second, and third leading producers of all major and minor technology metals. For each major mineral commodity, the world’s leading producer earns a gold medal, second leading producer a silver medal, and third leading producer a bronze medal. (Data source: USGS) Dylan McFarlane, Robert Pell, David Graham, Author provided From the metal tables you can see that no country has succeeded in the real metal race like China. Through geological good fortune, along with a sustained focus on the production of rare metals at lower costs than other countries, China is poised to reap the gains from their production. Their focus on producing these metals is important. Finding secure, stable supplies outside China is a goal of two international research projects, SoS Rare and HiTech AlkCarb. For each major mineral commodity, the world’s leading producer earns a gold medal, second leading producer a silver medal, and third leading producer a bronze medal.

X Close World Home > News > World < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 9 September 2016 | MYT 10:02 AM Rocket carrying NASA asteroid probe blasts off from Florida by irene klotz CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - An Atlas 5 rocket blasted off from Florida on Thursday carrying a robot space probe on NASA's first quest to collect samples from an asteroid and return them to Earth in hopes of learning more about the origins of life. The 19-story rocket, built and flown for NASA by United Launch Alliance, lifted off at 7:05 p.m. (2305 GMT) from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, hurling the satellite explorer Osiris-Rex on its voyage to the near-Earth asteroid Bennu. The 3,300-pound (1,500-kg) solar-powered probe separated from the rocket's upper stage an hour after blastoff, soaring into space at 22,000 mph (35,400 kph) - more than 28 times the speed of sound - to begin its $1 billion, seven-year mission. It will take Osiris-Rex two years to reach its destination, a dark, rocky mass roughly a third of a mile wide and shaped like a giant acorn orbiting the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. Bennu is thought to be covered with organic compounds dating back to the earliest days of the solar system. “You can think of these asteroids as literally prebiotic chemical factories that were producing building blocks of life 4.5 billion years ago, before Earth formed, before life started here,” NASA astrobiologist Daniel Glavin said before launch. Scientists believe asteroids and comets crashing into early Earth delivered water and organic compounds that seeded the planet for life. Atomic-level analysis of samples from Bennu could help them prove that theory. Once it settles into orbit around Bennu in 2018, Osiris-Rex will spend up to two more years mapping the asteroid's surface and taking inventory of its chemical and mineral composition. Scientists will ultimately choose a promising site on Bennu to sample and command Osiris-Rex to fly close enough to extend its robot arm to the asteroid's surface. A sampling container will then release a swirl of nitrogen gas, which will stir up gravel and soil for collection. "The more big pieces we can get the better ... they could contain the carbon molecules that we want to see," Jim Garvin, chief scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said on NASA TV. After gathering at least 2 ounces (60 grams) of material, Osiris-Rex will fly back to Earth, jettisoning a capsule bearing the asteroid-sample container for a parachute descent and landing in the Utah desert in September 2023. Only one other spacecraft, Japan’s Hayabusa, has previously returned samples from an asteroid to Earth, but it collected less than a milligram of material because of a series of problems. A follow-on mission, Hayabusa 2, is under way, with a return to Earth planned for December 2020. The U.S. space agency also hopes Osiris-Rex will demonstrate the advanced imaging and mapping techniques needed for future science missions and for upcoming commercial asteroid-mining expeditions. Although Bennu occupies the same approximate orbital distance from the sun, it poses little threat to Earth. NASA estimates that there is a one-in-2,700 chance that Bennu might hit Earth sometime between 2175 and 2199. United Launch Alliance is a partnership of Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

The star studded side of Sai Walker, Elizabeth Moceiwai, Losalini and Loretta Kotoisuva take on the Fiji men’s team of Arun Kumar, Semesa Naiseruvati, Rajnesh Prasad and Kushal Pillay. The women’s team suffered a 14-10 loss at the hands of Team Fiji Airways Airbus, which comprised of Dan Vinod, Bobby Prasad, David Aitcheson and Sitiveni Tikoisuva during the first round. They bounced back to record two wins in their respective pool games; 20-7 against Fiji Airways Boeing and 19-12 over Lautoka Masters. The Fiji men’s team won their two matches against Lautoka Babaas 18-9, and 14-12 over Geo Tech which was forced to an extra end. Tournament coordinator Tikoisuva said the event would be exciting taking into consideration the depth of the players. “The quarterfinals will be an interesting competition as the pool games ended on a high note. “The competition level has gone up and that shows the development in each player and brings the best of the bowlers to the green.” Other quarterfinals-  Samuela Tui’s Botswana take on Santok Singh’s William and Goslings, Nadi Combat take on Suva Surua while Fiji Airways Airbus meet Geo Tech. The quarterfinals start at 9.30am with the finals in the afternoon.

Tycoon Henry Ford had it moved brick-by-brick to his remarkable Greenfield Village project, near Detroit. The same applies to other sights around the village: the courthouse where Abraham Lincoln practised in Springfield, Illinois; the house from Sharpsburg, Pennsylvania, where Henry John Heinz went from selling bottled horseradish to ketchup fame. Motor city: Part of the collection at the Henry Ford, a museum founded by the car tycoon On its own, Greenfield Village would be one of the best museums in the United States. It’s brilliantly presented and has some seriously high-quality exhibits. But the astonishing thing is that it is a mere side dish to the main course. The Henry Ford is named in honour of the man who founded it, and it is utterly absorbing. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next No pain, no gain on California's mighty Lake Tahoe: Get in a...

Share this article Share 238 shares Some things are to be expected – the section on motoring with lots of old Fords, for example.  But it dives into other things, such as the history of the interstate system, how motels have changed over the years, and also includes a famous neon-lit McDonald’s sign. There’s a collection of presidential cars, including the Ford Lincoln that JFK was riding in when he was assassinated. What’s even more remarkable is that the limo was later revamped with some armour and used by Lyndon B. Johnson. An old McDonald’s sign at the museum is one of the most famous installations at the attraction Henry Ford, pictured at the Indianapolis Speedway in 1932 The aviation section starts with information on how early pilots used railroad tracks as navigational aids and how the first stewardesses were hired after one feisty woman marched into the Boeing offices and suggested the idea. The American history section is superbly presented, with independence, the Civil War and the civil rights movement given enough detail to tell a gripping story, but not too much so that you feel like you’re drowning in the dull bits. The wow-factor objects keep coming, from George Washington’s camp bed to the seat from Ford’s Theatre used by Abraham Lincoln when he was shot.  But most affecting of all is a green and yellow bus. You’re free to saunter on board, and a voice is heard over the speakers.  The voice belongs to Rosa Parks, and she’s explaining why she refused to give up her seat to a white person in Montgomery, Alabama. Heaven knows how they found it, but this is the bus where it happened, starting protests that would lead to the end of racial segregation. Henry Ford may be most famous for his cars, but he has left an astonishing cultural legacy too. TRAVEL FACTS  Combined tickets for the Henry Ford and Greenfield Village, in Dearborn, near Detroit, cost $36.50 (£27) – visit thehenryford.org.  The Dearborn Inn, built by the Ford Motor Co, is a historic landmark in its own right. Rooms cost from $173 (£130) – visit marriott.co.uk.  Delta (delta.com) offers return flights from Heathrow to Detroit from £668.  Read more: The Henry Ford – Museum, Greenfield Village & Rouge Factory Hotel Booking and Reservations | Find Rooms in the UK | Marriott Hotels delta.com Share or comment on this article e-mail 238 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Share via facebook dialog Share via Pinterest Fifteen years after September 11, how much safer are we? Every September 11 anniversary prompts an examination of what has—or hasn’t—happened in the ongoing quest to make air travel safer. And while the U.S. has spent an estimated nearly $100 billion to secure airports and airplanes since the attack, one thing is certain: more needs to be done. Fifteen years ago, right after the attacks, a security manifesto was quickly drawn up to ensure that terrorists would never again be able to commandeer an airliner and turn it into a guided missile, as 19 hijackers succeeded in doing that day. And even before Congress had a chance to act—the law creating the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was passed that November—airlines and airports were rushing to make the most urgent fixes: hardening cockpit doors with bulletproof material, updating no-fly lists, and closing other gaps. While the saga of the TSA, and all its embarrassing lapses and misfires over the years, is well-documented, the fact is, as of this writing, there has been no successful terrorist attack on any U.S. airliner since September 11. (There have been some close calls, like the infamous “underwear bomber” who tried to take down a Northwest Airlines plane with his explosives-laden briefs in 2009.) Most experts agree that the odds of another hijacking are remote. But terrorists adapt, and the threat has shifted to other, less-secure areas of the airport: check-in lobbies, checkpoint entrances, and arrivals areas, as the attacks on airports in Brussels, and Istanbul, have shown. And the downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt last year was a reminder that a bombing remains the most serious in-flight threat. In the U.S., epic waits at checkpoints this past spring caused tens of thousands of passengers to miss flights, and in the process, created long queues—a new weakness that many experts say isn’t being adequately addressed. With this in mind, it’s worth looking back to see what happened to that first blueprint for how to fix airport security, and what it suggests for the future: Protecting the aircraft The clear success has been sealing off the cockpit; since 9/11, pilots remain locked behind impregnable doors for the duration of the flight (with obvious exceptions for restroom breaks, but flight attendants are trained to protect the cockpit during those intervals). The second step was to beef up the air marshal workforce, which had dwindled to a minuscule number of guards—fewer than 100—by 2001. That part has been less successful; the program has reportedly been plagued by low morale and high attrition, although the details of just how many are employed in this job are classified (it’s estimated to be more than 5,000.) Pilots, however, have picked up some of the slack with the “Federal Flight Deck Officer” program, which permits them to carry guns with the proper training. What’s next: Double doors to fully protect the cockpit are under consideration at Airbus and Boeing Separating the “known” travelers A major aim of the post-9/11 overhaul was to harness better intelligence and more sophisticated pre-screening to separate the "known" travelers from those who might warrant more scrutiny. This made a lot of people uncomfortable, as it seemed to put us on the slippery slope to unacceptable profiling techniques. Still, one long-sought goal that eluded officials for years was to create a “known traveler” program that would give expedited treatment to travelers who voluntarily submitted to a background check. The three-year-old TSA PreCheck program has pretty much met that goal; after a slow start, it now has 3.6 million members. But credit for this should really should go to Customs and Border Protection, which got there first with its Global Entry fast-track screening for arriving passengers, which showed the TSA how this could be done without invading people’s privacy. What’s next: To meet its goal of 25 million enrollees, TSA is considering allowing people to enroll in PreCheck online and via smartphone app Federalizing and professionalizing the screener workforce On 9/11, there were fewer than 20,000 airport screeners, many of them poorly-trained, minimum-wage contract workers who were hired by the airlines. Immediately, they became scapegoats for the attacks, and for the apparent ease with which the hijackers were able to board planes with box-cutters. One of the very first responses from the government was to kick the airlines off the security beat, and to put the government in charge—that’s what gave us the TSA. In hindsight, that may have been an overreaction: On 9/11, the box-cutters used for deadly effect were, in fact, legal under the airlines’s own rules, and the computerized pre-screening system in place that day did flag a few of the hijackers for added screening of their bags—but, tragically, the attackers knew all too well how to evade the system. Now, there are around 42,000 screeners, who are federal employees represented by a union. But one thing hasn’t changed: the job is tedious and frustrating at times, and, as various covert tests have shown, screeners continue to miss weapons at a disturbingly high rate. The TSA’s response has been to double down on training and re-training; as of this writing, the jury is still out on the results. What’s next: Some members of Congress are pushing for privatization of the screener workforce, and more airports are likely to take advantage of a pilot program to test this approach Upgrading technology screening for weapons and bombs Before 9/11, most checked luggage, particularly on domestic flights, went straight onto the plane without being scrutinized for explosives; the following year saw the arrival of those mini-van sized detection machines in airport lobbies, and, in one of the biggest investments made to date, airlines and airports spent hundreds of millions to build much faster underground, or “in-line," bag screening systems. But the machinery to screen people has proved more of a challenge: The first generation of highly controversial body-scanning machines had to be scrapped, and while TSA insists the current machines are safe, worries about the health effects of exposure to radiation persist. What’s next: New detection equipment that can better detect liquid explosives and other dangerous materials—meaning the lines would move faster for all us Video Highlights Share this story Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Email Recommended for You Travel Inspiration The 20 Most Beautiful College Campuses in America by Laura Vogel Read Now Follow CNTraveler Get Traveler Delivered Subscribe Give a Gift International Orders Get Our Digital Edition Renew Subscription FAQ Manage Your Subscription Contact Us Subscribe Give a Gift International Orders Get Our Digital Edition Renew Subscription FAQ Manage Your Subscription Contact Us Helpful LinksAdvertise with CNTravelerCNTraveler Media KitReprints & PermissionsSite Map More from Condé NastCondé Nast Traveler UKCondé Nast Traveler SpainCondé Nast StoreCareers at Condé Nast Condé Nast Visit Our Sister SitesAllureArchitectural DigestArs TechnicaBackchannelBon AppétitBrides.comCondé Nast TravelerEpicuriousGlamourGolf DigestGolf WorldGQGQ StylePitchforkSelfTeen VogueThe New YorkerThe SceneVanity FairVogueWWired © 2016 Condé Nast.

A Sept. 1 accident destroyed a SpaceX Falcon rocket and its payload during a test on the launch pad. RED HUBER , FLORIDA TODAY By MARCIA DUNN / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk is calling last week’s launch pad accident the “most difficult and complex failure” in the company’s 14-year history. After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company’s main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. The blast rocked the launch pad – which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing – and shook buildings several miles away at NASA’s neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is “the quieter bang” heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else. “Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation,” he said in a tweet. “Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.” In the immediate aftermath, Musk said the trouble appeared to originate around the upper stage’s oxygen tank. He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. “We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week’s loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and industry experts,” SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. “Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight.” The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX’s vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to report(at)spacex.com for use in the investigation. “Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation,” Musk said on Twitter. “Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.” A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world’s first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite – an Israeli-made communications satellite – to expand internet service in Africa. For now, NASA isn’t saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX’s Sept. 1 accident, next year’s targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. “Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX,” said Dale Skran, the National Space Society’s executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. At the time of the explosion, NASA’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday’s successful liftoff. NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX’s resilience. “It’s nothing that any of us ever want to see,” he said. “However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular O.C.

After a 10 year old ban on foreign arms sales expired two years ago, the country had hoped that a submarine deal with Australia involving MHI would be their first major arms export agreement, but talks broke down and the $50 billion contract went to China. For a country that is inexperienced with global arms sales, an agreement with the U.S. may be a significantly easier entry point and would show proof of concept to the world's arms buyers. "For Japan, America would be the easiest market to break into," said Steve Rogers, Director of Asset Allocation at Orix Capital Trading in a note to clients. "MHI are the leading defence contractor in the country and are desperate to move forward into the world market now that their restrictions have been lifted," he added. Mitsubishi make arms for the nation's Self Defence Forces (SDF) and are famous for their production of the Zero fighter which saw action in WW2. The firm will be hoping their move into the world market might give it more control over the intellectual property rights of its technology, which are currently under the remit of the SDF. MHI's Defence and Space Systems chief Hisakazu Mizutani said the talks with the U.S. firm are "in early stages but ongoing" and the deal would be overseen by the Japanese MoD. He also hinted that MHI were approached by the U.S. firm regarding the possible partnership to design and build a new armoured personnel carrier containing state of the art technology. MHI have had a close relationship with several American defence contractors for many years and has previously partnered with firms like Boeing and Lockheed Martin for development of the SDF's modern military aircraft. The development of an armoured vehicle would create brand new opportunities for MHI to enter the global stage in an exciting new area. Tanks have long been seen as a dated military vehicle and smaller, lighter and more versatile armoured cars and trucks are considered to be the future of ground warfare. New foreign business could attract buyers to other MHI products such as their gear technology and amphibious lines. # # # Read more Press Releases from Kunio Sumi: Orix Capital Trading - U.S. Stocks Balanced with Energy Down and Biotech Up Orix Capital Trading - Japanese Output Achieves Long Overdue Increase Comment on this story...

After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company’s main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. The blast rocked the launch pad _ which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing _ and shook buildings several miles away at NASA’s neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is “the quieter bang” heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else.

He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. “We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week’s loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the US Air Force and industry experts,” SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. “Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight.” The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX’s vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to report(at)spacex.com for use in the investigation. “Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation,” Musk said on Twitter. “Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.” A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world’s first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite _ an Israeli-made communications satellite _ to expand internet service in Africa. For now, NASA isn’t saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX’s Sept. 1 accident, next year’s targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. “Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX,” said Dale Skran, the National Space Society’s executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. At the time of the explosion, NASA’s Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday’s successful liftoff. NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX’s resilience. “It’s nothing that any of us ever want to see,” he said. “However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences.” Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaBanks open on Saturday, but only senior citizens can exchange old notes IndiaDemonetisation: Misuse of bank account for black money deposit to invite govt action IndiaLong queues outside banks a ‘serious issue’, says SC on demonetisation IndiaDemonetisation: Cash against debit swipe takes off at 700 petrol pumps IndiaNavy rubbishes Pak Navy claim that it stopped Indian submarine from entering waters EntertainmentForce 2 movie review: John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha film is Bond-Bourne rehash EntertainmentChris Martin parties with Shah Rukh Khan, Sussanne Khan and Sridevi's daughters, see inside pics EntertainmentIt's November 18, Salman Khan's wedding day, see pics EntertainmentIulia Vantur reveals what she had to sacrifice to live in India.

The losses were broad-based, hitting industrials and energy shares especially hard, after Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a speech that higher rates were needed to prevent the economy from overheating. A second Fed official, Governor Daniel Tarullo, signaled openness to a rate hike in 2016 in an interview with CNBC. “Given the European Central Bank commentary yesterday as well as some Fed speakers today, it appears more likely that the Fed and the world is closer to lessening the amount of easy money,” said David Levy, portfolio manager at Republic Wealth Advisors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 400 points, or 2.1 percent to 18,085.45. The broad-based S&P 500 shed 2.5 percent to 2,127.81, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 2.5 percent at 5,125.91. US stocks have rallied to records in the last two months after plunging following the June 23 British vote to exit the European Union. But analysts have cautioned that a correction was possible given the importance of central bank-generated liquidity to the stock market gains. Industrial companies Boeing, Caterpillar and General Electric all shed 3 percent or more, while oil giant Chevron fell 2.7 percent and ExxonMobil 2.5 percent. Technology shares were also generally weak, with Apple shedding 2.3 percent, Facebook 2.4 percent and Twitter 3.2 percent. Large banks generally outperformed, with higher rates from the Federal Reserve expected to boost their lending margins. Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase shares kept losses to under 1.0 percent. But Wells Fargo slumped 2.4 percent a day after regulators fined the banking giant more than $185 million due to allegations the bank secretly opened millions of fake accounts without customers’ knowledge. General Motors sank 3.9 percent after it issued a recall notice for 4.3 million cars and trucks worldwide due to a dangerous electronic fault that could prevent airbag deployment in an accident.

The multi-billion shilling loss is the difference between revenues earned from the sub-leasing contracts and payments to be made to primary lessors in the same period. Kenya Airways yesterday said that the prevailing business circumstances had made it prudent to reduce excess capacity through leasing, adding that the Sh4 billion loss is an accounting treatment covering the entire period of the sub-lease. The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ, as the airline is popularly known, signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. “The airline has sub-leased certain aircraft that are held on operating and finance lease at lease rentals that are lower than that charged by the primary lessors resulting into onerous lease provision,” the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm says in its latest annual report. KQ last year leased five Boeing aeroplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines in the middle of a liquidity crisis that it only navigated with the help of the government.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE After Samsung recalled all Galaxy Note 7 smartphones due to the device exploding last week, US authorities advised airline passengers not to switch on or charge Galaxy Note 7 phones while travelling U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

(AP) — SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk is calling last week's launch pad accident the "most difficult and complex failure" in the company's 14-year history. After a week of public silence, Musk said via Twitter that the company is still investigating the accident, its second in just 15 months. A massive fireball erupted during a prelaunch test Sept. 1 at the company's main launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Falcon rocket and a satellite were destroyed, and the pad was damaged. Ground crews were fueling the Falcon for a brief test-firing of its engines, two days before its scheduled liftoff. This Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016 photo shows the damaged SpaceX launch complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. A Sept. 1 accident destroyed a SpaceX Falcon rocket and its payload during a test on the launch pad. (Red Huber/Florida Today via AP) The blast rocked the launch pad — which had been cleared of workers for the test-firing — and shook buildings several miles away at NASA's neighboring Kennedy Space Center. The sound of explosions continued for several minutes and black smoke billowed into the morning sky. Particularly puzzling, according to Musk, is "the quieter bang" heard a few seconds before what he is calling a fireball, not an explosion. He said the bang may have come from the rocket or something else. "Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation," he said in a tweet. "Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source." In the immediate aftermath, Musk said the trouble appeared to originate around the upper stage's oxygen tank. He made no mention of that in his tweets posted early Friday EDT. When pressed for further information Friday, the California-based SpaceX said there was nothing new to share for now. "We are continuing to thoroughly investigate last week's loss of Falcon 9, with support from the FAA, NASA, the U.S. Air Force and industry experts," SpaceX spokesman Dex Torricke-Barton said in an email Friday. "Our priority is to safely and reliably return to flight." The core investigation team consists of about 20 people, more than half of them representing federal agencies and industry. SpaceX's vice president for flight reliability, Hans Koenigsmann, is heading it up. SpaceX is urging anyone with audio, photos or video of the accident to send the material to report@spacex.com for use in the investigation. "Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation," Musk said on Twitter. "Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years." A co-founder of PayPal, the 45-year-old Musk also runs Tesla Motors, the electric car maker, and is chairman of SolarCity, a solar energy company. His private space company had been on a roll, with eight launches already accomplished in 2016, two of them space station supply runs for NASA. The company had also, last December, pulled off the world's first landing of a booster rocket used in an orbital mission, and had been repeating the success. It was planning to use a recycled rocket for an upcoming satellite launch. SpaceX was attempting to catch up on launches following an accident in June 2015 that grounded the Falcon 9 rocket for six months. That accident, two minutes into a delivery mission for the International Space Station, was blamed on a support strut that broke loose inside the upper stage. The issue was said to have been fixed. Now, with more than 70 launches in the wings worth $10 billion, SpaceX said it can rely on its two other launch pads if necessary, one at Kennedy and one in California, once the Falcon rocket is ready to fly again. Both pads are undergoing construction and should be ready soon. Facebook had planned to use the lost satellite — an Israeli-made communications satellite — to expand internet service in Africa. For now, NASA isn't saying much publicly about the SpaceX mishap. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start ferrying astronauts to the space station; even before SpaceX's Sept. 1 accident, next year's targeted launch date had been in jeopardy. "Clearly this incident is a setback for SpaceX," said Dale Skran, the National Space Society's executive vice president. At the same time, he noted in a statement earlier this week that NASA was wise to hire multiple companies for cargo and crew transport, not only from a competitive standpoint but for backup. At the time of the explosion, NASA's Osiris-Rex spacecraft was just a mile away, awaiting its own launch to chase down an asteroid. Both NASA and rocket maker United Launch Alliance conducted extra checks to make certain nothing was damaged by the blast before Thursday's successful liftoff. NASA launch director Tim Dunn was sympathetic and earlier in the week praised SpaceX's resilience. "It's nothing that any of us ever want to see," he said. "However, it is part of our business that has very harsh consequences." ___ Online: SpaceX: http://www.spacex.com/ Share or comment on this article e-mail 5 shares Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Consumer Product Safety Commission tells consumers to stop using Galaxy Note 7 devices over exploding battery fears Agency working with Samsung to announce official recall  Samsung investigation found rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault CPSC working to determine whether a replacement is acceptable remedy By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 17:24 EST, 9 September 2016 | Updated: 17:43 EST, 9 September 2016 e-mail 823 shares 33 View comments Owners of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones should stop using the devices and turn them off because of the threat of a battery fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has said. The CPSC said in a statement it was working with Samsung to announce an official recall of the devices as soon as possible.  The agency also said it is working quickly to determine whether a replacement Galaxy Note 7 is an acceptable remedy for Samsung or their phone carriers to provide to consumers. Scroll down for video  This Samsung customer displayed a melted Galaxy Note 7 on YouTube, saying it was less than two-weeks old. Owners of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s should stop using the devices and turn them off because of the threat of a battery fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has said. WHAT IS THE ISSUE?  Samsung found that a battery cell made by one of its two battery suppliers caused the phone to catch fire.  The company refused to name the supplier. 'There was a tiny problem in the manufacturing process, so it was very difficult to figure out,' Koh Dong-jin, president of Samsung's mobile business told reporters at a news conference. 'It will cost us so much it makes my heart ache. Nevertheless, the reason we made this decision is because what is most important is customer safety.'  'Lithium-ion batteries pack a lot of power into a small package,' it said. 'When these batteries overheat and burst, the results can be serious.  'This is why the U.S Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is urging all consumers who own a Samsung Galaxy Note7 to power them down and stop charging or using the device. 'This consumer warning is based on recent reports involving lithium-ion batteries in certain Note7 devices that have resulted in fires.  'These incidents have occurred while charging and during normal use, which has led us to call for consumers to power down their Note7s.'  Consumer Reports earlier this week slammed Samsung for failing to issue an official recall notice for its Galaxy Note7 smartphone following reports of some phones exploding while charging. Samsung said last Friday it had stopped selling the Note7, and would replace models that consumers had already purchased. However, Consumer Reports said 'the company's action was not an official recall, which would have involved the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), and would have made it illegal to sell the phones.' It also comes after U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire.

Share this article Share The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing 'recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung' about the devices.  It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault.  Owners of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s should stop using the devices and turn them off because of the threat of a battery fire, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has said.  In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Delta Air Lines Inc, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it is still studying the issue. 'Delta is in constant contact with the FAA and other bodies in its run of business as a global airline,' spokesman Morgan Durrant said in a statement. 'We will comply with any directive and are studying this matter. Safety and security is always Delta's top priority.' United Continental Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the FAA advisory. Vaughn Jennings, a spokesman for Washington-based trade group Airlines for America, said the organization was 'closely monitoring any developments as this issue evolves.' A family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle (scenes from that incident pictured) The family said the phone, which was plugged in here, was engulfed in flames which quickly consumed the rest of the vehicle Samsung say they are investigating the incident, and providing assistance to the family 'Each individual carrier makes determinations, in compliance with FAA safety rules and regulations, as to what is permitted to be carried on board and in the cargo hold,' Jennings said in a statement. The FAA statement does not order U.S. airlines to take action. The International Air Transportation Association said airlines have conducted risk assessments and noted that other phones have been recalled for battery issues. 'Although Samsung is the most recent company advising of faulty devices, others have issued similar recalls and warnings regarding lithium batteries in laptops over the last 12 months, so the industry is familiar with and equipped to manage such situations,' the IATA said. Australian airlines Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia have banned passengers from using or charging the Galaxy Note 7 during flights over fire concerns. Although customers will still be able to bring the phones on flights on the Australian carriers, the ban extends to the phones being plugged into flight entertainment systems where USB ports are available. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August.  The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring.  Delta Air Lines Inc, the No.2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said it is still studying the issue. The FAA statement does not order U.S. airlines to take action (stock photo) Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 is not the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to 'thermal runaway' in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels.  Water can put out the flames, but does not always halt the thermal runaway.  Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices.  Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

The warning, issued in a news release today, came amid recent news that lithium-ion batteries in certain Note7 devices had resulted in fires. "When these batteries overheat and burst, the results can be dangerous," the CPSC said in its statement. "These incidents have occurred while charging and during normal use, which has led us to call for consumers to power down their Note7s." The agency said it is working with Samsung to formally announce a recall of the devices. "CPSC is working quickly to determine whether a replacement Galaxy Note7 is an acceptable remedy for Samsung or their phone carriers to provide to consumers," the agency said. In a statement today, Samsung asked owners of the smartphones to exchange them for a loaner phone as it hammers out the terms of the recall. "New Note7 replacement devices will be issued to exchange program participants upon completion of the CPSC process. In the interim, consumers can return their Note7 for another device," said Tim Baxter, the president of Samsung Electronics America. "Our collaboration with the CPSC, carrier partners and via our own communication channels is aimed at ensuring all Note7 users are aware of the issue and understand their options." On Thursday the Federal Aviation Administration warned fliers not to put the Note7 smartphone in their checked bags or turn them on or charge them during flights. The same day, Samsung and fire officials said they would be launching investigations after a Florida family said a Galaxy Note7 exploded in their Jeep on Labor Day, setting the vehicle on fire and destroying it. The family said that the phone had been left charging in the empty vehicle as the engine ran. Florida Family Claims Samsung Galaxy Note7 Phone Set Jeep Ablaze Samsung Recalling Galaxy Note 7 Smartphones Because of Potentially Exploding Batteries On Sept. 2, before the Florida incident, Samsung said it was suspending sales of and recalling the Galaxy Note7. The move came after several reports that the phones exploded while charging. The tech giant said in a statement last week that there were 35 reported cases of phones with "a battery cell issue" and that it would replace devices that had been purchased. It also said sales of the smartphone would be suspended in 10 countries, including the U.S. In February the FAA issued a safety alert about lithium-ion batteries, saying airlines that carried the batteries as cargo carried the "risk of a catastrophic hull loss" after they led to fatal fires on Boeing 747s in 2010 and 2011. In 2013 several fires in the batteries of Boeing 787s led the FAA to ground the entire Dreamliner fleet. American Airlines announced Friday that it will start broadcasting warnings about the Samsung Galaxy Note7 at the gate, and on board flights. The gate announcement will be, "Due to a recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note7, the Federal Aviation Administration advises these devices should be powered off, and not connected to any power source while on board the aircraft. If your bag is checked at the gate, please remove your Galaxy Note7, and place it in your carry-on." Samsung has sold more than 1 million Note7s since the smartphone debuted in August and has manufactured an additional 1.5 million units. The unsold devices will be replaced with new, modified versions so that they will not be affected by the battery problem, Samsung said. ABC News' Paul Blake, Avianne Tan, and Erin Dooley contributed to this report. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Samsung Galaxy Note7 Users Urged to Turn Off Phones Vulnerable Countries Pledge to Go All-Renewables, With Help Today's Energy System Could Blow Paris Climate Goals Dying UK Girl Convinces Judge to Let Her Body Be Frozen China Astronauts Return From Monthlong Space Station Stay In Graveyard of Dead Coral in Pacific, Hope and Life Bloom Google Disappointed by South Korean Refusal on Mapping Data Google Hits Pixel Resellers With 'Digital Death Sentence' Facebook Boosts Efforts to 'Do Good' With New Tools " Rocket Carrying Crew of 3 Blasts off for Int'l Space Station " Trump Offers Sen.

It is billed as an instrument of national pride and industrial renewal. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, September 10, 2016 Kato Manufacturing, based in the blue-collar enclave of Gifu prefecture in central Japan, is a microcosm of the country’s industrial evolution. The family-run metal shop, which was started 128 years ago, originally made simple farming tools for what was then a largely agrarian society. When Japan morphed into a manufacturing giant, churning out automobiles and electronics for the world, Kato supplied the metallic equivalent of skeletons: Sculpted frames and housings that gave products their shape. Now, as Japan aggressively tries to regain its manufacturing might in the face of competition from lower-cost countries like China, Kato is producing parts for aircraft. The company recently installed new metalworking machinery and hired half a dozen workers to accommodate orders from domestic aircraft makers. “Airplanes, rockets — they’re a symbol for manufacturing,” said Mr Keiji Kato, the company’s president and the fourth generation of the family’s leadership at the firm. Kato Manufacturing is a small piece of Japan’s vast bet on aerospace, a multi-billion-dollar government effort to replace lost manufacturing jobs and lift up the country’s industrial heartland, centred in Gifu and neighbouring prefectures. Sony and Panasonic have closed consumer electronics factories here in the past decade. While the car industry has been more resilient, officials worry that the region’s industrial base is becoming dangerously narrow. Developing aerospace is more than just a bid for economic growth. The most public symbol of this effort, the Mitsubishi Regional Jet, is being billed as an instrument of national pride and industrial renewal, a chance for Japan Inc to restore some of its former glory. At a short test flight of the aircraft from an airport in Nagoya, Japan’s economy minister declared “the start of a new era for Japan’s aviation industry”. But breaking into the aerospace sector will be difficult. The country last produced a passenger aircraft more than 40 years ago, at the end of the propeller era. And Japan has never produced a civilian jet plane, although it has assembled some military models. The industry, which requires huge start-up costs, is dominated by a handful of established behemoths. Embraer of Brazil and Bombardier of Canada have long operated as a virtual duopoly in the midsize passenger-jet market that Mitsubishi is targeting. Chinese and Russian manufacturers also recently tried to grab a share of the business, with mixed results. Taxpayer funds are on the line. The Japanese government is underwriting about a third of the development costs for the Mitsubishi jet, which were initially projected at US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) but are likely to rise after repeated delays. “If Japan succeeds at this, it could be a huge new industry. But the short-term hurdles are high,” said Mr Yasuo Unakami, an analyst at the Japan Finance Corporation, a government-backed research and investment group. “” For a country proud of its manufacturing heritage, the fact that no modern passenger airplane is marked “Made in Japan” rankles. Japan was banned from making planes after its defeat in World War II. Although the prohibition ended decades ago, efforts to revive the industry have stumbled. One project, a propeller plane called the YS-11, built by Mitsubishi and other big names in the 1960s and ’70s, was a commercial flop. Even so, enthusiasts still celebrate the short-lived plane. When the last ones were retired from service by airlines a few years ago, newspapers and television news programmes were full of nostalgic tributes. The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), for which Kato is making parts, is drawing on a similar sentiment. At the unveiling of a prototype in 2014, a film showed workers holding signs with messages like “Made in Japan”, “This is our MRJ” and “MRJ renovates Japan”. “The world is full of products that are made in Japan, but unfortunately there hasn’t been a domestically made passenger plane in about 40 years,” Mr Hideaki Omiya, the chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the plane’s developer, said at the time. “This is a long-held dream.” The Mitsubishi jet is the most prominent of several Japanese aircraft projects underway. Honda Aircraft, a subsidiary of Honda Motor, is developing a light jet for five or six passengers, but it is being built in North Carolina. Japanese military contractors are looking at overseas markets after a decades-long ban on arms exports was lifted in 2014. ShinMaywa Industries, for instance, is in talks to sell a large-capacity seaplane, the US-2, to the Indian navy. Mitsubishi considers its new passenger jet the logical extension of a business that has grown to encompass satellite-carrying rockets and large-scale subcontracting work on Boeing jets. The company says it has an edge in technology, in particular with lightweight composite materials. The materials, Mitsubishi says, will make the new jet more fuel efficient than those of its rivals. But making parts and subsystems to order is one thing. Organising the hugely complex task of assembling a modern jet is another. The delays to the project have added to costs and undercut technological advantages by giving competitors such as Embraer time to catch up. Mitsubishi’s first test flight took place last year, three years behind schedule. The first delivery had originally been planned for early 2014, but is now expected in late 2018. Mitsubishi declined to disclose its latest cost estimates for the project, but said it would cover any overruns without relying on additional support from public funds. “We will recover our investment costs in the long run,” it said in a statement. Despite the challenges, Mitsubishi is a central piece of the government’s plans to nurture a broader industry and to provide a lift to the sagging economy. Aircraft manufacturing now generates about ¥1.5 trillion (S$20 billion) in revenue for Japanese businesses, according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, an industry lobby. That is up by half from five years ago, although it is still just a small fraction of the auto industry’s sales. Japan’s efforts extend along the supply chain. C-Astac, a government organisation, helps small-business owners break into aerospace, holding seminars to explain the certification and grant process. Subcontractors such as Kato Manufacturing are benefiting from start-up cash and relaxed regulations on things like factory floor space to accommodate new machinery. Mr Kato said he received a government grant of ¥15 million to buy new equipment. His new team is a mix of seasoned factory workers and novice recruits. Mr Ryoji Soga, a youthful-looking 72, retired seven years ago but decided to come back when he heard the company needed experienced hands to produce new kinds of aircraft parts. Mr Soga said he was glad to have a good-paying industrial job. “It’s better than waving a flag at a road construction site or cleaning toilets at a supermarket,” he said.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive FAA warns airline passengers not to use Samsung smartphone Friday Sep 9, 2016 at 2:01 PM Sep 9, 2016 at 2:01 PM Joan Lowy The Associated Press WASHINGTON — U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire.  The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for theFAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone.  Samsung Galaxy Note 7 | SpecOut The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report.

Army-technology.com wraps up key headlines from August. Saudi Arabia requests $1.15bn sale of battle tanks and vehicles from US The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of $1.15bn potential sale of M1A2S Abrams main battle tanks (MBT) and M88Al/A2 heavy equipment recovery combat utility lift evacuation system (HERCULES) armoured recovery vehicles (ARV) to Saudi Arabia. The procurement of the equipment will improve the Royal Saudi Land Force’s (RSLF) interoperability with US forces. Saudi Arabia will use its enhanced capability to meet current and future threats, as well as provide greater security for its critical infrastructure. Canadian Army receives first TAPV from Textron Systems The Canadian Army received the first six tactical armoured patrol vehicle (TAPV) from Textron Systems Canada, as part of efforts by the government to ensure the country’s soldiers have the right equipment to succeed at operations. In June 2012, the Canadian Government selected Textron Systems Canada as the prime contractor for the C$603.4m worth TAPV programme. The TAPV is a 4x4 wheeled armoured vehicle that will partially replace the army’s Coyote light armoured vehicle, completely replace the armoured patrol vehicle RG-31 and complement the light utility vehicle wheeled. Lockheed's PAC-3 MSE interceptor achieves initial operational capability Lockheed Martin's Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile segment enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor achieved initial operational capability (IOC) designation from the US Army. The PAC-3 MSE achieved IOC two years after receiving Milestone C approval. Lockheed Martin received the first US contract for the technology in 2014. Lockheed's high-velocity interceptor employs hit-to-kill technology to defend against incoming threats, including tactical ballistic missiles (TBMs), cruise missiles and aircraft. The PAC-3 MSE includes a larger, more powerful dual-pulse solid rocket motor for added thrust, as well as larger fins and other structural modifications to increase agility. Orbital ATK wins $400m contract to supply ballistic missile target rockets to US Orbital ATK received a contract valued at up to $400m from the US Missile Defense Agency (MDA) to supply medium-range ballistic missile target rockets. The MRBM T3c2 contract includes an initial order for vehicle development and production over a four-year period, as well as options for follow-on vehicle production and other activities through 2024, the company said. The company designs and produces its target vehicles and missile defence interceptors at its engineering and manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona, US. AM General wins $356m contract to supply HMMWVs for Afghan Army AM General received a $356m contract to produce high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicles (HMMWVs) for the Afghanistan National Army and Police. Awarded by the US Government, the latest contract includes delivery of 1,259 M1151A1B1 HMMWVs and 414 M1152 A1B2 HMMWV models. AM General will begin assembling HMMWVs at its plant in Indiana, US, later this month, and plans to finish production by 2017. The HMMWVs were designed to replace the US Army's tactical vehicles in the 0.25t-1.25t range. Russia's Vityaz plans to develop new surface-to-air missile system Russian machine-building company Vityaz geared up to develop a new surface-to-air missile (SAM) system for the Arctic and the Extreme North. Under the terms of the contract, the missile system will be mounted on an operational caterpillar armoured personnel carrier (APC) comprising a launcher and a crew module. The new SAM system is scheduled for completion in October, and will undergo state acceptance tests by late May 2017. US approves $231m sale of precision-guided munitions for Nato The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) notified Congress of a potential $231m foreign military sale (FMS) of precision-guided munitions, equipment, and support to the Nato Support and Procurement Agency. The agency will send precision-guided munitions to Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Greece, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain. The procurement will improve the Nato members' ability to meet current and future ground threats. Boeing Corporation and Raytheon Missile Systems will serve as prime contractors for the sale. US to deploy additional soldiers to support Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq The US Army announced the deployment of additional troops to support Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq for the next phase of the fight against ISIS. Nearly 400 more personnel will be sent to Iraq to help local forces recapture the northern city of Mosul from ISIS, media sources reported. Soldiers of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) will join approximately 1,300 previously deployed soldiers from the same unit, the US Army said in a statement. US Army develops new engine for Black Hawk and Apache helicopters The US Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center's Aviation Development Directorate (ADD) was developing a new military helicopter engine that would provide 50% more power at the same weight as the current fielded engine. The advanced affordable turbine engine (AATE) demonstrator programme aims to develop a turboshaft engine with reduced fuel consumption and improved shaft horsepower. This engine configuration can be fitted into the Black Hawk and Apache installation envelopes, as well as current and Future Vertical Lift rotorcraft. US and India sign agreement to share military bases The US and India signed a bilateral logistics exchange memorandum of agreement (LEMOA) in a bid to strengthen defence ties between the countries. The LEMOA will facilitate sharing of land, air and naval bases for repair and resupply, according to media sources. US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said that the military logistics agreement would provide additional opportunities for practical engagement and exchange. The agreement did not allow US troops to be based in India. Share Follow Us Facebook Twitter LinkedIn YouTube Newsletter For all the latest army industry news, sign up for our regular updates.

There are nearly half a million open tech jobs in the United States today, and that number is projected to more than double within the next four years. These jobs pay 50 percent more than the average private sector job. That's why President Obama and Vice President Biden launched the TechHire initiative in 2015 to give more Americans access to accelerated tech training that leads to a well-paying tech job -- no matter what their zip code. Four thousand workers have already been trained and employed across the country, and communities and businesses have committed to training and placing an additional 35,000 people in the next few years.  Today, Vice President Biden headed to the LaunchCode Mentor Center in St. Louis, Missouri -- one of the first TechHire communities -- to speak with employees and employers who have benefitted from this collaborative approach that trains Americans for the jobs of the future.  Vice President Joe Biden gives remarks at a roundtable on a tech hire initiative at the LaunchCode Mentor Center in St. Louis, Missouri, Sept. 9, 2016. (Official White House Photo by David Lienemann)  Here's how it works: A qualified candidate applies for dozens of tech jobs without ever getting an interview. She has the skills, the motivation, and the self-discipline to learn how to code herself. But because she didn't go to college, she doesn’t get the job. But then she shows up to at LaunchCode, a not-for-profit that finds talented people across St. Louis and gives them the training and credibility for the tech jobs that employers are desperately seeking to fill. LaunchCode goes to bat for her and connects her with a position at a company like MasterCard. She gets hired on as an apprentice. She proves herself and gets hired fulltime. She becomes a systems engineer with a good-paying salary. She gets promoted. That's good for her. It's good for the company. In the last year, numerous companies -- including major St. Louis employers like Mastercard, Boeing, and Express Scripts -- have been hiring more candidates with non-traditional backgrounds. In the LaunchCode program alone, 310 people have been placed in apprenticeships with a 90 percent hiring rate into full time positions. These employees make salaries that are two times higher than their previous jobs. Sixty percent of these folks were previously unemployed, and 25 percent lack a college degree. And at LaunchCode, the Vice President announced that The Iron Yard, Code Fellows, and Operation HOPE will launch a Tech Opportunity Fund, which will offer $100 million in full-tuition scholarships to women and minorities who are underrepresented in the tech workforce. The fund is launching with $45 million in committed funding so far. Through partnerships with city-level government bodies and civic organizations, the fund will also assist scholarship recipients by addressing needs such as affordable housing, financial literacy, counseling and transportation as needed.   But we're not going to stop here. We will be announcing new commitments from mayors, governors, businesses, traditional and non-traditional training programs, and others to the TechHire initiative this fall. If you're not involved yet, you can get involved by making a commitment here. So make sure tune in to hear Vice President Biden talk about training Americans for the jobs of the future.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival.

The FAA also urged travelers not to stow the phones in checked baggage, either.

In some cases, the device’s lithium batteries sparked fires, including one that destroyed a Jeep in St. Petersburg, Fla. Samsung asked all owners to return the phones that began circulating in August. The offer was to exchange the phones for a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 edge, along with a $25 gift certificate for the inconvenience. “We are offering this exchange because your safety and peace of mind is our top priority,” the company said last week. Rechargeable lithium batteries are widely used in electronic devices because they are lighter and are smaller than other comparable batteries. But the batteries are also susceptible to overheating when damaged or suffering from manufacturing problems. Larger lithium batteries sparked problems for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, after batteries short-circuited and damaged planes in Boston and Japan. The fleet of new planes was grounded worldwide for three months in early 2013 as Boeing developed and installed safeguards against the batteries overheating. “In light of recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices, the Federal Aviation Administration strongly advices passengers not to turn on our charge these devices on board aircraft and not to stow them in any checked baggage,” the FAA said Thursday in a statement.© Ahn Young-joon, AP A woman walks by an advertisement of Samsung Electronics Galaxy Note 7 smartphone at the company's showroom in Seoul, South Korea, Sept. 2, 2016.

In a statement published on their website, Samsung addressed the FAA warning about the Note 7: We are aware of the Federal Aviation Administration’s statement about the Galaxy Note7. Consumer safety and peace of mind are our top priority. We plan to expedite new shipments of Galaxy Note7 starting from this week in order to alleviate any safety concerns and reduce any inconvenience for our customers. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. MORE: Samsung recalls Galaxy Note 7 after battery explosions » The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

John Harper writes DoD’s Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation Office estimated the cost of the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program to reach more than $85 billion in the coming years, or $23 billion more than the U.S. Air Force’s own estimate. James told reporters at the Pentagon that DoD and the Air Force used different methods, assumptions and data for the cost estimates. “The data that everybody is using to try to build up these cost estimates is somewhat dated simply because we haven’t done it in so long,” she added. The Air Force issued the request for proposals on the GBSD program in July. The report said Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman have submitted proposals for the program. “[As] we get the proposals back from industry, this will inform what I believe will be refinements in that cost estimate over time as we learn more,” James said, according to the report.

Added by Agency Staff on 9 September 2016. Saved under News, Top Tags: SAA, Samsung, South African Airways Tweet An SAA Boeing 747 photographed near OR Tambo International Airport (image: Bob Adams – CC BY-SA 2.0) South African Airways has banned the charging of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphones on board all its aircraft effective from Saturday, amid battery explosion reports. “South African Airways has taken a decision to prohibit the charging of Samsung Note 7 mobile phones on board all its aircraft,” SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said. “SAA will make appropriate announcements on board to remind passengers of this restriction and our crew has been briefed as well. “This does not amount to an outright ban of the device on our flights. We trust that all our customers will cooperate fully and observe this request which the airline is making based on safety considerations for passengers and crew,” he added. Tlali said that the decision will be effective as of Saturday, 10 September until further notice. The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) has also taken note of recent reports of exploding Note 7 batteries and concerns raised regarding the device. “Moreover, the SACAA has also noted the announcement by Samsung to stop the sales of the Galaxy Note7, and the company’s offer to replace similar devices already in customers’ possession,” SACAA said in a statement. “In light of these developments, the SACAA is currently and carefully looking into this matter and will take an appropriate decision in due course,” the statement read. However, the SACAA said that the current regulations do not prohibit airlines and operators from introducing additional and appropriate measures that would enhance civil aviation safety and security. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Comair, which operates Kulula.com and British Airways flights in South Africa, said that the company’s aircraft were not fitted with power sockets, so they would not be affected by faults which have been encountered with the Samsung Note 7. “It’s thus not necessary to ban the Samsung Note 7 from our flights,” Comair operations director Martin Louw said. “That said, we adhere precisely to the very specific procedures outlined by the Civil Aviation Authority and Boeing, including those procedures which involve electronic devices. The safety of our crew and passengers is always our foremost priority,” Louw said. Comair said it had not yet received instructions from regulators on the use of power banks and personal chargers. But if that changed, they would ensure adherence on board aircraft to any new instructions. “As stated, the safety of our crew and passengers is always our foremost priority,” Louw said. Samsung South Africa on Thursday put a stop all pre-orders of the Note 7 in the country after 35 cases of faulty devices as reported by the company. Initial reports suggested that charging the device without the original charger led to the risk of exploding batteries. The company said earlier that the availability date, which had initially been set as 23 September, had also been postponed until further notice. Meanwhile, the US Federal Aviation Administration has this week joined four Australian airlines in banning usage of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 on board flights.

The teen, Ines Madani, stabbed a police officer with a knife and was shot in the leg Thursday night in a raid south of Paris, police said. France's interior minister described the pursuit as "a race against time" to find Madani and the two women with her before they struck. Another of the women had, at one point, been in close contact with the extremist who killed two French police officials earlier this year before he was shot to death, two officials said. A man arrested Thursday also had ties to the dead jihadi, Larossi Abballa, who filmed himself on Facebook Live pledging allegiance to Islamic State as he sat in the home of the dead officials, one of the officials said. Security in train stations around Paris was visibly higher today as the investigation widened. "There's a group that has been annihilated, but there are others," French President Francois Hollande said today. "Information we were able to get from our intelligence services allowed us to act before it was too late." Nigeria facing 'a famine unlike any we have ever seen' MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) - The whimpers from skeletally thin babies too weak to cry are a harbinger of worse things to come: A quarter of the children lucky enough to make it to this emergency feeding center are dying. They are the latest victims of Boko Haram's Islamic insurgency. No one knows how many more children are dying of starvation in refugee camps and areas too dangerous to access because of the extremists' presence, according to Doctors Without Borders, which runs the emergency feeding center. The aid group first sounded the alarm of a humanitarian crisis of "catastrophic" proportion in northeast Nigeria as Boko Haram lost its grip on some areas and its victims began to emerge. "These are kids that basically have been hungry all their lives, and some are so far gone that they die here in the first 24 hours," said Jean Stowell, an American midwife in charge of the center in Maiduguri, the biggest city in this largely Muslim region. The 110-bed center has quadrupled in size in recent weeks, but each time it expands it rapidly fills. Nearly a quarter of a million children are severely malnourished because Boko Haram has disrupted trade and farming, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General Toby Lanzer warned at a meeting in Brussels on Thursday. About 2 million people in the region have not been reached, "and we can't assess their situation. We can estimate that it's awful." Dozens of birds fall from sky; officials want to know why BOSTON (AP) -- Health officials in Massachusetts are trying to figure out what caused dozens of birds to fall out of the sky onto a Boston street. City officials say 47 grackles were found Thursday in the city's Dorchester neighborhood. Some were found dead, while others were just sick. The Animal Rescue League of Boston says it went to the neighborhood after residents reported birds falling from the sky and a sick cat. The cat was later euthanized. The birds that died will be sent to Tufts University for testing. FIFA opens bribery case against Sepp Blatter, 2 others GENEVA (AP) -- Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter is now facing a bribery case. The FIFA ethics committee said today it opened formal proceedings against Blatter, former secretary general Jerome Valcke and former finance director Markus Kattner over million-dollar payments in their contracts -- some of which were approved by other senior FIFA officials. FIFA revealed in June, after Kattner was fired, that the three men agreed to pay themselves bonuses worth tens of millions of dollars from World Cup profits. Then, lawyers acting for FIFA described evidence suggesting "a coordinated effort by three former top officials of FIFA to enrich themselves." Ethics prosecutors said their investigation relates to bribery and corruption, accepting gifts and conflicts of interest for all three men, plus a breach of confidentiality by Kattner. Volunteer firefighters in Russia attacked by masked men MOSCOW (AP) -- Masked men armed with guns, knives and stun grenades early today attacked a camp of volunteer firefighters who came to southern Russia to help to put out forest fires. The environmental group Greenpeace, whose members were at the camp, said the men attacked their camp at night, beating up people and damaging their tents and cars parked nearby. Several people have been taken to the hospital, one of them with a broken nose, another with broken ribs. The government has been cutting funding for firefighting brigades so much that volunteers in recent years have been traveling to forest fires to help out. The attackers wielded the batons, knives and guns, Greenpeace Russia quoted firefighting volunteers coordinator Grigory Kuksin as saying: "They said if we don't get out of here till the morning, no one will ever find us, (they said) we should get the hell out of here to 'our America.' " The ultranationalist Cossack militia considers Greenpeace and other foreign NGOs to be Western spies infiltrating Russia. MasterCard faces $18.6 billion UK lawsuit over fees LONDON (AP) -- MasterCard is being sued for 14 billion pounds ($18.6 billion) in Britain for allegedly charging excessive fees on millions of transactions over a 16-year period. Law firm Quinn Emanuel filed the suit Thursday at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on behalf of Walter Merricks, a former U.K. financial services ombudsman. The firm says the claim is the biggest in British legal history and could bring a payout to 46 million British MasterCard users. The suit alleges that MasterCard charged stores unlawfully high fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008, which were passed on to consumers in the form of inflated prices for goods and services. FAA warns airline passengers not to use Samsung phone that could catch fire WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ------ Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. ------ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP--Joan--Lowy.

With AP Photos. By MARCIA DUNN AP Aerospace Writer CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A NASA spacecraft is on its way to the space rock Bennu (BEHN'oo). The Osiris-Rex explorer rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on Thursday evening, just before sunset. It was the start of a seven-year quest to the big, black, unexplored asteroid. Once there, the spacecraft will gather a few handfuls of gravel for return to Earth. These bite-size bits of ancient space rock -- due here in 2023 if all goes well -- could hold clues to the origin of life. Thousands gathered to witness the evening launch of Osiris-Rex, a robotic hunter resembling a bird. It took flight atop an Atlas V (five) rocket. Among the well-wishers: Mike Puzio, the 12-year-old North Carolina boy who won a contest to name the asteroid.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/18/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Fort Plain man arrested for molestation Monday, November 14, 2016 3 arrested for prostitution in Amsterdam Monday, November 14, 2016 Facts and figures for the opening of deer hunting season Saturday, November 12, 2016 State police to focus on 'Move Over' law through Friday Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Montgomery County OFA receives $359K in state, federal funds Saturday, November 12, 2016 Mohawk reviews scope of work for annexation Saturday, November 12, 2016 Neighborhood Watch learns to ID drug deals Tuesday, November 15, 2016 The News in Brief Tuesday, November 15, 2016 Charlotte V.

Some of the largest Fortune 500 companies are bringing factory jobs back to U.S. shores. American flag photo via Pixabay A growing number of American companies are reshoring part or all of their operations to the U.S., a major theme in this election year. This blog looks at five Fortune 500 firms bringing manufacturing home, and focuses on story angles business reporters can use. General Electric Co. In 2011, General Electric brought the manufacturing of its energy-efficient water heaters back to Louisville, Kentucky after years of building the devices in China. USA Today reports that the move returned hundreds of manufacturing and engineering jobs to the States. The American Manufacturers Association also notes that over the past seven years General Electric has made high-efficiency light bulbs and batteries on American soil, adding 2,656 jobs. The Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit advocacy group, reports the reasons for the switch: government incentives, the ability to improve business processes, and overseas issues such inventory control, currency changes, freight costs and personnel risks. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The mammoth retailer is one the biggest American companies to reshore operations. Although it remains a major importer of goods from China, 2013 saw the launch of Walmart’s Made in America initiative. The company pledged that by 2030, it would purchase $250 billion of products made, sourced or grown in the U.S. The American Manufacturers Association reports that the program has already brought 4,838 jobs back to America. Walmart hopes its efforts can create 1 million jobs in America, according to Boston Consulting Group. Ford Motor Co. In 2015, Ford brought back part of its operations from Mexico and Spain to Avon Lake, Ohio, creating 3,200 manufacturing jobs in the process. Some of the company’s truck models and engines are also being manufactured in the U.S. 24/7 Wall Street reports that along with state tax breaks, improving manufacturing quality and reducing shipping costs were the biggest incentives for these moves. Boeing Co. In Fall 2014, Boeing announced plans to reshore the manufacturing of its 777 series passenger jets to its St. Louis plant. Completing the process will likely take until 2017. Puget Sound Business Journal reports that Boeing’s incentive are tied to its goal of “zero growth in greenhouse gas emissions over the decade ending in 2017.” Caterpillar Inc. Caterpillar has brought some of its manufacturing from Japan and Mexico to several plants across the U.S., including Victoria, Texas, and Athens, Georgia. San Antonio Business Journal reports that moving its construction equipment manufacturing operations from Mexico to Texas will bring around 200 jobs to region, and benefit both dealers and customers. Reporter’s Takeaways More U.S. companies are attempting to restore jobs to Americans by bringing back part or all of its operations from overseas. The Reshoring Initiative is an excellent resource for researching specific cases. The Walmart Made in America initiative alone, through which the retailer pledges to purchase $250 billion of products made, sourced or grown in the states by 2030, hopes to restore 1 million jobs to the country. Look into the incentives for companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.; state tax brakes, supply chain costs and green initiatives may play a role. Debbi G McCullough runs Hanging Rock Media.

BUSINESS No flying Tesla? That's because electric planes are a steeper challenge than electric cars Airbus E-Fan prototype Jean-Pierre Muller / AFP/Getty Images A pilot sits inside the Airbus E-Fan prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at Bordeaux-Merignac Airport in France on April 25, 2014. A pilot sits inside the Airbus E-Fan prototype electric aircraft during a presentation at Bordeaux-Merignac Airport in France on April 25, 2014. (Jean-Pierre Muller / AFP/Getty Images) Samantha Masunaga Thousands of electric cars are on the road, with many more set to join them over the next few years. Electric planes? Not so much. There are several small, experimental aircraft out there — NASA is building an electricity-powered plane set for a test flight next year and a two-seat Airbus electric aircraft soared over the English Channel in 2015. But don’t expect an electric jet to fly hundreds of passengers anytime soon. Battery limitations all but rule that out. “A lot of the technical advances that happen start in smaller airplanes,” said Richard Anderson, director of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s flight research center and a professor of aerospace engineering. “There will be a market that stands for smaller, fully-electric airplanes.” The concept of using electric motors to power airplane systems dates back at least to World War II, when the B-29 Superfortress bomber used electric motors to power its gun turrets. Since then, other airplanes have replaced the ducts and hoses of hydraulic and pneumatic systems with electrical power to control such things as stabilizers and brakes. That can save significant weight and reduce fuel burn. Using electrical power to actually propel planes, however, is a more complicated challenge. In a conventional jet airplane, the engine sucks air in through its front, a compressor squeezes it, and fuel is sprayed in and lit, creating burning gases and forward thrust. Electric plane power is much simpler — batteries power an electric motor that spins a propeller. It’s more efficient, but involves far less thrust, which is why electric planes tend to be slow.  Airbus’ two-seat electric plane could only go a maximum speed of about 136 miles per hour. A solar-powered plane that completed an around-the-world journey this summer had an average airspeed of 47 miles per hour. The plane, called Solar Impulse 2, had more than 17,000 solar cells that powered four electric motors.  The payoff, however, could be a quieter, greener way to fly. According to a recent report from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, aircraft were responsible for about 8% of the greenhouse gas emitted by the U.S. transportation sector in 2014. That compares to 23% for medium- and heavy-duty trucks and 61% for light-duty vehicles.  “As technology progresses, I think we’ll see big strides in improvements in noise, direct operating costs, reduction in fossil fuel burning and reduction in emissions,” Anderson said of electric aircraft research. An electric plane gets its energy from batteries, generally lithium-ion. An example of that is NASA’s X-57, an experimental plane that will test how electric propulsion technology can improve performance. See the most-read stories in Business this hour » A team of NASA researchers and private industry professionals is converting an Italian-designed Tecnam twin-engine plane fuselage into an all-electric plane by swapping out the original piston engines for electric motors and switching to battery power. A later iteration of the plane, if it receives funding, would have a modified wing with 14 electric motors that would turn propellers to simulate a high-lift component, which would reduce the speed that’s normally needed to take off. The conversion is taking place at Scaled Composites’ Mojave headquarters. Prime contractor Empirical Systems Aerospace is from Oceano, Calif.; Electric Power Systems of City of Industry is developing the battery system; Santa Cruz electric aviation start-up Joby Aviation is working on the cruise motors; and San Luis Obispo company Xperimental is making the wing. The efficiency of electric power enables other design advances, said Sean Clarke, principal investigator for the X-57 project at NASA’s Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base. For example, the electric motors’ smaller size and weight allowed engineers to experiment with a smaller wing and multiple engines for increased lift, said Matt Redifer, chief engineer for the X-57. “I think that electric propulsion technologies are going to greatly improve aircraft design over the next few decades," Clarke said. The biggest hurdle for these projects is battery technology, particularly a battery’s specific energy, or the amount of energy it can store for a given amount of weight. I think that electric propulsion technologies are going to greatly improve aircraft design over the next few decades. — Sean Clarke, principal investigator for the X-57 project Despite improvements, planes need a lot of lithium-ion batteries to achieve significant range. In electric cars, the main problem was the cost of the batteries, which is starting to come down. In planes, the biggest challenge is weight. The jet fuel capacity of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner is about 223,000 pounds, according to an airport planning document released in December. The estimated weight of a battery pack with equivalent energy would be 4.5 million pounds, Anderson said.  “Unless there’s a cosmic change in the battery, it’s just not going to work for bigger, faster airplanes,” he said. “It’s going to be a really long time before batteries weigh less than liquid fuel.” The X-57’s battery system alone weighs about 800 pounds — close to the weight of the plane’s fuselage. The weight of the entire aircraft is 3,000 pounds. To mitigate this, Empirical Systems Aerospace decided to put the batteries in the fuselage rather than in the wings, said Philip Osterkamp, lead integration engineer for instrumentation systems on the X-57 at Empirical Systems Aerospace. Tesla Autopilot upgrade is imminent, Elon Musk says Russ Mitchell Tesla Motors Inc. will announce “major improvements” for its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system Wednesday, according to Chief Executive Elon Musk.

Tesla Motors Inc. will announce “major improvements” for its Autopilot semi-autonomous driving system Wednesday, according to Chief Executive Elon Musk. The improvements will come “primarily through advanced processing of radar signals,” Musk said in a series of tweets. He promised more details... (Russ Mitchell) Packing lithium-ion batteries on a plane has other drawbacks. In 2014, a federal probe found that an internal short circuit in a battery cell was the “probable cause” of a 2013 fire aboard a parked Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Boeing has since redesigned the batteries. Battery limitations grounded the Firefly, an all-electric helicopter developed several years ago by Sikorsky Innovations as a technology demonstrator. Firefly never flew and the program is no longer active. “It just wasn’t worth it for where the battery technology was at the time,” said Chris Van Buiten, vice president of innovation at Sikorsky. The company continues “internal explorations and studies” on the technology’s progress, he said. A more viable solution is a hybrid system with at least two motors: an electric motor that turns the propeller and a gas engine that drives another generator for power. Since its English Channel crossing, Airbus has modified its all-electric E-Fan into a hybrid to improve range and learn more about that technology. The aerospace giant is also developing an E-Fan 2.0 that runs only on electric power. NASA considered making its X-57 a hybrid, but because the plane is not intended as a commercial product, the team decided to focus simply on electric propulsion technologies, said Clarke of NASA. The ideas may not end up working out quite as expected, but he said the plane’s development is “trying to push the limit.” “NASA’s prepared for that kind of risk,” Clarke said. “We want to take bigger risks and learn where the technology could go.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Some Trump supporters say it's not fair to equate white pride with white supremacists, the Rams break ground on their new stadium, Trump moves forward with naming positions in his administration, and Los Angeles practices for a major earthquake.

SAMSUNG ISSUES WORLDWIDE RECALL OF GALAXY NOTE 7 Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

The Federal Aviation Authority has warned passengers not to turn on or charge their phones because of concerns about the devices. It has also told passengers not to put their phones in their checked bags. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments It is one of the first times that the FAA has warned people about a specific device, this time referring to the new Galaxy Note 7. The warning followed a global recall of the phone, after reports that they spontaneously exploded. Samsung investigated the problems and found that the rechargeable batteries inside the phones were at fault. In one case, a family in St Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive line-ups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring.

U.S. aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said.

Sep 9th 2016, 11:33 AM 16,664 Views 12 Comments Share43 Tweet Email1 Image: AP Photo/Richard Drew US AVIATION SAFETY officials took the extraordinary step late Thursday of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing “recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung” about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports had found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St Petersburg, Florida, reported a Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner. Source: AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.

The project has been known since Soviet times as A-60 (A-60SE).

Source: Mil.ru Russia is working on a plane equipped with a new-generation laser, a source in the Russian defense industry has said in an interview with the TASS news agency. "The defense industry is working on a new-generation air-based laser," said the source. In his words, the plane with the laser is being referred to as the A-60. Earlier, the mass media reported (in Russian) that the weapon is being realized as part of the Sokol-Eshelon project.  The A-60 flying laser However, this is not the first time that Russia has tried to develop an effective plane-mounted laser weapon, and reflects the resurrection of an old project begun in the Soviet era. Work on the air-based laser system (LKAB) began in the Almaz scientific-productive association in June 1965. Almaz carried out the work on the aviation system along with the G. M. Beriev aviation scientific-technical plant in Taganrog (700 miles south of Moscow). Russia may soon be able to hit targets in space Together the two scientific centers created the A-60 Soviet aviation laser system, to be installed on the Il-76 airplane. Active testing of the flying laser system was conducted at an airport near Moscow in 1983. On April 27, 1984 the A-60's laser successfully struck an aerial target, which received the necessary damage after being hit with the radiation. In the 1990s, due to the collapse of the USSR and the consequent economic crisis, work on the project was halted. It was renewed only in the 2000s. Experts say that it is incorrect to attribute to the laser system "the objective to intercept combat blocks of ballistic missiles." "No one ever expected this of the LKAB," said Konstantin Makienko, deputy director of the Moscow-based Center for Strategy and Technology Analysis. Specialists have distinguished not so much the possibilities of striking the target thermally as the laser’s potential to suppress optic-electronic reconnaissance instruments: periscopes, rangefinders and other devices that modern weapons possess. Thanks to their focus characteristics, such devices significantly augment the impact of laser radiation. The laser's striking range can be hundreds and thousands of times greater in comparison to the limited range of the thermal strike, say Almaz representatives. The A-60 Soviet aviation laser system was to be installed on the Il-76 airplane. Source: Krasnaya zvezda Inexpensive, instantaneous and good for any weather Laser weapons are attractive primarily because of their possibility to unexpectedly and practically instantaneously (with the speed of light) attack the enemy. They are also interesting because of the inexpensiveness of the “shot,” their high precision, as well as the absence of the need to maintain an arsenal of "ammunition" during peacetime. Because it can be installed on a plane a laser can be used in all weather (shooting is not affected by cloudiness, for example), it can be transported to various locations and it can be easily maneuvered. What will 6th-generation fighters be like in the U.S. and Russia? In August 2009 the defense industry carried out an experiment in which the laser ray from the A-60 plane was aimed at a spacecraft at an altitude of over 900 miles (1,500 kilometers). Several dozen space apparatuses were discovered and tracked by the laser during the flight. At the end of 2012, according to the Izvestiya newspaper, the Defense Ministry ordered the renewal of work to create combat lasers that would strike airplanes, satellites and ballistic missiles. A laser weapons race? The U.S. also carried out tests of a powerful laser as part of the ABL project aimed at creating an anti-missile defense system. Boeing, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin participated in the project. In land tests conducted in 1985, the chemical laser heated up and blew up an immobile fuel tank at a distance of around 1,000 yards (about 1 kilometer). Modernized Russian bombers will be able to fly in the stratosphere This system had been assembled on the modified Boeing 747-400F cargo plane. The ABL consisted of infrared sensors for identifying the targets, three lasers and a lens system for focusing the ray. The tests were carried out almost annually, but in the end the testers were not able to reach the desired level of effectiveness. The project was abandoned in 2012. "The domestic aviation laser complex will use the excellence of laser weapons to maximum effect for solving important problems in Russia's aerospace defense. We are convinced that, by creating this innovative system, Almaz and the association of enterprises will maintain their leading position in the development of laser systems," said a spokesperson from the Almaz press service.

The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle.

Aviation safety officials took the extraordinary step of warning airline passengers not to turn on or charge a new model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The Federal Aviation Administration issued the warning Sept. 8, citing ¿recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung about its Galaxy Note 7 devices.¿ It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Australian airline companies were among the first to take measures. Qantas has asked passengers not to switch the Note 7 devices on and not to charge them during flights, its spokeswoman Sharna Rhys-Jones said. Media reports said other Australian airlines took a similar step, including Jetstar Airways and Virgin Australia. Shares of Samsung suffered their second worst day of the year, tumbling 4 percent Friday on the Korea Exchange. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn't the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing's 787 jetliner. Rechargeable lithium batteries are more susceptible to overheating than other types of batteries if they are exposed to high temperatures, are damaged or have manufacturing flaws. Once the overheating starts, it can lead to "thermal runaway" in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can extinguish the flames, but doesn't always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries are ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane. ___ Kristen Gelineau in Sydney contributed to this report. ___ Follow Joan Lowy at http://twitter.com/AP_Joan_Lowy.

PHOTO | FILE  By VICTOR JUMA, vjuma@ke.nationmedia.com Posted  Friday, September 9   2016 at  09:47 In Summary The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. National carrier Kenya Airways’ decision to sub-lease five aeroplanes to foreign airlines left it with a Sh4 billion loss, the company’s latest financial statement shows. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet Related Stories Kenya Airways board to share recovery plan with shareholders KQ leases two more planes to Turkish, Oman Air KQ plane sales and leases to earn carrier Sh11bn The multi-billion shilling loss is the difference between revenues earned from the sub-leasing contracts and payments to be made to primary lessors in the same period. Kenya Airways yesterday said that the prevailing business circumstances had made it prudent to reduce excess capacity through leasing, adding that the Sh4 billion loss is an accounting treatment covering the entire period of the sub-lease. The loss-making contracts are the latest culmination of the chain of bad decisions linked to an expansion binge dubbed Project Mawingu, and which it has been unwinding in the past year at a heavy cost to shareholders. KQ, as the airline is popularly known, signed the deals to mitigate even larger losses it would have incurred from cancelling the contracts after it failed to fly the planes profitably. “The airline has sub-leased certain aircraft that are held on operating and finance lease at lease rentals that are lower than that charged by the primary lessors resulting into onerous lease provision,” the Nairobi Securities Exchange-listed firm says in its latest annual report. KQ last year leased five Boeing aeroplanes to Oman Air and Turkish Airlines in the middle of a liquidity crisis that it only navigated with the help of the government.

KQ chief executive Mbuvi Ngunze said at the time of signing the lease contracts that they would reduce fleet costs by Sh8.4 billion annually, indicating that sub-leasing at a loss (which was not disclosed at the time) represents a lesser evil compared to maintaining a bloated fleet. “These actions will reduce our monthly fleet costs by over $7 million (Sh707 million), and improve our liquidity, and is part of our strategy to return Kenya Airways to profitability in the next 18 to 24 months,” Mr Ngunze said on a May 26, 2016 statement, adding that while it was sad to see brand new aircraft going to other airlines, it was important to understand the context in which the decision was made.  READ: Kenya Airways board to share recovery plan with shareholders KQ leased two B787s to Oman Air for three years and is set to take a loss of Sh918 million in that transaction. Besides, its lease of three B773s to Turkish Airlines for four years is expected to result in a loss of 3.1 billion, bringing the total loss to Sh4 billion. Sub-leasing the aircraft, non-renewal of other leases and sale of several aeroplanes saw KQ’s fleet drop to 47 planes in the year ended March compared to 52 units the year before. 1 | 2 Next Page » Latest from Daily Nation: Business State bets on new pest-proof storage bags to reduce maize wastage GE Africa celebrates breast cancer awareness month Big GE digital acquisition uses cloud analytics to keep machines in shape GE Africa and USADF launch 2017 Off-Grid Energy Challenge for women Loss-making Portland set to send home 1,000 workers NSE top gainers & losers n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms RSS

The airline has warned about Samsung devices after some caught fire overseas. Photo / Alan Gibson Air New Zealand has joined other airlines of warning passengers not to turn on or charge a new-model Samsung smartphone during flights following numerous reports of the devices catching fire. The US Federal Aviation Administration has warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing "recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung" about the devices. "On recommendation from the FAA all Air New Zealand customers carrying Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices must ensure that they are carried in the cabin only and not turned on or charged while onboard any Air New Zealand service," an airline spokeswoman said. The devices must not be carried in checked in baggage. Airlines in Australia have taken similar action. Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users' eyes to unlock the phone. Continued below.

On Friday morning, Musk tweeted his concern about a bang heard shortly before the massive explosion. Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2016 He also addressed the fact that there was the possibility that something had hit the rocket moments before. @ashwin7002 @NASA @faa @AFPAA We have not ruled that out. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 9, 2016 This is the second time in just over a year that SpaceX has lost a rocket. In June 2015, a Falcon 9 rocket exploded shortly after liftoff after a strut in the its upper stage liquid oxygen tank failed. This caused the helium tank to release too much helium into the upper-stage liquid oxygen tank which increased the pressure, causing it to explode.

Boeing is also contracted for a crew capsule. Though SpaceX has suffered a devastating loss with this explosion, it has successfully returned the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket to Earth as part of its reusable rocket initiative, aimed at making space travel cheaper and therefore more accessible.

 Elon Musk: SpaceX's fireball is 'the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had' Dave Mosher Sep. 9, 2016, 10:31 AM 22,563 facebook linkedin twitter email print Elon Musk, left, the founder of SpaceX, and the September 1 explosion of a Falcon 9 rocket, right, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Max Whitaker/Getty Images; USLaunchReport.com; Business Insider A little more than a week after SpaceX's launchpad rocket explosion, tech entrepreneur Elon Musk — the aerospace company's founder, CEO, and CTO — has hinted at how trying its investigation has become. "Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation," Musk wrote on Twitter early Friday morning. "Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years." The cause of the September 1 mishap isn't yet known, but experts say the incident will hamper SpaceX's ambitious launch schedule. "It typically takes nine to 12 months for people to return to flight. That's what the history is," Tory Bruno, CEO of United Launch Alliance, told Reuters reporter Irene Klotz. And the ramifications will extend well beyond SpaceX's walls, says Wayne Hale, an engineer, aerospace consultant, and NASA's former space-shuttle program director. "It sets back the whole industry," Hale told Business Insider, adding that such accidents remind people of the "risky business" of launching rockets. Hale also said the blast leads "to the perception that folks aren't doing their jobs quite as well as they could" in the spaceflight industry. SpaceX declined to respond on the record to Hale's comments and did not immediately respond to a question about Bruno's comments on the potentially lengthy nature of the investigation. However, John Logsdon, a space policy expert and historian at George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, told Business Insider that Bruno's comment is based on past experience with other rockets, not SpaceX's. "Until [the] investigation finds cause, all anyone (like Bruno) can do is informed-by-experience speculation," Logsdon wrote in an email to Business Insider. Other industry experts have expressed some measured optimism in the fallout of SpaceX's latest failure. Samantha Masunaga at The Los Angeles Times reported on September 1: "Bill Ostrove, an aerospace and defense analyst at Forecast International, said SpaceX's reliability with the Falcon 9 is 93%, which is 'right in the ballpark' of the industry average of 95%." Michael Blades, a senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at Frost & Sullivan, also told The LA Times: "The investment [in private space efforts] will still happen. I don't think the technology is in jeopardy. It's just going to be a bump in the road." Investigating the fireball The explosion happened on Sept. 1 at 9:07 a.m., just a few minutes before the 229-foot-tall Falcon 9 rocket was supposed to briefly test-fire its engines. At that moment, the rocket catastrophically blew up at a launchpad called Space Launch Center 40, or SLC-40, leading to a giant fireball and several smaller explosions. No one was hurt during the blast, which destroyed Facebook's $200 million Amos-6 satellite — a device that was supposed to help provide internet service to the developing world. The blast reportedly shattered windows nearby, knocked sliding doors off people's homes farther away, and was heard as far as 30 miles from SLC-40, according to local Florida TV stations. SpaceX would not disclose the damage to SLC-40 and declined Business Insider's request for the company's own photos and video of the accident. However, the damage could be worse than meets the eye, according to a source who's employed at a company that does work at Cape Canaveral. The source — who asked to remain anonymous because of security concerns — told Business Insider that he has driven by SLC-40, as have his colleagues, and says it appears that a lot of the rocket's kerosene-like fuel spilled out during the accident, leaking into crucial launchpad structures. "The foundation of these structures are from the mid '60s," the source wrote in a text message. "Concrete doesn't react well to being subjected to prolonged [heating]." Musk's company also wouldn't comment on the $50 million reimbursement being sought by Spacecom, the maker of Facebook's satellite. "We don't disclose contract or insurance terms," a SpaceX spokesperson wrote in an email to Business Insider. SpaceX's statement SpaceX's launch Pad 39A in Cape Canaveral, Florida. SpaceX/Flickr On September 2, SpaceX issued a full statement about the explosion. Note that instances of "anomaly" refer to the explosion (though Musk wrote on Twitter that it's more of a fireball), and we've emphasized certain parts in bold: "SpaceX has begun the careful and deliberate process of understanding the causes and fixes for yesterday's incident. We will continue to provide regular updates on our progress and findings, to the fullest extent we can share publicly. "We deeply regret the loss of Amos-6, and safely and reliably returning to flight to meet the demands of our customers is our chief priority. SpaceX's business is robust, with approximately 70 missions on our manifest worth over $10 billion. In the aftermath of yesterday's events, we are grateful for the continued support and unwavering confidence that our commercial customers as well as NASA and the United States Air Force have placed in us. "Overview of the incident: Yesterday, at SpaceX's Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, an anomaly took place about eight minutes in advance of a scheduled test firing of a Falcon 9 rocket. The anomaly on the pad resulted in the loss of the vehicle. This was part of a standard pre-launch static fire to demonstrate the health of the vehicle prior to an eventual launch. At the time of the loss, the launch vehicle was vertical and in the process of being fueled for the test. At this time, the data indicates the anomaly originated around the upper stage liquid oxygen tank. Per standard operating procedure, all personnel were clear of the pad. There were no injuries. "To identify the root cause of the anomaly, SpaceX began its investigation immediately after the loss, consistent with accident investigation plans prepared for such a contingency. These plans include the preservation of all possible evidence and the assembly of an Accident Investigation Team, with oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration and participation by NASA, the United States Air Force and other industry experts. We are currently in the early process of reviewing approximately 3000 channels of telemetry and video data covering a time period of just 35-55 milliseconds. "As for the Launch Pad itself, our teams are now investigating the status of SLC-40. The pad clearly incurred damage, but the scope has yet to be fully determined. We will share more data as it becomes available. SpaceX currently operates 3 launch pads — 2 in Florida and 1 in California at Vandenberg Air Force Base. SpaceX's other launch sites were not affected by yesterday's events. Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base is in the final stages of an operational upgrade and Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center remains on schedule to be operational in November. Both pads are capable of supporting Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. We are confident the two launch pads can support our return to flight and fulfill our upcoming manifest needs. "Again, our number one priority is to safely and reliably return to flight for our customers, as well as to take all the necessary steps to ensure the highest possible levels of safety for future crewed missions with the Falcon 9. We will carefully and thoroughly investigate and address this issue." NASA's statement A model of SpaceX's Dragon capsule, which is designed to carry astronauts. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Business Insider also contacted NASA about any potential disruptions to its Commercial Crew Program, through which SpaceX and Boeing are designing, building, and testing spacecraft to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. The ultimate goal of CCP is to replace the astronaut-launching ability of the Space Shuttle program, ended in mid-2011, and prevent the space agency from having to pay Russia billions of dollars for the privilege. NASA spokesperson Tabatha Thompson told Business Insider on September 2 (emphasis added): "NASA remains confident in our commercial partners and in the goals of the Commercial Crew Program to take astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. It is too early to know whether Thursday's incident will impact their development schedules. Spacecraft and launch vehicles designed for the Commercial Crew Program must meet NASA's stringent safety criteria before being certified to launch crews into space. Successfully meeting those requirements has always taken precedence over schedule. "Both companies working with the Commercial Crew Program are required to carry numerous additional safeguards including a launch abort system that can be activated while the rocket is still on the launch pad. Those systems must be proven in flight tests before NASA will certify them for missions carrying astronauts. SpaceX tested its launch abort system from the pad successfully in May 2015. Both SpaceX and Boeing plan to further test launch abort systems in 2017. "NASA and our partners remain committed to meeting the goals of the Commercial Crew Program."

The Upstate Chamber Coalition, representing 13 different local chambers of commerce from eight counties, joined forces to urge Congress to give final approval to the harbor deepening project, which would allow the larger post-Panamax ships to load and unload their cargo on the east coast. “Our Upstate manufacturers use that port every day,” said Jason Zacher, vice president of business advocacy for the Greenville Chamber of Commerce and executive director of the coalition. The South Carolina Ports Authority commissioned a study last year that credits state port facilities and the companies that use them with an estimated $27 billion economic impact in the Upstate. BMW Manufacturing Co., Michelin North America and General Electric Co., are huge port customers. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said the current version of the federal water resources legislation includes a provision giving final approval to deepen the port to 52 feet. “If we don’t get there, we become a backwater port,” Graham said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has estimated the project to cost about $521 million. The South Carolina General Assembly in 2012 set aside $300 million to cover the state’s share of the project. Graham, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said one of his top priorities for South Carolina this year is to get the project approved and funded. “I like our chances,” he said. The chamber group met with the members of South Carolina’s House delegation on Thursday morning, and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., spoke to them about criminal justice reform. The group also supports re-opening the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that provides loans, guarantees and credit insurance to businesses that want to put their products on the global market. Congress refused to renew the institution’s public charter amid criticism that it was a political tool used to favor certain companies, and that businesses had other private options for such financing. The shut down “had a crippling effect on the suppliers for Boeing and GE,” Graham said, and he urged the Upstate business leaders to lobby for its re-opening. To that end, Graham has legislation pending that would let the bank operate even if the Senate refuses to confirm the appointment of a new board member. “These two things – the port and the Ex-Im Bank — are critical to South Carolina’s economy,” Graham said.

The Federal Aviation Administration also warned passengers not to put the Galaxy Note 7 phones in their checked bags, citing “recent incidents and concerns raised by Samsung” about the devices. It is extremely unusual for the FAA to warn passengers about a specific product. 2 This Galaxy Note 7 smartphone reportedly burst into flames while charging overnight, causing $1800 damage to a hotel room Samsung suspend Galaxy Note 7 sales after multiple battery explosions Last week, Samsung ordered a global recall of the jumbo phones after its investigation of explosion reports found the rechargeable lithium batteries were at fault. In one case, a family in St. Petersburg, Florida, reported a Galaxy Note 7 phone left charging in their Jeep caught fire, destroying the vehicle. Samsung launched the latest version of the Note series in August. The Note series is one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung, and the devices usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S phones that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which detects patterns in users’ eyes to unlock the phone. Before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. The Note 7 isn’t the only gadget to catch fire thanks to lithium-battery problems, which have afflicted everything from laptops to Tesla cars to Boeing’s 787 jetliner.

Once the overheating starts, it can lead to “thermal runaway” in which temperatures continue escalating to very high levels. Water can put out the flames, but doesn’t always halt the thermal runaway. Flames will often reappear after initially being quenched. Lithium batteries have become ubiquitous in consumer electronic devices. Manufacturers like them because they weigh less and pack considerably more energy into the same space than other types of batteries. Earlier this year, the International Civil Aviation Organization, a U.N. agency that sets global aviation safety standards, banned bulk shipments of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries as cargo on passenger planes until better packaging can be developed to prevent a fire from spreading and potentially destroying the plane.
