(Photo: Bill Carey) Qatar Airways has placed an order with Boeing for 40 787-9 and 777-300ER widebody airliners, plus signed a letter of intent for up to 60 737 Max 8s, which would be the Gulf carrier’s first narrowbody purchase from Boeing in 15 years. The transactions combined are valued at $18.6 billion at list prices. During a press conference that Qatar Airways hosted in Washington, D.C., on October 7, chief executive Akbar Al Baker said the carrier remains committed to a 50-aircraft package with Airbus for A320neo and A321neo airliners, though it has cancelled initial orders because of delivery delays. “We never renege on contracts that we sign. We have a contract signed with Airbus for 50 neo airplanes, and we will continue to get those airplanes,” he said. “The [Boeing 737] that we are ordering today is to serve the ever-expanding network and we are taking these Max airplanes in order to get a firm delivery schedule. “As you know the neos are having problems,” Al Baker added, in reference to early problems with Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered aircraft. “The airlines that have received them are not getting the quantities that they require because of the ongoing issues with the aircraft. For us, to mitigate our [issues] we have no alternative but to order the reliable 737 family of aircraft, which will fuel our continued demand for growth.” Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Ray Conner, Qatar minister of finance Ali Sharif Al Emadi and U.S. deputy secretary of state Tony Blinken joined Al Baker for the announcement at a Georgetown hotel. Specifically, Qatar Airways ordered 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs valued at $11.7 billion. The 60 737 Max 8s would cost $6.9 billion at list price. Plans call for the 737 deliveries to begin next year, Boeing said. During questioning, Al Baker denied any linkage between the airline’s order and the recently approved U.S. foreign military sale of 36 Boeing F-15 fighters to Qatar. “We don’t relate anything to anything,” he said. “Qatar Airways has an independent policy of ordering airplanes. So nothing is attached to anything.” Nor was the order influenced by discussions the U.S., Qatari and UAE governments have held over civil aviation agreements between the countries, Al Baker said. The talks were undertaken after U.S. carriers American, United and Delta accused their Gulf counterparts—Qatar Airways, Emirates and Etihad  Airways—of anti-competitive practices. “We don’t attach any orders that we place with Boeing to get any special favors for anybody,” Al Baker said. “We have an air services agreement signed between the United States and my country. We meticulously follow each and every condition and clause of that air services agreement…At the end of the day, the business and commercial and economic relationship between our two countries will prevail and not the vested interest of any business entity.” Aircraft http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-07/qatar-airways-places-18-billion-order-boeing-airliners There are no comments yet, please Login or Register to begin a discussion.

Street6 Oct 2016Newport Beach, CA0 6 Oct, 2016 6 Oct, 2016 SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER Mars is the destination for the next space race, and unlike the first round in the Cold War, this one will be between private companies, not countries. With NASA expected to conclude its research on the International Space Station before 2024, U.S. space travel and colonization has been turned over to private companies like SpaceX, Boeing, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic for the conquest of Mars. SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER SpaceX CEO Elon Musk kicked off the land rush to Mars when he formally announced on September 26 at the 67th International Astronautical Congress in Guadalajara, Mexico, that he intends to “Make Humans a Multi-planetary Species” by having SpaceX launch the first leg of its privately funded two-year mission to Mars by 2022. Musk hilariously commented at the conference, “I’d like to die on Mars, just not on impact.” Musk outlined that SpaceX would soon unveil a powerful reusable rocket system called the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS), which can carry a 100-person working crew to the “Red Planet” to set up permanent extraterrestrial colonies, factories and mines. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, speaking at an early October conference in Chicago, said his company was joining the land rush, and that he is “convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” according to Bloomberg. Boeing unveiled its heavy-lift rocket project, called the Space Launch System, which also aims to develop reusable rocket systems. Many aspects of Boeing’s plan appear similar to SpaceX, but Muilenburg commented that his plan is a more realistic approach because it will rely on at least $60 billion in private sector satellite launches and NASA-funded development prior to a human-crewed venture to Mars in the late 2030s. NASA has essentially been operating as a joint venture in space travel with the Russians since the July 17, 1975 “rendezvous between the Soyuz and Apollo spacecrafts proved that the Soviet Union and the United States could set aside their differences in the name of advancing manned spaceflight,” according to Stratfor Global Intelligence. The partnership allowed Washington to curtail drastically its very expansive NASA budgets, which at the height of the Apollo program accounted for 4.2 percent of all federal budget spending. Today, that budget is less than one-half percent of federal spending. As NASA’s budget declined, the U.S. space agency also struck partnership deals with other nations and the private sector to help finance research efforts. Although the U.S. continued to pay most of the cost of the International Space Station, the U.S. gained benefits, sharing the expenses with others. Historically, manned space flight has been mostly about basic research, and had few military applications. A few experiments could only be conducted in zero atmosphere, but there is no advantage to putting military special forces in space. Remote satellites are far superior to manned spacecraft for reconnaissance and imaging programs. But with the U.S. once again becoming a military and policy adversary on the world stage to the Russians and the Chinese, the importance of space as the ultimate high ground in terrestrial warfare is becoming more obvious, according to Stratfor. The U.S. has always banned Chinese scientists from working with their NASA counterparts because of national security concerns. The International Space Station required all participating nations to hand over technical information and make their hardware freely accessible to anyone involved in the program, a step China has refused to take. China, with the help of Russia, launched its second space lab into orbit in September as a preparatory step to a permanent space station in the 2020s. Russia has recently announced that it intends to separate their portion of the International Space Station modules in 2024, and then build their own outpost, or partner with the Chinese. China and Russia are focused on colonization and economic exploitation of the moon. Beijing plans to follow the model of its One Belt, One Road strategy of using economic projects and partnerships to gain political support abroad, particularly in the developing world. Moscow’s space strategy is focused on military projects and the projection of power. But NASA and the Obama administration are squarely focused on reaching the Red Planet, and will let private sector companies grab Mars as the ultimate resource platform.

His contributions to geology and biology rank him as one of the greatest scientists in history. His inventions — from the parachute to the helicopter — were centuries before their time. He was able to accomplish all of this in large part because he saw all knowledge as related. So when trying to tackle one of the biggest challenges of our time — educating students today for the jobs of tomorrow — it is only natural to take inspiration from this true "Renaissance man." To best prepare students for the increasingly complex and demanding challenges in today's world, they must learn to adapt to new environments and readily envision new ideas and innovations. They must be able to think conceptually and learn from failures. They must understand science, technology, engineering, arts and math — the STEAM fields that will be critical in the 21st Century workforce — and how all of them work together in the real world. VIDEOS TOP JOBS This week we celebrate The Leonardo Museum's fifth anniversary. For the past five years, we have developed one-of-a-kind interactive exhibits to help Utah's students think more like da Vinci and become better prepared for whatever comes their way in the future. Visitors are immersed in issues that face us locally and globally and are provided STEAM concepts and tools as a way to navigate these real-world problems. Students have fun while they are learning. And because they are more engaged than they would be in a more traditional classroom, they leave with better knowledge retention, greater interest in schools, and, perhaps most importantly, critical thinking skills. But the spirit of da Vinci told us that we can't limit learning to just our faculties. So as our state's leaders emphasized teaching computer science, we wanted to expand our efforts. And we saw that there weren't enough qualified teachers to teach the courses. Around the same time, representatives from Boeing reached out to us. The company has a long history in our state dating back to 1927, and today the company has nearly 1,000 employees based here. Since the company's founding in 1916, Boeing has made giving back to the communities it calls home a core part of its mission. And around the same time we were looking for more ways to help Utah's students, Boeing took notice of the impact we were having. They reached out, wanting to invest in our efforts and help us grow. Soon after, Boeing provided the funding to help us create a Teacher Professional Development program focused on helping teachers gain the skills and resources to support Applied Computer Science classes. Since Boeing's initial investment, we have served over 200 teachers, and each of them went on to help inspire between 20 and 120 students a year. And that was the beginning of a great partnership between The Leonardo and Boeing. Today, Boeing is helping with our FLIGHT exhibit, providing not only a donation but, more importantly, the manpower to help oversee design and fabrication. For example, they connected us with Curiosity Machine, a group that creates hands-on engineering design challenges and provided activities to bolster our FLIGHT exhibit. To some, this partnership might seem odd, after all, we are a young organization, still testing what works and learning from our mistakes. Boeing on the other hand is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. Our partnership with Boeing has shown us that their leaders understand the right mix of start-up enthusiasm and the tried-and-true experience that are both needed to build something to last. In many ways, they are a lot like us at The Leonardo. Five years into this adventure, we continue to be inspired by the spirit of da Vinci, as we lean on the experience of our partners to guide us. Together, we will ensure the students of today learn the skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow.

These two significant agreements result from several years of collaboration by international experts from ICAO member states, the aviation industry and non-governmental organizations. “The market-based carbon-offset system and CO2 standard are integral to the four-pillar approach the industry is taking to stop the growth of emissions by 2020 and cut them in half by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. These efforts also include: investing in new, more efficient aircraft; improving operational performance of the in-service fleet; improving the efficiency of air traffic management and other infrastructure; and scaling up the use of sustainable alternative fuels. “We continually innovate to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of our products and services. The 787 Dreamliner family reduces fuel use and CO2 emissions by 20 to 25 percent compared to airplanes it replaces. The 737 MAX, with first delivery expected in 2017, will reduce fuel use and emissions by 20 percent compared to the original Next-Generation 737.” PR Newswire http://www.prnewswire.com More about PR Newswire PR Newswire is the leading global provider of marketing and communications solutions that let you optimize and distribute multimedia content to actively engage all key audiences, across all traditional, digital, social and mobile channels, anywhere in the world.

Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenberg means to ride his dark horse straight to Mars, beating NASA, Elon Musk, and everybody else to the Red Planet. Bloomberg reports that Muilenberg, speaking at the Atlantic’s “What’s Next” conference in Chicago, said he’s “convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket.” But Jeff Bezos doesn’t mean to be outdone. Blue Origin ran a successful test of its New Shepard crew escape pod this week, and did better than anyone expected. “Today, we’re likely going to lose the New Shepard booster,” Ariane Cornell had said on the Blue Origin webcast a bit before liftoff. “Today’s [Wednesday’s] mission is totally focused on a successful crew capsule escape with the understanding that the booster will likely be lost.” But they managed to land the booster upright with a powered descent to a pad, with nothing more than a list to the side and a little bit of singeing at the edges. Sabotage of the rocket is unlikely, but this article has some great theories :)https://t.co/1fCRbZvRHo — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) October 5, 2016 While it might be tempting to speculate on the motives that frenemies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin or ULA might have to sabotage SpaceX, not even SpaceX thinks someone sniped their rocket. Company president Gwynne Shotwell addressed the 2016 Asia-Pacific Satellite Communications Council in Kuala Lumpur this week about what SpaceX has been up to lately, SpaceNews.com reports. While reassuring everyone that SpaceX has it together with regards to their ongoing operations, Shotwell dropped a few choice sound bites about the original September 1 kaboom. Shotwell appears to be pretty confident about its source. SpaceNews quotes her as commenting that “We believe that the composite over wrapped pressure vessel [the helium bottle], known as a COPv, let go in the tank.” She explained that the whole rocket is bristling with accelerometers, which let investigators find out exactly where in the rocket the disturbance began. That’s how they know it wasn’t a bullet. It probably wasn’t a design flaw with the bottle, either, and it also probably wasn’t ground systems responsible for the failure of the pressure vessel. Shotwell is pretty sure “operations” was the source, but didn’t get less vague than that. “Let go,” though, suggests a blowout. CNG tank delamination. Hammer for scale. Found on CleanMPG For reference, the above is what happens when a composite overwrapped pressure vessel “lets go.” It’s called delamination. It’s really fun to look at, and really bad for whatever used to be laminated. The image above is from a CNG-fueled car that exploded. Imagine the violence of the decompression event that could blow a composite-wrapped pressure vessel into a shaggy, fuzzy pile of fibers. Now picture something like that happening to a composite-wrapped helium bottle inside the tank of liquid oxygen, perhaps because of a thermal differential between tanks. It would certainly explain the quieter bang a few moments before the massive fireball in the SpaceX incident. Pressed to address the idea that a “nefarious actor” had tried to take out the rocket, Shotwell remarked that while you can’t ignore anything during such an investigation, no matter how unlikely it might be, “The more-than-likely — the overwhelmingly likely — explanation is that we did something to that rocket. And we’re going to find it and we’re going to fix it.” Tagged In nasa mars spacex elon musk Boeing Jeff Bezos blue origin United Launch Alliance Post a Comment Comment ExtremeTech Newsletter Subscribe Today to get the latest ExtremeTech news delivered right to your inbox.

By: Associated Press | Washington | Published: October 8, 2016 12:34 AM Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion.(Reuters) Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion. Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country’s history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. Al-Baker acknowledged the decision to go with Boeing also was due to “ongoing issues” with Boeing rival Airbus. Al-Baker in April publicly blasted Airbus over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. In June, Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the planes. “Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else,” Al-Baker told a news conference in Washington attended by government officials from the US and Qatar. “They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this.” The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. “Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes,” said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a time-frame for deliveries.   Please Wait while comments are loading...

The state-owned airline has agreed to buy 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its b-market 777-300 aircraft worth $11.7bn. At the same time it said it intends to order up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn. The bumper aircraft spree grows Qatar’s order backlog of Boeing airplanes from 65 to 105 and will more than double its current fleet, which consists of 84 Boeing aircraft, all delivered to Qatar’s flag carrier in the last nine years. Timelapse video shows super-fast construction of a BA 787-9 Dreamliner Play! 03:59 Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker claims that the airline’s expansion is one of the fastest in aviation history and the latest deal will power its continued growth. The airline’s rapid growth in recent years has included Qatar bolstering its stake in British Airways-owner International Airlines Group to more than a fifth of the FTSE 100 company earlier this year. Qatar said its interest in IAG as “purely financial”. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al Baker Credit: Fred Lancelot/AP Photo Late last month Qatar Airways strengthened its ties to British Airways owner with a pact to co-operate on scheduling and pricing of flights. Under the new deal the airlines will take part in 'code-sharing', so both airlines can sell tickets for the same flight, on all non-stop flights between the UK and Doha. The deal will also include connecting services to destinations in the UK, continental Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa.

Close share panel × Image copyright AFP US aircraft maker Boeing has announced a major deal to supply Qatar Airways with wide-body jetliners. The deal includes 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7bn (£9.4bn) at list prices, along with the option to buy 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn at list prices. It is the largest single order ever placed by the Gulf carrier. The deal gives Boeing a boost in a year when orders for widebody planes have slumped. Qatar has been frustrated over prolonged delivery problems from Boeing's European rival aircraft maker, Airbus. Media reports last week suggested the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7bn. Airplane makers typically give large discounts on the list price when carriers order in bulk. Analysis: Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The continuing fight between Qatar Airways and Airbus has turned nasty - with Boeing emerging as the big winner. The chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker, is a forthright individual. He has previously described his airline's relationship with Airbus as "strained" because of delivery delays and engine problems with the Airbus A320neos. Now Akbar Al Baker is sending Airbus a message, with a big order for its American rival. The mega deal is not just a financial winner for Boeing. It's also a huge boost for the US plane maker's single aisle 737 MAX aircraft. It is the US aerospace giant's newest plane and doesn't go into service until next year. And politics may also be at play. There was a suggestion that the Qatar government may have delayed the Boeing passenger jet order to put pressure on the US to approve a deal for Boeing fighter jets to the Middle Eastern country - a deal which the Americans now look set to approve.

Home Industry Companies Qatar Airways orders 100 Boeing planes for up to $18.6 billion Qatar Airways orders 100 Boeing planes for up to $18.6 billion Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. By: AFP | Washington | Published: October 7, 2016 11:22 PM Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country’s history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. (Reuters) Qatar Airways has agreed to purchase as many as 100 Boeing airplanes for up to USD 18.6 billion, the companies jointly announced today. Qatar will buy 30 of the new-generation Boeing 787 and 10 Boeing 777, both widebody aircraft, for USD 11.7 billion. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 of the narrow-body Boeing 737 valued at about USD 6.9 billion. Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker said that the order was one of the largest in the country’s history and would help meet growing demand for air travel. Al-Baker acknowledged the decision to go with Boeing also was due to “ongoing issues” with Boeing rival Airbus. Al-Baker in April publicly blasted Airbus over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. In June, Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the planes. “Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else,” Al-Baker told a news conference in Washington attended by government officials from the US and Qatar. “They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this.” The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. “Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes,” said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a time-frame for deliveries. Please Wait while comments are loading...

(AP Photo/Kamran Jebreili, File) NEW YORK •  Gulf carrier Qatar Airways ordered $18.6 billion worth of Boeing Co. jetliners, a deal that includes firm orders for 40 widebody aircraft and a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrowbody 737 MAX 8 jets, Boeing and the airline said on Friday. The order for up to 100 jetliners helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal includes 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners, 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft plus the 737 MAX 8 options. It is significantly larger than a deal for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by the Qatari government in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The firm orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX options are exercised. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. The Qatari order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the U.S. at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer.

Compare pay of top St. Louis executives The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp. and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.   Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Under the agreement, Qatar will buy 30 new-generation Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777s, both widebody aircraft, for $11.7 billion, the companies announced. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrow-body Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal is worth as much as $18.6 billion all together. The order for the 737s follows unusual public criticism of Airbus earlier this year by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. The order would help meet growing demand for air travel, Al-Baker said Friday. But the decision to go with Boeing was also prompted by "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus, Al-Baker acknowledged, appearing with Boeing executives and US and Qatar government officials at a news conference in Washington. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," he said. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." Al-Baker later emphasized that his company would continue to work with Airbus and take delivery of the A320 planes when they are ready. We are not "pointing fingers or trying to embarrass Airbus," he told AFP. "We have close relations with Airbus and we are continuing to receive aircraft orders." "The decision for us to buy Boeing airplanes is to get them for certain missions which today Airbus aircraft are not able to do," he added. "We will maintain all of our commitments to Airbus." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The US company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

Under the agreement, Qatar will buy 30 new-generation Boeing 787s and 10 Boeing 777s, both widebody aircraft, for $11.7 billion, the companies announced. Qatar Airways also signed a letter of intent to purchase up to 60 narrow-body Boeing 737 aircraft. The deal is worth as much as $18.6 billion all together. The order for the 737s follows unusual public criticism of Airbus earlier this year by Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al-Baker over delays in deliveries of the single-aisle Airbus A320neo due to problems with its engine. The order would help meet growing demand for air travel, Al-Baker said Friday. But the decision to go with Boeing was also prompted by "ongoing issues" with Boeing rival Airbus, Al-Baker acknowledged, appearing with Boeing executives and US and Qatar government officials at a news conference in Washington. "Boeing has started building airplanes before everybody else," he said. "They make the best airplanes, even if their competitors will not like me saying this." Al-Baker later emphasized that his company would continue to work with Airbus and take delivery of the A320 planes when they are ready. We are not "pointing fingers or trying to embarrass Airbus," he told AFP. "We have close relations with Airbus and we are continuing to receive aircraft orders." "The decision for us to buy Boeing airplanes is to get them for certain missions which today Airbus aircraft are not able to do," he added. "We will maintain all of our commitments to Airbus." The contract for the 737 marks the first time Qatar Airways has ordered single-aisle planes from Boeing in more than 15 years, the companies said. Al-Baker threatened to cancel the Airbus order in April due to problems with the engine and other difficulties, resulting in an "unacceptable" delay in delivering six planes. "We always in Qatar Airways have a plan B," he said at the time. Qatar Airways cancelled an order for one of the Airbus planes in June. The Qatar contract gives Boeing a boost. The US company had net orders of 380 through the end of the third quarter, suggesting its full-year tally for 2016 will come in below last year's 868. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes," said Ray Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial airplane division. The companies did not release a timeframe for deliveries. Shares of Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.53 in afternoon trade.

airline's single-aisle fleet One of largest fleet announcements in Qatar Airways' history News provided by Boeing Oct 07, 2016, 11:39 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Oct. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Boeing [NYSE: BA] and Qatar Airways announced an order for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7 billion at list prices, validating the value, reliability and performance of Boeing's twin-aisle airplanes. The airline also signed a Letter of Intent for up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. Today's announcement builds on Qatar Airways' current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With this new order, Qatar Airways increases its firm order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. The announcement was attended by the State of Qatar's Minister of Finance, His Excellency Ali Shareef Al Emadi, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken and the Ambassador of Qatar, His Excellency Mohammed Jaham Al-Kuwari. "Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead," said Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive, His Excellency Mr. Akbar Al Baker. "Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today's announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service."  Qatar Airways' relationship with Boeing was renewed in 2006. Since then, there have been many milestones in the partnership. The airline was the first to operate the 787 in the Middle East and is a launch customer for the 777X. With the commitment for the 737 MAX 8, it would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways' fleet in more than 15 years. "Congratulations to The Boeing Company and Qatar Airways on the remarkable milestone they've reached, which will significantly grow the number of Boeing aircraft in the Qatar Airways fleet," said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. "Beyond its importance for these two companies, this agreement demonstrates the importance of global commercial partnerships in strengthening our bilateral ties. This deal will strengthen economic opportunity and job creation, and highlights the importance of strong global trading relationships." "We are so very proud that a discerning and market-leading customer like Qatar Airways not only continues to endorse our current products, but  also has confidence in Boeing's new technology that will soon be evident on the 777X and 737 MAX," said  Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. "Our partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes." The 777-300ER is the most reliable twin-aisle airplane flying today and is considered to be the flagship of the world's elite airlines. It has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent – the airplane is on time, nearly all the time. The 787-9 Dreamliner is the second member of the super-efficient, passenger-pleasing 787 family. The 787-9, a stretch of the 787-8, can fly 290 passengers 7,635 nautical miles (14,140 km) in addition to more cargo, allowing airlines the ability to grow routes first opened by the 787-8. Boeing's newest family of single-aisle airplanes – 737 MAX 7, 737 MAX 8, 737 MAX 9 and 737 MAX 200 – builds on the Next-Generation 737's popularity and reliability while delivering customers unsurpassed fuel efficiency in the single-aisle market, with deliveries scheduled to begin in 2017.

REUTERS/Fabrizio BenschMore By Alwyn Scott and Mike Stone NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Gulf carrier Qatar Airways ordered 40 Boeing Co <BA.N> widebody jets valued at $11.7 billion and signed a letter of intent for up to 60 narrowbody 737 MAX 8 jets worth $6.9 billion, Boeing and the airline said on Friday. The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus <AIR.PA>. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp <FDX.N> and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

Uresh Sheth, an investment banker who tracks Dreamliner production on his All Things 787 website, said the Airbus planes in Qatar’s fleet have had performance and reliability issues . “I have to wonder if Qatar’s order for the remaining A350s is in jeopardy given the large order with Boeing,” Sheth said. The 787-9 and 777-300ER orders are among the airline’s largest fleet announcements and are valued at $11.7 billion at list prices, although airlines typically negotiate discounts. In addition to those orders, Qatar Airways signed a letter of intent to buy up to 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices. It would be the first Boeing single-aisle airplane model to join Qatar Airways’ fleet in more than 15 years. “By far the biggest impact of this new order is the commitment for 60 Boeing 737 MAX 8s,” Ahmad said. “This is a direct rival to the (Airbus) A320neo, the same jet which the airline has thus far refused to take delivery of due to concerns about the GTF engines,” which have had performance problems in hot weather. “This is a massive, massive disaster for Airbus no matter which way you cut it,” Ahmad said. Friday’s announcement builds on Qatar Airways’ current fleet of 84 Boeing aircraft, a combination of 787s and 777s, all delivered over the last nine years. With the new order, the carrier increases its order backlog of Boeing widebody airplanes from 65 to 105, including 60 777Xs. “Qatar Airways, already one of the fastest growing airlines in the history of aviation, today announces a significant and historic aircraft order that will power our future growth for the years and the decades ahead,” Akbar Al Baker, Qatar Airways’ CEO, said in a statement. “Boeing has proven to be a valuable partner, and today’s announcement is testament to our appreciation of the quality of their product and their dedication to providing world class customer service.” Boeing’s “partnership with Qatar Airways has grown and strengthened tremendously over the years and I look forward to the time when its fleet will feature an increasing number of both our single and twin-aisle airplanes,” Ray Conner, president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a statement. The 787-9 Dreamliner — which is built at Boeing’s North Charleston campus and in Everett, Wash. — is the second member of the 787 family. It is a stretch of the 787-8 and can fly 290 passengers a maximum 7,635 nautical miles. The 777-300ER has the highest schedule reliability of any twin-aisle airplane at 99.5 percent.

The WTO found that it was not. A corrected version of the story is below: The Obama administration on Thursday claimed a victory in its long-running trade dispute with the European Union over whether the 28-country bloc is illegally helping airplane manufacturer Airbus. In June 2011, the World Trade Organization found that the EU and four of its member countries provided billions of dollars in subsidized financing to Airbus. While the EU subsequently claimed to have come into compliance, the United States disagreed and requested that a compliance panel intervene. The WTO panel on Thursday ruled mostly in favour of the U.S. The international body, which helps solve trade disputes, found the EU had provided billions of dollars more in subsidies, causing lost sales worth tens of billions of dollars for Airbus’ archrival Boeing Co. Boeing praised the overall ruling, which the EU can appeal, saying the “day of reckoning” has finally arrived. It went so far to say that Airbus might not even exist today if not for continued support of European governments. “Today’s historic ruling finally holds the EU and Airbus to account for their flouting of global trade rules,” Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. “This long-awaited decision is a victory for fair trade worldwide and for U.S. aerospace workers, in particular.” United States Trade Representative Michael Froman says the finding is “a sweeping victory for the United States and its aerospace workers.” He called on the EU, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Spain to “respect the WTO rules” and “end subsidized financing of Airbus immediately. This decision is independent of the EU’s case against the United States, in which the WTO is considering whether Boeing received banned federal and state support in the U.S. “Watch this space,” Airbus said in a statement in reaction to Thursday’s ruling. “Before year-end the record subsidies for the 777X will almost certainly be condemned as illegal,” it said, referring to a new Boeing airliner. The Boeing Company is the only American producer of large civil aircraft and is the largest single U.S. exporter. Boeing has major facilities around the country, including in Washington and South Carolina. Members of the Washington congressional delegation joined the administration in hailing the ruling, which has the potential to result in tariffs that would likely cost Airbus market share. Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called on the EU to come to the negotiating table and settle, rather than wait for future tariffs on Airbus planes. “Without having to compete against illegal, market-distorting practices, Boeing should win more sales around the world,” Cantwell said. ___ Scott Mayerowitz in New York, Jamey Keaten in Geneva and Angela Charlton in Paris contributed to this report. shares Share: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Google+ Share Email Advertisement Advertisement    Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Politics Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top White House aides and says deportations will begin immediately BUSINESS To keep drones out of high-risk areas, companies try hijacking them and shooting them down Aerospace Corp.

During a counterdrone test, Randy Villahermosa, left, and Esteban Valles show how Aerospace Corp. uses its sophisticated technology to locate a drone controller. (The Aerospace Corporation) Samantha Masunaga A public awareness campaign last year did little to deter the growing number of rogue drones flying near wildfires and forcing firefighters to ground their own aircraft. So this year, the Department of the Interior tried something a little more direct. The agency gave real-time access to data on all active wildfires to two airspace mapping companies as part of a pilot program. One of those firms, Santa Monica-based AirMap, worked with drone manufacturer DJI, which created “geofences” around wildfires. When drones hit the virtual boundary, the geofencing software overrides the flight controller and forces them to hover in place. Any drone deployed inside the barrier won’t be able to lift off. “We really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them,” said Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior. As private drone use has soared, so has concern about keeping the remote-controlled aircraft away from sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, nuclear power plants and prisons. Those concerns are heightened by high-profile incidents such as the near collision in March of a drone and a Lufthansa jet approaching Los Angeles International Airport. In 2013 a drone crash landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a campaign event, and a quadcopter crashed on the White House lawn in 2015. Defense giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., as well as a handful of start-ups, have jumped into the fray, developing technology ranging from detection systems to more disruptive solutions such as software that forces unauthorized drones to go home or land safely and laser cannons that shoot unwanted drones out of the sky. The technology is of interest to commercial users as well as the government. The Department of Defense hosts an annual counterdrone demonstration called Black Dart in which the military, its allies and industry partners can assess current technology and techniques. Earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Administration tested FBI drone-detection technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey for a few weeks. Last year, Boeing unveiled its compact laser weapons system, which ignites targeted drones. At a demonstration in California, Boeing said it took only about 15 seconds for its 2-kilowatt laser to disable the drone. Though the counterdrone industry is still nascent, the global market — including both civilian and military uses — could be worth at least several hundreds of millions of dollars, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan. “With all the talk of how many drones are going to be flying around and, at least on the commercial side, how much privacy is going to be an issue, I think these companies saw an opportunity,” he said. Much will depend on how well the technology works. It’s not easy to devise a system that tracks and identifies tiny drones, and stops unauthorized ones without knocking out everything — or creating a safety hazard. “This rapid proliferation of start-ups, of large companies all proposing systems that deal with the issue in different ways, suggests to me that there isn’t one single unifying solution for how to bring drones out of the sky,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “Every single step of the process is challenging.” That starts with identifying whether drones are friendly or rogue. Autonomous drone-detection systems need to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between slow-moving drones and birds, or even the signals emitted from drones compared with those emitted by cellphones. Detection systems will likely need to integrate a number of sensors such as acoustics, cameras, radio frequency or even radar to create “multilayer capability,” Blades said. Other companies and organizations are looking into the interdiction, or disruptive, aspect of how to safely deal with a drone threat once it is identified. At Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, researchers are investigating how to isolate the link between a specific drone and its controller that could lead to a safe takeover — rather than blindly “jamming,” or interrupting, all of the authorized frequencies in that range to cause confusion and force a potentially unpredictable landing. It is illegal for nongovernment entities to operate these kinds of jammers. That sounds easier than it is. Drones change their frequency band tens of times a second to ensure an uninterrupted communications link, said Randy Villahermosa, principal director of research and program development at Aerospace Corp. But by using software-defined radios and integrating the team’s coding knowledge, the researchers have been able to successfully take over a drone’s controls in several tests, said Esteban Valles, associate director of digital communication in the implementation department at Aerospace Corp. The researchers have also worked on pinpointing the position of a rogue drone’s controller, allowing law enforcement to find the pilot. There have been more than 300 so-called drone incidents in California between April 2014 and Jan. 31, 2016, according to an analysis of FAA data by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office. More than half of these incidents involved a drone that flew within five miles of an airport. In one case from early January, a Cessna agricultural aircraft reported that it possibly hit a drone about 1,400 feet in the air near Modesto, according to the analysis. No damage was reported to the aircraft. Aerospace Corp. does not sell its products commercially but is trying to better understand how drone communications work so it can advise customers on their own technology solutions, Villahermosa said. Drone maker DJI introduced its GPS-based geofence system about three years ago. It prevents “inadvertent” drone operations in sensitive areas, such as airports or in Washington, D.C. Since drones rely on their GPS receivers to determine where they are, DJI preprograms certain locations into the geofencing system. If a drone gets close to one of these locations, operators first receive a warning, said Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI. If they continue to fly their drone, they will be stopped by the geofence. The distance around these sensitive locations can vary. A more recent version includes locations with a temporary flight restriction, such as sporting events. DJI, which analysts estimate sells up to 70% of all consumer and professional drones, has included the option of overriding the geofence for wildfires, allowing a “verified” user to input credit card information or a mobile phone number to give firefighting or other authorized personnel the ability to keep using drones for legitimate efforts. “It’s really a balance between safety and innovation,” Schulman said. “We don’t want to just shut down the technology in places it can be useful.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Watch: Interview with combatants outside of Mosul Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske interviews ISIS fighter and speaks with Iraqi military on the east side of Mosul.

The agreement for up to 100 jetliners potentially worth $18.6 billion helps fill out Boeing's order book in a year when sales have slowed sharply, and amid tough price competition with European rival Airbus. The deal marked a key commitment by Qatar Airways to Boeing's new 737 MAX jetliner, after it refused to accept three of Airbus' competing A320 aircraft earlier this year. Qatar has not ordered 737s previously. Airline Chief Executive Officer Akbar Al Baker took the opportunity of the announcement in Washington to further press Boeing to build a new jet slightly larger than the 737 to fill a gap in Boeing's product line. Asked in an interview when he expected to hear more about that proposed plane, Al Baker said: "Yesterday!" Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, in the same interview, said Boeing continues to evaluate such a plane and talk with customers. "I think we have a pretty good idea today as to what our customers would like to see with respect to seat count, range capabilities," Conner said, adding that Boeing understands how quickly customers want the plane. "Now it's a matter of us going back and doing our homework and figuring out how do we put all of that together," he said. "I can't give you a real time frame on that, but we're certainly working the heck out of it right now." BIG ORDER The deal for 30 of Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 of its 777-300ER aircraft is significantly larger than an order for five Boeing 777-300ER aircraft worth $1.7 billion that the carrier had been expected to place during Britain's Farnborough Airshow in July. That announcement was postponed by Qatar in an effort to speed up U.S. approval of its purchase of Boeing fighter jets, sources familiar with the situation said. The orders announced on Friday are worth $11.7 billion at list prices, with an additional list value of $6.9 billion if all of the 737 MAX jets are purchased. Airlines typically receive steep discounts on large orders. Boeing shares were down 0.7 percent at $133.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Qatar Airways' order is likely to further intensify concern among U.S. airlines about what they term unfair subsidies that Gulf carriers receive. Earlier on Friday, Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian said Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates airline had received $50 billion in illegal subsidies, financing that allows the carriers to offer some 30 flights a day to the United States at fares substantially below what U.S. airlines can offer. The United Arab Emirates and Qatar together have a population the size of the U.S. state of Ohio, but "they have more widebodies on order than all the Chinese airlines and U.S. airlines combined," Bastian said at an event in New York. "That doesn't sound fair, that doesn't sound free," he said. The three Gulf carriers deny receiving subsidies, and other powerful U.S. businesses, including FedEx Corp and Boeing, oppose changes to Open Skies agreements with Gulf nations.

Space Exploration Technologies Corporation or better known as ‘SpaceX’, founded by Elon Musk seems to have an archrival who is bolstering claims to beat SpaceX in the big race to Mars. CEO of Boeing – the aforementioned archrival to SpaceX – Dennis Muilenburg casually remarked at ‘The Atlantic’s, What’s Next?’ conference, "I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket." What really reinforces the assertions made by Boeing is the fact that they already have rapport. For the sake of the argument, having built the boisterous ‘Saturn V rocket’, which was used to transport Apollo equipment and facilitate astronauts on their journeys to and fro from the moon; also the fact that Boeing also built the infamous Space Launch System (SLS) - which is said to be sending 20 metric tons to Mars in 2018 - surely is enough to prove Boeing’s mettle as far as probability for success is concerned. In the meantime, SpaceX has plans to debut its most potent rocket ‘Falcon Heavy’ early in 2017, despite the ensuing controversy surrounding their re-landing failures and recent launch pad explosion. Au contraire the ‘Falcon Heavy’ is said to be able to life about 13 metric tons of weight to Mars.

Like so many other things, the space race has moved into the private sector. Late last month, Elon Musk unveiled his plan to take humankind off this rock and colonize another one, with his sights set firmly on Mars. He intends to ferry up to one million people using something called the Interplanetary Transport System - essentially a ship capable of carrying up to 100 humans equipped with the largest rocket the world has ever seen. No electric powertrain here, then. Musk's vision expands over the next 50 to 100 years, which is something new for him. When talking about Tesla and the automotive industry, he says any strategy longer than five years feels like an eternity to him, but it would make sense for things to move slower in the world of interplanetary travel. However, Musk and his SpaceX won't be alone in their attempt to deliver the first human on Mars. Lockheed Martin and Boeing are also vying for a slice of the space travel pie, and they can't just sit back and watch Musk make bold claims about the future of SpaceX without some comments of their own. The first voice to respond was that of Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg who, without expanding the subject any further, told an audience gathered in Chicago for an innovation conference that he was convinced "the first person to step foot on Mars would arrive there riding a Boeing rocket.” (via Teslarati) Boeing and SpaceX are two very different companies, so the former's CEO doesn't really have the liberty to get into more detail. But while Musk's plans were farfetched and ambiguous, at least they were something. Boeing is making this claim without anything to back it up except the company's expertise and renown in the industry. Progress is best stimulated by competition, so the more companies get involved in the space race, the quicker we will begin to see results. At the moment, though, SpaceX is busy dealing with the aftermath of the Cape Canaveral explosion, while Boeing is focusing on other projects as well such as the hypersonic aircraft that should bring back passenger flights at speeds greater than that of sound. spacex Boeing space race rocket Mars Elon Musk   Why Apple and McLaren Should Probably Not Hook Up Speeding Fines In the U.S. - The Worst Places To Go Over The Limit In America The Biggest Anticipations in Motorcycling for 2016, Part 1 On Electric Harleys and New Generations The Dos and Don’ts of Washing a Motorcycle, Part One Triple Turbo And Quad Turbo Engines - The Only Cars That Feature Them What if Jaguar and Land Rover Weren't British Anymore?

During a counterdrone test, Randy Villahermosa, left, and Esteban Valles show how Aerospace Corp. uses its sophisticated technology to locate a drone controller. (The Aerospace Corporation) Samantha Masunaga A public awareness campaign last year did little to deter the growing number of rogue drones flying near wildfires and forcing firefighters to ground their own aircraft. So this year, the Department of the Interior tried something a little more direct. The agency gave real-time access to data on all active wildfires to two airspace mapping companies as part of a pilot program. One of those firms, Santa Monica-based AirMap, worked with drone manufacturer DJI, which created “geofences” around wildfires. When drones hit the virtual boundary, the geofencing software overrides the flight controller and forces them to hover in place. Any drone deployed inside the barrier won’t be able to lift off. “We really want to have this new community of pilots be as responsible as the manned aircraft pilots that came before them,” said Mark Bathrick, director of the office of aviation services at the Department of the Interior. As private drone use has soared, so has concern about keeping the remote-controlled aircraft away from sensitive and high-risk areas such as airports, nuclear power plants and prisons. Those concerns are heightened by high-profile incidents such as the near collision in March of a drone and a Lufthansa jet approaching Los Angeles International Airport. In 2013 a drone crash landed in front of German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a campaign event, and a quadcopter crashed on the White House lawn in 2015. Defense giants Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp., as well as a handful of start-ups, have jumped into the fray, developing technology ranging from detection systems to more disruptive solutions such as software that forces unauthorized drones to go home or land safely and laser cannons that shoot unwanted drones out of the sky. The technology is of interest to commercial users as well as the government. The Department of Defense hosts an annual counterdrone demonstration called Black Dart in which the military, its allies and industry partners can assess current technology and techniques. Earlier this year, the Federal Aviation Administration tested FBI drone-detection technology at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey for a few weeks. Last year, Boeing unveiled its compact laser weapons system, which ignites targeted drones. At a demonstration in California, Boeing said it took only about 15 seconds for its 2-kilowatt laser to disable the drone. Though the counterdrone industry is still nascent, the global market — including both civilian and military uses — could be worth at least several hundreds of millions of dollars, said Michael Blades, senior industry analyst for aerospace and defense at research and consulting firm Frost & Sullivan. “With all the talk of how many drones are going to be flying around and, at least on the commercial side, how much privacy is going to be an issue, I think these companies saw an opportunity,” he said. Much will depend on how well the technology works. It’s not easy to devise a system that tracks and identifies tiny drones, and stops unauthorized ones without knocking out everything — or creating a safety hazard. “This rapid proliferation of start-ups, of large companies all proposing systems that deal with the issue in different ways, suggests to me that there isn’t one single unifying solution for how to bring drones out of the sky,” said Arthur Holland Michel, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York. “Every single step of the process is challenging.” That starts with identifying whether drones are friendly or rogue. Autonomous drone-detection systems need to be sophisticated enough to distinguish between slow-moving drones and birds, or even the signals emitted from drones compared with those emitted by cellphones. Detection systems will likely need to integrate a number of sensors such as acoustics, cameras, radio frequency or even radar to create “multilayer capability,” Blades said. Other companies and organizations are looking into the interdiction, or disruptive, aspect of how to safely deal with a drone threat once it is identified. At Aerospace Corp. in El Segundo, researchers are investigating how to isolate the link between a specific drone and its controller that could lead to a safe takeover — rather than blindly “jamming,” or interrupting, all of the authorized frequencies in that range to cause confusion and force a potentially unpredictable landing. It is illegal for nongovernment entities to operate these kinds of jammers. That sounds easier than it is. Drones change their frequency band tens of times a second to ensure an uninterrupted communications link, said Randy Villahermosa, principal director of research and program development at Aerospace Corp. But by using software-defined radios and integrating the team’s coding knowledge, the researchers have been able to successfully take over a drone’s controls in several tests, said Esteban Valles, associate director of digital communication in the implementation department at Aerospace Corp. The researchers have also worked on pinpointing the position of a rogue drone’s controller, allowing law enforcement to find the pilot. There have been more than 300 so-called drone incidents in California between April 2014 and Jan. 31, 2016, according to an analysis of FAA data by U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s office. More than half of these incidents involved a drone that flew within five miles of an airport. In one case from early January, a Cessna agricultural aircraft reported that it possibly hit a drone about 1,400 feet in the air near Modesto, according to the analysis. No damage was reported to the aircraft. Aerospace Corp. does not sell its products commercially but is trying to better understand how drone communications work so it can advise customers on their own technology solutions, Villahermosa said. Drone maker DJI introduced its GPS-based geofence system about three years ago. It prevents “inadvertent” drone operations in sensitive areas, such as airports or in Washington, D.C. Since drones rely on their GPS receivers to determine where they are, DJI preprograms certain locations into the geofencing system. If a drone gets close to one of these locations, operators first receive a warning, said Brendan Schulman, vice president of policy and legal affairs at DJI. If they continue to fly their drone, they will be stopped by the geofence. The distance around these sensitive locations can vary. A more recent version includes locations with a temporary flight restriction, such as sporting events. DJI, which analysts estimate sells up to 70% of all consumer and professional drones, has included the option of overriding the geofence for wildfires, allowing a “verified” user to input credit card information or a mobile phone number to give firefighting or other authorized personnel the ability to keep using drones for legitimate efforts. “It’s really a balance between safety and innovation,” Schulman said. “We don’t want to just shut down the technology in places it can be useful.” Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption Weekend Roundup: 7 stories you can't miss Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Donald Trump wins the presidency, we show you how your neighbors voted, thousands protest in Los Angeles, Kamala Harris is heading to Washington, FBI director James Comey has a rocky future, California's passed some major bills, and Robert Durst appears in a Los Angeles court on murder charges     Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  President Obama and Donald Trump have their first meeting, what Donald Trump can and can't do with his presidential powers, George Takei donate 70 years of memorabilia to the Japanese American National Museum, and what scientists learned by tickling rats.  Caption President Obama and Donald Trump in the Oval Office President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House President Obama and Donald Trump discuss their visit at the White House Caption Watch: Interview with combatants outside of Mosul Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske interviews ISIS fighter and speaks with Iraqi military on the east side of Mosul.

However, Musk is probably OK with that. Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing (one of SpaceX’s biggest competitors) casually loosed the remark during a session of The Atlantic’s “What’s Next?” conference. “I’m convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said during the recorded event. Boeing has good ground to stand on with its claim, not the least of which includes some moon dust. After all, it was the company that helped build the ultra-powerful Saturn V rocket, which blasted Apollo-era equipment and astronauts to the moon and back. NASA also contracted Boeing to build its similarly huge Space Launch System (SLS), which should eventually be capable of sending up to 20 metric tonnes — roughly five large, fully grown elephants’ worth of mass — to Mars after its scheduled debut in 2018. Meanwhile, SpaceX plans to debut its most powerful rocket yet, the Falcon Heavy, in early 2017, despite a recent launchpad explosion and ongoing investigation. That rocket should be able to lift about 13 metric tonnes to Mars. If the sweeping vision that Musk laid out last week during a keynote speech at the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, is to be believed, SpaceX could start sending uncrewed Dragon capsules to Mars as soon as 2018 and 2020, then later land the first people on the red planet in 2022. But Musk may not mind if Boeing uses SLS to beat SpaceX. “I really don’t have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets, except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary,” Musk said during his talk. Further, when someone in the IAC conference’s audience asked the billionaire if would be the first person on Mars, Musk expressed some ambivalence. “I think it’s good for there to be multiple paths to Mars ... to have multiple irons in the fire,” he said. Musk went on: “I think it’s actually much better for the world if there are multiple companies or organisations building these interplanetary spacecraft. You know, the more the better. Anything, I think, that improves the probability of the future is good. And so multiple companies doing it, I think, would be great. So I wanted to come describe the architecture actually in the hopes that this would encourage companies and organisations around the world to perhaps do something like this.” Whether or not Boeing, SpaceX, or both companies reach Mars, however, NASA is perhaps best-poised to benefit. With multiple potential options to get to the red planet, the agency may be able to more rapidly advance the world’s understanding of that world. In a statement responding to news about Musk’s vision, the space agency wrote: “NASA applauds all those who want to take the next giant leap – and advance the journey to Mars. We are very pleased that the global community is working to meet the challenges of a sustainable human presence on Mars. This journey will require the best and the brightest minds from government and industry, and the fact that Mars is a major topic of discussion is very encouraging. “At NASA, we’ve worked hard over the past several years to develop a sustainable Mars exploration plan, and to build a coalition of international and private sector partners to support this vision. And we’ve made extraordinary progress implementing this plan, working with a number of international and private sector partners.” See Also: Idea that SpaceX's rocket was sabotaged is 'pretty much a joke,' says rival SpaceX and its biggest competitors are waging a space battle on Capitol Hill House Republicans don't want SpaceX investigating its own rocket failures Click here to visit Business Insider   Most Popular Viewed 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 2 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 5 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence Commented 1 Five places hikers can get away from it all on Hong Kong Island’s wild side 2 Michelin releases new list of Hong Kong and Macau restaurants offering HK$300 meals 3 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 4 How San Francisco got its Chinese produce 5 Genetic damage from smoking measured for the first time Promotions Register your FREE copy of Home Essentials 2017 now!

Close share panel × Image copyright AFP US aircraft maker Boeing has announced a major deal to supply Qatar Airways with wide-body jetliners. The deal includes 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs, valued at $11.7bn (£9.4bn) at list prices, along with the option to buy 60 737 MAX 8s, valued at $6.9bn at list prices. It is the largest single order ever placed by the Gulf carrier. The deal gives Boeing a boost in a year when orders for widebody planes have slumped. Qatar has been frustrated over prolonged delivery problems from Boeing's European rival aircraft maker, Airbus. Media reports last week suggested the deal was for at least 30 Boeing 777 and 787 jets, valued at about $6.7bn. Airplane makers typically give large discounts on the list price when carriers order in bulk. Analysis: Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The continuing fight between Qatar Airways and Airbus has turned nasty - with Boeing emerging as the big winner. The chief executive of the Gulf carrier, Akbar Al Baker, is a forthright individual. He has previously described his airline's relationship with Airbus as "strained" because of delivery delays and engine problems with the Airbus A320neos. Now Akbar Al Baker is sending Airbus a message, with a big order for its American rival. The mega deal is not just a financial winner for Boeing. It's also a huge boost for the US plane maker's single aisle 737 MAX aircraft. It is the US aerospace giant's newest plane and doesn't go into service until next year. And politics may also be at play. There was a suggestion that the Qatar government may have delayed the Boeing passenger jet order to put pressure on the US to approve a deal for Boeing fighter jets to the Middle Eastern country - a deal which the Americans now look set to approve.

Godbee Download Image Image details page Businesses, academic institutions, and government agencies, including DoD and its Manufacturing USA institutes, will host events nationwide promoting manufacturing and educating the public about the unique technologies used in modern manufacturing. Lead by the Department of Commerce and supported nationally by government agencies, industry, academia, and nonprofit partners, Manufacturing Day celebrates modern manufacturing and provides opportunities, through hands-on events, to inspire the next generation of manufacturers. DoD Seeks Technological Growth DoD is actively working toward creating an environment for technological growth through its targeted investments in the defense industrial base. DoD’s leadership realizes the significance of this mission, with Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Frank Kendall writing in the most recent issue of AT&L Magazine, “Manufacturing technology doesn’t just affect weapons systems and technological superiority -- it also drives national economic performance.” The DoD leads the way in setting up the Manufacturing USA institutes -- each institute a public-private partnership bringing together industry, academia and federal partners within a growing network to increase U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and promote a robust and sustainable national manufacturing research and development infrastructure. Within the department’s Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy  serves as the DoD’s lead in establishing and administering the Manufacturing USA institutes. The DoD-led institutes focus on a wide range of manufacturing technology areas, from additive manufacturing to advanced textiles. The DoD Manufacturing USA institutes include: -- America Makes: Youngstown, Ohio. -- DMDII: Chicago. -- LIFT: Detriot. -- AIM Photonics: Albany, New York. -- NextFlex: San Jose, California. -- AFFOA: Boston. The DoD will stand up two more institutes -- one in advanced tissue bio fabrication, and the other focused on robotics in manufacturing environments -- by the end of the Obama Administration. The Department of Energy leads three institutes -- IACMI in Knoxville, Tennessee; PowerAmerica in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute, recently awarded and located in Los Angeles. Each institute within the network is hosting events -- or supporting partners or members with events -- for Manufacturing Day. ODASD MIBP leadership will attend events at DMDII, America Makes, and LIFT, which is hosting a joint event with IACMI. The department recognizes that each opportunity to inspire the next generation of manufacturing talent is an opportunity to increase the domestic workforce supporting the warfighter. As Defense Secretary Ash Carter proclaimed earlier this year, “The reality is that … we don’t know all the advances this new technology is going to make possible -- that’s the remarkable thing about innovation -- and it’s another reason why America, and America’s military, must get there first.” The Manufacturing USA institutes are reshaping the technological landscape through manufacturing, officials said, by facilitating innovation to support the warfighter, ensuring the U.S. military’s competitiveness, and proliferating new ideas for America’s industrial base. October 7 is one more opportunity for DoD to tell that story to the American people, officials added. In the Department of Defense, every day is Manufacturing Day.

"This historic agreement represents the world's first sector-based, global market mechanism to address climate change and is complementary to the first-ever CO2 standard for airplane emissions that ICAO adopted earlier this year. These two significant agreements result from several years of collaboration by international experts from ICAO member states, the aviation industry and non-governmental organizations. "The market-based carbon-offset system and CO2 standard are integral to the four-pillar approach the industry is taking to stop the growth of emissions by 2020 and cut them in half by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. These efforts also include: investing in new, more efficient aircraft; improving operational performance of the in-service fleet; improving the efficiency of air traffic management and other infrastructure; and scaling up the use of sustainable alternative fuels. "We continually innovate to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of our products and services. The 787 Dreamliner family reduces fuel use and CO2 emissions by 20 to 25 percent compared to airplanes it replaces. The 737 MAX, with first delivery expected in 2017, will reduce fuel use and emissions by 20 percent compared to the original Next-Generation 737."

News Boeing's Cash Flow Called Strong, But A320 Line Seen As Major Threat Orders for Boeing's 777 have been weak as customers prefer to wait for the next-generation 777X. (Boeing) GILLIAN RICH 10/06/2016 Reprints Boeing's (BA) cash flow and shareholder returns look solid, but 777 weakness and competition from Airbus' (EADSY) A320 line are major risks, said Baird analysts Thursday. Baird initiated coverage on Boeing with an outperform rating and 161 price target, citing a "robust backlog." Analyst Peter Arment said the aerospace giant will generate $23 billion in free cash flow from 2016 to 2018, with $15 billion available for buybacks after paying dividends. But Arment warned in the note that Boeing faces a risk from Airbus as the A320neo family has been outselling the 737 Max family and now has 59% of the market share. Boeing's 777 production bridge is also a risk, as there is still pressure on widebody orders, according to Arment. The company has been trying to maintain its 777 production rate to ensure a smooth transition to the next-generation 777X, but orders for the older model have been drying up as customers prefer to wait for the new one. Shares ended 0.2% lower at 134.42 in the stock market today. Boeing is consolidating in a flat base as its shares continue to climb about its 50-day line. IBD'S TAKE: Boeing only has a 44 Composite Rating and defense contractors like Raytheon and Northrop are outperforming the aerospace giant as commercial sales weigh on Boeing. Also Thursday, Boeing announced that third-quarter deliveries fell 5.5% year over year to 188 planes. Deliveries of its 737 fell to 120 from 126, 787 deliveries fell to 36 from 37 a year ago, and 777 deliveries were flat at 22. Airbus said Thursday that it delivered 62 planes in September, up 26.5% from a year ago, including 10 A321neos and 10 A321 current engine option aircraft to VietJet. The European aerospace giant also reported new orders and bookings for 49 planes last month. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus fell 1.1% to 15.16.

Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travellers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. “I’m convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket,” Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk’s SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as space flight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies Nasa selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travellers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. “The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It’s like building the Union Pacific railroad,” Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as $100,000. Boeing built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful US rocket ever built, which took men to the moon. Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home “blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market.” The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing microgravity manufacturing and research, he said. “I think it’s a fascinating area for us,” he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, travelling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly US travellers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed’s Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing’s X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. “That business model isn’t closed yet. At some point it will,” he said. “The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability.” More from Aviation Air Arabia third quarter net profit rises 26% Emirates Skywards adds WSJ to list of partners Jet Airways’ stand-alone Q2 net profit up 23.43% US airlines plan appeal to Trump for protection Emirates retires last Airbus A330, A340 Gulf giants score new lounges in Lufthansa home Airbus A320neo customers gird for delays Emirates airline half-year profit at Dh786m tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNNational Aeronautics and Space Administration follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessAviation tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNNational Aeronautics and Space Administration follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In AviationAir Arabia third quarter net profit rises 26% Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedGalleriesVideos 01Air Arabia third quarter net profit rises 26% 02Emirates Skywards adds WSJ to list of partners 03Emirates retires last Airbus A330, A340 04Jet Airways’ stand-alone Q2 net profit up 23.43% 05US airlines plan appeal to Trump for protection 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 17Images UAE Apple retail stores open to the public Oct 30, 2015 14Images Trump casino closes in Atlantic City Oct 11, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play DWC can accommodate US customs May 10, 2015 Play How to protect your device from hackers May 26, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Explore the UAE Find the right airport Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Meet the best street cleaners in UAE Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Passengers can now get UAE visa using app Revealed: Countries with great jobs Job worries bog down UAE consumers: survey Why Balan thought she'd never marry Aftershocks rattle New Zealand after big quake Self-cooling home unveiled Close Recommended For You American Apparel set to file second bankruptcyPUBLISHED ON Nov 14, 2016 Revealed: Countries with great jobsPUBLISHED ON Nov 14, 2016 Your guide to tonight’s SupermoonPUBLISHED ON Nov 13, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

In the first half of 2016, Boeing bought back $5.5 billion in stock, bringing the total to over 165 million shares since 2013 and representing a 16 percent reduction since 2012. Boeing is expected to raise its dividend in December and expand its share repurchase program, said the analyst.

 Boeing says it will beat SpaceX to Mars Dave Mosher Oct. 6, 2016, 1:04 PM 20,801 facebook linkedin twitter email print Shutterstock Less than a week after SpaceX founder Elon Musk detailed his vision to get people to Mars, a rival aerospace company has intimated that it plans to beat Musk (and everyone else) to the punch. However, Musk is probably OK with that. Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of Boeing (one of SpaceX's biggest competitors) casually loosed the remark during a session of The Atlantic's "What's Next?" conference. "I'm convinced that the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding on a Boeing rocket," Muilenburg said during the recorded event. Boeing has good ground to stand on with its claim, not the least of which includes some moon dust. After all, it was the company that helped build the ultra-powerful Saturn V rocket, which blasted Apollo-era equipment and astronauts to the moon and back. NASA also contracted Boeing to build its similarly huge Space Launch System (SLS), which should eventually be capable of sending up to 20 metric tons — roughly five large, fully grown elephants' worth of mass — to Mars after its scheduled debut in 2018. Meanwhile, SpaceX plans to debut its most powerful rocket yet, the Falcon Heavy, in early 2017, despite a recent launchpad explosion and ongoing investigation. That rocket should be able to lift about 13 metric tons to Mars. Illustrations of Boeing and NASA's Space Launch System (left) versus SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket (right). Boeing/NASA; SpaceX If the sweeping vision that Musk laid out last week during a keynote speech at the 67th International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Guadalajara, Mexico, is to be believed, SpaceX could start sending uncrewed Dragon capsules to Mars as soon as 2018 and 2020, then later land the first people on the red planet in 2022. But Musk may not mind if Boeing uses SLS to beat SpaceX. "I really don't have any other motivation for personally accumulating assets, except to be able to make the biggest contribution I can to making life multiplanetary," Musk said during his talk. Further, when someone in the IAC conference's audience asked the billionaire if would be the first person on Mars, Musk expressed some ambivalence. "I think it's good for there to be multiple paths to Mars ... to have multiple irons in the fire," he said. Musk went on: "I think it's actually much better for the world if there are multiple companies or organizations building these interplanetary spacecraft. You know, the more the better. Anything, I think, that improves the probability of the future is good. And so multiple companies doing it, I think, would be great. So I wanted to come describe the architecture actually in the hopes that this would encourage companies and organizations around the world to perhaps do something like this." Whether or not Boeing, SpaceX, or both companies reach Mars, however, NASA is perhaps best-poised to benefit. With multiple potential options to get to the red planet, the agency may be able to more rapidly advance the world's understanding of that world. In a statement responding to news about Musk's vision, the space agency wrote: "NASA applauds all those who want to take the next giant leap – and advance the journey to Mars. We are very pleased that the global community is working to meet the challenges of a sustainable human presence on Mars. This journey will require the best and the brightest minds from government and industry, and the fact that Mars is a major topic of discussion is very encouraging. "At NASA, we’ve worked hard over the past several years to develop a sustainable Mars exploration plan, and to build a coalition of international and private sector partners to support this vision. And we've made extraordinary progress implementing this plan, working with a number of international and private sector partners." We contacted Boeing representatives for further clarification on Muilenburg's remark, and Daniel Curran, a company spokesperson, only told Business Insider in an email that they're "going to let Dennis' comments this week speak for themselves."

Share via facebook dialog Share via Pinterest Stargaze your way through a long-haul flight. Airplane manufacturers are constantly innovating to minimize costs or outpace the competition and, if the diagrams and designs that pass through the U.S. Patent Office are any indication, no idea is too crazy. Filed aviation patents range from the revolutionary (a supersonic jet powered by rockets that will get you from San Francisco to Tokyo in three hours) to the straight-up sadistic (How do you fit more seats into a plane? Stack ‘em!). A patent from Boeing filed last month, however, doesn’t fall squarely into either camp, instead being more of the "That's neat!" variety. Boeing has designed a projection system that would allow it to project calming images—cloud-dotted blue skies during the day and a starry night once the sun sets—in the interior of the plane, on its walls and ceilings. The company wants to use creative projection lighting as a way to enhance the flier experience. A clear-day sky can make a cramped cabin feel a little bigger—but it could also, we imagine, create the illusion of flying in a convertible jet, which is a little unsettling for those afraid of flying to begin with. It can also lead to a better night's sleep, as projections could be used to simulate the time of day, so that you don't disembark groggy and exhausted. But if the concept becomes a reality, its use wouldn’t be limited to just setting the mood, or displaying psychedelic star patterns to lull you to sleep. “These ceiling projections could be scenes found in nature or helpful information for passengers projected on the walls and bulkheads,” said Mike Sinnett, a VP of product development at Boeing, last year when the idea was first announced. “Airlines could use these lighting enhancements on the walls and bulkheads to display information about the destination or to project scenes that get passengers thinking about where they’re going." Lighting has increasingly been used by manufacturers as a way to improve the air travel experience. It’s a wonder why it’s taken them so long to realize the fluorescent lights we are currently used to do not in any way achieve that. Most notably, the Airbus A350 includes a system of LED cabin lighting that can emit 16.7 million different shades of color to mimic the natural phases of the day and thus limit the effects of jet-lag. The wild world of aviation patents never fails to deliver, but it’s important to note that for the most part, it can take a long time until any of them are realized (we are still waiting for the SkyDeck, that totally insane viewing deck on top of the plane). Regardless, it’s encouraging to see the major aviation players channeling R&D resources into projects besides adding more seats into already cramped cabins.

The firm is under contract to produce mission-critical equipment and cockpit panel assemblies for its F-15 and F/A-18 fighter aircraft | TNN | Oct 6, 2016, 06.47 PM IST BENGALURU: Sasmos HET Technologies Limited delivered the first F/A-18 Super Hornet electrical panel assembly within six months from receipt of order to Boeing from its Bengaluru plant on Thursday. The firm is under contract with Boeing to produce mission-critical equipment and cockpit panel assemblies for its F-15 and F/A-18 fighter aircraft, which a release issued here said is an "example of Boeing's ongoing support of the 'Make in India' initiative." "This delivery demonstrates again that Indian suppliers, both big and small are becoming an integral part of Boeing's global supply chain," Boeing India President Pratyush Kumar said, adding that Boeing will continue to rapidly increase its efforts to enhance complex aerospace manufacturing in India. Sasmos Managing Director HG Chandrasekhar said the firm has not only met the Boeing standards, but has also increased its production rate in a "relatively short timeframe." Boeing, the release said is expanding its collaborations with Indian firms with the aim of building a world-class aerospace ecosystem in India. "Boeing is expanding its collaboration with Indian industrial partners across manufacturing, engineering and IT sectors. The company continues to increase its footprint as direct and indirect suppliers and sourcing activities continue to grow rapidly," the release said.

PetroTalk Infogram Docs فارسی French فارسی French Boeing casts fresh doubt on Iran deal Wed Oct 5, 2016 7:18AM Home Iran Economy An Iran Air Boeing 747SP aircraft is pictured before leaving Tehran's Mehrabad airport, Sept. 19, 2011. Fresh skepticism springs up about the fate of a deal which Boeing has signed to provide Iran Air with over 80 jetliners after the US aircraft maker says none will be delivered this year.  Since Boeing announced a tentative deal to sell jetliners to Iran in June, US lawmakers have been trying to block it. Under the agreement, Boeing must supply Iran some 80 passenger jets worth $25 billion at price lists. On Tuesday, Boeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said while the two sides were making progress on the deal, no deliveries would take place this year. "We won't deliver any aircraft under that deal this year - these are deliveries that are a year, two, three downstream," Muilenburg told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Chicago on future technologies. Boeing’s deal is similar to another provisional agreement which Iran Air has signed with Airbus to get 118 jetliners from the European aircraft maker. However, no formal contracts have been signed yet, meaning all of these deals could fail, given the volatile dynamics of the West’s relations with Iran. Presidential election factor The tentative deals have already hit a speed bump because major global banks are refusing to handle transactions with Iran for fear of running afoul of US sanctions on the country. One major roadblock was lifted last month when the US government granted Airbus and Boeing permission to sell aircraft to the Islamic Republic. Some Iranians, however, believe the US is most likely to put up new hurdles even if it does not scrap the deal entirely. They are disheartened by what the next presidential elections in the United States might have in store for the patchy relations between Tehran and Washington. Both current US presidential candidates are expected to adopt a much stricter line than President Barack Obama toward Iran. Another detracting factor which could scupper the deals is opposition from the US Congress. The US House of Representatives has already passed a motion to block the Boeing deal, with further measures proposed in Congress to bar certain transactions by US financial institutions connected to the export of aircraft. If the proposed bills to restrict the deal become law, they would also affect other companies’ sales to Iran, including those by Airbus. Looking for new options Last month, Iran indicated that it was cutting the Airbus deal by six aircraft and clipping the contract with Boeing by one jet. Reports also have it that Iran Air has been cooling towards the purchase of 12 A380 superjumbos that were part of the provisional deal. Iranian airlines, meanwhile, are looking for other options. They have approached smaller aircraft manufacturers which they believe are easier to deal with. Tentative deals have been signed with France’s ATR and Brazil’s Embraer, while Japan’s Mitsubishi and China’s Comac have held talks with Iranian aviation companies. Such developments have taken the shine off the deals with Airbus and Boeing – the biggest for Western aviation companies in Iran since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. However, neither of the two airline behemoths wants to lose one of the last untapped aviation markets in the world. On Tuesday, Muilenberg described Iran “significant opportunity for us.” “And I'm pleased to see that we're making steady progress," he said, adding Boeing was "in the final stages of working through the deal structure with our customers in Iran" while also working through the US government licensing process.

Jack Stewart Transportation Date of Publication: 10.06.16. 10.06.16 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Inside the 737 Test Plane That Boeing Beats the Bejesus Out Of The sight of a passenger jet performing stunts might terrify you, but it shouldn’t. The Boeing 737 MAX is the first new plane of Boeing’s second century of existence, but before it can enter service, it has to prove itself. The 737 is a Seattle stalwart—the best-selling commercial jet ever—but that doesn’t mean it can afford to skimp on evolution. That’s why Boeing has built the 737 MAX, a new take on the jet that’s 14 percent more efficient and 40 percent quieter than the outgoing version. But before airlines can cram you into the thing, Boeing’s got to prove it’s airworthy in just about any situation. The 737 MAX will compete directly with the Airbus A320neo, both fighting for dominance of the single aisle passenger jet market. The MAX left the ground for the first time in January, in front of an applauding crowd. Test pilot Captain Ed Wilson treated it gently on that initial flight. He didn’t even retract the wheels, in case he needed to return to earth on the double. “It was a little nerve wracking,” he says, as he shows us around the redesigned cockpit. Now the audience is gone and the test pilots have forgotten those gentler days. Boeing has rigged up four 737 MAX aircraft with a bevy of instruments and is busily running them through endless tests and checks. Pilots push the speeds to the limit, head to Bolivia for high altitude testing, and even try to fly with missing winglets. We went aboard to see how it’s done. Go Back to Top.

PDT Europe will take place at the same location on November 9-10. Modern engineering design systems have enabled significant productivity improvements in the design process and have contributed to an explosion of information around the design that confounds downstream utilization of the design data. Designers spend an ever increasing percentage of their time working with supplemental information and less time doing technical work. The customization of design practices and data leads to the need for specialized training, which in turn increases the “on boarding” costs for new employees and limits the ability to share resources from other programs or from design centers. In addition, production systems and suppliers are given more information than is needed which creates confusion. Unique, poorly documented custom data representations make it difficult to integrate, maintain, and replace information systems. To address this pain-point a group of like-minded industry peers came together to jointly fund and staff a project team to identify root causes and potential remedies. In his keynote presentation, Mr. Swope will share a high level review of the objectives, requirements, and a roadmap for the definition and implementation of a “minimum digital thread.” The project involved reaching agreement on the minimum content required in full 3D model-based definition and engineering bill of material definition, agreeing on a set of standards for representation of this information, communicating objectives and requirements to solution providers for their review and comment, and reaching closure on a joint plan of action. As the Business Capabilities Architecture Lead at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Mr. Swope is responsible for the integrated set of business architecture products related to Boeing’s airplane business. These products include business requirements, performance measures, business data, and process management. In addition, Mr. Swope leads the organization that is integrating the future state architecture and plan for Boeing Commercial Airplanes’ processes and tools. During his 22 years at Boeing, Mr. Swope has worked in manufacturing research, operations research, program management, and product change management.

Boeing rolls out first P-8A Poseidon for Australia by Richard Tomkins Seattle (UPI) Sep 28, 2016 disclaimer: image is for illustration purposes only The first of 12 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force has been unveiled by Boeing at a rollout ceremony in Seattle, Wash. The maritime patrol and surveillance aircraft, based on the design of Boeing's 737-800 fuselage, will fly to Australia in November. "It is a privilege to accept the first Australian P-8A Poseidon aircraft," Australia's Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Leo Davies, said at the rollout ceremony. "The P-8A is the latest in a pedigree of Boeing aircraft that have provided important and significant operational capability to Australia." The aircraft, used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and shipping interdiction, features a weapons bay as well as under-wing and under-fuselage hard points for weapons. It has a maximum speed of 564 miles per hour, a combat radius of 1,200 nautical miles and a service ceiling of 41,000 feet. Australia's Director Maritime Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Response Transition Office, Group Captain Roger McCutcheon, says the P-8A will be a fundamental element of Australia's future maritime patrol and response strategy in replacing the country's AP-3C Orion aircraft, which are slated for retirement in 2018-2019. Boeing said the remaining 11 Poseidons for Ausstralia will be delivered by 2020.

Now the company intends to go toe-to-toe with newcomers such as billionaire Elon Musk in the next era of space exploration and commerce. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg sketched out a Jetsons-like future at a conference Tuesday, envisioning a commercial space-travel market with dozens of destinations orbiting the Earth and hypersonic aircraft shuttling travelers between continents in two hours or less. And Boeing intends to be a key player in the initial push to send humans to Mars, maybe even beating Musk to his long-time goal. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "I'm convinced the first person to step foot on Mars will arrive there riding a Boeing rocket," Muilenburg said at the Chicago event on innovation, which was sponsored by the Atlantic magazine. Like Musk's SpaceX, Boeing is focused on building out the commercial space sector near earth as spaceflight becomes more routine, while developing technology to venture far beyond the moon. The Chicago-based aerospace giant is working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to develop a heavy-lift rocket called the Space Launch System for deep space exploration. Boeing and SpaceX are also the first commercial companies NASA selected to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. Musk last week welcomed competitors as he unveiled a SpaceX craft that would dwarf the workhorse of Apollo missions of a half-century ago, hauling 100 travelers to Mars with cruise-ship-style amenities. "The goal of SpaceX really is to build the transport system. It's like building the Union Pacific railroad," Musk told a space conference, as he laid out a plan to bring travel to Mars to a mass market with tickets priced one day as low as $100,000. Boeing built the first stage for the Saturn V, the most powerful U.S. rocket ever built, which took men to the moon. Nowadays, Muilenburg sees space tourism closer to home "blossoming over the next couple of decades into a viable commercial market." The International Space Station could be joined in low-earth orbit by dozens of hotels and companies pursuing micro-gravity manufacturing and research, he said. "It's a fascinating area for us," he said. Muilenburg said Boeing will make spacecraft for the new era of tourists. He also sees potential for hypersonic aircraft, traveling at upwards of three times the speed of sound. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are among the space heavyweights developing experimental aircraft that could fly U.S. travelers at speeds right out of a science fiction movie. Lockheed's Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 is being designed to zip through the sky at Mach 20 (about 13,000 miles per hour), flying between New York and Los Angeles in 12 minutes. Boeing's X-51A WaveRider, which relied on its own shock waves for compression lift, reached Mach 5.1 in 2013. Costs will need to drop substantially before these experimental spacecraft can be seriously considered for commercial use, Muilenburg said. "That business model isn't closed yet. At some point it will," he said. "The future of innovation has to include not only the technology, but economic viability."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Oregon medical examiner identifies remains as daughter of Piano Guy George Pyle: By backing Trump, after all, Mormons blow their moral lead Trump plans to immediately deport 2 to 3 million undocumented immigrants Utah Jazz start season off hot after successful road trip Utah football: After wild weekend, Utes have two 'Super Bowls' remaining to secure lofty goals ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Ted S. Warren / AP Photo Qatar Airways has placed a sizable order with Boeing. The airline ordered a total of 40 jets, comprised of 30 787-9 Dreamliners, and 10 777-300ER aircraft. Both of those planes are made in the Puget Sound area. The list price for all 40 planes is nearly $12 billion, but large orders typically include discounts. Aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia says Qatar’s order with Boeing is less about the aircraft and more about customer service. “It’s hard to see this as a major announcement by a company that really loves these products. It’s easier to see it as an airline that’s rather annoyed at Airbus because of production delays … so they’re showing their displeasure by diverting a few of those orders to Boeing instead,” said Aboulafia. In the case of the 777, he says Qatar Airways is giving Boeing a slight boost in an otherwise dismal sales year. Qatar also announced tentative plans to order up to 60 of Boeing’s 737-MAX 8 jets. The list price for that sale is around $7 billion.

The brokerage cut its non-GAAP third quarter/2016 EPS view to $(0.19)/$(0.81) from $(0.01)/$(0.69) to reflect a lower cost reduction benefit than earlier expected. The brokerage's $(5.01) GAAP EPS estimate for the third quarter includes a $334 million ($4.83) charge for idling the Rowley facility and a $1.71 tax valuation allowance. "While we expect a disappointing 3Q16 print and for the stock to initially come under some pressure, we think improving end market commentary and the 2017 outlook will likely drive the stock higher," analyst Richard Safran wrote in a note. Related Link: Boeing And Qatar Confirm Earlier Report Of $11.7 Billion Plane Order Safran believes a lot of negative sentiment is already in the stock, as investors would mainly focus on the following: Commentary about 2017 EPS. FCF commentary. HRPF. Aerospace OE production ramp. End of cycle concerns. Demand for commodity metals. Rating, Valuation And Justification The analyst, who reiterated his Buy rating and $21 target price, expects 2017 EPS of $1.15 that is well above $0.77 consensus. "While we think ATI will express concerns about Flat Rolled growth in 2017 (we expect 1 percent y/y), we also think ATI will cite higher commercial aircraft build rates and a better mix driving High Performance growth (we expect 9 percent y/y)," Safran higlighted. Meanwhile, near-term concerns center on expectations that Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) will lower B777 production rates. But, Safran noted that ATI has very little content on the B777 or the GE 90 engine. The price target of $21 implies 18x Safran's 2017 estimated EPS of $1.15 and 8x his 2017 estimated EBITDA of $458 million. ATI currently trades at 16x his 2017 estimated EPS of $1.15, below peers at 17.5x. At time of writing, shares of Allegheny fell 2.87 percent to $17.63. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

The Doha-based carrier made good on a threat to buy Boeing's 737 Max after rejecting initial A320neo deliveries from Airbus Group SE because of engine issues. Qatar Airways is also taking 777 and 787 Dreamliner aircraft in an order flurry that could add 100 Boeing planes to its fleet, Akbar Al Baker, the airline's chief executive officer, and Ray Conner, CEO of Boeing's commercial airplane division, said Friday in Washington. The deal is a vote of confidence in Boeing's revamped 737 Max, which was announced after Airbus unveiled its upgraded A320neo family and has struggled to close the sales gap. Qatar Airways pledged to buy as many as 60 Max 8 models, valued at $6.9 billion at list prices, marking the carrier's first narrow-body order from Boeing since 1979. The order is a boost to Chicago-based Boeing, which, like Airbus, has been contending with sales slowed by economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia and a commodities downturn in Russia and Brazil. Meanwhile, relatively low fuel prices have damped demand for new, fuel-efficient wide-body jets such as the 777 and 787 and contributed to a glut of second-hand models. Boeing fell 0.7 percent to $133.39 at 12:29 p.m. in New York, paring a drop of as much as 1.4 percent. Airbus declined 1.1 percent to 53.83 euros at the close in Paris. Airbus Doubts Qatar Airways intends to follow through on a 2011 order for 50 Airbus A320neo and A321neo planes, which have a combined value of $6.4 billion at list prices, Al Baker said. But he also took a swipe over issues with the aircraft's geared turbofan engine, which is made by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney unit, saying the delays left him with “no alternative” but to order the “reliable” Boeing narrow-body planes. “We never renege on contracts that we sign,” Al Baker said. “The aircraft that we are ordering today will serve this ever-expanding network.” Qatar is also ordering 30 of Boeing's 787-9 model and 10 777-300ER jets, valued at a combined $11.7 billion at list prices before discounts that are customary for large aircraft purchases It is Boeing's largest twin-aisle sale this year, providing a little more visibility into plans for the 777, the planemaker's largest twin-engine aircraft, as well as for the Dreamliner, the company's marquee carbon-fiber jet. Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said last month that current sales campaigns could determine whether Boeing boosts Dreamliner output -- and whether a dearth of orders will force it again to slow assembly of current-generation 777 models before an upgraded version debuts in 2020. Delivery Delays Al Baker has signaled his growing frustration with Airbus in recent months, threatening to switch a Qatar Airways order for planes in the A320neo family to Boeing 737 Max jets. He has declined to take delivery of the first Airbus narrow-bodies because of an engine cooling issue. Airbus has also drawn Al Baker's ire for its struggles to meet delivery deadlines of the A350, the European company's most advanced jetliner, which competes with the 777 and 787 Dreamliner. The state-owned airline was the first buyer of the new Airbus wide-body. Boeing's deal with Qatar Airways was forged after the U.S. approved sales by Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp. to Persian Gulf allies, including as many as 72 Boeing F-15 jets to Qatar. The fighter-jet sale is subject to approval by the U.S. Congress. Boeing Co. Manufacturing Airlines Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.

Boeing/Gail Hanusa Courtesy photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Qatar Airways placed a multibillion-dollar widebody jet order with Boeing that will benefit Spirit AeroSystems and could stave off further production rate cuts on the 777, at least temporarily. Qatar’s firm order is for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs – a deal valued at $11.7 billion at list prices, though the airline likely will receive a sizable discount. It also signed a letter of intent for as many as 60 737 Max 8s, a deal that carries a value of $6.9 billion at list prices. Qatar has a fleet of 84 Boeing 787s and 777s that have been delivered in the past nine years. The deal is significant for not just Boeing, but also Wichita-based Spirit AeroSystems. Spirit manufactures 70 percent of the 737, both the current Next Generation and the new Max. It also manufactures the forward fuselages and struts of the 787 and 777, and the nacelles of the 777. Boeing Commercial Airplanes chief executive Ray Conner said at a news conference Friday that the Qatar order could help what has been a dearth of orders for the 777, Boeing’s second-biggest jetliner. Boeing has seen slowing demand for the 777 and plans to reduce production of the airplane from a rate of 8.3 a month to seven a month starting in 2017. In the past year, analysts have become increasingly concerned that Boeing will have to further reduce 777 production because of order sluggishness and as it begins its transition to production of the new 777X. Boeing expects to deliver the first 777X in 2020. “We’ll just have to wait and see how the rest of our order stream plays out, but I can tell you that 10 777s is a big deal,” Conner said at the news conference held in Washington, D.C. “Where these airplanes fall within our delivery stream is extremely important to us in terms of how we maintain or what we do with our production rates. So I would say this order is very important from that standpoint.” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said the gap between what’s on the order books for the 777 and the 777X is large enough that the Qatar order probably won’t be enough to prevent an additional rate cut. “It puts off the next rate cut, but the next rate cut is still inevitable,” Aboulafia said. “They need a couple hundred airplanes to bridge that gap.” He estimates the Qatar 777 order pushes back a second, 777 rate cut “by a few months, maybe.” Spirit president and CEO Tom Gentile said at a Morgan Stanley investor conference last month in California that the company was paying close attention to Boeing’s 777 rate plans. He said next year’s rate reduction would be a “proportional” reduction in Spirit revenue and profit. A second 777 rate cut could be partially offset by the planned increase in 737 production next year — from 42 a month to 47 — Gentile said, but it would likely prompt Spirit to “accelerate some of our cost reduction initiatives,” including ways to streamline the company’s overhead and infrastructure.

The transaction also provided a vote of confidence in the Boeing jet, which is on pace to begin commercial service months ahead of schedule in the second quarter next year. Qatar Airways will take its first Max in 2018, Al Baker said in an interview. He insisted the decision to pivot to the rival Boeing model wasn’t intended as retaliation against the European planemaker. “There is no message to Airbus,” he said. “We don’t send messages by aircraft purchases to each other.” Boeing Boost Boeing pared a drop of as much as 1.4 percent before the Qatar Airways announcement to trade 0.2 percent lower at $134.07 at 2:52 p.m. in New York. Airbus fell as much as 2.1 percent as news of the order broke, then declined 1.1 percent to 53.83 euros at the close in Paris. The order gives a boost to Chicago-based Boeing, which, like Airbus, has been contending with sales slowed by economic uncertainty in Europe and Asia and a commodities downturn in Russia and Brazil.

Home News Science, Space & Robotics Boeing wants to beat Elon Musk and SpaceX to Mars The CEO of The Boeing Company is convinced that the first humans to set foot on Mars will get there by a Boeing rocket By: Lana Jelic | Science, Space & Robotics News | Posted: Oct 7, 2016 1:31 pm Comment | Email to a Friend | Font Size: AA Elon Musk has a plan to colonize Mars, but he isn't the only one who wants to get to the Red Planet. Speaking at a conference in Chicago, Dennis Muilenburg, the CEO of The Boeing Company, stated that he is convinced that the first humans to set foot on Mars will get there by a Boeing rocket.     The Boeing Company is involved in space exploration practically since the founding of NASA. They built the first stage of the Saturn V rocket, the three-stage liquid-fueled launch vehicle developed to support the Apollo program for human exploration of the Moon, and was later used to launch Skylab, the first American space station. Boeing also participated with other projects in the space program, and was the first contractor for the International Space Station program.   NASA has awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX for transporting astronauts to the International Space Station, and seems like their rivalry will continue since Boeing, like SpaceX, is also working on the design and development of a new rocket that should bring the first people to Mars.   Muilenburg also expressed doubts about Musk's optimistic plan to send first humans to Mars in 2024. NASA mentioned in their plans that the first humans could get to Mars a decade later than Musk's estimation. Musk's end goal is to send up to one million people to the Red Planet in 10,000 person flights at a time, something he believes is achievable in less than 100 years.

24/7 Wall St. - Insightful Analysis and Commentary for U.S. and Global Equity Investors Search this site Business Aerospace & Defense Autos Banking & Finance Commodities & Metals Consumer Products Energy Healthcare Industrials Infrastructure Media Retail Services Technology Apps & Software Consumer Electronics Telecom & Wireless Apple Inc. Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States Did Honeywell Guidance Just Jeopardize Conglomerates or Industrials? By Jon C. Ogg October 6, 2016 6:09 pm EST Print Email Tweet Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON) is one of the largest conglomerates out there, but it is often overlooked as a broad economic indicator like some of the companies. Maybe its $88 billion market cap just isn’t big enough these days in the world where companies need to have $100 billion market capitalization rates to be megacaps. 24/7 Wall St. cannot help but wonder if Honeywell may have just inadvertently wrecked the story for many industrial and conglomerate outfits after lowering guidance. The good news here is that Honeywell’s guidance looks limited to Honeywell, but we took a look at General Electric, Boeing and United Tech just to be sure. Honeywell has now lowered 2016 sales and earnings forecast for 2016, in part due to the aerospace and Space & Defense divisions seeing lower shipments. The separation of automation and control solutions into two new segments and the overall impact of acquisitions and divestitures was also cited — the acquisition of Intelligrated, sale of the Honeywell Technology Solutions, and the spin-off of Resins and Chemicals as AdvanSix. Earnings per share (EPS) for 2016 was lowered to a range of $6.60 to $6.64 (a gain of 8% to 9%) versus a prior range of $6.60 to $6.70. That doesn’t look too bad, but what hurts here is that Honeywell now sees its organic revenues dropping from 1% to 2% in 2016. Its prior estimate was a 1% drop. Investors might feel as though they were caught off guard here. It was a month ago when the AdvanSix spin-off was set. Things seemed normal then. After closing up 0.3% at $115.61 on Thursday, Honeywell shares were last seen trading down 3.9% at $111.05 — but only 30,000 shares or so had traded at 5:50 p.m. Eastern time. On October 4, Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) announced that its 2016 gross orders were now 460, showing a change of −80 units, for some 380 net orders. Boeing has exposure for both defense and aerospace. Its shares closed down 0.18% at $134.42, but they were not seen moving in the after-hours. General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) closed down almost 0.8% at $29.27 on Thursday, after an analyst lowered its price target by $1.00. Its after-hours range was not lower either, with a 52-week range of $27.10 to $33.00. GE has exposure to aerospace and as a conglomerate. United Technologies Corp. (NYSE: UTX), which was not that long ago considered a Honeywell merger partner, closed down 0.17% at $102.08. Its market cap is $85 billion, and its shares have a 52-week range of $83.39 to $109.83. Earlier Thursday, UTX said that it was reducing its pension obligations, but it will take a charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million. If you saw the headlines on Honeywell, then you might be more worried. After looking at the fallout and looking at the statements, the spillover and fallout doesn’t look too extreme. Stay tuned as Friday’s unemployment and payrolls report could skew how this guidance fallout impacts other companies. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

The move comes after Christian Estrosi broke off negotiations with TER complaining 40 trains simply do run every single day not to mention the 86 days of strike so far this year. M Estrosi said he would not tolerate that situation continuing and that the region will begin to look for alternative train service options. TER has now deployed new drivers and and say they are willing to re-open negotiations. Smoking - A strike by doctors for October 12th has been called off after successful negotiations at the Ministry of Health which include incentives for new doctors to practice at public hospitals and areas in need of young doctors such as Fréjus and Saint-Raphael who reported a drop in local healthcare this week. The Ministry of Health has also revealed figures which show France has one of the highest smoking rates in the OECD, with 28% of people smoking regularly, and 20% of pregnant women regular smokers also. The Ministry hope to cut smoking rates with a new campaign encouraging people to give up for the month of November.  The campaign is called “Moi sans Tabac”. Ferrari - The driver of a Ferrari which seriously injured a Russian man on the eve of the Formula 1 Grand Prix in Monaco has been given 15 months in jail, had his car confiscated and ordered to pay €1m to the victim. The incident happened in May when the Finnish driver, was drinking with friends in Larvotto when seven of them piled into the open top Ferrari to drive to Jimmyz nightclub. As the driver accelerated, the Russian fell out of the car, seriously injuring himself. The driver was arrested on site for drunk and dangerous driving and has been in custody ever since. Nice - The new prison promised for Nice by Prime Minister Valls yesterday, will not be built in Saint-Laurent-du-Var according to the Mayor of the area. Speaking at a lively council meeting last night Joseph Segura said; Christian Estrosi wants his prison. He can have it in Nice. We don’t want it. Meanwhile the city of Nice has announced plans to improve  security on the Promenade des Anglais with new retractable bollards to be put in place by next summer, along with other devices which will provide optimal security along the strip. More than two months after the Nice Attack investigators are discovering more about the personality of the killer, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. While his entourage had told police he had radicalized very quickly, the investigators have found that the Nice killer actually frequented Islamist circles for at least a year. According to reports nearly a year before the attack in Nice Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel was controlled at the Italian border in Ventimiglia. Three other men were also travelling in the vehicle, one of which was linked to the jihadist networks leaving for Syria. One of the alleged accomplices of Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel has told investigators that he often went to Italy with individuals radicalized to bring food to migrants. Missing Person - Twenty four year old Valentine Breton, who was reported missing last week has been found safe and well. Mr Breton had been missing since last Friday and police had launched an investigation.He reportedly made contact by phone on Thursday much to the relief of his friends and relatives. Promenade des Anglais - Following the Nice attack, the city has announced plans to improve  security on the Promenade des Anglais. By the summer of 2017 retractable bollards will be put in place along with other devices which will provide optimal security along the coastal strip. Monaco in Russia - Prince Albert of Monaco has held talks with President Vladimir Putin. The Russian president met with his serene highness on Thursday morning at the Kremlin as part of the Monaco in Russia week. Elections - The candidate for the Republican’s primary elections Alain Juppé has chosen to hold his local meeting in Toulon rather than Marseille. Initially the meeting, which is to take place on the 27th October, had been planned in Marseille the capital of the Provence Alpes Cote d’Azur region. Juppé however reportedly changed the location after hearing that the former head of state Nicolas Sarkozy had decided to hold a meeting in Marseille on the same day. The mayor of Bordeaux is still ahead in the polls. PTA - Today 15 million French people will vote in schools across France for  Parent teaching associations. Last year a reported 50% of parents voted. Voting will take place today and tomorrow either on the school premises or by post.   National Vladimir Putin - Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold talks with his French counterpart François Hollande during a visit to France on 19th October . The two leaders “will discuss international issues including Syria and Ukraine. Putin's visit to France – his first to the country since he attended a climate summit in Paris late last year – has been in the planning for months. The trip comes amid a spike in tensions with the West over Moscow's bombing campaign in war-torn Syria. Love letters - A collection of love letters from former French president François Mitterrand to his longtime mistress, Anne Pingeot, are to be published next week. Lettres à Anne” (Letters to Anne), published by leading French publisher Gallimard, is a collection of more than 1,200 letters from Mitterrand that have been compiled and edited by Pingeot herself. She has, however, chosen not to include her replies. Business For the first time airlines have committed to a deal on greenhouse gas limits where, from 2020, any increase in CO2 emissions will be offset by activities like tree planting, which soak up CO2. Attempts have been made for almost 20 years to include aviation and shipping in climate agreements, but both sectors have managed to avoid firm targets. In other aviation news, it’s another bad day for Airbus as Boeing are about to announce a substantial deal with Qatar Airways for up to 35 widebody planes worth $18bn. Qatar are said to have run out of patience with Airbus over prolonged delivery delays. An error in automated trading is being blamed for a “flash crash” of Sterling on Asian markets this morning. At one stage the Pound fell 6% in just two minutes although it is returning to more normal levels this afternoon. Meanwhile French President Francois Hollande has said the EU must take a firm line with the UK as Theresa May told her party she wants Britain to trade freely with Europe but restrict movement at its borders. Mr Hollande said Britain wanted to leave the bloc without paying the consequences which he said was not possible. His comments are backed-up by German chancellor Angela Merkel. Shares in Twitter have continued to fall sharply on concerns about a lack of takeover interest. The company lost a fifth of its value in trading on Thursday following reports that Apple,Google and Walt Disney were all losing interest in taking it over. The cloud software firm salesforce.com is now thought to be the most likely suitor. Sport Tennis - British No 1 Johanna Konta is through to the China Open semi-finals after fighting back from 4-0 down in her quarter final. She will now meet Madison Keys in the semi-finals this weekend. Rugby Union-The French sports newspaper L’Equipe has reported that the New Zealand stars Dan Carter and Joe Rokococo both provided drug test samples that showed “anomalies” before the final of this year’s French Top 14 championship final. Both former All Blacks played in the final for Racing Metro against Toulon and L’Equipe says that urine samples taken by the French national anti-doping agency showed traces of banned corticosteroids. The pair’s manager Simon Porter says that both players had therapeutic use exemptions TUEs and all the paperwork can be provided. Meanwhile-Anthony Watson is the latest England player to be ruled out of the autumn internationals through injury. Watson suffered a broken jaw at the England training camp and is unlikely to be fit to play. Earlier this week,lock Sam Jones suffered a fractured fibula after an accident during a judo training session at the camp. Coach Eddie Jones had warned that the three day training session would be “brutal”. Football-Wales drew 2-2 in Austria in last night’s World Cup qualifying Group D game last night while the Republic of Ireland beat Georgia 1-0 in the same group. France play Bulgaria in Group A tonight  while England play Malta in Group F tomorrow and Scotland play Lithuania. Northern Ireland host San Marino in Group C.  OGC Nice - It has been confirmed that Mario Balotelli will be allowed to play in the match against Lyon next weekend.  Unfairly sent off against Lorient last weekend in Ligue 1, Balotelli saw his red card be withdrawn by the Disciplinary Committee of the LFP.  Formula 1-Nico Rosberg was quickest in first practice for Sunday’s Japanese Grand prix at Suzuka. Rosberg outpaced Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton who complained of a lack of power early in the session. Sebastien Vettel in the Ferrari was third quickest. Qualifying is at 8am tomorrow morning with the race at 7am on Sunday. Cricket-Security is tight ahead of the first one day international between Bangladesh and England in Dhaka. Bangladesh army commandos carried out drills inside the national stadium on Thursday with fears over a possible terrorist attack.Play starts at 10.30 French time this morning. Weather Clearing skies with a moderate westerly wind developing across the Var and light easterly winds in the Alpes-Maritimes. Top temperature 23 degrees Celsius. Overnight lows of 15 degrees on the coast and 9 degrees inland with partially cloudy skies. The weekend-Mainly fine with perhaps an occasional shower in the Alpes-Maritimes tomorrow evening.Highs of 23 degrees. And Finally With only 79 days to go before Christmas hopes of a few hours’ peace as the children put together Lego or play with model cars may be dashed as this year’s must-have toy looks like it may threaten to turn Christmas into a war zone. A new range of Star Wars-inspired toys include saucer-sized drones capable of flying at 50mph. The drones powered by four propellers are also armed with lasers and intended to allow users to group together to recreate the intergalactic battles seen in the Star Wars films. The drones are intended for outdoor use by over-14s with experience of flying drones. They are being launched in shops to coincide with the release of latest Star Wars film in December.     Advertisement Homepage Features News What's on guide Giveaways Videos Advertisers Contact Us Copyright - RIVIERA RADIO | Design & SEO by I2N

(AP) — NASA is bracing for its first hurricane without space shuttles to worry about. Now it's SpaceX and Boeing fretting about hurricane-force wind and equally devastating storm surges. Before the shuttle fleet's retirement in 2011, rollbacks from the launch pads were commonplace during hurricane season at Kennedy Space Center. Now both pads are empty, at least for the time being. NASA is modifying Launch Complex 39B for its still-in-development Space Launch System mega-rockets intended for outer-space travel. SpaceX is leasing the other pad, 39A, from where Apollo astronauts departed for the moon and multiple shuttle flights began. SpaceX was counting on this historic pad to get its rockets flying again, possibly in November, once modifications were complete. The SpaceX pad at neighboring Cape Canaveral Air Force Station was damaged Sept. 1 when a Falcon rocket exploded during prelaunch testing. Boeing, meanwhile, is using a former shuttle hangar to build capsules to fly future space station crews as early as 2018. The building can withstand 105 mph wind — no more. SpaceX is also in the race to get Americans launched into space again from U.S. soil, possibly in the next year. NASA isn't out of the space game, though, by a long shot. The space agency is developing a new capsule called Orion for sending astronauts beyond low-Earth orbit; it has its sights set on Mars in the 2030s. The spacecraft was covered in a Kennedy building built to withstand sustained wind of 114 mph and gusts of 125 mph. A much-advanced, next-generation GOES weather satellite, meanwhile, was inside an even stronger building in nearby Titusville, capable of tolerating 130-mph wind, NASA spokesman George Diller said Thursday. The satellite is supposed to launch on an Atlas V rocket on Nov. 4, although that date may now be in jeopardy because of Matthew. This "game-changer" of a satellite, as weather officials call it, will enhance meteorologists' ability to monitor hurricanes and climate to boot. Kennedy was closed Thursday and Friday, with a 116-person ride-out crew on duty to help keep things safe. Its visitor complex — home to space shuttle Atlantis in retirement — also was shut down. ___ Online: Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex: https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/ Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Shares of the world's biggest planemaker were down 0.5 pct at US$133.99 in morning trading. Boeing booked orders for 150 commercial planes in the third quarter, lower than the 182 a year earlier. The company said deliveries of its single-aisle 737 slipped to 120 from 126 in the third quarter as customers await first deliveries of the 737 MAX, the latest version of its most popular plane, next year. Deliveries of 777 model declined to 22 from 27, while 787 deliveries fell to 36 from 37. The company said it delivered 563 planes this year. Rival Airbus delivered 62 aircraft in September, including eight of its A320neo jets and five A350s, bringing the total for the year so far to 462 aircraft. Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg warned in September that the company might miss its target of selling 740 jetliners in 2016 and production of 777 jets may be cut further if sales continued to lag.

AP File photo i By Jerry Siebenmark jsiebenmark@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Boeing saw fewer airplane deliveries in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. The Chicago-based aerospace giant said Thursday it delivered 188 commercial airliners in the third quarter of 2016. That’s 11 fewer than the same three-month period a year ago. For the first nine months of the year, deliveries totaled 563, down from 580 in the same period in 2015. The only airplane it delivered more of in the third quarter was its 747 jumbo jet, the monthly production rate of which has been lowered starting this year. Boeing delivered five 747s in the period compared with four last year. Third-quarter deliveries of all other models including its popular 737 narrowbody airliner – 70 percent of which is manufactured by Spirit AeroSystems in Wichita – were flat or lower compared with the third quarter of 2015. For the year, the 787 was its only jetliner to see higher deliveries from the same period last year.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michele Lerner October 6 Matt and Ann MacPhail own a Queen Anne-style Victorian home that is designed to fit in with the neighborhood and reminiscent of nearby Victorian homes in Falls Church. It also includes a home theater for professional and personal use as well as a recording studio with a control room and three isolation booths. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) Washington and its suburbs are well known as a setting for spies, clandestine meetings and hidden safe rooms for the powerful, and now a new secret has been revealed: Undisclosed Location Studios, a state-of-the-art recording studio, is hiding in an Arlington basement. “We can’t claim to have invented the joke about being in an undisclosed location, but we like the tongue-in-cheek reference to being near D.C. and the Pentagon and at the same time to refer to the fact that no one can drive by our house and know that it has a recording studio inside,” says Matt MacPhail, who owns News at Eleven Productions, an audio-production business in Arlington, with his wife, Ann MacPhail. The MacPhails’ Queen Anne-style Victorian home, designed to fit in with the neighborhood and reminiscent of nearby Victorian homes in Falls Church, includes a home theater for professional and personal use as well as a recording studio with a control room and three isolation booths, all completely invisible to outsiders. While that invisibility is intentional, it deprives local residents of being able to point to the new cool thing in the Lyon Village neighborhood: a studio designed by the architect who designed Jimi Hendrix’s Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, which was pioneering as a musician-owned recording studio. “Recording studios in homes have become pretty common since digitalization allows equipment to be less expensive and smaller,” says John Storyk, founding partner of WSDG-Walters-Storyk Design Group in Highland, N.Y. “While there are thousands of them across the country now, very few are at the professional level of the MacPhails’ studio.” Storyk says the acoustical accuracy of the MacPhails’ studio is exceptional. 1 of 15 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × State-of-the-art recording studio hidden beneath Arlington home View Photos With Undisclosed Location, a couple mixes work and family life. Caption With Undisclosed Location, a couple mixes work and family life.   Undisclosed Location Studios, a state-of-the-art recording studio, is hiding in the basement of the Arlington home of Matt and Ann MacPhail. Katherine Frey/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. The couple have always had some type of recording system in their home and have been producing music and voice-overs for nearly 20 years. “Matt and I met in 1996 as founding members of the SoCal VoCals, a rock a cappella group at the University of Southern California,” Ann MacPhail says. “They are the only four-time champions of the ICCA [International Collegiate Championship of A Cappella]. The experience of recording an album with the SoCal VoCals sparked our interest in audio production.” Among the MacPhails’ clients are IBM, MasterCard, Boeing and Bank of the West. “A big part of our business now is audio for video, so it helps to have the home theater connected to the recording studio when we work on sound design for a documentary or narrate an employee safety video for Boeing,” Ann MacPhail says. [How D.C. area residents turned their basements into stunning wine cellars] While none of that sounds quite as cool as recording Hendrix or jamming with the Rolling Stones, some of the essential elements of the recording-studio design are the same for Hendrix and the MacPhails, including fully decoupled, room-within-a-room construction and a custom-designed ceiling with varied heights. One of the innovations of Electric Lady Studios was the use of lighting for mood in keeping with the psychedelia in which Hendrix was interested and to make the studio feel less sterile and closer to the live experience for performers. That recording studio, like the MacPhails’ and most other studios today, was intended to encourage creativity and artistry. “The democratization of recording studios means that artists have more control over their own work,” Matt MacPhail says. “Hendrix was one of the first artists to own his own creative space, but there are challenges in designing a recording studio. Acoustic isolation requires a tight seal, so you can’t always get the ventilation you need. Now we have ventilation, and even if we turn on the air conditioning, it’s quiet enough that we don’t pick up any sound on our recordings.” The MacPhails’ neighborhood is in a flight path for Reagan National Airport, which makes acoustic isolation even more essential. The sub-basement includes a studio reception room for clients, the isolation booths and control room, along with an elevator and stairs to the basement level, which has a separate entry for clients, a full bathroom and the theater. “Because this is our house as well as our workspace, we worked with the designer to have two entrances into the theater, so that clients never have to walk through the residential part of the house,” Ann says. In addition to the theater, the basement level has family spaces, including a recreation room, access to the garage, storage closets and another full bathroom. The entire house has approximately 5,400 finished square feet, with purely residential functions on the first and second floors. Undisclosed Location Studios uses lighting for mood and to make the studio feel less sterile and closer to the live experience for performers. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) Mixing sound, work and family life Matt MacPhail attended Georgetown University and worked at WETA-FM for a few years and always intended to return to the D.C. area after graduate school in California. The couple decided to relocate to the region a few years ago to be close to friends and to raise their children, Gabriel, 12, and Lucas, 10, here. Their friends recommended Lyon Village, and the couple spent seven months searching for an appropriate site for their home. They have lived in it for about four years but only recently have rededicated their time to their recording business. “Our focus was first on the residential aspect of our home and second on the studio, but from the very beginning, we worked with the recording-studio designers and our architects to make sure everything worked together,” Matt says. In their previous home, Ann says, clients had to step over the toys and walk through the kitchen to get to the professional area, so the couple planned for a dedicated entrance for when clients occasionally came to the studio. “We wanted a theater but weren’t sure whether it was family space or professional space,” Ann says. “It’s actually worked out to be both. We use it for work, but we also had ‘Downton Abbey’ watch parties and [watched] the Olympics with our sons. It’s a fun social space.” [A neighborhood bar so beloved, he moved it to his basement] The MacPhails enjoy playing music and singing with friends in their great room, which has space for a grand piano. The great room has been designed for enhanced acoustics and has microphone and data lines linked to the recording studio in case the MacPhails want to record the spontaneity. “We’ve enjoyed entertaining in the house because the open floor plan makes it so easy,” Ann says. “We held a ’70s-themed fundraiser for our kids’ school and even set up a ‘Not-So-Newlywed’ game with Matt dressed up like Bob Eubanks, and [had] a disco ball and laser lights. The next year, we had an ’80s fundraiser, and Matt built a console with working buttons to replicate ‘Family Feud.’ He dressed up like Richard Dawson for that one.” The MacPhail boys enjoy using the recording studio equipment for karaoke, and the couple donated a two-hour recording studio session as an auction item for a fundraiser. “We love using our space for community-building events and love that this is such a socially active neighborhood,” Ann says. Architects in step The MacPhails’ residential architects, John and Marilyn Burroughs, principals of New Leaf Collaborative Architecture and Design in Ashburn, Va., collaborated closely with Storyk and his team from the very beginning of the project. “Getting in on the master planning level helped make this a success,” Storyk says. “We did the architectural design for the basement and sub-basement, but the challenge here was that it’s a very tight site. We had to piggyback the studio and the home theater and the multipurpose space on top of each other.” “A big part of our business now is audio for video, so it helps to have the home theater connected to the recording studio when we work on sound design for a documentary or narrate an employee safety video for Boeing,” Ann MacPhail says. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) The MacPhails wanted three small isolation booths, so that was another challenge, says Storyk, who says it’s easier to control sound in a bigger room than in the series of smaller rooms. Storyk says that while being underground helps maintain acoustic isolation, not all recording studios are in basements. “People want privacy, but they also want sunlight, and we can easily use glass to create sound isolation,” Storyk says. “But daylight isn’t an asset for a professional theater, so it was easier to design that underground.” Storyk says Matt is an expert in lighting design, so he created a low-voltage LED lighting system that can be adjusted and programmed. The lighting can be set to automatically mimic the time of day. “We deliberately designed the architecture of the studio and home theater to be different from the rest of the house, to be more neutral, since these are professional work spaces,” Storyk says. Ann had photos and ideas of what she wanted, with a definite desire for a Victorian house with a front porch on the outside but a modern feel inside, Marilyn Burroughs says. “The exposed beam ceiling, arches and traditional cabinets in the kitchen warm up the contemporary open floor plan,” she says. The most dramatic feature of the residential portion of the building is the great room, which the Burroughses designed with a 22-foot-high vaulted ceiling similar to a church nave. “I literally drew what I wanted on a napkin for the great room, and it came out even better than expected,” Ann says. “I wanted to be able to see everyone from the kitchen, but I also wanted the space to be both elegant and warm.” The ceiling has exposed timber trusses, and the room has a sliding glass “NanaWall” partition to separate it from the kitchen, which is open to a dining alcove in a bay window. Outside the kitchen and dining area is a screened porch. “Ann wanted the great room to be capable for making recordings, but she still wanted the open floor plan for entertaining, so the NanaWall was perfect for that,” Marilyn Burroughs says. The most dramatic feature of the residential portion of the building is the great room, which the Burroughses designed with a 22-foot-high vaulted ceiling similar to a church nave. (Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) The first floor also has a guest bedroom and bathroom with universal design features such as a curb-less shower, which John Burroughs refers to as the “backup master suite” in case one of the residents needs to live on one level. This level also has an office with a storage closet. An elevator reaches all four levels of the home — from the sub-basement to the bedroom level on the second floor. The second floor has a master suite with a balcony, a walk-in closet and private bathroom; two more bedrooms, each with a walk-in closet and private full bathroom, and a laundry room. Sustainability goals met While the MacPhails’ priorities included comfortable living space for their family, room to entertain and space for their business, they also were committed to using sustainable, efficient building techniques. They recycled every part of the house that had been on the lot before theirs. “The MacPhails wanted to do the right thing throughout the project and to have a minimal impact on the environment,” John Burroughs says. The home has two cisterns to collect rain water and to collect water from the sump pump. “We have a rain garden and permeable pavers to help us conserve water,” Matt says. “We use the water from our cisterns for landscaping, and we hope to use it as gray water in our home in the future.” The home was designed to maximize the benefits of a tighter envelope and insulation and natural light. Solar panels generate electricity on-site, and a separate solar hot-water system provides radiant floor heating as well as for domestic use. Energy-efficient appliances and systems are in place, and the whole home is controlled by a smart home-management system. Working with professional architects for each of the dual purposes of their home resulted in the MacPhails’ getting exactly what they wanted: a family-oriented home in a friendly neighborhood along with a secret, high-caliber recording studio so they can seamlessly move between their private and professional lives.

Most Russians do not believe that Moscow was involved in the crash of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Donbass two years ago, a poll conducted by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center showed on Thursday. Read also MH17 crash investigators call not to rush with accusations against Russia "Half of the polled Russians (50%) believe that the Boeing was downed by the Ukrainian military while 14% share the opinion that the Western secret services are to blame for the tragedy, and 8% call it a terrorist attack. The Boeing crash received a wide response in the Russian society, almost every resident of the country has heard about it," the pollster said. The poll results show that Russians disagree with the assertion laying the blame on the militia of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Lugansk People’s Republic, or Russia’s secret services. Four percent and 1% of those polled said they believed in the respective theories. Meanwhile, 64% of the polled said they were familiar with the conclusions the international investigation group had come to, announcing that the plane had been attacked from the Donbass militia-controlled area with a missile launcher brought from Russia. However, one-in-five Russians (21%) did not think the investigation outcome would have significant consequences as far as Russia is concerned while 40% of the polled are undecided if the investigation could somehow affect Russia and its people or not. Read also Moscow considers MH17 probe biased, politically motivated — foreign ministry The poll was conducted on October 1-2 among 1,600 respondents in 130 locations across 46 regions throughout Russia, with a margin of error not exceeding 2.5%. The Malaysia Airlines MH17 flight, was a Boeing-777 passenger plane journey from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. It was shot down on July 17, 2014, over Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew on board. There were ten various nationals among the dead. The Ukrainian authorities and the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic militia accused each other of downing the plane. On July 21, 2014, the UN Security Council demanded a full and independent investigation. Russia’s representatives have repeatedly objected to the manner of the investigation and pointed to the data provided by Russia being neglected. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Boeing 777 crash in Ukraine Top News November 14, 8:26 Russian military to perform observation flight over US November 14, 8:26 November 14, 9:01 Czech PM calls initiatives to deploy US radar in republic 'pure fiction' November 14, 9:01 November 13, 16:17 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language November 13, 16:17 November 14, 8:30 Socialist leader wins presidential election in Moldova November 14, 8:30 In other media Реклама Photo 14 March to mark anniversary of legendary 1941 parade begins in Moscow 10 Russia's most remarkable monuments 15 Photos of the week: fire in a giant migrant camp, Trump's flag hug and a 'river of sheep' Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Formidable Sarmat: Satan’s successor that can pierce any defense 2 Russian military to perform observation flight over US 3 Czech PM calls initiatives to deploy US radar in republic 'pure fiction' 4 Socialist leader wins presidential election in Moldova 5 Gazprom hits new record of gas supplied to Europe - 597.9 million cubic meters a day 6 Bulgaria’s PM announced government resignation 7 Russian PM says Trump’s victory not to affect macroeconomic forecast 1 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language 2 Erdogan says protests in US only temporary 3 Crimea to supply gas to Ukraine’s town till March - legislator 4 Karjakin-Carlsen Game 2 ends in draw 5 International military drills 'Slavic Brotherhood' closed near Belgrade 6 Putin reiterates Russian Armed Forces not threatening anybody 7 Russia to attend talks with OPEC on November 26-28 - Novak 1 Dutch sub tried to approach Russian aircraft carrier in Mediterranean — defense ministry 2 Trump elected president of the United States — live coverage 3 Source: 16 US servicemen killed, 27 injured in fighting for Iraq’s Mosul 4 Putin congratulates Donald Trump on winning US presidential election 5 Russia-US discord will leave with Obama administration: lawmakers' reaction to Trump's win 6 US election results in animated graphics 7 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

 It’s time for the F-35 to start blowing up old F-16s Alex Lockie Oct. 5, 2016, 9:48 AM 33,734 facebook linkedin twitter email print The first QF-16 target aircraft seen at Tyndall Air Force Base in 2012. US Air Force photo by Chris Cokeing Gen. Herbert "Hawk" Carlisle of the US Air Force recently declared a squadron of 15 unmanned F-16s operationally capable, IHS Jane's reports. These drone versions of the F-16, called QF-16s, will provide targets for the Air Force as it tests out new weapons capabilities of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. "The QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target will provide the next generation of combat training and testing for US warfighters," a Boeing statement on the drones said. While the old F-16s may seem like costly targets, the Air Force is touting them as a more realistic opponent than what was previously available, and they are economical to some extent because they're made from older, retired F-16 airframes. "The QF-16 will replace the existing QF-4 fleet and provide a higher-capability, fourth-generation aerial target that is more representative of today's targets and threats," the Boeing statement continued. Having realistic targets to train against will help the F-35 pilots. F-35 Joint Program Office "This leap forward in airframe capabilities, combined with advanced electronic pods, will allow us to properly test and evaluate our 5th generation aircraft and weapons," Lt. Col. Matthew Garrison, the commander of the 82nd Aerial Target Squadron at Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, told C4ISRNET in an email. In fact, an F-35 already participated in a test in which a QF-16 drone was shot down, though it did so with an SM-6 missile fired from a land-based silo.

The carrier is delaying deliveries of 39 of the upgraded single-aisle planes originally scheduled for 2018 to 2020, the company said in a filing Friday to Borsa Istanbul. Turkish is raising its 2022 deliveries for the workhorse jets to 30 from the six it had previously planned. The company didn’t elaborate on the models that will be deferred, but it has ordered 92 Airbus A321neo, 65 of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 and 10 of the U.S. planemaker’s Max 9 models. Turkish, based in Istanbul, said it was reducing flight frequencies and shifting to smaller planes on “demand-challenged routes” after posting a second-quarter loss of 656 million liras ($215 million) in August.

Friday’s sharp decline puts the GCI at a close below 80 points for the first time since Sept. 21 and occurred in the midst of narrow trade in U.S. markets to put stocks on course for a third straight weekly decline as investors looked at September jobs numbers that fell below economists’ expectations. GovCon Index decliners outnumbered laggers by a 5-to-1 ratio Friday with Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), McKesson Corp. (NYSE: MCK) and Harris Corp. (NYSE: HRS) the GCI’s lone S&P 500-listed stocks to close green. On a weekly basis, seven GCI stocks advanced with KBR (NYSE: KBR) as the best percentage performer over five days and Boeing (NYSE: BA) the only co-listed company to gain. Honeywell posted its biggest one-day decline in 15 months and was the S&P 500’s second-worst net performer after the company issued new third quarter earnings guidance below the Wall Street analyst consensus with a cut to full-year expectations on lower shipments in the aerospace division, the Sept. 20 sale of its government services business to KBR (NYSE: KBR) and the separation of its former automation and control solutions business into two new reporting segments. Honeywell expects third quarter earnings per share of $1.60 excluding a 7-cent stock compensation restructuring versus analyst forecasts of $1.70 and trimmed full-year EPS expectations to $6.60-$6.64 from the prior $6.60-$6.70 outlook. Honeywell also forecasts core organic revenue for 2016 to decline 1-2 percent compared to prior guidance of a 1 percent sales fall. Approximately 19.87 million shares in Honeywell traded Friday to exceed the three-month average eight-fold. The GovCon Index’s notable net decliners included other aerospace and defense stocks Rockwell Collins (NYSE: COL), Textron (NYSE: TXT) and Raytheon (NYSE: RTN) with government services contractor CACI International (NYSE: CACI) also a major contributor to the GCI’s loss. Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE: BAH) retreated below its Wednesday close to give back gains from its Thursday rally on volatility in the stock after news surfaced over the FBI probe of a firm employee as volume totaled 2.33 million shares traded to top the three-month average by three times. Volume in Booz Allen’s stock has exceeded the three-month average for three consecutive days. U.S. investors kept their expectations as is over when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and now turn their attention to third quarter corporate earnings season with many GovCon Index-listed companies slated to report results this month. According to Bloomberg, bond markets have the probability of a December rate hike at 66 percent with odds of an increase in November at 17 percent compared to 24 percent before the Labor Department released September’s payrolls figures.

Currently a team of 116 employees from NASA, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and their commercial space partners are hunkered down and riding out the storm at the Kennedy Space Center's Emergency Operations Center. NASA's Kennedy Space Center NASA file After the went dropped below 50 knots, workers were able to venture out and do initial damage inspections, George Diller, a public affairs officer at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, told NBC News Friday afternoon. They found the facility made it through mostly unscathed. Related: NASA Deployed This Whale-Shaped Drone to Monitor the Hurricane "It's mostly roof damage and other collateral damage like windows and doors, but no major damage to the major facilities and none to flight hardware, including the GOES-R weather satellite, Orion or the Boeing commercial crew vehicle," he said. The group of over a hundred sheltered inside the emergency center will likely move back to their respective buildings and areas by Saturday, Diller said. NASA's facilities sit on the coast and were initially forecasted to take a direct Category 5 level beating from Hurricane Matthew. The storm was eventually downgraded to Category 4 before it hit. Each facility has their own storm plan which would typically involve a limited number of people staying behind in each facility, Diller said. But NASA decided to not take any chances. There were worries a storm surge could cause flooding, however a NASA blog post this morning reported the surge has been "relatively minimal." The Damage Assessment and Recovery Team will begin a formal evaluation Saturday morning, according to NASA. "In a Category 4 or 5 storm, they don't think its safe to have people scattered around in those facilities," Diller told NBC News on Thursday as Florida braced for impact. "We have brought in food and cots we are going to put down tonight and blankets and pillows. "We are basically here until its over," he added.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close Hurricane Matthew (image from nasa.gov) Disruptions to stores, ports, plants spread ahead of Hurricane Matthew Reuters Oct 7, 2016 (…) Hurricane Matthew (image from nasa.gov) Disruptions to air travel, manufacturing, supply chains and retail stores spread on Friday as Hurricane Matthew worked its way up Florida's Atlantic Coast, leaving people and goods stranded and plants idled. After cancelling a total of 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning. Delta Air Lines said it had canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, Coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. The storm had also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Ga., and Charleston, S.C., also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores said it had closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesman said the company is using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas in the path of the storm." Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co. closed its Miami office for three to four days, and several of its Nortrax Construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it was monitoring the situation for its operations in Georgia and North Carolina. Honda Motor spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said the company was evaluating the impact of Hurricane Matthew. "At this point, the hurricane will not impact any of our manufacturing plants," he wrote. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain." Fitch Ratings estimates that if Matthew results in insured losses in excess of $10 billion, a greater proportion of losses will be borne by reinsurers as opposed to primary companies. CoreLogic, a California-based real estate data firm, estimated the storm could cause up to $189 billion in storm surge damage to residential property in Florida alone. In comparison, recovery costs from Superstorm Sandy totaled $71.3 billion in New York and New Jersey in 2012, according to estimates from their governors. Here is a summary of closures and disruptions due to the hurricane. TRANSPORTATION AIRPORTS: South Florida airports closed. Flights at Miami International Airport were resuming on Friday. FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS: Delta Airlines: About 130 Thursday, 150 Friday and 80 Saturday cancellations. United Airlines: 180 flights canceled through Saturday in Florida.

The speciality business, which is the world’s third-largest manufacturer of steel for the aerospace industry, and counts Airbus, Boeing and Rolls Royce among its customers, was put up for sale as a separate business in July. A shortlist has been reduced to two main bidders - Albion Steel, a start-up headed by Forgemasters chairman Tony Pedder, against international steel company Liberty House Group. In a letter to Mr Jha, Wentworth and Dearne MP John Healey criticised the lack of “progress” and “communication”, saying the sale appeared to be on “go slow”, with the 2,000-strong workforce left in the dark. He wrote: “We were told weeks ago that the range of potential purchasers had been reduced to two main bidders, with an indication that the one preferred buyer would be settled shortly after that. ‘Since then there has been silence from Tata, and it looks like your company is dragging its feet. It is for this reason and to help remove the continuing uncertainty that I write to ask that you end this delay, release the relevant details about your preferred bidder so that the unions, the workforce and local South Yorkshire agencies can assess the prospects for a successful sale and work with the potential new owner.” Senior officials from the trade union Community have spent the past week meeting with members at the steelworks and joined calls for Tata to come clean. Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary, said: “While so much focus is on the sale of Tata’s Strip business and the uncertainty surrounding the pension scheme, Community will not allow Speciality Steels to become the forgotten part of the steel crisis. “With over 2,000 direct employees and many thousands more in the local supply chain, this business is of huge importance to the South Yorkshire region. “When Tata announced that they wanted to sell the business, we called on them to act as a responsible seller. The continued lack of information about that process and the worry this has caused amongst their loyal workforce is highly irresponsible.” A spokesman for Tata said: “Whenever we have significant news we always seek to tell our employees first. We also communicate regularly with our employees about issues which could affect them including through briefings and newsletters. “We strive to maintain strong relationships with all our key stakeholders, including local MPs, around our UK sites. We have offered to meet John Healey MP to discuss the points in his letter. “Discussions have been ongoing with a number of interested parties regarding the sales process of our Speciality Steels business since our announcement in July. Bidders have been given the opportunity to meet with management and conduct site visits, as well as having access to information to assist in performing due diligence. “The process is ongoing and we will provide a further update at the appropriate point.” Back to the top of the page Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

HNA's Avolon group to acquire CIT Commercial Air, creating world’s third largest aircraft lessor CAPA > Aviation Analysis > HNA's Avolon group to acquire CIT Commercial Air, creating world’s third largest aircraft lessor 7-Oct-2016 Tweet © CAPA HNA Group’s remarkable spending spree continues, with the announcement that its Avolon subsidiary will acquire CIT Commercial Air, the aircraft leasing arm of CIT Group. The USD10 billion deal will create the world’s third largest lessor - and they may be more to come yet. Avolon itself was only recently acquired by HNA Group, with the USD2.7 billion purchase agreement being finalised in Jan-2016, via Bohai Capital Holdings. Avolon is now the core aircraft leasing brand for the HNA Group. Including assets from Hong Kong Aviation Capital, Bohai Capital and several smaller HNA Group leasing firms, Avolon has a fleet of nearly 250 aircraft and almost 200 more on order. Avolon will double in size with the CIT purchase The CIT Commercial Air acquisition will again double the scale of the Avolon’s business. The unified portfolio will comprise an in-service fleet of 511 aircraft, along with a managed portfolio of 50. Avolon and CIT combined have another 349 aircraft on order. This includes 282 new/next generation aircraft, including 195 Airbus commercial jets - A320neo family, A330neo and A350 - and 87 Boeing jets, comprising 59 737 MAXs and 28 787s. The entire portfolio of 910 aircraft is valued at more than USD43 billion. The combined portfolio will also expand Avolon’s existing customer base by 69 airlines in 20 countries, bringing the total to 154 customers in 61 countries. Geographically, the company’s customer base will now be split one third each across the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions, reducing risk and providing opportunities for yield improvement. Combined Avolon and CIT Commercial Air fleet metrics* Total fleet (in-service, managed + on order) 910 aircraft Fleet value USD43 billion + Owned and managed portfolio 561 aircraft Aircraft orders and commitments 349 aircraft Average fleet age (in service fleet) 4.6 years Average remaining lease period 6.7 years Customer base 154 *As at 30-Jun-2016 The transaction will be financed through a combination of Avolon’s cash, new equity contributed by Bohai and acquisition debt financing of USD8.5 billion, committed by Morgan Stanley & Co and UBS Investment Bank. The deal is expected to be completed during 1Q2017, following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Despite Avolon being just six years old, it is already a powerhouse in the aircraft leasing industry. Avolon’s management team – comprised of industry veterans from RBS - has rapidly developed the company’s international footprint across key global leasing centres. In addition to its headquarters in Dublin, the company has a strategic Asian regional head office in Hong Kong, and offices in Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore and the US. The Avolon powerhouse has even grander intentions The ambitions of Avolon CEO Dómhnal Slattery stretch higher still; and Mr Slattery has the industry’s two leading firms – AerCap and ILFC, both of which control more than 1000 aircraft – in his sights. Mr Slattery commented that the CIT acquisition is “not the summit of our ambition” but rather a “very important milestone on the journey.” Largest lessors by fleet (as at 07-Oct-2016)  Lessor Active On order Total GECAS 1630 270 1900 AerCap 1227 410 1637 SMBC 453 202 655 Air Lease Corp 278 373 651 CIT Commercial Air 380 132 512 Nordic Aviation Capital 297 194 491 ICBC Leasing 318 173 491 BOC Aviation 265 218 483 Avolon 247 185 432 BBAM 399 0 399 Aviation Capital 260 97 357 Macquarie AirFinance 223 40 263 AWAS 240 15 255 Source: CAPA Fleet Database Order and fleet portfolio discrepancies result from differing reporting times China takes on a leadership role in aircraft leasing The acquisition is also testament to the rapid expansion of Chinese players in the leasing market. Since 2007, Chinese-owned lessors have expanded their collective fleet from under 500 to more than 2200 aircraft, increasing their share of the domestic leasing market from under 10% to more than half. Even the large and rapidly growing Chinese leasing market is not enough to satisfy their ambitions, and the massive international market contains further inviting targets for JV, portfolio acquisitions or more outright purchases.

Thai AirAsia: pursuing expansion in China & India as rapid fleet & secondary base growth continues 14-Nov-2016 Thai AirAsia is planning further growth in China as it continues to expand its fleet rapidly. The LCC is planning to add five to six aircraft per annum over the next few years and allocate approximately half of the additional capacity to China, which is already by far its largest international market. India is another focus area for Thai AirAsia. A large portion of the additional aircraft will be based at secondary cities. Approximately 30% of Thai AirAsia’s fleet is now based outside Bangkok, compared to 15% two years ago, and this portion will continue to increase as the airline expands. Thai AirAsia is particularly keen to grow its base at U-Tapao near the resort of Pattaya, which opened in Sep-2015 and now has two aircraft. Thai AirAsia plans to expand the U-Tapao/Pattaya base by one or two aircraft in 2017, enabling new routes to China. Thai AirAsia is also considering the launch of international services in 2017 from Khon Kaen, which could become its seventh base and the fifth gateway for services to mainland China. China’s role in international aviation – and tourism – in 2025. The CAPA-ACTE Global Summit 12-Nov-2016 The CATA-ACTE Global Summit in Amsterdam explored some of the changes that will likely come to Chinese aviation and tourism by 2025. The viability of secondary markets has a mixed prognosis as British Airways exits Chengdu, but Vancouver airport expects sustainability from the secondary cities it is linked to – some of the first secondary routes from Chinese airlines. Partnerships and joint ventures are expanding and becoming more pressing subjects. oneworld is without a mainland Chinese partner, while China Eastern is exploring partnerships outside its SkyTeam alliance: it has a JV with Qantas and a partnership with BA, but Delta's minority equity investment gives it footing. Partnerships will influence, or be preceded by, liberalisation – including eventual China-US open skies. Although the Chinese outbound travel market is celebrated for its growth, a downturn can occur just as quickly. While visa liberalisation with Morocco has resulted in the country becoming a new popular market for Chinese visitors, terror attacks in France have reduced visitor growth not only in France but also in neighbouring countries, as visitors shun the region. © 2016 CAPA Centre for Aviation :: Contact Us :: Terms & Conditions :: Cookies & Privacy Policy :: Glossary :: Feedback :: All times are in AEST (GMT +11)

Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email this article By Marcus Weisgerber Read bio October 6, 2016 The tests in the Nevada desert come as tensions rise with Russia and the Pentagon seeks to replace its aging nuclear arsenal. A pair of U.S. Air Force B-2 bombers dropped two 700-pound faux nuclear bombs in the middle of the Nevada desert within the past few days. Now the Pentagon wants to tell you about it. Conducted “earlier this month,” according to an Oct. 6 press release, the test involved two dummy variants of the B61, a nuclear bomb that has been in the U.S. arsenal since the 1960s. One was an “earth penetrator” made to strike underground targets, the other a tactical version of the B61. Neither carried an actual warhead. “The primary objective of flight testing is to obtain reliability, accuracy, and performance data under operationally representative conditions,” said the statement from the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Energy Department arm that oversees such tests. “Such testing is part of the qualification process of current alterations and life extension programs for weapon systems.” But why now? Perhaps it has to do with tensions with Russia, which are higher than they have been in decades, and which have sparked fears of a new nuclear arms race. Earlier this week, the Russian government announced it would conduct a massive drill to prepare its citizens for nuclear war.

But it may also have to do with the Pentagon’s quest to replace its decades-old nuclear arsenal with new bombs and delivery vehicles, an endeavor whose price tag tops several hundred billion dollars. The Air Force, for one, has been making its case for new intercontinental ballistic missiles and a nuclear cruise missile. At an Air Force Association conference in the Washington suburbs last, Boeing touted its work on the Minuteman III ICBM, mounting large-scale models of the long-range missiles front and center in its sprawling display area. “[We] are used to sustaining the [current] systems in pieces,” said Larry Shafer, a Boeing executive working on the company’s work to build a new ICBM to replace the Minuteman III. “This is a unique opportunity to build an ICBM system as a whole.” There has been much debate over building new ICBMs, a project the Air Force calls the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. Former Defense Secretary William Perry has argued that it is unnecessary. The cruise missile project, called the Long-Range Standoff weapon, has also been called redundant to the improved version the B61 set to enter service in the 2020s. The Air Force put out a notice in August that it is soliciting bids from companies to build new ICBMs and a nuclear cruise missiles. At the time, Maj. Gen. Scott Jansson, commander of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center and Air Force program executive officer for strategic systems, called the Long-Range Standoff weapon “a critical element of the United States’ nuclear deterrence strategy.” Last year, the Air Force inked a deal with Northrop Grumman to build a new long-range, stealth bomber — recently named the B-21 Raider — that will eventually be equipped to carry nuclear weapons. At the same time, the Navy is preparing to buy 12 new Columbia-Class submarines that will replace the Ohio-Class, which can launch nuclear missiles. The total price tag for the all of the new nuclear weapons is projected to cost between $350 billion to $450 billion over the next two decades.

(October 6, 2016) Bo Rader The Wichita Eagle Mykel Taylor, assistant professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, talks about the ag forecast during the annual Economic Outlook Conference on Thursday morning at Century II. Bo Rader The Wichita Eagle 1 of 4 i By Dan Voorhis dvoorhis@wichitaeagle.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story How’s the Wichita economy going to do next year? The same as in 2016, but more: aircraft manufacturing kind of flat. Oil and gas and agriculture still down. But everything else up. The net: About 2,500 more jobs in the Wichita area, and 12,000 more jobs statewide. Both are less than a 1 percent increase and slower than growth nationally. That’s the takeaway from the scores of charts and three-plus hours of talking by forecasters Thursday morning at the 2016 Wichita Area Economic Outlook Conference. Many of the business leaders in the audience have lived through the slow Wichita recovery and said they understand underwhelming forecasts. “It’s fair, and it’s conservative,” said Mark Murphy, a commercial banker with Fidelity Bank. “Some sectors in the service are seeing some growth, and there’s been some growth in the aircraft sector.” “It’s about right,” said Junetta Everett, vice president with Delta Dental. “I’m optimistic. “It’s faster than Topeka, slower than Kansas City.” But for some sectors, things are moving a bit faster. “This is a booming period,” said Derek Volgamore of Sunflower Bank. “There are all sorts of business that are wanting to talk about loans with all of the low interest rates.” Corporate aircraft Richard Aboulafia, vice president of the Teal Group, said Wichita’s aircraft industry took a bigger hit in 2009 than anyone. Sales of the small- and medium-sized jets made in Wichita and sold to companies in North America never rebounded as credit remained tight and the corporate culture shifted. Instead, local airplane makers faced increased competition from Brazilian planemaker Embraer, even as the large business jet makers – such as Gulfstream – saw their sales to oil-rich countries soar. That has changed in the past two years. Plunging commodity prices have hurt the large jet makers, and Embraer seems to have stalled in its attempts to grab more market share. Aboulafia said he expects the small- and medium-jet market to remain flat or rise slightly over the next five years. That’s a clear benefit to Wichita, he said, although the health of Bombardier Learjet remains a question. Commercial aircraft Wichita also benefits from trends in commercial aircraft, Aboulafia said. It looks like Boeing and Airbus are getting close to overproducing for the market demand. But that overproduction is coming mainly in wide-bodies, such as the Boeing 777 and the Airbus A330, while demand for the narrow-body 737 will remain strong. Wichita’s Spirit AeroSystems makes 70 percent of the 737 and depends heavily on demand for it for its well-being. Aboulafia forecasts a slowing of growth followed by a slight dip in 2021, but the decline will leave Wichita largely unaffected, he said. Agriculture, energy Mykel Taylor, a professor at Kansas State University, said farmers’ incomes have plunged since 2014, which has rippled out into the rural economy. She sees accelerating job losses throughout the rural parts of the state. Declining farm land values are pushing farmers to operate very conservatively, and banks are stretching out repayments and even forcing a few to sell off equipment or land. “I think it will continue at least a couple more years,” she said. “Most will figure out a way to continue with lower costs, but some producers will not make it out.” The energy sector is in similar straits, with low prices wrecking the ability of local producers to keep operating. Caron Lawhorn, senior vice president for One Gas, the largest natural gas supplier in Kansas, said the overall energy market in the U.S. remains in flux. Part of the uncertainty is who gets elected at the federal level. That will probably determine how hard environmental controls on emissions are applied. Some of her predictions: Renewable energy will continue to grow; nuclear will remain in the mix; coal will continue to shrink; natural gas will replace much of coal in generation of electricity. Real estate The area’s real estate really looks good, but not great, said Tom Johnson, president of the Martens Cos., which distributed its annual commercial real estate forecast on Wednesday. “We’re generally pretty optimistic, overall,” said Johnson. “The economy is growing, but nothing dynamic. Jobs aren’t growing at any fast clip.” Highlights of the report: ▪ Office: A lot of activity, with sizable companies moving, but it hasn’t cut down on the overall vacancy rates. Vacancy rates will actually rise and rents will stay level. ▪ Retail: With employment and incomes growing, this sector is expanding, particularly northeast and northwest. Vacancy rates will fall and rents rise. ▪ Industrial: After years of no new construction, a lot of new industrial space was built in the last year. That will continue. Vacancy rates will fall and rents rise.

The Seattle-based tech giant’s commitment to the $110 million public-private fundraising campaign for a new computer science building is its largest local contribution yet. Amazon, despite thousands of local employees, has been criticized for its perceived lack of local philanthropy, particularly in comparison to Northwest stalwarts such as Microsoft and Boeing. (Microsoft kicked off the fundraising campaign for the new 130,000-square-foot computer science and engineering building last year, also with a $10 million donation.) This is Amazon’s third significant contribution to UW in the last four years. Last year, the company began a grant-funding program at UW, Amazon Catalyst, to support students, faculty, and staff working on “bold, risky, globally impactful projects.” And in 2012, Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos funded the creation of a pair of endowed professorships that were instrumental in recruiting sought-after professors. “The University of Washington is a world-class institution, and we are lucky to have thousands of UW graduates inventing and pioneering in Seattle—including right here at Amazon,” Bezos says in a news release. “We’re proud to support UW as they expand their computer science program, which will benefit the whole community.” As planned, the new building would make room for enough students and faculty to double the number of degrees awarded by UW in computer science and engineering each year, to more than 600. Many of those new graduates would fit in a 250-seat auditorium in the new building to be named for Amazon. The fast-growing Washington tech industry is hiring computer science graduates as fast as top-flight universities such as UW can produce them. Computer science is the top choice major for first-year students. But two out of three students interested in the major are denied entry into UW computer science due to lack of capacity. “UW graduates with skills in computer science are highly sought after, yet we are turning away excellent students who want to pursue studies in the field because we simply don’t have enough room,” UW President Ana Mari Cauce says in a news release. The university is well on its way toward raising the funding for the new building, which would complement the existing Paul G. Allen Center, built more than 12 years ago, and currently well over capacity. Counting Amazon’s $10 million, some $86 million has been committed to the building project, including $32.5 million in state funds. UW aims to begin construction in January. Meanwhile, the school is planning a broader fund-raising campaign to begin later this month. Benjamin Romano is editor of Xconomy Seattle. Email him at bromano [at] xconomy.com.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE Aerial images of the construction work on the number 1 runway at the Istanbul New Airport have been released. The construction work at the airport continues at full speed, with some 30 percent of construction work being completed so far. It is planned that the rough construction work on the main terminal building will be completed by the end of the year. Scheduled to come into service on Feb. 26, 2018, the airport will make Turkey one of the most important aviation centers in the world. İstanbul Grand Airport (İGA), which was founded to carry out the construction work and operate the airport for 25 years, shared the latest aerial images of the number 1 runway through its social media accounts. Bulky planes like Airbus A380s and Boeing 747s can easily land and take off from the 3,750-meter-long and 60-meter-wide runway. Being constructed on an area of 76.5 million square meters that is 35 kilometers from the city center, the airport consists of four stages with different designs. The first phase of the project's first stage will consist of two detached parallel runways which are 1,700 meters from each other, two attached runways and a main terminal building that is capable of harboring 90 million passengers. Following the finalization of the construction work on the second phase of the first stage, the third detached parallel runway will come into service. When all phases are completed, the airport will be able to harbor 200 million passengers a year, as well as providing flights to more than 350 destinations and serving more than 150 airline companies. The airport will provide 100,000 new jobs on its own and 1.5 million through secondary sectors. The 1.4 million-square meter Cargo City within the airport's customs zone will include 300 cargo agency offices, on which the book-building process has already begun. There are three different price categories for 300 offices varying between 13 square meters and 19 square meters.

Back to site Election 2016 Donald Trump Taxes Trump Benefits From a Broken Tax System Revelations about Donald Trump’s tax returns—and the probability that he has paid no federal income tax for decades—should spur movements to fix our broken tax system. By Chuck Collins October 6, 2016 Facebook Twitter Email Print Activists demonstrate against tax evasion and money-laundering outside the European Commission headquarters, Brussels, Belgium, April 12, 2016. (Reuters / Yves Herman) As we heard at the first presidential debate last week, Donald Trump is among the legions of wealthy investors and transnational corporations that lobby for special tax breaks and then declare they have “broken no laws.” Meanwhile, the bottom 99 percent of taxpayers and small-business owners are left to pick up the tab. Ad Policy We now have a tax system where billionaires and global corporations such as General Electric and Boeing pay little or nothing toward the infrastructure, defense, national parks, and education. From the offshore tax havens, such as those disclosed by the Panama Papers, to complex trusts, loopholes, and a myriad of energy industry and real-estate tax breaks, the current rules benefit the already-haves. The United States effectively has a two-tier federal tax system with one set of rules for the wealthy and another set for everyone else. The vast majority of people and small businesses pay taxes on wage income that is often withheld in advance. But the greater one’s income and wealth, the more opportunities there are to reclassify income and dodge taxes. Trump declared his tax minimization makes him “smart.” In reality Trump is no genius, but he is rich enough to hire professionals in the wealth defense industry. Wealthy individuals like Trump deploy an army of trust lawyers, estate tax planners, charity advisers, accountants, specialty bankers, and tax attorneys (some of whom previously worked for the IRS), to slide past tax rules and create barriers to transparency, accountability and taxation. In a three-page 1995 tax return obtained by The New York Times, Trump reported a $916 million loss on his business ventures. This net operating loss, which could be spread over the previous two years and subsequent 15 years, probably eliminated all his income-tax obligations in those years, according to David Cay Johnston, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his tax reporting at The New York Times, and prominent tax experts Edward Kleinbard of the University of Southern California and Martin J. McMahon Jr. of the University of Florida. Without more information, tax analysts cannot determine if these were legitimate losses or fabrications. Trump should disclose his complete tax returns if he has nothing to hide on this front. Regular taxpayers may see their incomes spike and plummet, but are not allowed to carry forward a bad year against 18 years of future taxes. There may be a sound policy rationale for retaining net operating losses in real-estate tax law. But it remains another striking example of a two-tier tax system where wealthy individuals structure their financial affairs to take advantage of generous tax breaks that ordinary individuals don’t have. Regular taxpayers may see their personal incomes spike and plummet over several years, but are not allowed to carry forward a bad year against future taxes, let alone 18 years.

Sign Our Petition 4 Donald Trump Won on White-Male Resentment—but Don't Confuse That With the Working Class 5 Keith Ellison Is the Leader the DNC Needs Another example of the two-tier tax system is how small businesses are forced to compete with the rampant use by transnational companies of the offshore tax system. At least 367 of the Fortune 500 corporations operate at least 10,366 subsidiaries in tax-haven countries, including the Netherlands, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands. These corporations are holding offshore an estimated $2.5 trillion in accumulated profits, according to a new study, “Offshore Shell Games,” authored by US PIRG and the Citizens for Tax Justice. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Profitable American companies using this offshore system include Apple, Citigroup, Nike, Pfizer, PepsiCo, and Goldman Sachs. If these and other companies in the study brought their profits home and paid their fair share of corporate income taxes, they would owe $717.8 billion in federal taxes. Wealthy individuals also use the offshore system alongside complicated trusts and loopholes to minimize and dodge taxes. Tax-haven use by individuals has grown 25 percent in the last five years, according to researcher Gabriel Zucman, author of The Hidden Wealth of Nations: The Scourge of Tax Havens. Zucman estimates that about 8 percent of the world’s individual assets, an estimated $7.6 trillion are stashed in tax havens, including $1.2 trillion by US citizens. The United States loses an estimated $200 billion in lost revenue from individuals and $130 billion in corporate tax avoidance. Loopholes established to subvert the federal estate and gift tax, which is paid exclusively by multimillionaires and billionaires, enable wealthy families to place hundreds of billions a year beyond the reach of taxation. Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas casino mogul and GOP mega-donor, used a complex trust system called a Granter Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT) to pass on an estimated $8 billion to his children and dodge over $2.3 billion in estate taxes. We must shut down the offshore tax haven system, using American leadership to require transparency and reporting. During the first four years of the Obama administration, the wealthiest 0.01 percent of households saw their tax rate drop from an average 20.9 percent to 17.6 percent, despite no change during that time in the tax rate set by Congress. Creative accounting enabled these millionaires and billionaires to drop their effective tax rate to half the top marginal rate at the time, 35 percent. This fall is the 30th anniversary of the 1986 tax reform, dramatically chronicled in the book Showdown at Gucci Gulch. In that year, Congress undertook a massive tax-reform process that shut down thousands of tax loopholes and lowered tax rates while maintaining the same levels of revenue. Today it is hard to imagine that ultra-wealthy individuals like Trump or the most profitable corporations that dominate our political system would have any interest in meaningful tax reform. The present tax rules, complete with complexity and opaqueness, are their creation and serve their interests. Tax reform must be central to any progressive populist platform. We must shut down the offshore tax-haven system, using American global market leadership to require greater transparency and reporting. And we should raise standards in states such as Delaware and Wyoming that serve as internal US tax havens. It is easier to incorporate a shell corporation in these states than to get a fishing license or library card. Corporations that want to do business in the United States should be required to disclose the human beings that actually own and benefit from the corporation. We should eliminate the trusts and loopholes that render the tax system voluntary for billionaires. If we tax income from wages and capital gains at the same rates, we eliminate a plethora of tax shenanigans, such as the carried-interest loophole used primary by hedge-fund managers. Powerful corporations, industry groups, and wealthy individuals stand with too many in Congress to block action and protect the status quo. But pressure is building to eliminate the two-tier US tax system. Public opinion polls indicate that large majorities want to eliminate the use of offshore tax havens, close loopholes, and require the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes. “Ultimately, this is Congress’s fault,” said Frank Clemente of Americans for Tax Reform. “We must keep the organizing pressure to force a change.” 3 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Chuck Collins Chuck Collins is a senior scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies where he co-edits Inequality.org.  His new book is Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good.

There's a famous quote at the beginning, where Reagan says to a (Democrat) higher-up that when he's done with the tax code, the guy won't recognize it. I forget who Reagan was talking to, but maybe you get the point. 1986 comes and the big "tax revision" comes. Some marginal rates are adjusted, couple of loopholes closes, and voila-tax reform! If you have this discussion now with someone on the right they will likely point to the 86 act and how it restored fairness. Of course, that is utter bullshit but they did this then, in classic Reagan style, to make it LOOK like something was actually happening. Some things did, mostly it was a huge document that by it's size concealed how nothing was done to address these key issue of how all these big entities essentially pay nothing to do business here, including an ever growing number of private citizens. I really wish people would refer to how Reagan stacked the deck on so many things, first and foremost what a crook he actually was with his own and the nation's finances. (1)(1) Doug Barr says: October 6, 2016 at 1:14 pm How can a person who edits "Inequality.org", presumably a site advocating the elimination of inequality, "require the wealthy to pay their fair share of taxes." For goodness sake Chuck, as long as their are "the wealthy" there will be inequality. The tax system isn't broken. It's the human system that creates inequality that's broken. If we fix that, economic inequality and not incidentally gender inequality and racial inequality won't be issues. http://thelastwhy.ca/poems/2012/12/13/economy.html (0)(1) Walter Pewen says: October 6, 2016 at 11:37 pm Dream on.

With the deadline for the Genes in Space competition at midnight on Friday night, youngsters where finalising their proposals for experiments that analyse the effects of low gravity on the building blocks of life. The contest – a collaboration between the UAE Space Agency, Boeing and The National – challenges pupils to come up with DNA experiments that take advantage of the unique environment in orbit. Open to pupils in grades 7 to 12 in all UAE schools, the competition’s finalists will be mentored by scientists at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Khalifa University. Winning pupils will travel to the United States to watch their experiment being launched to the International Space Station. At the ISS, the experiments will be conducted by astronauts. To ensure they met the deadline, pupils at the Emirates International School Meadows said they spent their breaks, lunches and time after school working on their ideas. "We really didn’t mind giving up our free time because it was something that interested us and allowed us to be innovative at the same time," said Anannya Sivakumar, 15, who, with two classmates, chose to research possible ways to reverse the negative effects space conditions have on astronauts’ neurons. With cosmic radiation known to accelerate neurodegeneration, leading to diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, Anannya’s group proposes to expose DNA samples to different levels of radiation aboard the ISS and put them in a hyper-gravity environment to counter the effects. "We are hoping this could be used to benefit returning astronauts and potentially people with Parkinson’s here on Earth," said the Grade 10 pupil. The other two students in her group said the contest was unique in that it gave them the flexibility to choose the topics they wished to study and the challenge to come up with something new. "Through the research we learnt about things we would have never come across," said Talia Alhammoud, 14. Preferring to focus on the food supplies for long-term space missions, Aashlesha Galla and Amr Kanan, both 14, decided to look into the possibilities of growing fresh food on the space station. "We never understood why food wasn’t grown in space and why they always transported food, which is a waste of space and energy," said Aashlesha. The pair are hoping to use DNA analysis to see the possibilities of growing oranges, potatoes and kiwis, chosen for their nutritional benefits. Amr said that regardless of whether his group was chosen as one of the finalists, he had already learnt a great deal from the work needed to enter. "I didn’t even know that plants could be grown in space," he said. Having mentored both groups, Kayleigh Moss, the school’s assistant head of science, said she would love for more of these competitions to happen. "They were having to do work that you would equate with grades above them or even at university level," she said. "It allowed them to come up with their own ideas, do the research and think critically about it." Submissions are being accepted until midnight on Friday at genesinspace.org.

Resend activation e-mail Scientific Method / Science & Exploration Blue Origin just validated the new space movement With both Musk and Bezos now flying robust launch vehicles, new space becomes real. by Eric Berger - Oct 6, 2016 3:28 pm UTC Login to bookmark 227 Blue Origin The moment of separation during Wednesday's test flight. Blue Origin The moment of separation during Wednesday's test flight. Blue Origin webcast Here's a look at the New Shepard rocket and capsule on the launch pad, shortly before launch. Blue Origin webcast A top-down view of the rocket, pre-launch. Blue Origin webcast At 45 seconds into the flight the abort motor at the bottom of the New Shepard capsule fired, to separate it from the rocket. This is a view one second later. The rocket is engulfed in flames. Blue Origin webcast At 47 seconds into flight the rocket starts to emerge from a plume of smoke. Blue Origin webcast But will it go into space? Blue Origin webcast Yes, it will. Blue Origin webcast And a few minutes later, it will land. Tory Bruno/Twitter Blue Origin didn't offer close-up views after the landing, but United Launch Alliance Chief Executive Tory Bruno (center) tweeted this photo afterward. Blue Origin webcast Here's another photo, with Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos in the center. Jeff Bezos/Twitter Here's a photo Bezos himself tweeted on Wednesday night. Note the company's motto, Gradatim Ferociter, or “step by step, ferociously,” on his boots. Safe to say the boss was pleased. On Wednesday morning Blue Origin did something no other company, or country, has ever done before. The company launched its rocket, and 45 seconds later, instructed the capsule to fire its engine and abort the flight. The rocket subsequently emerged from a curtain of flames and continued into space, blackened but not broken. Later, both the capsule and rocket safely landed in the West Texas desert. The dramatic flight of the New Shepard vehicles made for exceptional viewing, and Blue Origin obliged with a webcast from start to finish. But more than that, the dramatic minutes between launch and landing felt like something of a historic turn in human spaceflight. This particular capsule and rocket have now flown together five times in less than 11 months and passed a succession of ever more rigorous tests. After flying New Shepard twice in late 2015 and early 2016 on nominal missions, the company began pushing the envelope. In April, it held off restarting the rocket’s BE-3 engine until just 3,600 feet above the ground, six seconds before landing. The engine responded by restarting and ramping up quickly. Two months later, the company intentionally had one of the capsule’s three parachutes fail during landing, and it still made a safe touchdown. And on Wednesday, of course, the company conducted its most dramatic test of all, an in-flight abort. After all of this the spacecraft and rocket remain intact, perhaps even ready to fly again. But enough is enough: these historic vehicles will now go to museums, perhaps to the Smithsonian. This seems appropriate given that no other launch system has survived such a succession of in-flight tests. But far more significant than their historical value is what New Shepard’s feats mean for the future of spaceflight, because it looks like Blue Origin just validated the new space movement. New space For the longest time new space has been more of a philosophy than a physical reality. Organizations such as the Space Frontier Foundation have been extolling the virtues of Solar System settlement and operating independent of bureaucratic government programs since the 1980s. There were lots of great ideas and some money, but generally very little hardware actually flew in space. A decade ago, when Elon Musk entered the space business, things began to change. With equal measures of stubbornness, arrogance, and single-minded determination, Musk flew his Falcon 1, and then Falcon 9 rockets. He broke down the barriers. Yes, his company received considerable amounts of federal money, but the purpose wasn’t just to secure the next big NASA contract. Rather he sought to bootstrap the federal money toward a vision of colonization of space, beginning with Mars. This vision contrasts with that of the traditional aerospace contractors—Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and others—which generally wait for NASA to say what it wants, and then the contractors fight for those federal dollars. They will deliver a quality product, certainly, but at a high cost and generally without a sense of urgency. For new space, the vision must exist independent of government programs, beyond the NASA model of exploring with a few professional astronauts. Costs must fall, and space must become accessible for many, not a few. Yet as much as Musk has shaken up the global launch industry, one man—or one company—does not make a movement. SpaceX has now had two accidents with its Falcon 9 rocket. With one or two more it is possible to conceive of SpaceX going out of business. So while the new space movement gained credibility from Elon Musk, its position was not secure. Blue changes everything Now Blue Origin seems to have changed all that. With its dramatic flight tests, the company has proven its basic design works well. Over the next couple of years, Blue Origin intends to scale the suborbital New Shepard design into an orbital rocket, New Glenn, and larger rockets still. Significantly, the sooty rocket that landed in West Texas proves that Blue Origin has an incredibly robust design. The company has been largely quiet until now, but founder Jeff Bezos could afford to act slowly and stealthily—space wasn’t his primary business, merely a passion. Now that the company has had some success, Bezos is warming to sharing his baby with the public. This heretofore silent approach belies the fact that Bezos is a true believer in new space. Not only does he want to see millions of people living in space, he operates independently of the US government and has even openly spurned NASA’s approach. Last November, after the initial successful landing of the New Shepard capsule, I asked him about his philosophy toward total reusability in contrast to NASA’s approach of continuing to build large, expendable rockets just like during the Apollo era. He seemed almost incredulous in his response. “The holy grail of rocketry is full reusability,” Bezos replied. He then spoke of Wernher von Braun, the German rocket scientist who built the deadly V-2 rocket for Hitler before defecting to the United States at the end of World War II. Later, von Braun would design the Saturn V rocket that blasted Neil and Buzz to the Moon. The German would be shocked, Bezos said, that NASA is still flying essentially the same hardware he designed in the 1960s. “If von Braun came back from the dead and looked around at our current fleet of rockets he would recognize them all,” Bezos said. “He’d say ‘Oh, you’re still throwing them in the ocean. I thought by now you’d be reusing them.’” This is essentially the core new space philosophy—there must be a better way. Nearly three decades after its founding, the Space Frontier Foundation remains committed to the principles of new space. One of the organization's co-founders, James Muncy, said Blue Origin’s accomplishments during the last 11 months are truly significant. “Blue Origin shows that new space is not just about one guy or one company,” Muncy said. “We’re an industry.  And we’re growing in capability and breadth and support every day.” The experience, revealed The commentators for Blue Origin’s webcast found themselves with some extra time to kill Wednesday morning when an unexplained hold occurred about two minutes before the initial launch time. Ariane Cornell, who works for the company’s strategy and business development team, used that time to provide some details about the experience “astronauts” will have when they begin flying Blue Origin’s suborbital flights, possibly as early as 2018. Two days before the flight, participants would fly into Van Horn, Texas, population 1,930. After meeting the Blue Origin team and their crew mates, they would go to bed. The day before flight would involve “intense training,” Cornell said, including ingress and egress, emergency exercises, as well as “zero-G etiquette,” so that passengers aren’t flailing around too much to enjoy the flight. Launch day would begin early, and the flight itself would last 11 minutes, including four minutes of weightlessness in space, and 5 Gs during the descent. For the first time, the company also appeared to confirm that its New Glenn rocket would offer orbital space tourism opportunities in addition to delivering satellites and other payloads into space. “We’re going to make sure that all astronauts who fly on New Shepard are going to get first access to tickets on New Glenn, which is going to be our orbital vehicle, which we hope to have flying by the end of this decade,” Cornell said. That would be some experience indeed. Wednesday morning’s launch was powered by a single BE-3 engine, with 110,000 pounds of thrust. The much, much larger New Glenn rocket will have seven BE-4 engines, each with a thrust of 550,000 pounds. This next-generation rocket, therefore, would have 35 times the thrust of the New Shepard vehicle that launched this week. If such is the future of new space, it is a bright one indeed.

Today, the research and advisory firm released its Information Industry Outlook 2017 report, with the key theme All Data, Nothing But Data. For the year ahead, the report highlights data monetization as the number-one growth opportunity for information, media, technology, and any enterprise — from GE to Boeing, Ford to Monsanto — in the business of information. First shared during Outsell's 10th Anniversary Signature Event, an off-the-record event for C-level executives, the report highlights 10 important industry trends, with data front and center. "Data has become the big enabler, and the chief data officer (CDO) and emerging chief analytics officer have become the money makers. Savviness in developing applications and analytics capabilities that take advantage of data is a differentiator among peer companies, and a leading indicator for overall business performance," said Anthea Stratigos, co-founder and CEO, Outsell. From CivicScience, which produces a syndicated "poll of the day," to Kensho Technologies, an unstructured data analytics provider in financial services, to Numisight, which helps identify anomalies in a blockchain, "rising stars" are already harnessing this trend and disrupting a broad range of industries. By combining big data with artificial intelligence, the internet of things, machine learning, and robotics, whole verticals like food/agriculture are reinventing themselves and so too are companies in the Fortune 500. Today, everyone is a data provider, user, maker. Outsell's research and Outlook focuses on this now far-reaching phenomenon. "Successful data-driven businesses reflect a transition from a product-oriented strategy to a platform strategy. At their core, platforms are data collection mechanisms with strong design that attracts participants, their customers, and enables desired interactions, encouraging ever-more-powerful network effects," said Leigh Watson Healy, Chief Analyst, Outsell. Among other trends highlighted in the report: Innovation demands de-siloing the data. The value is in knitting together all searchable and previously dark data with new service models. Advertising might survive by getting smarter, including behavioral targeting through demographic, credit/financial, and social media data, as well as information on personal habits. This will add to the increasing concerns about cybersecurity seen across every sector, which will make specialized cybersecurity firms super-hot M&A targets. The platform model is rising. The move from a product-oriented strategy towards a platform strategy provides opportunities for industry providers to create platforms or ride on third-party platforms. Talent trends are changing. With data now a foundational element of product strategy, chief data officers are becoming chief analytics officers and expanding from the back office of "risk management" towards roles focused on new business and product development. Outsell's report also identifies disruptive companies to watch, essential actions for increasing revenues in today's data-driven world, and the information industry segments that will experience the strongest growth next year. The analysis is based on Outsell's tracking of over 9,000 firms, along with their customers and advertisers. For a complimentary copy, please go to: https://www.outsellinc.com/search/d7entity/108212 In recognition of the fundamental shift that data, big and small, is driving, Outsell will also produce its first annual DataMoney Conference February 1-2, 2017 in New York City.

With the approval of the Civil Aviation Department, the 60-minute flight – CX8747 – will include a Victoria Harbour flyover, giving Hong Kong one final opportunity to bid farewell to Cathay Pacific’s “Queen of the Skies”. Some 300 of the airline’s staff, many of whom have a long attachment to the 747, have made a minimum donation of HK$747 to secure their seats onboard the historic flight.  With Cathay Pacific absorbing the flight’s operating costs, all funds raised will benefit the Hong Kong Breast Cancer Foundation. The flight is planned to take-off from Hong Kong International Airport at 10.30 am, subject to airport traffic and weather conditions, and will initially head east over Victoria Harbour, passing the former Kai Tak Airport and out over the Lei Yue Mun Gap. The best vantage points for members of the public to watch the farewell flight include the Peak, Lion Rock, Kennedy Town promenade, West Kowloon Cultural District, the harbour facing sides of ICC and IFC, Tsim Sha Tsui promenade, Tamar, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal, Golden Bauhinia Square, MegaBox and the Tsing Ma Bridge Observation Deck. Members of the public are invited to share their photos of the special flight on social media using #Cathay747. Additionally, fans who post their photos on the official Cathay Pacific Facebook page will stand the chance to win a 747-8F aircraft model, autographed by the late Joe Sutter, Boeing’s chief engineer who will forever be remembered as the “Father of the 747”. The 747 first entered Cathay Pacific’s passenger fleet in 1979 and made an immediate impact. Able to carry far greater numbers of people for far greater distances than any other aircraft of its era, the 747 helped transform the company from being a primarily regional carrier into the truly global airline it is today.  The 747 also played a significant role in growing Hong Kong into an international aviation hub.

The final Boeing 777 – one of a number serving South Africa – has now been equipped and is back in service. It marks a new milestone for the airline with flights from Accra, Dakar, Lagos and Johannesburg– offering on-demand Wi-Fi throughout the aircraft. “We know that Wi-Fi is an important part of the travel experience, especially for those flying for business,” said Jimmy Eichelgruen, Delta’s Sales Director for Africa, the Middle East and India. “With Wi-Fi available in every cabin, all our customers can stay in touch with events on the ground throughout their journey. We hope our customers will enjoy this enhanced experience the next time they fly Delta.” Delta’s Wi-Fi is powered by high-speed, Ku-Band satellite technology and provided by Gogo.

Customers also enjoy free access to the airline’s on-demand entertainment system Delta Studio, which includes in-flight streaming to view movies and TV shows on mobile devices. Delta began installing Wi-Fi on U.S. domestic mainline aircraft in 2008. With international satellite-based Wi-Fi now installed on Delta’s wide-body fleet comprising Boeing 767s, 747s, 777s Airbus A330 and transoceanic Boeing 757s, the airline operates the world’s largest Wi-Fi equipped fleet, giving customers more options to stay connected in-flight.

The airline has taken a hit, but still plans to expand. The price of Brexit is writ large for easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ). Perhaps it should even be inscribed on the side of the orange-liveried Airbus passenger planes that depart its base at Luton airport every few minutes. For the fall in the pound has cost the budget airline £35mln in “adverse exchange rate movements” since June 23, bringing the currency-related impact on results to £90mln in the year ended September. The fall in the fuel bill by up £80mln caused by lower oil prices acted as something of a counterweight. That said, EasyJet is guiding the market that it expects pre-tax profits in the order of £490-£495mln, well down on the £686mln it posted a year earlier. According to brokers, the numbers were below City consensus. The figures were contained in easyJet’s trading update following the close of its financial year. Looking ahead, the carrier told investors it has an as an opportunity “to build and strengthen its strategic position for the long term”. Capacity is expected to grow by around 8% in new the financial and around 45% of seats are now sold for the first quarter. The total expected foreign exchange cost for the company for the 12 months just started is put at £90mln. “The current environment is tough for all airlines, but history shows that at times like this the strongest airlines become stronger,” said chief executive Carolyn McCall. “That is why we will continue to invest for the long term success of the business, establishing even stronger market positions, delivering excellent customer service and establishing new revenue opportunities for the future."

Today, the research and advisory firm released its Information Industry Outlook 2017 report, with the key theme All Data, Nothing But Data. For the year ahead, the report highlights data monetization as the number-one growth opportunity for information, media, technology, and any enterprise - from GE to Boeing, Ford to Monsanto - in the business of information. First shared during Outsell's 10th Anniversary Signature Event, an off-the-record event for C-level executives, the report highlights 10 important industry trends, with data front and center. "Data has become the big enabler, and the chief data officer (CDO) and emerging chief analytics officer have become the money makers. Savviness in developing applications and analytics capabilities that take advantage of data is a differentiator among peer companies, and a leading indicator for overall business performance," said Anthea Stratigos, co-founder and CEO, Outsell. From CivicScience, which produces a syndicated "poll of the day," to Kensho Technologies, an unstructured data analytics provider in financial services, to Numisight, which helps identify anomalies in a blockchain, "rising stars" are already harnessing this trend and disrupting a broad range of industries. By combining big data with artificial intelligence, the internet of things, machine learning, and robotics, whole verticals like food/agriculture are reinventing themselves and so too are companies in the Fortune 500. Today, everyone is a data provider, user, maker. Outsell's research and Outlook focuses on this now far-reaching phenomenon. "Successful data-driven businesses reflect a transition from a product-oriented strategy to a platform strategy. At their core, platforms are data collection mechanisms with strong design that attracts participants, their customers, and enables desired interactions, encouraging ever-more-powerful network effects," said Leigh Watson Healy, Chief Analyst, Outsell. Among other trends highlighted in the report: Innovation demands de-siloing the data. The value is in knitting together all searchable and previously dark data with new service models. Advertising might survive by getting smarter, including behavioral targeting through demographic, credit/financial, and social media data, as well as information on personal habits. This will add to the increasing concerns about cybersecurity seen across every sector, which will make specialized cybersecurity firms super-hot M&A targets. The platform model is rising. The move from a product-oriented strategy towards a platform strategy provides opportunities for industry providers to create platforms or ride on third-party platforms. Talent trends are changing. With data now a foundational element of product strategy, chief data officers are becoming chief analytics officers and expanding from the back office of "risk management" towards roles focused on new business and product development. Outsell's report also identifies disruptive companies to watch, essential actions for increasing revenues in today's data-driven world, and the information industry segments that will experience the strongest growth next year. The analysis is based on Outsell's tracking of over 9,000 firms, along with their customers and advertisers. For a complimentary copy, please go to: https://www.outsellinc.com/search/d7entity/108212 In recognition of the fundamental shift that data, big and small, is driving, Outsell will also produce its first annual DataMoney Conference February 1-2, 2017 in New York City.

The study reiterates what other reports have found about low levels of college attainment in this state, and underscores the degree to which Washington students will miss out on the coming wave of lucrative job openings in the next five years. According to the study, commissioned by the Roundtable, about 69 percent of high-school students from 2006 have no degree, not even a certificate from a community college or a professional license. More than 20 percent of those students are high-school dropouts. Roundtable President Steve Mullin called the results alarming. And his organization — a public-policy group of business leaders — has set a goal: By 2030, it wants to more than double the percentage of students who have a college degree or other type of credential by age 26. If that happens, he said, not only would more students have better jobs, everyone in Washington would benefit from a reduction in the state’s unemployment and poverty rates. In the next five years, the Roundtable report says, 740,000 jobs will open in Washington — a number three times higher than the projected growth rate for the U.S. economy. Well over half those jobs will require a postsecondary credential — a college degree, a certificate or apprenticeship. About 300,000 of those jobs will be new positions, but most — 58 percent — will be jobs open because of retirements and people leaving the state. It includes baby-boom Boeing machinists and engineers, who will retire by the tens of thousands in the coming years. About 35 percent of the openings will be what the report labels “career jobs,” or jobs with a salary range of $60,000 to $100,000. More than 90 percent of those workers will need a credential — a bachelor’s degree or other advanced training. An additional 45 percent of the openings will be “pathway jobs,” or jobs that pay about $30,000 to $45,000 and offer a path to better pay. About two-thirds of job hopefuls for those positions will need a college degree or credential. Only about 20 percent of the job openings, labeled “entry level” by the report and paying $20,000 to $30,000 a year, will call for the low level of education most Washington students are achieving today. State’s skills gap The state’s fastest-growing, highest-paying companies will continue to need to go beyond Washington to find employees with the skills and training they need to fill jobs, because there are just too many jobs for the number of workers living here. The Roundtable analysts don’t consider that a bad thing; it makes the workforce more diverse. But it does mean Washington kids aren’t getting enough education to compete for many of the good job openings, Mullin said. The skills gap goes beyond the much-talked-about need for software engineers at the area’s tech giants, he said. The state also needs nurses, machinists, store managers, engineers, electrical line workers, construction workers, cybersecurity analysts – a long list of professions that pay at least $50,000 a year, and many far more. A few caveats: The report, written by the Boston Consulting Group, doesn’t cover private schools, which graduated about 6 percent of the approximately 67,000 students in the class of 2016, according to the Western Interstate Higher Education Commission. The report is based on work by the Washington State Education Research and Data Center, which estimates that about 42 percent of the students who graduated in 2006 earned a postsecondary credential by 2013. However, that report didn’t take into account students who dropped out of high school; about 25 percent of the class of 2006 dropped out of school and never graduated. (The dropout rate has since gone down, to 20 percent.) And the report doesn’t look beyond seven years after graduation, even though some studies suggest that Washington students in their mid-20s do better than the national average when it comes to returning to community college, and using it as a launchpad to a four-year degree. The study’s release comes a few months before the Legislature will begin debating its biennial budget and will decide how much more it needs to invest in K-12 education to settle the McCleary school-funding case. “Our hope for this session is that new resources get focused where they’re most needed,” particularly to chronically underperforming schools, Mullin said. The Roundtable also wants more money going to early learning, especially for low-income families. The policy group also wants to continue to see strong funding of the state’s two- and four-year colleges, and has called for increased teacher effectiveness, expanded STEM education, and career and college readiness for all students. It also supports public charter schools. Later this year, the Roundtable will release a second report with more specific recommendations.

The NAE will facilitate the operations of Boeing P8I aircraft to enhance the surveillance of area around the western coast and the strategically critical Lakshadweep and Minicoy Islands. It will also enable timely assistance to neighbouring countries which share friendly ties with India. The naval air enclave will be utilised to accommodate and operate aircraft which cannot be operated from INS Garuda due to inadequate runway length. Speaking on the occasion, Admiral Lanba said that the air enclave revived the bond between the Navy and civil operators which had come to a halt with the shifting of civil air operations to CIAL. The air station at Garuda is limited in its operations due to space restrictions, bird menace due to the very dense human habitation in vicinity and growing obstructions around the airfield. The establishment of CIAL offered a unique opportunity to the armed forces to utilise its facilities to meet their growing needs. The function was attended by Vice Admiral A.R. Karve, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Southern Naval Command; Rear Admiral R.B. Pandit, Chief of Staff, SNC; Shabeer A.M., executive director, CIAL; Sony Chacko, chief financial officer; K.P. Thankachan, general manager; R.F. Dçruz, airport director; besides other service and civilian dignitaries.

ROS LBoard 1 Labuan-Sabah bridge will interest China, Japan, says economist Robin Augustin Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US ‘Conjectures’ ruin MH370 book, says veteran Joe Fernandez | October 6, 2016 The only saving grace in the book, if at all, was the "decompression" theory, as there are too many conjectures. KUALA LUMPUR: A local aviation industry veteran cautions against much being made of the book, “The Crash Detectives” by Christine Negroni on missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. The veteran who spoke on condition of anonymity said the only saving grace in the book, if at all, was the “decompression” theory. “There are too many conjectures in the book,” he said. The way forward on MH370, he suggested, was to focus on the engineering records and carry out a forensic audit. “The book has also hinted in this direction.” Focus on what kind of aircraft flew as MH370, he said. Patently, the design was 20 years old and had flaws. Boeing advised reinforcing the avionics bay section. He reckons this may not have been done but declines to hazard a guess why. Apparently, that explains decompression. The book should have focused on probabilities, he added, and eliminated them based on evidence, “not conjectures”. He conceded the “decompression” theory was one probability, the only other one being something happening in the cockpit between the pilots. “It’s a Sherlock Holmes situation where every probability must be placed on the table.” When it comes to probabilities, he explained, nothing must be disregarded “no matter how bizarre or far-fetched. In the case of the missing plane, he continued, the aviation industry was in consensus the decompression theory only comes in if a fight between the two pilots can be ruled out. “Only the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) — a black box — can tell us what happened in the cockpit,” said the veteran. “The flight data recorder (FDR) is the other black box in the cockpit.” If the CVR rules out a fight between the two pilots, he said, “we can explore the decompression theory but not in the manner the author suggested”. The veteran, based on the consensus in the aviation industry, said it would be inappropriate to blame the First Officer for not donning the oxygen mask first and not being quick enough at it. “Tests in the decompression simulator room have proven that 80 per cent of pilots don’t don the oxygen mask first,” he recalled. “They are always doing something else first in the cockpit during an emergency.” Watch the video below for Negroni’s theory.

Hurricane Matthew stalls planes, plants, ports and trains Reuters 10/7/2016 Nick Carey and Meredith Davis © Wilfredo Lee/AP There are no lines to board flights at the Palm Beach International airport after flights in and out were cancelled in the afternoon as Hurricane Matthew advances, Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016, in West Palm Beach, Fla. Disruptions to air travel, manufacturing, supply chains and retail stores spread on Friday as Hurricane Matthew worked its way up Florida's Atlantic coast, leaving people and goods stranded and plants idled. After canceling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Quotes in the article Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 111.95 +1.09 +0.98% American Airlines Group Inc AAL ▲ 42.93 +0.63 +1.49% Delta Air Lines Inc DAL ▲ 46.38 +0.43 +0.94% Southwest Airlines Co LUV ▲ 43.84 +0.20 +0.46% Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines said it had canceled 270 flight from Wednesday through Saturday. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Toyota Motor Corp like several other automakers, holds new vehicles at ports prior to final shipment to dealerships. A Toyota spokesman said Friday the company moved most of its vehicles parked at the port in Jacksonville inland ahead of the storm. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it had also moved some vehicles from the port prior to its closure and BMW accelerated deliveries inland. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew, as did office supply retailer Staples Inc and Nike Inc, which closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company was monitoring the situation at its Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and should reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc temporarily shuttered facilities and offices in both Florida and South Carolina. Vulcan Materials Co closed facilities in the Bahamas and Miami, and all along the East Coast, spokesman Jimmy Fleming said. Vulcan's crushed stone is mixed with materials like concrete, cement and asphalt to repair roads and buildings. "We'll need to reopen (when possible) because we supply material to fix things," Fleming said. Honda Motor Co Ltd said Hurricane Matthew would not impact any of its manufacturing plants. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

No, US politics is not complex for us EDITORIAL: Humility and dedication are hallmarks of a good leader MONTREAL – As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, demand for air travel is growing, with more than 30,000 new large aircraft expected to take to the skies in the next few years. But if we are to sustain growth in air travel without aggravating global warming, we must quickly reduce aviation-related CO2 emissions, which are substantial and not covered by the Paris climate agreement that more than 190 countries agreed to last December. Christiana Figueres. Laurence Tubiana. Fortunately, now is the perfect time to decouple aviation emissions from air-travel growth. Representatives from 191 countries convened in Montreal this week for the 39th Session of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization; after decades of wrangling, they have agreed to an aviation-specific climate agreement. The new ICAO framework aims for “carbon-neutral growth” in international aviation from 2020 onward, and has as its centerpiece a global market-based measure (GMBM) to help airlines affordably cap their net emissions at 2020 levels. When implemented, it will be the first carbon-emissions cap on a global industry that does not noticeably increase costs for consumers. And airlines will purchase emissions reductions from other economic sectors, thus funneling billions of dollars into low-carbon development around the world. For the first six years, the new framework will apply only to flights between countries that have voluntarily adopted it, which means that the ICAO will have to encourage adequate participation for the program to be effective. This opt-in approach has some critics, but whether a program is categorized as “voluntary” or “mandatory” is beside the point, because international accords generally apply only to the sovereign countries that have decided to join them. Some 64 countries have already signaled their willingness to sign on to the ICAO agreement, and together they account for nearly 80% of expected growth in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. That isn’t 100%, but it’s a great start, and we can expect more countries to join when they see others reaping the benefits of low-carbon development. The airlines themselves will welcome a coherent global framework that establishes clear and predictable compliance metrics, rather than a regulatory patchwork that differs from country to country and complicates international operations. To minimize compliance costs – and because environmental sustainability is now a key competitive marker for customers and investors alike – airlines will likely encourage the countries where they do business to participate in the ICAO program. The new agreement provides an enormous opportunity to prevent the emission of 2.5 billion tons of CO2 in the first 15 years – the equivalent of taking roughly 35 million cars off the road every year the program is in force. The agreement will also spur major manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, and Embraer – which are already investing in quieter, more fuel-efficient aircraft and efficiency improvements for existing models – to develop cleaner technologies that will allow them to purchase fewer emissions offsets. However, the framework decided in Montreal is not complete, and crucial details need to be worked out quickly so that airlines can begin to plan how they will meet the new environmental targets. Developed countries have already offered to help implement the GMBM, which, it is hoped, will pave the way for investments in emerging economies that are becoming new aviation powerhouses. If the countries can leapfrog over old technologies, they can become new leaders in carbon-smart flying. They should seize the opportunity before them and join the ICAO framework so that their manufacturers have a clear and predictable path forward. At the Paris climate talks last year, we witnessed the power of global collective action to address climate change. No fewer than 187 countries – large and small, developed and developing – announced emissions-reduction targets in the months before the conference, which created the momentum to reach a landmark accord. With the Paris climate agreement on track to enter into force in the coming months – more rapidly than anyone ever thought possible – we still have that momentum. The ICAO agreement is the next wave in the international battle against climate change. Together, the two agreements will boost our chances of delivering environmentally sustainable economic growth. By cleaning up our carbon footprint now, future generations of air travelers from all countries will be able to look out their window onto a healthy planet. Christiana Figueres was Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from 2010 to 2016. Laurence Tubiana, the French Ambassador for Climate Change and Special Representative for the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, is founder of the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI) in Paris and Professor and Director at the Sustainable Development Center at Sciences Po.

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines said it had canceled 270 flight from Wednesday through Saturday. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Toyota Motor Corp like several other automakers, holds new vehicles at ports prior to final shipment to dealerships. A Toyota spokesman said Friday the company moved most of its vehicles parked at the port in Jacksonville inland ahead of the storm. Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it had also moved some vehicles from the port prior to its closure and BMW accelerated deliveries inland. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew, as did office supply retailer Staples Inc and Nike Inc, which closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company was monitoring the situation at its Georgia and North Carolina facilities. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and should reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Mining and construction equipment maker Caterpillar Inc temporarily shuttered facilities and offices in both Florida and South Carolina. Vulcan Materials Co closed facilities in the Bahamas and Miami, and all along the East Coast, spokesman Jimmy Fleming said. Vulcan's crushed stone is mixed with materials like concrete, cement and asphalt to repair roads and buildings. "We'll need to reopen (when possible) because we supply material to fix things," Fleming said. Honda Motor Co Ltd said Hurricane Matthew would not impact any of its manufacturing plants. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said.

This comes a month after US Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter approved the Army’s proposed multiyear procurement plan. Col. Jeffrey Hager, the Apache program manager, told Inside Defense that a signed agreement can be expected by early 2017. The Senate and House versions of the fiscal 2017 National Defense Authorization Act have both been approved, but concerns over the cost efficiency of production and procurement programs has kept any bill from being passed. The director of defense pricing for the Pentagon's acquisition directorate, Shay Assad, approved the Apache proposal. Assad told Politico in April that his years spent as an executive at Raytheon showed him how companies often overpay for multi-year defense contracts. As a result, Assad claims that he requires contractors to justify their prices, in an attempt to garner the most savings.  © AP Photo/ BAE Systems BAE Wins $49Mln Contract to Maintain US Main ICBM Radar Defense System Pentagon spokesperson Mark Wright vouched for the effectiveness of Assad’s tactics, citing the latter’s leadership on negotiations for the acquisition of the F/A-18 fighter jet "that returned in excess of $500M to the taxpayers," according to Wright. Assad also led talks on the multi-year deal for Boeing’s C-17 Globemaster. According to a fact sheet released by the House Armed Services Committee (HASC), if the Apache deal is approved it could potentially yield some $1 billion in savings over five years.  © Flickr/ The U.S. Army Alabama Firm Wins $128Mln US Missile Defense Management Contract The HASC recently voted for an additional $583 billion defense budget, which includes 25,000 reservists, 27,000 additional active-duty troops, an increase in the Navy’s shipbuilding budget, and the acquisition of new aircraft for the Navy. Defense News quotes US House Representative Adam Smith as saying, "This bill is based on a lot of hope in what will happen next April or May…While this is a good bill, it spends more than we have, and this is a problem we will have to wrestle with in this markup, on the floor and once we get to conference." ...

After cancelling 590 flights on Thursday, American Airlines Group Inc canceled 580 on Friday and 160 on Saturday. A spokesman said flights had resumed in Miami on Friday morning as the storm moved north. Delta Air Lines Inc canceled 240 flights for Friday, and roughly 80 for Saturday for northeastern Florida, coastal Georgia and South Carolina. Southwest Airlines Co canceled 130 flights for Friday and 95 for Saturday. United Airlines raised its total number of cancellations for Wednesday through Saturday to 270 from 180. Many of the additional cancellations affect Georgia and South Carolina. The storm also caused railroads and retailers to suspend or curtail operations. Ports in Florida and up the coast, including Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, also suspended operations. Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed a number of stores ahead of Hurricane Matthew. A spokesperson said the company was using its experience of past disasters to anticipate what goods may be in greater demand after the storm passes. Office supply retailer Staples Inc said it had closed stores in line with emergency evacuation guidelines. Nike Inc has closed facilities in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina and encouraged "employees to follow the guidance of state and local officials to evacuate areas." Online retailer Amazon said it was working closely with its employees to ensure their safety and get donations of supplies to areas hit by the storm. Employee-owned supermarket chain Publix said stores in southern Florida had reopened after the hurricane passed. Manufacturers were also affected. Deere & Co closed its Miami, Florida, office for three to four days and several of its Nortrax construction equipment dealerships around the state. "We basically want people to go home and take care of their own personal property," spokesman Ken Golden said. "For their safety we would rather have them doing whatever the government disaster officials are saying." Boeing Co suspended production on Wednesday at its South Carolina plant in North Charleston, and in Florida, including Miami, the Kennedy Space Center, Jacksonville and Orlando. The company said it was monitoring the situation for its operations in Georgia and North Carolina. Auto supplier WABCO Holdings Inc halted production in Charleston, South Charleston and said that "weather permitting," work would resume on Monday, Oct. 10. Business jet aircraft maker Gulfstream, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, said its plants in Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, and West Palm Beach, Florida, were closed and were tentatively slated to reopen on Monday. Engine maker Cummins Inc has closed four plants in Florida, one in Georgia and another in South Carolina. Honda Motor Co Ltd, which has a plant in South Carolina, is evaluating the impact of Hurricane Matthew. "At this point, the hurricane will not impact any of our manufacturing plants," spokesman Chris Abbruzzese said. "We are, however, monitoring any potential impacts to our supply chain."
