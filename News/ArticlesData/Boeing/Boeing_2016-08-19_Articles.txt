PM Modi's auctioned suit enters Guinness Book of World Records Mob justice: 2 goons thrashed to death in Bihar TAL to serve Boeing and Airbus from MihanShishir Arya | TNN | Aug 21, 2016, 04.47 AM IST NAGPUR: Tata Group's TAL Manufacturing Solutions, which started off as a unit to make floor beams for Boeing Dreamliners in Mihan, inaugurated a facility for making spares to be used in Airbus' aircraft, on Saturday. The event coincided with a function to deliver the 5000th floor beam to Boeing. This makes TAL probably the only unit which is catering to both Boeing and Airbus, the two Aviation giants and also rivals, under a single roof. The supply to Airbus will be through Switzerland-based Ruag Aviation, a tier one supplier to the aircraft maker. The ceremony was attended by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and union minister for surface transport as well as Member of Parliament (MP) from Nagpur, Nitin Gadkari. TAL, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors, eyes to take its turnover to Rs1,000 crore in the next five years as against the current Rs200 crore. A chunk of the business is expected from the Mihan plant. "There are plans to start another workshop for making generic components for original equipment makers (OEMs) in the coming two years," said TAL's chief executive officer Rajesh Khatri. For Ruag, the company will be making sheet metals, machine parts and assemblies. TAL has evolved in this sector with time. "The additional workshop, which has been planned two years from now, is likely to be used for making advanced components," said Khatri. The TAL chief sees a major opportunity in the sector. If the global average is 4%, in India aviation sector has seen a growth of 22%. TAL will have also have an early mover advantage. So far the company has pumped in Rs400 crore which includes Rs300 crore for the floor beam unit. "The new workshop is likely to have an investment of another Rs100 crore. Better air connectivity can add to the company's advantage as it will lead to faster movement of components, many of which have to be brought under controlled temperature," he said, adding, "It is hoped Mihan emerging as a cargo hub will lead to it." Dinesh Keskar, the president of Boeing India, said recent forecast on Indian aviation sector released by the company says that the country will need 1850 new aircraft worth $265 billion in the next 20 years. The purchase of Boeing 787s has also led to India add new routes. Gadkari urged Boeing to develop sea planes which he said can make transportation much easier. He recalled the time when the project was being wooed to Mihan and there were issues over allotment of land to TAL. "It was in 2007, and the site where TAL's unit stands now was a farm with a standing crop of soyabean. The owner was reluctant to leave but was finally convinced. A private businessman having invested in Mihan also gave him Rs20 lakh from his pocket," he said. Jai Vidarbha, says Keskar An emotional Dinesh Keskar ended his speech with Jai Vidarbha, Jai Maharashtra and Jai Hind. The president of Boeing India, who hails from Amravati, graduated in engineering at the erstwhile VRCE (now VNIT) in the city. After starting in English, Keskar ended his speech in Marathi. He said: "I could repay what Vidarbha my homeland gave me by bringing the Air India MRO and TAL to Nagpur. It was here that I got the opportunity to get educated enough to work in the US and achieve so much." Interestingly, the Jai Vidarbha comment came in the presence of CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari. The BJP, which fought the last elections on the plank of Vidarbha statehood, is today not making any move for its creation. Keskar's comment hardly raised any eyebrows at the venue. Nagpur as hub for aerospace biz CM Devendra Fadnavis said Nagpur is fast emerging as a hub for aerospace industry. The Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) is in advanced talks with one more company to set up an aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) depot in Mihan-SEZ. Later, sources said it was the Gurgaon-based Airworks which is likely take up 20 acres of land. "The Air India MRO built by Boeing is already functional, but initially business was not much. It was originally planned to be run by Boeing itself. But due to certain circumstances it was handed over to Air India. I had urged that Boeing should take it back. Though this could not happen so far, Dinesh Keskar has ensured that business goes up. Now Spice Jet will be getting its aircraft overhauled at the Air India MRO," said Fadnavis.

Astronaut Jeff Williams is pictured below the docking port. Image: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now. Two spacewalkers attached a new docking port to the International Space Station Friday, clearing the way for U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to begin test flights to the lab complex next year. It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships. A second IDA is expected to be attached in 2018. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” radioed station commander Jeff Williams, who worked with astronaut Kate Rubins to attach and outfit the IDA. “Congratulations to the entire team.” Williams, making his fourth spacewalk, and Rubins, making her first, began the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT (GMT-4). After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting tools and foot restraints, they made their way to the front of the station where the shuttle port — pressurized mating adapter No. 2 — extends from the forward end of the Harmony module. The new docking mechanism was carried up to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. Overnight Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled it from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and positioned just in front of PMA-2 to await the spacewalkers.

Once in place on either side of the mating adapter, their feet locked in restraints on PMA-2 for stability, Williams and Rubins attached tethers to the IDA and cinched it in before connecting cables to provide power to sensors, heaters and motors needed to drive home 12 latches to lock the component to the old shuttle port. Other than a minor problem freeing up one balky cable connector, the astronauts had no trouble staying ahead of their timeline. After sensors indicated the IDA was properly aligned, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, working inside the station, sent commands to drive the hooks closed, firmly locking down the IDA. Williams and Rubins then reconfigured the power cables, removed a cover over the end of the docking adapter, covered up no-longer-needed reflectors used by approaching shuttles and installed new laser reflectors that will be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to help determine distance and relative velocity. NASA originally hoped to get the first IDA installed last year, but the initial unit was destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to space suffered a catastrophic failure. A replacement IDA is being built by Boeing and should be ready for installation in 2018. In the meantime, the IDA installed Friday will suffice for initial test flights starting next year. SpaceX is expected to launch an unpiloted Dragon test flight early next summer, followed by a crewed “demo” mission a few months later. Boeing expects to launch an unpiloted test flight late next year with the first crewed test mission in early 2018. Artist’s impression of the crewed SpaceX Dragon craft docking at the International Space Station using the newly installed docking adapter. Image: NASA. The new spacecraft will give NASA astronauts their first independent access to space since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. And because SpaceX’s Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 can carry four astronauts compared to three aboard the Russian Soyuz, NASA plans to add a seventh crew member to the space station to increase the amount of research that can be carried out. “It’s really a momentous day when I sit here and think about the fact that that docking adapter is just about perfect for us to come (to) next year,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager of the commercial crew program. “It’s a huge milestone in our program.” Even though the commercial crew ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz, at least one U.S.-sponsored astronaut will launch aboard each Soyuz and a Russian will fly aboard each NASA spacecraft through the life of the station program. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships — and its crew — to depart. The IDA installation work took about four hours to complete, giving the spacewalkers time to carry out lower-priority tasks. Rubins routed a cable that will be needed by the second IDA while Williams worked with an ethernet cable that will be needed by a future Russian module. “I see a beautiful sunrise, Tom,” Rubins radioed astronaut Tom Marshburn in mission control as the shuttle sailed high above the south Pacific Ocean. “You’ve got the best view, that’s great,” Marshburn replied. With their primary objectives complete, the astronauts agreed to carry out two final “get-ahead” tasks, but the work was called off when Williams ran into intermittent problems with his helmet’s audio feed. While he could still hear flight controllers with one ear, flight controllers decided to go ahead and end the spacewalk. After carrying their tools and tethers back to the airlock, Williams and Rubins floated back inside, shut the hatch and began repressurization at 2:02 p.m., closing out U.S. EVA-36. Duration was five hours and 58 minutes. It was the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998 and the third so far this year. Adding Rubins to the list of veteran station spacewalkers, 124 astronauts and cosmonauts have now logged 1,210 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station, or 50.4 days. Williams and Rubins plan to stage another spacewalk Sept. 1 to retract a cooling radiator, to install an HD camera and replace an external light.

Home Latest Popular Pakistan Today's Paper Opinion World Sport Business Magazine Culture Blogs Tech Multimedia Archive In Depth SEARCH US astronauts prepare spacewalk to install new docking port AFP — Published Aug 20, 2016 01:48pm WHATSAPP   0 Comments  Email Email Your Name: Recipient Email:  Print This Nasa TV video grab shows US astronaut Kate Rubins viewed near the docking port on August 19, 2016 at the ISS. — AFP MIAMI: With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming years, two US astronauts are set to embark on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. Nasa describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft ─ the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 ─ to carry astronauts to the space station. Astronaut Kate Rubins adjusts cables on August 19, 2016 at the ISS. — AFP The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. Early morning start With more private spaceship traffic expected at the ISS, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk to install a special parking spot for them. — AFP The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05am (1205 GMT) with veteran Nasa astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in Nasa's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers ─ also known as extravehicular (EV) crew ─ are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. This image provided by Nasa shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk. ─ Nasa via AP The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM," she added. "In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." Second spacewalk planned Nasa is planning a second spacewalk on September 1 for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." Rubins works outside the International Space Station with the SpaceX Dragon space freighter just below her on August 19, 2016. — AFP However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. Nasa has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment ─ and it is not the same as what we do on the ground."

By Tom Mendelsohn August 20, 2016 16:59 BST Close Embed Feed SpaceX successfully launches a docking ring for space taxis for the International Space Station IBTimes US <iframe src="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/videos/embed/19326" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> The International Space Station (ISS) is now equipped to host guests, after two astronauts finished a six-hour spacewalk to install a new docking bay for commercial traffic. Nasa is describing the new kit as "a metaphorical gateway to a future", while ISS's operations manager believes it is a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability". Two Americans currently stationed on the ISS, Jeff Williams and Kate Rubin, fitted the first of two docking adapters onto the orbital facility, which Nasa expects to see more and more use during the coming years. Describing the new adapter, which was designed by the aerospace company Boeing, as a "parking spot", Nasa's mission control announcer Rob Navias said: "We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles." Nasa claims that the docking equipment is the most sophisticated yet by allowing for automatic parking of spacecraft. Previous methods involved grappling and then berthing space ships in a clumsy process that has to be performed by the astronauts themselves. The new system will work with two upcoming private space vehicle projects: Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, with the first test flights expected as early as next year. Eventually, it will be the way astronauts and private citizens are brought to the ISS. Ever since Nasa retired the space shuttle in 2011, astronauts have had to arrive at the station using a Russian Soyuz rocket. Russia's Soyuz MS-01 spacecraft, carrying its crew to the International Space Station (ISS), blasts off to the ISS from the launch pad at the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodromeVasily Maximov/ AFP SpaceX and Boeing are both developing a new generation of human-crewed spacecraft, which the two companies hope might enter official service by early 2018. The new docking adaptor has been made open source in the hopes that it will be adopted as a universal international standard. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," Nasa program manager Shaun Kelley told an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us."

The successful installation of an international docking adapter on the International Space Station on Friday represents another step toward space tourism. By Lucy Schouten, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams (l.) and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Astronauts created a back door for the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, which will someday enable commercial space shuttles to dock. During a spacewalk on Friday , NASA's Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins installed the first of two docking adapters  where crews riding with Boeing and SpaceX will soon disembark. The newly named "international docking adapter's" installation marks another step forward in commercial space travel, where steadily advancing technology in the last two years has opened up real potential for life both here and in the skies. Recommended: Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel "It's really good we have an international standard now that anybody can build against and come dock to the station or to anything that has the same standard," David Clemen, Boeing's development director for the space station, said in a NASA press release. Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 The dock uses unprecedented open-source technology so anyone can build to it. This design strategy hints at how space travel will operate as it enters a new era of commercial development. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," NASA program manager Shaun Kelley said in an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us." The adapter precedes NASA's shift from transporting ISS-bound astronauts via Russian Soyuz rockets, as it has done since 2012, to a new model of using US commercial shuttles. Switching to US companies Boeing and SpaceX frees NASA from an expensive transportation plan with Russia that costs taxpayers $70 million per ride . Set for 2018, the plan suggests how soon commercial space travel could become a reality. "Never before in the history of human spaceflight has there been so much going on all at once," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager for space exploration at Boeing, during a 2015 briefing on NASA's commercial crew program. Space travel operations are already speeding up back on terra firma. One sign of the uptick is the packed 2016 schedule for  Cape Canaveral , where private companies, the military, ISS cargo loads, and NASA operations are jostling for time on the launch pad. Private space companies such as SpaceX and United Launch Alliance planned more than 30 launches from Florida alone in 2016, nearly double the 2015 schedule.  "The last time we saw 30-plus launches would have been back in the 1960s," Dale Ketcham of the Space Florida economic development agency told Reuters. The advance is not without complications. Some space observers on the international scene expressed dismay after Congress passed a bill  in late 2015 to regulate space mining, betting that travel and exploration will soon fall under the purview of US companies, not just governments. Some said the law violates the universalist spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and needs further discussion, wrote Jeff Foust for the Space Review.  "Asteroid mining is cool. Everyone thinks it's cool. But is it legal?" asked Jim Dunstan, founder of the Mobius Legal Group, during a May panel on the issue. "These are the tough scenarios that we’ve really got to work through as we talk about policy," he said, according to Space Review.  But technology's rapid advance will bring those "tough scenarios" to the forefront quickly in the coming years. For example, after many failed attempts, companies are learning to reuse rockets in a cost-effective manner, as the Christian Science Monitor's Pete Spotts previously reported: NASA's space shuttle program was an initial attempt at developing a fleet of reusable vehicles for human spaceflight, as well as for launching and servicing satellites. But over its 30-year history, it never delivered on its architects’ initial promises.      Initial estimates suggested that each flight would cost as little as $9 million and the cost of carrying cargo would be $118 per pound. By the end of the program, each flight cost about $1.5 billion, and cargo cost about $10,000 per pound. Now, privately-owned aerospace companies owned by wealthy visionaries are taking up the challenge, free of Wall Street demands for quick returns on investment or of the intense scrutiny of annual federal budget cycles. As technology makes space exploration appear more practical, some also see the economic potential that Star Trek's iconic "final frontier" could offer to our already-mapped planet. Moon Express, an entrant in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, expresses the commercial aim of many companies seeking to explore the moon's natural resources to facilitate deeper space travel.  "We believe it's critical for humanity  to become a multi-world species and that our sister world, the Moon, is an eighth continent holding vast resources than can help us enrich and secure our future," writes Moon Express on the prize website.

Sanjai Currently, TAL is the only non-US facility to supply ACFBs to Boeing for its 787-9 Dreamliner, and it will also supply this component to the soon-to-be-built 787-10 Dreamliner. Mumbai: Tata Group-controlled TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd (TAL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors, has dispatched 5,000th Advanced Composite Floor Beam (ACFB) to plane maker Boeing Co. for its 787-9 and 787-10 Dreamliner aircraft. These ACFBs are shipped out of the aerospace manufacturing facility located in MIHAN SEZ, Nagpur. Currently, TAL is the only non-US facility to supply ACFBs to Boeing for its 787-9 Dreamliner, and it will also supply this component to the soon-to-be-built 787-10 Dreamliner. The ACFBs are shipped to Boeing partners in Italy, Japan and the US. “We are despatching the 5000th advanced composite floor beam for Boeing 787s-9s and Boeing 787-10. The 787-10 is yet to be manufactured. TAL was given the order for the first five 787-19 floor beams because of its reliable and impeccable delivery and quality performance,” Rajesh Khatri, executive director and chief executive officer, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd. TAL is six months ahead of its original schedule of despatch of floor beams. “We have invested over Rs.250 crore at the Boeing-dedicated facility in Nagpur. We started commercial production in March 2015,” he said. Khatri said TAL has a headcount of 880 in Pune and Nagpur, of which 550 are based in Nagpur. Boeing India President, Pratyush Kumar, called it a major milestone not just for Boeing and TAL, but also for India. TAL did not disclose the value of the contract. The Tata firm is associated with other original equipment manufacturers. “We are associated with the A (Airbus) and B (Boeing) of aircraft manufacturing,” Khatri said. TAL has signed a contract aerospace firm RUAG for supplying parts that will go into A320 planes made by Airbus SAS. The contract with RUAG is worth $170 million for making 550 sheet metal, machine parts and sub assemblies, which are fitted in to the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. “We are exclusive suppliers for these parts for RUAG,” Khatri said. TAL is also working on robots for commercial purpose. “We are working towards the formal commercial launch of robots, TAL BRABO!,” Khatri said. All three will help us to develop a sustainable and profitable business model enabling TAL to clock a five-fold increase in revenue of over Rs.1,000 crore from Rs.224 crore over the next five years, he said. He added that TAL would also increase headcount to 1,250 from its current 880. Aerospace is profitable and robotics will also turn profitable from next year, once commercial production starts, he said. “TAL is working with next generation aerospace technology with two leading airplane makers. We intend to be the market leader in civil aerospace manufacturing and among the top three aerospace manufacturers in India,” Khatri added. P.R.

The successful installation of an international docking adapter on the International Space Station on Friday represents another step toward space tourism. By Lucy Schouten, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams (l.) and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Astronauts created a back door for the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, which will someday enable commercial space shuttles to dock. During a spacewalk on Friday , NASA's Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins installed the first of two docking adapters  where crews riding with Boeing and SpaceX will soon disembark. The newly named "international docking adapter's" installation marks another step forward in commercial space travel, where steadily advancing technology in the last two years has opened up real potential for life both here and in the skies. Recommended: Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel "It's really good we have an international standard now that anybody can build against and come dock to the station or to anything that has the same standard," David Clemen, Boeing's development director for the space station, said in a NASA press release. Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 The dock uses unprecedented open-source technology so anyone can build to it. This design strategy hints at how space travel will operate as it enters a new era of commercial development. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," NASA program manager Shaun Kelley said in an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us." The adapter precedes NASA's shift from transporting ISS-bound astronauts via Russian Soyuz rockets, as it has done since 2012, to a new model of using US commercial shuttles. Switching to US companies Boeing and SpaceX frees NASA from an expensive transportation plan with Russia that costs taxpayers $70 million per ride . Set for 2018, the plan suggests how soon commercial space travel could become a reality. "Never before in the history of human spaceflight has there been so much going on all at once," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager for space exploration at Boeing, during a 2015 briefing on NASA's commercial crew program. Space travel operations are already speeding up back on terra firma. One sign of the uptick is the packed 2016 schedule for  Cape Canaveral , where private companies, the military, ISS cargo loads, and NASA operations are jostling for time on the launch pad. Private space companies such as SpaceX and United Launch Alliance planned more than 30 launches from Florida alone in 2016, nearly double the 2015 schedule.  "The last time we saw 30-plus launches would have been back in the 1960s," Dale Ketcham of the Space Florida economic development agency told Reuters. The advance is not without complications. Some space observers on the international scene expressed dismay after Congress passed a bill  in late 2015 to regulate space mining, betting that travel and exploration will soon fall under the purview of US companies, not just governments. Some said the law violates the universalist spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and needs further discussion, wrote Jeff Foust for the Space Review.  "Asteroid mining is cool. Everyone thinks it's cool. But is it legal?" asked Jim Dunstan, founder of the Mobius Legal Group, during a May panel on the issue. "These are the tough scenarios that we’ve really got to work through as we talk about policy," he said, according to Space Review.  But technology's rapid advance will bring those "tough scenarios" to the forefront quickly in the coming years. For example, after many failed attempts, companies are learning to reuse rockets in a cost-effective manner, as the Christian Science Monitor's Pete Spotts previously reported: NASA's space shuttle program was an initial attempt at developing a fleet of reusable vehicles for human spaceflight, as well as for launching and servicing satellites. But over its 30-year history, it never delivered on its architects’ initial promises.      Initial estimates suggested that each flight would cost as little as $9 million and the cost of carrying cargo would be $118 per pound. By the end of the program, each flight cost about $1.5 billion, and cargo cost about $10,000 per pound. Now, privately-owned aerospace companies owned by wealthy visionaries are taking up the challenge, free of Wall Street demands for quick returns on investment or of the intense scrutiny of annual federal budget cycles. As technology makes space exploration appear more practical, some also see the economic potential that Star Trek's iconic "final frontier" could offer to our already-mapped planet. Moon Express, an entrant in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, expresses the commercial aim of many companies seeking to explore the moon's natural resources to facilitate deeper space travel.  "We believe it's critical for humanity  to become a multi-world species and that our sister world, the Moon, is an eighth continent holding vast resources than can help us enrich and secure our future," writes Moon Express on the prize website.

(AP) — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday, Aug. 19, 2016. The docking port will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. (NASA via AP) "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html FILE - In this Friday, April 17, 2015 file photo, the Canadarm 2 reaches out to capture the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft for docking to the International Space Station.

It’s real:’ Stealth fighters vie for attention from air show attendees — and the Canadian Forces David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen | August 18, 2016 8:29 PM ET More from David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo? More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon ABBOTSFORD, B.C. — Last weekend, the unicorn finally came to Canada. Sitting on the tarmac at the Abbotsford Air Show, the F-35 stealth fighter made its first appearance in this country. Recently declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force — though critics point out much more work needs to be done on the jet — officials with its manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, were jokingly referring to it by the name of the mythical beast, because it’s been talked about here so much and seen not at all. But the plane’s appearance in Abbotsford marked the first major shot in the next phase of the high-stakes marketing battle to sell a new fighter to the Canadian Forces. And the two main contenders in that battle — Boeing with its Super Hornet and Lockheed with the F-35 — came face-to-face in Abbotsford. “There’s no better vehicle to educate the public than to allow them to see the actual aircraft,” said Jack Crisler, one of Lockheed Martin’s top F-35 officials. “It’s here. It’s real.” The Liberal government is expected to decide within months how it wants to proceed on replacing Canada’s aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. Justin Trudeau came to power last fall pledging that a Liberal government wouldn’t buy the F-35, an aircraft he said was too expensive and unnecessary given Canada’s needs. That should have been the kiss of death for Lockheed Martin. But Crisler said he’s feeling good these days about how Canada is moving ahead on the fighter jet file. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has talked about holding a fair and open competition. Lockheed Martin, along with other aircraft firms, recently submitted information to the government about their planes, and met Monday with federal officials. “It looks like we’re being included, so we look forward to competing on that basis,” Crisler said. “I’m certainly more optimistic than I was in December 2015.” The controversial stealth fighter became a political nightmare for the Harper government after it pledged to buy 65 of the planes, which were plagued by technology problems and complaints from U.S. lawmakers about their cost. Auditor General Michael Ferguson found that Canadian defence officials withheld key information from parliament about the proposed purchase, underestimated the costs of the jets and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. In June, Lockheed Martin almost saw its hopes of selling planes to Canada disappear completely. The Liberal government was close to moving on an interim purchase of Super Hornets and Trudeau claimed the F-35 “does not work and is far from working.” Related F-35, the aircraft Trudeau said is ‘far from working,’ now declared ready for combat by U.S. Air Force Liberals pay $33 million to stay in F-35 development program, despite promise not to buy the fighter jet U.S. Navy pilots report oxygen shortage while flying Super Hornet jets being considered by Liberals That prompted Lockheed Martin to warn that Canadian companies who had contracts on the F-35 would suffer. Plans for a Super Hornet interim deal seemed to disappear. As for Trudeau’s F-35 comment, Crisler has a diplomatic response: “The evidence is not consistent with a statement like that. If you’re not living it day-to-day, you might not see that.” At the Boeing tent at the Abbotsford air show, officials smiled while pointing out the F-35 wasn’t going to be showcased in a flight demonstration that weekend. In contrast, their Super Hornets roared back and forth in front of the crowds on both days of the show. “This is a remarkable event where we can show what our aircraft are capable of,” said top Boeing official Roberto Valla. A Boeing representative providing commentary for the demonstrations introduced the Super Hornet as a “fifth generation stealth fighter” — a dig at Lockheed, which also bills the F-35 as such. Boeing officials were happy to outline their sales pitch: their aircraft is combat proven, less expensive than the F-35 and will be operating with the U.S. military until at least 2040. During a demonstration in which a Postmedia reporter flew in one of the planes, Boeing pilot Ty Frautschi claimed the Super Hornet’s capabilities are suited to both combat and Arctic patrols; its two engines provide added safety for northern flights. The jet is designed to take the pounding from short landings on aircraft carriers, he said, which would also help it handle the short runways at the Canadian military’s forward operating locations in the Arctic. Both Lockheed and Boeing are promoting their longtime presence in Canada as part of their pitch. By September, Crisler said, Canadian firms will have been awarded US$1 billion worth of work on the F-35. For its part, in conjunction with the air show, Boeing announced the opening of a new software lab in Vancouver, including 50 new jobs. Crowds gathered to gawk and take photos of the planes, though the two F-35s didn’t fly. The U.S. Air Force pilots that flew them up from Utah were under strict rules not to discuss the Canadian situation. Instead, they chatted about the aircraft’s capabilities. F-35 pilot Lt.-Col. Curtis Pitts highlighted the plane’s powerful radar and sensors, and the stealth technology that provides it with increased survivability. If necessary, Pitts said, he’d be ready to go to war in the F-35 today. “It’s hard to find bad news” about the plane, said Pitts. “It’s all good news.” In the end, though, the Canadian Forces will have bad news for one of its suitors. dpugliese@postmedia.com Twitter.com/davidpugliese Find National Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ Reddit Email Typo?

Main / Industry / Science, Technologies US astronauts prepare spacewalk to install new docking port 19 august, 15:17 0 International Space Station ©AFP / NASA With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts are set to embark on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them, AFP reports. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. - Early morning start - The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05 am (1205 GMT) with veteran NASA astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers -- also known as extravehicular (EV) crew -- are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM," she added. "In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." - Second spacewalk planned - NASA is planning a second spacewalk on September 1 for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. NASA has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment -- and it is not the same as what we do on the ground." 168 Tags: Americas, astronaut, equipment, International Space Station, ISS, news, space, USA Other news in the category "Science, Technologies": Google says anti-privacy effort has delivered $2 bn Fido forever?

A380: Ramping Down Production? Capt. Daniel Omale — Aug 20, 2016 4:10 am | Leave a comment This article is taken from Aviation week and Space Technology July 18-31, 2016. On Dec. 19, 2000, Jean-Luc Lagardere, co-chairman of the newly formed EADS, stood in front of a big crowd in Toulouse where he and his German colleague Manfred Bischoff had just announced the launch of the biggest commercial aircraft ever—the A380. “We will achieve superior profitability,” Lagardere confidently predicted. And Bischoff said with equal certainty: “There is a sufficient market” for the aircraft that would transform air transport much like the Boeing 747 did in the 1970s. At this year’s Farnborough Airshow, Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier had the rather unpleasant task of amending these statements. The A380 is still decades away from recovering its development costs, in a best-case scenario. But whether it will reach that point became even more doubtful when Bregier conceded that—at least for now—the market is not nearly as big as the founders of EADS had hoped. EADS was later renamed Airbus Group. Because of the slow pace of orders for the A380, Airbus is severely curtailing production. The manufacturer is currently producing 2.5 aircraft per month. It turned out only 27 aircraft in 2015. The output will go down to 20 in 2017, and just one aircraft per month in 2018. Airbus’s $20 billion-plus bet at the turn of the century that it was going to break Boeing’s monopoly in the very large aircraft market is about to go terribly wrong. That decision is rapidly turning into a prime example of market misjudgment and bad timing. Instead of being the first aircraft in a new era of air travel, the A380 is now increasingly perceived as the last of an old era when big was beautiful. In some respects, the A380 is the victim of Airbus’s own success. Back in the old days, lower unit costs were mainly achievable by making aircraft larger. But since the introduction of the A380, major efficiency gains have been realized by engine manufacturers that enable airlines to operate smaller wide bodies such as the A350 and Boeing 787 at unit costs similar to those of the A380. Emirates Airline President Tim Clark says even the 777-300ER comes near the A380 in terms of cost per seat mile. But if there is no need to operate large aircraft to drive down costs, why take the risk of having more seats that one must sell on any given flight? Bregier, of course, thinks differently. He believes that general air traffic growth and constraints at key airports will require airlines to up gauge aircraft size regardless of the cost argument. “The trend is with us,” he said. The problem is that the argument may make sense in theory, but too few airlines are following it in reality. By ramping down A380 production, Airbus is giving the theory another 2-3 years to come to fruition while applying a tourniquet to the flow of red ink on the program. If orders still do not come in by then, the question will no longer be about how many aircraft are produced, but when production will end. More and more, observers are convinced that discontinuing the program is unavoidable. The rate cut “looks like the beginning of the end,” Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia says. “I cannot imagine any market or technology changes that would cause sales to recover. The best they can do is to find a face-saving way to terminate the program.” Airbus has firm orders for 319 A380s, 193 of which had been delivered by the end of June. The backlog is 126, of which 61 are for Emirates Airline and can be considered a safe bet. However, the picture shifts when it comes to the remaining 65 aircraft. In fact, orders for around 40 aircraft look shaky. The backlog still includes orders for 20 aircraft from lessor Amedeo, which has not yet placed the aircraft with any operators; 10 aircraft originally planned for Hong Kong Airlines (and now listed for an undisclosed customer); six for Virgin Atlantic; and three for now-defunct Transaero. It appears to be highly unlikely that Hong Kong and Virgin will take delivery of their aircraft. A further two aircraft are listed for Air France, but the carrier has already made clear it does not intend to accept them. Most of the existing big operators such as Lufthansa, British Airways and Qatar Airways say they will not take more than their original orders. What is more, a preliminary commitment from Iran Air for 12 A380s announced in January does not appear to be turning into a firm deal. Bregier remains confident, at least officially. Airbus plans to keep A380 output at low levels “for a few years before we can ramp back up again,” he said at the Farnborough Airshow. He insisted that he sees “big upside potential” in the program in spite of the announced scaling back. Bregier sees two reasons why production could be boosted again at some point. He argues that Emirates will eventually have to replace its existing fleet, which will grow to 142 aircraft in the next few years. After all, Clark has often made clear that the carrier would want to replace the aircraft with the A380 again, ideally with an A380neo, and that an order for up to 200 aircraft is possible. But the fact that the A380neo proposal has been shelved for several years is further evidence that Airbus’s confidence in sales prospects for its flagship aircraft is dwindling. Projecting such optimism for 25 years later is a further indicator of Airbus’s misjudgment. The much more short-term challenge is to keep program costs under control. Bregier says Airbus knows it can profitably build 20 A380s in 2017, down from the current level of 27. He indirectly concedes going to 12 will not be profitable: “I don’t say we will break even at 12.” On the other hand, he emphasizes that the losses incurred at that low production rate “will not be material for Airbus.” However dramatic the A380 crisis may look, it is unique. The rest of the industry (and the Airbus portfolio) are nowhere near crisis mode.

Two NASA astronauts on Friday (Aug. 19) performed a six hour spacewalk outside the orbiting laboratory to install the docking ring, where Boeing and SpaceX crewed capsules will connect to the space station in the near future. Another of the international docking adapters (IDA) is planned to be launched in late 2017. Expedition 48 commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins oversaw the installation of the IDA on Friday, connecting power and data cables after the Canadian-built mulit-armed robot "Dextre" was used to position the IDA to latch onto the pressurized mating adapter where the space shuttles previously docked. "This EVA [extravehicular activity] represents a significant milestone on the path to establishing a commercial crew capability on board the International Space Station, so we are very excited," said Kenny Todd, NASA's space station operations integration manager, at a press conference on Monday (Aug. 15). "We are very excited to put this piece of hardware on the front of the station and get it all integrated and get ready to go."

(NASA TV) The IDA was launched inside the unpressurized trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft that berthed to the space station on July 20. On Wednesday (Aug. 17), the Dextre special purpose dexterous manipulator, attached to the end of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, was used to extract the IDA from the Dragon and position it for installation on the forward end of pressurized mating adapter 2 (PMA-2). Williams and Rubins began their spacewalk Friday at 7:04 a.m. CDT (1204 GMT). Just over an hour later, after they had configured their work stations, the Dextre released its grapple on the IDA, marking the first hand-off between the robot and spacewalking astronauts since the manipulator was added to the space station in 2008. After the two astronauts cinched down the adapter using tethers, the 12 hooks used to hard mate the IDA to PMA-2 were driven closed at 9:40 a.m. CDT (1440 GMT), as was commanded by Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi using a control panel inside the space station's Harmony node. Williams and Rubins then set about connecting additional power and data cables, covering up an obsolete targeting reflector used by the space shuttle and installing two new reflectors on the adapter. The spacewalkers also removed a thermal cover from the front of the adapter, exposing the attachment point for in-bound commercial spacecraft. Astronaut Jeff Williams works alongside the newly-installed IDA-2 outside the International Space Station on Aug. 19. (NASA TV) The IDA, which has an outer diameter of about 8 feet (2.4 m), will be the port to which SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner commercial capsules will dock when bringing astronauts to the space station beginning in the next year or two. Built to a new international standard for docking systems, the IDA enables the different visiting vehicles to use the same port for automated berthings. Future U.S. commercial cargo spacecraft and international spacecraft still to be designed may also use the IDA. "It is amazing that now we have opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles," Williams radioed, "and, frankly, potential international vehicles that adopt the international standard that [the docking adapter] has been designed to." Assembled by Boeing using parts from companies in 25 states, the adapter's primary structure was provided by the Russian aerospace company RSC Energia. The adapter's targets, used to guide spacecraft in for docking, are more sophisticated than earlier systems and include lasers and sensors that allow the station and capsules to talk to each other digitally to share distance cues and enable automatic alignment and connection. Astronaut Kate Rubins configures a foot restraint early during her and Jeff Williams spacewalk to install the IDA. (NASA TV) Friday's spacewalk attached the IDA to PMA-2, one of the first two mating adapters launched to the space station in 1988 on STS-88, which was the first space shuttle mission to the infant orbital laboratory. Repositioned as the station grew in size, PMA-2 is connected to the forward end of the Harmony module. The adapter installed on PMA-2, IDA-2, was the second to be built. The first IDA was destroyed in June 2015 with the launch failure of a SpaceX Dragon. A third IDA, now under construction by Boeing, is expected to be launched in late 2017 and attached to PMA-3 after that mating adapter is moved from the Tranquilly node to Harmony's zenith port. Friday's EVA, which ended at 1:02 p.m. CDT (1802 GMT), five hours and 58 minutes after it began, marked the 194th spacewalk in support of the space station's assembly and maintenance. It was Williams' fourth career extravehicular activity and Rubins' first. The 60th woman to fly into space, Rubins is now the 11th U.S. woman to perform an EVA and the 12th worldwide — including Soviet-era cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who was the first woman to spacewalk in 1984. © 2016 collectSPACE.com All rights reserved.

While Boeing this month cited “softness” in the widebody-jet market and lowered expectations about near-term demand for the 787, ANA’s milestone allowed the jet maker to celebrate the success of the Dreamliner in passenger service. Hideki Kunugi, senior vice president of ANA Americas, said the airplane’s fuel efficiency — 20 percent better than the 767 it replaced — is today saving the airline about $98 million per year. “The 787 plays a vital role” in the airline’s plans to expand its international network, he said. The economics of the midsize, long-range jet have allowed ANA to open up long-haul routes not only to giant hubs such as New York and Los Angeles but also to mid-size cities. Hence its nonstop flights from Tokyo to D?sseldorf, Germany, and Brussels, as well as Seattle and San Jose, Calif. “Without the Dreamliner, Seattle and San Jose would not be possible,” Kunugi said. To get to this point, ANA suffered through a turbulent early ride. After working closely with Boeing on the design of the airplane, then giving the jet maker its launch order in 2004, ANA got its first delivery in September 2011 — three years and four months late. Just over a year after the jet entered service, a main battery started smoking aboard one of ANA’s planes in flight, and the airline endured with all other 787 operators the grounding of the entire Dreamliner fleet for more than three months. But the battery problem was fixed, and Boeing has now delivered 447 Dreamliners to 39 airlines. As of July, more than 108 million passengers have flown on more than 569,000 Dreamliner flights. Opening new routes ANA now flies the 787 on 40 percent of its international routes, and it plans to open more routes to previously unserved destinations. In September, it will introduce the 787 between Tokyo and Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Next February, it will fly the jet nonstop between Tokyo an Mexico City, which on the northbound leg takes more than 14 hours. Kunuga said the opening up of Mexico City “is only possible thanks to the 787, which can operate such long-haul routes with greater comfort and efficiency than any other aircraft.” The airline sees this route as “a first very important step” to expanding connections to Central and South America. At the delivery ceremony Wednesday, Boeing’s senior vice president of sales for northeast Asia, Ihssane Mounir, said that despite the general softness in demand, China remains a bright spot that offers hope of buoyant future sales. “China will continue to drive the demand,” he said. “I’m not seeing any signs of weakness whatsoever.” ANA has 33 more Dreamliners on order, which is scheduled to enter service in 2018.

Astronaut Jeff Williams is pictured below the docking port. Image: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now. Two spacewalkers attached a new docking port to the International Space Station Friday, clearing the way for U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to begin test flights to the lab complex next year. It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships. A second IDA is expected to be attached in 2018. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” radioed station commander Jeff Williams, who worked with astronaut Kate Rubins to attach and outfit the IDA. “Congratulations to the entire team.” Williams, making his fourth spacewalk, and Rubins, making her first, began the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT (GMT-4). After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting tools and foot restraints, they made their way to the front of the station where the shuttle port — pressurized mating adapter No. 2 — extends from the forward end of the Harmony module. The new docking mechanism was carried up to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. Overnight Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled it from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and positioned just in front of PMA-2 to await the spacewalkers. The International Docking Adapter, in position in front of PMA-2. Image: NASA TV/Spaceflight Now. Once in place on either side of the mating adapter, their feet locked in restraints on PMA-2 for stability, Williams and Rubins attached tethers to the IDA and cinched it in before connecting cables to provide power to sensors, heaters and motors needed to drive home 12 latches to lock the component to the old shuttle port. Other than a minor problem freeing up one balky cable connector, the astronauts had no trouble staying ahead of their timeline. After sensors indicated the IDA was properly aligned, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, working inside the station, sent commands to drive the hooks closed, firmly locking down the IDA. Williams and Rubins then reconfigured the power cables, removed a cover over the end of the docking adapter, covered up no-longer-needed reflectors used by approaching shuttles and installed new laser reflectors that will be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to help determine distance and relative velocity. NASA originally hoped to get the first IDA installed last year, but the initial unit was destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to space suffered a catastrophic failure. A replacement IDA is being built by Boeing and should be ready for installation in 2018. In the meantime, the IDA installed Friday will suffice for initial test flights starting next year. SpaceX is expected to launch an unpiloted Dragon test flight early next summer, followed by a crewed “demo” mission a few months later. Boeing expects to launch an unpiloted test flight late next year with the first crewed test mission in early 2018. Artist’s impression of the crewed SpaceX Dragon craft docking at the International Space Station using the newly installed docking adapter. Image: NASA. The new spacecraft will give NASA astronauts their first independent access to space since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. And because SpaceX’s Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 can carry four astronauts compared to three aboard the Russian Soyuz, NASA plans to add a seventh crew member to the space station to increase the amount of research that can be carried out. “It’s really a momentous day when I sit here and think about the fact that that docking adapter is just about perfect for us to come (to) next year,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager of the commercial crew program. “It’s a huge milestone in our program.” Even though the commercial crew ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz, at least one U.S.-sponsored astronaut will launch aboard each Soyuz and a Russian will fly aboard each NASA spacecraft through the life of the station program. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships — and its crew — to depart. The IDA installation work took about four hours to complete, giving the spacewalkers time to carry out lower-priority tasks. Rubins routed a cable that will be needed by the second IDA while Williams worked with an ethernet cable that will be needed by a future Russian module. “I see a beautiful sunrise, Tom,” Rubins radioed astronaut Tom Marshburn in mission control as the shuttle sailed high above the south Pacific Ocean. “You’ve got the best view, that’s great,” Marshburn replied. With their primary objectives complete, the astronauts agreed to carry out two final “get-ahead” tasks, but the work was called off when Williams ran into intermittent problems with his helmet’s audio feed. While he could still hear flight controllers with one ear, flight controllers decided to go ahead and end the spacewalk. After carrying their tools and tethers back to the airlock, Williams and Rubins floated back inside, shut the hatch and began repressurization at 2:02 p.m., closing out U.S. EVA-36. Duration was five hours and 58 minutes. It was the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998 and the third so far this year. Adding Rubins to the list of veteran station spacewalkers, 124 astronauts and cosmonauts have now logged 1,210 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station, or 50.4 days. Williams and Rubins plan to stage another spacewalk Sept. 1 to retract a cooling radiator, to install an HD camera and replace an external light.

Photo / AP Air crash investigators are planning to dump replica Boeing 777 wing flaps fitted with satellite trackers into the Indian Ocean in an effort to discover the wreckage of the missing MH370 jet. The Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 vanished from radar screens on March 8, 2014 shortly after leaving Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board. In July 2015, a section of the aircraft's wingtip, known as a flaperon, washed ashore on a beach in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island. Now experts want to "reverse" the flaperon's journey in an effort to determine the most likely crash site. So far, experts have searched approximately 46,000 square miles of the ocean floor during a two-year operation but have failed to find the missing jet. Greg Hood Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner, who last month took over responsibility for the search, is currently trying to identify new areas where the jet could be. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. Hood said: "If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity." Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year - 15 months after the plane went missing - will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Continued below. Related Content Missing plane MH370 dived from the air, new analysis shows Mangled 'MH370 debris' found off the coast of Mozambique suggests plane may have exploded Malaysia confirms MH370 pilot plotted flight over Indian Ocean on flight simulator Greg Hood is currently trying to identify new areas where the jet could be. Photo / AP Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modelling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year - the third anniversary of the disaster - and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analysed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modelling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or approximately 550km. Foley said: "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot." Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area - which includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales - made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. Experts have searched approximately 46,000 square miles of the ocean floor during a two-year operation but have failed to find the missing jet. Photo / Getty Images The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 40,000 feet after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimise debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 12,000 feet and 20,000 feet a minute before it crashed. A rate of 2000 feet a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. Foley said: "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap - if it's found that it is not deployed - will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking." Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20m swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 4000 square miles of seabed, which is outside the original 23,000-square-mile high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 1700 miles and 1200 miles from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. Hood said: "We are still hopeful and optimistic." Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. Foley added: "We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it." - Daily Mail Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Desperate bid to stop pet being put down Jerran Puru loves his tan and white pitbull Paco.

The successful installation of an international docking adapter on the International Space Station on Friday represents another step toward space tourism. By Lucy Schouten, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams (l.) and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port outside the International Space Station on Friday. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of Astronauts created a back door for the International Space Station (ISS) on Friday, which will someday enable commercial space shuttles to dock. During a spacewalk on Friday , NASA's Commander Jeff Williams and Flight Engineer Kate Rubins installed the first of two docking adapters  where crews riding with Boeing and SpaceX will soon disembark. The newly named "international docking adapter's" installation marks another step forward in commercial space travel, where steadily advancing technology in the last two years has opened up real potential for life both here and in the skies. Recommended: Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel "It's really good we have an international standard now that anybody can build against and come dock to the station or to anything that has the same standard," David Clemen, Boeing's development director for the space station, said in a NASA press release. Beyond SpaceX: Five companies seeking to change space travel Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 The dock uses unprecedented open-source technology so anyone can build to it. This design strategy hints at how space travel will operate as it enters a new era of commercial development. "A new interface standard out in the public domain for anyone to build to that standard will stimulate competition and stimulate technology," NASA program manager Shaun Kelley said in an interview on NASA TV. "We're entering a commercial sector now. Any company in the world, any country in the world, can build to that standard and be sure that they can be compatible with us." The adapter precedes NASA's shift from transporting ISS-bound astronauts via Russian Soyuz rockets, as it has done since 2012, to a new model of using US commercial shuttles. Switching to US companies Boeing and SpaceX frees NASA from an expensive transportation plan with Russia that costs taxpayers $70 million per ride . Set for 2018, the plan suggests how soon commercial space travel could become a reality. "Never before in the history of human spaceflight has there been so much going on all at once," said John Elbon, the vice president and general manager for space exploration at Boeing, during a 2015 briefing on NASA's commercial crew program. Space travel operations are already speeding up back on terra firma. One sign of the uptick is the packed 2016 schedule for  Cape Canaveral , where private companies, the military, ISS cargo loads, and NASA operations are jostling for time on the launch pad. Private space companies such as SpaceX and United Launch Alliance planned more than 30 launches from Florida alone in 2016, nearly double the 2015 schedule.  "The last time we saw 30-plus launches would have been back in the 1960s," Dale Ketcham of the Space Florida economic development agency told Reuters. The advance is not without complications. Some space observers on the international scene expressed dismay after Congress passed a bill  in late 2015 to regulate space mining, betting that travel and exploration will soon fall under the purview of US companies, not just governments. Some said the law violates the universalist spirit of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty  and needs further discussion, wrote Jeff Foust for the Space Review.  "Asteroid mining is cool. Everyone thinks it's cool. But is it legal?" asked Jim Dunstan, founder of the Mobius Legal Group, during a May panel on the issue. "These are the tough scenarios that we’ve really got to work through as we talk about policy," he said, according to Space Review.  But technology's rapid advance will bring those "tough scenarios" to the forefront quickly in the coming years. For example, after many failed attempts, companies are learning to reuse rockets in a cost-effective manner, as the Christian Science Monitor's Pete Spotts previously reported: NASA's space shuttle program was an initial attempt at developing a fleet of reusable vehicles for human spaceflight, as well as for launching and servicing satellites. But over its 30-year history, it never delivered on its architects’ initial promises.      Initial estimates suggested that each flight would cost as little as $9 million and the cost of carrying cargo would be $118 per pound. By the end of the program, each flight cost about $1.5 billion, and cargo cost about $10,000 per pound. Now, privately-owned aerospace companies owned by wealthy visionaries are taking up the challenge, free of Wall Street demands for quick returns on investment or of the intense scrutiny of annual federal budget cycles. As technology makes space exploration appear more practical, some also see the economic potential that Star Trek's iconic "final frontier" could offer to our already-mapped planet. Moon Express, an entrant in the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition, expresses the commercial aim of many companies seeking to explore the moon's natural resources to facilitate deeper space travel.  "We believe it's critical for humanity  to become a multi-world species and that our sister world, the Moon, is an eighth continent holding vast resources than can help us enrich and secure our future," writes Moon Express on the prize website.

NASA TV Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Two spacewalkers attached a new docking port to the International Space Station Friday, clearing the way for U.S. crew ferry ships being built by Boeing and SpaceX to begin test flights to the lab complex next year. It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships. A second IDA is expected to be attached in 2018. “It is amazing that now we’ve opened up a new chapter in the story of the International Space Station, putting the front door on this for future commercial vehicles,” radioed station commander Jeff Williams, who worked with astronaut Kate Rubins to attach and outfit the IDA. “Congratulations to the entire team.” Williams, making his fourth spacewalk, and Rubins, making her first, began the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT (GMT-4). After exiting the Quest airlock and collecting tools and foot restraints, they made their way to the front of the station where the shuttle port -- pressurized mating adapter No. 2 -- extends from the forward end of the Harmony module. The new docking mechanism was carried up to the station aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship in June. Overnight Wednesday, the station’s robot arm pulled it from the Dragon’s unpressurized trunk and positioned just in front of PMA-2 to await the spacewalkers. Once in place on either side of the mating adapter, their feet locked in restraints on PMA-2 for stability, Williams and Rubins attached tethers to the IDA and cinched it in before connecting cables to provide power to sensors, heaters and motors needed to drive home 12 latches to lock the component to the old shuttle port. Other than a minor problem freeing up one balky cable connector, the astronauts had no trouble staying ahead of their timeline. After sensors indicated the IDA was properly aligned, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, working inside the station, sent commands to drive the hooks closed, firmly locking down the IDA. Williams and Rubins then reconfigured the power cables, removed a cover over the end of the docking adapter, covered up no-longer-needed reflectors used by approaching shuttles and installed new laser reflectors that will be used by the Boeing and SpaceX spacecraft to help determine distance and relative velocity. NASA originally hoped to get the first IDA installed last year, but the initial unit was destroyed when the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying it to space suffered a catastrophic failure. A replacement IDA is being built by Boeing and should be ready for installation in 2018. In the meantime, the IDA installed Friday will suffice for initial test flights starting next year. SpaceX is expected to launch an unpiloted Dragon test flight early next summer, followed by a crewed “demo” mission a few months later. Boeing expects to launch an unpiloted test flight late next year with the first crewed test mission in early 2018. Williams, left, and Rubins make their way toward the front of the space station to attach a new docking mechanism to the lab’s no-longer-needed shuttle port. If all goes well, new commercial spacecraft being built by Boeing and SpaceX will dock there starting with test flights next year. NASA TV The new spacecraft will give NASA astronauts their first independent access to space since the shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. And because SpaceX’s Dragon and Boeing’s CST-100 can carry four astronauts compared to three aboard the Russian Soyuz, NASA plans to add a seventh crew member to the space station to increase the amount of research that can be carried out. “It’s really a momentous day when I sit here and think about the fact that that docking adapter is just about perfect for us to come (to) next year,” said Steve Stich, deputy manager of the commercial crew program. “It’s a huge milestone in our program.” Even though the commercial crew ships will end NASA’s sole reliance on the Soyuz, at least one U.S.-sponsored astronaut will launch aboard each Soyuz and a Russian will fly aboard each NASA spacecraft through the life of the station program. That strategy will ensure at least one astronaut or cosmonaut can remain aboard the station to operate critical systems in the event of a problem that might force one of the other ferry ships -- and its crew -- to depart. The IDA installation work took about four hours to complete, giving the spacewalkers time to carry out lower-priority tasks. Rubins routed a cable that will be needed by the second IDA while Williams worked with an ethernet cable that will be needed by a future Russian module. “I see a beautiful sunrise, Tom,” Rubins radioed astronaut Tom Marshburn in mission control as the shuttle sailed high above the south Pacific Ocean. “You’ve got the best view, that’s great,” Marshburn replied. With their primary objectives complete, the astronauts agreed to carry out two final “get-ahead” tasks, but the work was called off when Williams ran into intermittent problems with his helmet’s audio feed. While he could still hear flight controllers with one ear, flight controllers decided to go ahead and end the spacewalk. After carrying their tools and tethers back to the airlock, Williams and Rubins floated back inside, shut the hatch and began repressurization at 2:02 p.m., closing out U.S. EVA-36. Duration was five hours and 58 minutes. It was the 194th spacewalk devoted to station assembly and maintenance since construction began in 1998 and the third so far this year. Adding Rubins to the list of veteran station spacewalkers, 124 astronauts and cosmonauts have now logged 1,210 hours and 46 minutes working outside the station, or 50.4 days. Williams and Rubins plan to stage another spacewalk Sept. 1 to retract a cooling radiator, to install an HD camera and replace an external light. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 most likely drifted. Peter Foley, Australian Transport Safety Bureau director of Flight 370 search operations, beside a stack of replica wing flaps on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2016, at the bureau's headquarters in Canberra, Australia. AP Photo / Rod McGuirk Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood says experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives. ShareAdjustCommentPrint CANBERRA, Australia — Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres and 6,100 metres a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometre high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometres and 1,900 kilometres from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month, packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule.   NASA describes the gear as 'a metaphorical gateway to a future' that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft - the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 - to carry astronauts to the space station.  Scroll down for live video US astronaut Kate Rubins works on the docking port of the International Space Station.The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station.

It is a crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year.  Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011.  SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two.  But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. 'We have a new port of call for the new U.S. commercial crew vehicles,' announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Bone-appetit!

Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides - at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be installed in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called Friday's installation a 'very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability.' HOW TO INSTALL AN ORBITING PARKING SPACE The docking adapter arrived to the space station July 20 on a SpaceX Dragon cargo resupply spacecraft.  On Wednesday, ground controllers used the Canadarm2 robotic arm, and its attached 'Dextre' Special Dexterous Manipulator, to extract the IDA from the trunk of Dragon and position it just 2 feet away from Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 located on the forward end of the Harmony module. Once the IDA is moved to a surface to surface contact with the PMA, Williams and Rubins will begin work to hook up tethers in advance of Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Takuya Onishi sending commands to close the hooks between the two docking ports.  Once the hooks are closed, Williams and Rubins will press ahead to mate power and data connectors for future use of the IDA. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station.  The docking adapter arrived to the space station July 20 on a SpaceX Dragon cargo resupply spacecraft. Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts.

He has accumulated 19 hours of spacewalk time in his life. The spacewalk is Rubins's first. But the work will be hardly brand new for her.  The spacewalk began at 8:04 (1204 GMT) when Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. Late Wednesday, the space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, placing it next to the station's Harmony module for installation. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. The last US spacewalk was on January 15, when a problem with American Tim Kopra's spacesuit allowed a small amount of water to build up inside his helmet by the end of the outing. It was the latest in a series of spacesuit issues, but was not as severe as an emergency in 2013 when Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet flooded, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, Todd said. NASA commentator Rob Navias said the US space agency has done a thorough review of the spacesuits being worn by Rubins and Williams, and they are in 'excellent shape' for Friday's spacewalk. The spacewalk is Rubins's first. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. NASA is planning another spacewalk on September 1 to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. 'We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time,' he added.

NASA awards contracts to build homes in space The Motley Fool 8/19/2016 Rich Smith Sometime in the next two decades, NASA plans to land humans on Mars. In the meantime, several companies are making efforts to put fresh footprints on the Moon. But here's the thing: If astronauts want to spend any significant amount of time exploring these heavenly bodies, they're going to need someplace to live. Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 149.57 +0.05 +0.03% Lockheed Martin Corp LMT ▼ 264.13 -0.53 -0.20% Orbital ATK Inc OA ▲ 86.33 +0.57 +0.66% As spaceflight pioneer Elon Musk has explained, even SpaceX's rather roomy Dragon 2 space capsule only has about as much interior volume as a family SUV, while Boeing's CST-100 Starliner capsule isn't much bigger. The Orion crew module that Lockheed Martin is building for NASA is somewhat roomier -- but still probably not big enough to move its crew of four astronauts to Mars and back in comfort. Don't get me wrong. All three of these spaceships are probably comfortable enough for short hops. But for any mission of any real length on a foreign planet(oid) -- and especially for the 18-month round trip to Mars and back -- astronauts are going to need some better extended-stay housing options. So last week, NASA announced a new project to try to develop such options. Round up the usual space suspects On August 9, NASA expanded the parameters of its NextSTEP program (Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships) for development of new space technology by private industry. In NextStep part 2, the agency has invited six U.S. companies to try to come up with improved options for long-term deep-space living. These six companies include publicly traded space giants Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Orbital ATK. In addition, up-and-comer Bigelow Aerospace, private aerospace specialist Sierra Nevada, and relative newcomer NanoRacks of Webster, Texas also won contracts. (Although actually, NanoRacks will partner with Boeing's and Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance joint venture. So in a sense, you could say that Boeing and Lockheed won this NextSTEP competition twice). Living off campus -- way off campus What will they be building for NASA? The range of potential space habitat ideas is pretty wide. We've already written at length about Bigelow's inflatable "BEAM" series of inflatable space habitats -- one of which is already undergoing testing as an add-on to the International Space Station (ISS). In addition, both Boeing and Orbital ATK are developing new purpose-built habitation modules for NASA. Lockheed and Sierra Nevada both envision habitats comprising repurposed cargo capsules (sent into orbit on ISS resupply missions, for example). The NanoRacks team will try to do something similar, refitting a launch rocket's second-stage fuel tank to see if it can be converted into living quarters (a la Skylab). What it means for investors NASA hasn't divulged the value of its initial six NextSTEP-2 contract awards, which is problematic for investors trying to gauge the investment opportunity here. On the other hand, neither has NASA stated that it will pick just one of the solutions proposed by its contractors for building future deep-space habitats. To the contrary, it might make more financial sense to build as much outer-space real estate as possible, utilizing all available resources -- spent fuel tanks, empty cargo containers, purpose-built modules, and inflatable structures as well. Potentially, all six of these companies could come out of the NextSTEP-2 competition looking like winners. For now, though, you can still only invest in three of them: Boeing, Lockheed, and Orbital ATK.

Advertisement Boeing Defense, Space & Security (Boeing Co. IW500/9) has a new, $2.8-billion U.S. Air Force contract to start low-rate initial production for two “production lots” of the KC-46A tanker aircraft. The first lot involves seven aircraft, while the second covers 12 aircraft. Including future options, Boeing expects to build 179 of these refueling and strategic airlift aircraft for the USAF. This step follows a Defense Acquisition Board review and announcement that the KC-46 program completed “Milestone C” (a series of ground and flight tests) and is approved for initial production. Those tests included refueling flights with F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10, C-17, and A-10 aircraft and a cargo handling demo.

With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. The spacewalk began at 8:04 (1204 GMT) when Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power. Shortly afterward, they made their way outside the orbiting laboratory to begin the work of attaching an international docking adaptor, launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. / AFP PHOTO / NASA TV / Lizabeth MENZIES /With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. The spacewalk began at 8:04 (1204 GMT) when Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power. Shortly afterward, they made their way outside the orbiting laboratory to begin the work of attaching an international docking adaptor, launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the gear as “a metaphorical gateway to a future” that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft — the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 — to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be installed in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called Friday’s installation a “very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability.” Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing’s CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX’s Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. – Rubins’s first spacewalk – Williams is making his fourth career spacewalk. He has accumulated 19 hours of spacewalk time in his life. The spacewalk is Rubins’s first. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA’s neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor’s arrival. Late Wednesday, the space station’s robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, placing it next to the station’s Harmony module for installation. The last US spacewalk was on January 15, when a problem with American Tim Kopra’s spacesuit allowed a small amount of water to build up inside his helmet by the end of the outing. It was the latest in a series of spacesuit issues, but was not as severe as an emergency in 2013 when Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano’s helmet flooded, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, Todd said. NASA commentator Rob Navias said the US space agency has done a thorough review of the spacesuits being worn by Rubins and Williams, and they are in “excellent shape” for Friday’s spacewalk. NASA is planning another spacewalk on September 1 to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. “We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time,” he added.

The KC-46A will be used to refuel all allied and coalition military aircraft compatible with international aerial refuelling procedures as well as transport passengers, cargo and patients. The award follows a Defense Acquisition Board review and announcement that the KC-46 programme has completed Milestone C and is approved for initial production. "The KC-46 tanker will provide the Air Force unprecedented refuelling capabilities, operational flexibility and combat readiness." Under the award, which includes the first two production lots, Boeing will build seven and 12 takers respectively. Upon exercising of future options by the USAF, Boeing will be required to build a total of 179 aircraft for the service. Boeing Defense, Space & Security president and CEO Leanne Caret said: “The KC-46 tanker will provide the Air Force unprecedented refuelling capabilities, operational flexibility and combat readiness. “It’s an important day for the company and programme. "We’re excited about building low-rate initial production aircraft, and it’s only possible because of the hard work of the joint Boeing-Air Force team.” Work on assembling KC-46 aircraft will be carried out by Boeing at its Everett facility in Washington, US, with deliveries set to begin in 2017. Designed and developed based on Boeing 767 refuelling aircraft, the KC-46A Pegasus tanker will replace the USAF’s KC-135 fleet. Prior to receiving approval for initial production, the aircraft completed a set of required ground- and flight-test tests that included refuelling flights with F-16, F/A-18, AV-8B, KC-10, C-17 and A-10 aircraft and a cargo handling demo. In 2011, Boeing was initially contracted to design and develop the USAF’s next-generation tanker aircraft, under which the company built four test aircraft, two configured as 767-2Cs and two as KC-46A tankers. So far, the test aircraft have completed more than 1,000 flight hours. Image: Boeing KC-46A Pegasus tanker. Photo: courtesy of Paul Weatherman, Boeing photo.

(AP) -- Astronauts ventured out on a spacewalk today to install a new door for visitors at the International Space Station. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, quickly began hooking up a docking port that will be used by future commercial crew capsules. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. SpaceX is shooting for a launch of its supped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person test flight of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides -- at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. Police: Family in quadruple slaying likely beat with hammer GREENVILLE (AP) -- Police say a North Carolina man accused of killing his two young daughters, their sister and their mother likely beat the victims to death with a hammer. News outlets report 39-year-old Dibon Toone was in a Richmond, Virginia, courtroom Thursday morning for an extradition hearing on a murder charge in 32-year-old Garlette Howard's death. Greenville police say they expect Toone will be charged with additional counts of murder in the deaths of the three children, ages 6, 7 and 11. The victims were found dead Tuesday night inside their Greenville home. Toone was arrested hours later in Richmond, Virginia. Former chairman of joint chiefs Gen. John Vessey dies at 94 MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Retired Army Gen. John W. Vessey, who rose through the ranks in a 46-year military career to become chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under President Ronald Reagan, has died. He was 94. Vessey -- who enlisted as a private in the Minnesota National Guard in 1939, fought in World War II and Vietnam, and was the nation's top military officer when he retired to his home state of Minnesota in 1985 -- died Thursday evening, his daughter, Sarah Vessey told The Associated Press. He was surrounded by family and died of natural causes, she said. After being named chairman of the joint chiefs in 1982, Vessey helped oversee the military buildup that Reagan championed when he took office just over a year earlier. "It was probably the greatest peacetime modernization of the American military establishment that ever took place," Vessey recalled in a 2004 interview. "We improved every facet of the armed forces, from the recruiting and retention, the selection of individuals, to the way they lived, but most importantly to the way they fought." Germany rejects latest Greek call for WWII reparations BERLIN (AP) -- The German government is rebuffing the latest push by Greece to secure reparations for the brutal Nazi occupation of Greece during World War II. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said today that Berlin's "position is very clear" on the reparations issue and has been stated repeatedly. "The question of German reparations has been conclusively dealt with, legally and politically," Seibert said. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras vowed Tuesday to exhaust diplomatic and, if necessary, legal means to win reparations. He urged Germany, the main European contributor to Greece's massive bailout program, to enter negotiations on the matter. A Greek parliamentary committee recently prepared a report on war reparations. Greek media reports say it set the total sum due at $340-$450 billion. 2,000 dead seahorses smuggled in packages to France PARIS (AP) -- French customs police have seized 2,000 dried seahorses smuggled into France in several postal packages en route from Guinea to Vietnam. The endangered creatures were discovered in plastic bags by customs officers in a Paris suburban post office. The national customs police said in a statement today that the seahorses were slated to be sent on a flight to Vietnam, where they could be used in traditional medicine or sold to tourists. Istanbul police detain dozens as part of coup probe ISTANBUL (AP) -- Turkey's state-run news agency says police have detained dozens at Turkey's banking regulatory agency and at one of Istanbul's largest universities as part of an investigation into the July 15 abortive coup which killed over 270 people. Anadolu Agency said 29 auditors at the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency were detained early Monday for allegedly conducting "irregular probes" in 2013 into businessmen and foundations that are close to the government. Meanwhile, detention orders were issued for 62 academics working at Istanbul University as part of the same investigation. Police detained 44 of them Monday morning. Turkey accuses U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen of masterminding the coup and has launched a massive crackdown on his movement, detaining more than 40,000 people and dismissing tens of thousands from government jobs. Mexico's rights agency says police executed 22 at ranch MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Federal police executed at least 22 people on a ranch last year, then moved bodies and planted guns to corroborate the official account that the deaths happened in a gunbattle, Mexico's human rights commission said Thursday. One police officer was killed in the confrontation in the western state of Michoacan on May 22, 2015. The government has said the dead were drug cartel suspects who were hiding out on the ranch in Tanhuato, near the border with Jalisco state. The National Human Rights Commission said there were also two cases of torture and four more deaths caused by excessive force. It said it could not establish satisfactorily the circumstances of 15 others who were shot to death. Experts use drift modeling to define new MH370 search zone CANBERRA, Australia (AP) -- Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 -- a wing flap -- most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 46,000 square miles turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. Greek coast guard rescues migrants stuck on islet ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Greece's coast guard rescued dozens of migrants today whose boat ran aground on a deserted islet off the coast of southwestern Greece, hundreds of miles from the usual entry point of migrants into the European Union nation. The boat carrying about 70 people ran aground overnight on the tiny islet of Sapientza, off the southwestern tip of the Peloponnese, the coast guard said. The vast majority of migrants reach Greece's eastern Aegean islands a few miles from the Turkish coast. Coast guard vessels picked up the migrants this morning, ferrying them to the mainland where they were to be registered. It was not immediately clear what type of boat they had been on, where they had set sail from or where they had been sailing to. US appeals court upholds UN immunity from cholera suit PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A U.S. federal appeals court has upheld the United Nations' immunity from a damage claim filed on behalf of 5,000 cholera victims who blame the U.N. for an epidemic of the deadly disease in Haiti. In a decision issued late Thursday, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals in New York affirmed a lower court's January 2015 dismissal of a lawsuit brought in the worst outbreak of cholera in recent history. "We have considered all of plaintiffs' arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit," the U.S. appellate judges said. The ruling came shortly after U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq referred to the United Nations' "own involvement" in the introduction of cholera to Haiti. It was a significant statement because the U.N. has for years kept silent about allegations its peacekeepers introduced cholera to Haiti. It has answered lawsuits on behalf of victims filed in U.S. courts by claiming immunity under a 1946 convention.       Comments made about this article - 0 Total Comment on this article Title: Comments: Your Name: (optional - shown on website) Advertisement Subscribe to The Recorder   E-Edition 11/23/2016 Click here to see and download more print issues The Recorder Sports Schedule Most Popular Area high school sports calendar Monday, November 21, 2016 Volunteers to cook up holiday spirit in city with meal delivery Saturday, November 19, 2016 Experienced core will be key for Northville Friday, November 18, 2016 Mayfield returns four starters; also has talented 6-foot-5 eighth grader in the mix Tuesday, November 22, 2016 Fulton County supervisors give approval to $97M draft budget Friday, November 18, 2016 From The Recorder Archives Saturday, November 19, 2016 Thomas to replace Cramer as undersheriff Saturday, November 19, 2016 Sophie Malkowicz Friday, November 18, 2016 City gun buyback yields less, but still viewed as a success Thursday, November 17, 2016 Police report Friday, November 18, 2016 Isabel faces Nelson for county legislature District 8 seat (1) Jury convicts Thomas Mair of murdering UK lawmaker Jo Cox (0) Oh please, not another gratitude list (0) The News in Brief (0) University police officer shot in head (0) Airstrike hits bridge, disrupting IS supply lines (0) Trump taps Gov.

Goodbye to the Jet That Ruled the World The Daily Beast 19/08/2016 Clive Irving © Getty Boeing Plans to End 747, The Plane That Changed the World As epoch-ending statements go, this one was stealthy and carefully modulated: “It is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.” And so it slipped out, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, first reported by Aviation Week, that Boeing foresees the moment when the single most consequential airplane it ever built will come to the end of its viable life—probably around 2020, which would give the 747 fifty years in production. Like millions of people across the globe, I long ago came to take the 747—the Jumbo Jet—waiting at an airport gate as a distinctive and welcome presence, an airplane that reassured you with its substance and solidity; never exactly sexy but with a personality that other airplanes never quite reached, something above being just an exquisite machine. In truth, though, for me the attachment is stronger and more personal. Some 23 years ago I published a book about the 747, which turned out to be a story about much more than a machine. It was about a singular group of engineers who brought the machine to life in a way that permanently marked their own life experience, always under stress, often tested to the limits of their skills but never, never daunted. I realized that I wasn’t just writing about a machine, but the biography of a machine and its creators, a process in which you get to know the subject so intimately that you can’t ever shake off the effect of the achievement. As a result of writing the book, every time I board a 747 it remains impossible not to think about its details, visible and invisible, without hearing the voices of those whose work it was, the scores of engineers I had interviewed, most of them at that point living out their retirement in and around Seattle. And of all those stories there is one that shows how daringly improvised the creation of the 747 sometimes was—in a real sense it describes the genesis of the whole concept.  Milt Heinemann was not a salesman at Boeing but there was a single quite scary moment in his career when he sold the biggest idea ever to come out of the company. It happened one morning in 1966. Heinemann had a meeting with the top managers of Pan Am in the airline’s eponymous building that rose above Grand Central station in New York. Deliberately, he arrived a little early, and was shown into the boardroom on the 52nd floor. From his briefcase he pulled out a length of hemp rope, 35 feet long. It was knotted at two points, at 20 feet and 29 feet. He played out the rope across the width of the boardroom, and it turned out to be just a tad wider than the 20 feet marker. Then he pulled out a chair from beside the boardroom table, stood on it, and with the 20 feet knot on the floor stretched up to the ceiling. The ceiling height was just beyond the 29 feet knot. Nobody had witnessed this strange behavior. Had they done so they might well have decided that Heinemann was nuts. He wound up the rope and put it back in his briefcase, pulled out a wad of documents and sat down at the table. A little later the managers filed in, led by Pan Am’s imperious creator and chairman, Juan Trippe. The business of the day was to hear out Heinemann on Boeing’s latest plans for a new airplane, the 747. Trippe wanted an airliner that was at least twice the size of the first Boeing passenger jet, the 707. Until that moment he believed that the 747 would simply be a 707 with two decks instead of one and otherwise follow conventional dimensions in each cabin. Heinemann had been sent from Seattle to tell Trippe that Boeing had a radical new concept for the 747. It would have only one deck for passengers—a very wide deck. Heinemann explained that, essentially, the cabin would virtually have the internal dimensions of the Pan Am boardroom: 19 feet wide and nine feet high. They were, he said, to all intents and purposes now sitting in that cabin. There was a silence while Trippe’s obedient managers awaited his response and Heinemann wished he could disappear. Finally Trippe said only that it was an interesting proposal and he wanted to know more —a lot more. It wasn’t the airplane he thought he was buying. In the history of companies handing off the delivery of potentially deal-breaking news to a relatively junior executive this one deserves a prime slot. Heinemann was a modestly ranked engineer at Boeing. His specialty was cabin interiors and in the Boeing hierarchy the engineers who designed the frame of a new airplane and its working parts—thousands of working parts—came first in responsibility and influence. To them, the cabin was décor. When Boeing made a pitch for a new airplane to an airline, Heinemann was always the last to speak. He liked to say that he was responsible for the only part of the airplane that made a profit: the seats. And yet what Heinemann had described to Trippe that day was momentous. For the first time an airplane cabin could break free from the confinement of a tube, the conventional form with a single-aisle and six-abreast seating. There were many other innovations in the 747 but what became known as the twin-aisle wide-body cabin was the most far-reaching. However, even though Trippe accepted the concept and Pan Am was the first airline to fly the 747 he never thought it would endure. His plan was for the wide-body, this capacious but bulbous machine, to be replaced by a supersonic jet, the SST, flying two and half times as fast, with a slender fuselage shaped for speed. The 747, Trippe believed, was just a useful stopgap and once the SST arrived it would revert to carrying cargo only—the reason why it had been designed with a cockpit in the hump above the main deck was so that cargo could be loaded through  a hinged door at the nose. That never happened. The U.S. government-sponsored SST program was abandoned. Its economics were awful and the environmental impact equally egregious—only one SST, the Anglo-French Concorde, gained an established place on airline routes and then only as an elitist convenience. Ironically, Trippe didn’t seem to appreciate that the 747 would enable aviation to initiate the age of widely affordable air travel. In the first phase of the Jet Age, beginning in the late 1950s, the passengers frequently looked as sexy and glamorous as the machines, but flying remained well beyond the means of the middle class. With the 747, Trippe had set Boeing the goal of achieving what would be a new price point for airline travel. The economics of an airplane are expressed in the seat/mile cost—given a nominal number of seats, the cost of flying one seat one mile. Trippe wanted that number to be 6.6 cents per mile, one third of the 707’s cost. By reaching that number, in one leap the 747 not only put flying within the reach of many more people, it did so on a global basis. In airports around the world the 747 became a mesmerizing and inimitable presence. Small countries where leaders had big egos and autocratic style bought 747s as prestige projects. In that way the 747 went beyond being just an airplane to being a ubiquitous advertisement of America’s attainments. More substantially, it was an instrument of social advancement, introducing a new math that enabled coach class seats to be sold at prices that brought international travel to many millions more people. The result, however, was often far from egalitarian. Because the 747’s size allowed a variety of cabin comfort standards, airlines began to see that they could make an airplane a microcosm of an increasingly affluent but still stratified society. For one thing, what could be a more specifically delineated society than the three-class cabin? Without altering the basic utility of the machine—everybody departs and arrives at the same time—the passengers are divided by carefully calculated levels of comfort. At the front end there was first class, replicating what in the early post-war years of international flights had been common throughout the cabin, well-spaced wide seats and restaurant-style meal service. In the middle came business class at first, relatively few seats). And then in the rear, with 10 seats in each row and tight space between each row, there was coach—or cattle class, as it was frequently described by those who liked the price but not the discomfort.  This stratification of the wide-body cabin has now become such a finely tuned work of airline business plans that there are now regularly four classes, not three, with the arrival of "premium economy" - something of a contradiction in terms in both concept and execution, but fine for those who want to escape the press of bodies in the back of the airplane but who don’t want to pay a whole lot more to do so. In this new world, the art of successfully filling seats of four different sizes on every flight has actually ended up dictating the size and shape of every new wide-body plane, whether built by Boeing or Airbus. And it is this calculation that, in the end, has been the nemesis of the 747. As the economics of the wide-body cabin were refined it became apparent that a four-engined airplane like the 747 was less competitive than one with two engines—and so in the 1990s Boeing created the first “big twin” the 777. The latest and final iteration of the 747, the 747-8, launched in 2010, has new and more efficient wings and a new generation of engines that are more efficient, cleaner and quieter. But orders for the 747-8 have slumped, with a backlog now of only 21 airplanes. The production rate has been cut to the lowest sustainable level: 0.5 per month. Without admitting as much, it is Boeing itself that has rendered the 747-8 obsolescent by launching a new generation of the 777, the 777X, planned to arrive in 2020. It will be capable of flying as many passengers as the original 747, more than 400, at a lower cost than the 747-8.  Already, airlines have ordered more than 300. It may well be that the only other supersized jet, the Airbus A380, will be the last of the big jets. Launched with high expectations in 2000, only 319 A380s have been sold, and 142 were bought by one airline, Emirates. Other airlines have canceled orders and, like Boeing, Airbus is undermining the logic of its jumbo with a big twin, the A350, that on many long-haul routes is more efficient. Perhaps this is another tough lesson that the future does not always turn out as imagined, a series of big technical advances bringing startling transformations. Commercial jets fly no faster today than the Boeing 707 that arrived in 1957. That was a quantum leap but it had its own terminating speed wall, 600 mph. Supersonic flight just doesn’t make economic sense for mass air travel. It seems equally likely that mega-sized jets will turn out to be a dead end. A combination of market forces and tough new environmental regulations, stressing efficiency, quietness, and low emissions favors the twins. In no way does that diminish the glory of the 747. By the end of its run Boeing will have produced 1,555 747s, way beyond what its creators imagined possible. But it’s not just about numbers. I’ve been flying on 747s since the year of its debut, 1970. As I take my seat and look around me it still seems so big that it’s amazing it can leave the ground. It is a magic machine that casts its own spell and that won’t be quickly snuffed out. Jumbo, The Making of the Boeing 747, by Clive Irving is available on Kindle from Amazon and also in paperback.

Russian Space Corporation, US Boeing Reach Deal on Dispute Over Sea Launch by Staff Writers Moscow (Sputnik) Aug 19, 2016 File image. Russia's S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation (RSC) Energia and the US aircraft manufacturing company Boeing reached an agreement to solve dispute over the Sea Launch project, Energia's General Director Vladimir Solntsev said Thursday. In 2015, US District Court for the Central District of California awarded Boeing a multimillion compensation from its former partners under the Sea Launch, including Energia, following the bankruptcy procedure. Energia and its Ukrainian counterpart Yuzhnoe claimed that Boeing had given unwritten assurances to its Sea Launch partners that it would not seek reimbursements. "We have signed a preliminary agreement with Boeing to settle a dispute on 'Sea Launch,' in that context a court in the United States suspended all the activities to collect debts. Before the end of the year we are planning to sign a final agreement with Boeing, which should stipulate conditions of the [dispute's] settlement," Solntsev said, as quoted by the Russian Izvestia newspaper. He added that Energia and Boeing had already evolved a program of long-term cooperation, which included projects of far space exploration. Sea Launch was formed in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, and was managed by US aerospace giant Boeing. The project aimed to use a floating launch site to place rockets on the equator - the best possible location for launch - which gives the rocket additional speed on lift-off thanks to centripetal force caused by Earth's rotation. Sea Launch resumed operations in 2011 after a 30-month hiatus that saw passage through US Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Now the company is 95-percent owned by Energia Overseas Limited, a subsidiary of Energia.

Share & Embed Air Force Electronic Warfare Upgrade to F-15 Designed to Help Fighter Stay in Front of Chinese J-10 Kris Osborn 11/07/2016 / Originally published onWarrior The US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The Air Force is reving up electronic warfare upgrades for its F-15 fighter as a way to better protect against enemy fire and electronic attacks, service officials said. Boeing has secured a $478 million deal to continue work on a new technology called with a system called the Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System, or EPAWSS.  “This allows the aircraft to identify a threat and actively prosecute that threat through avoidance, deception or jamming techniques,” Mike Gibbons, Vice President of the Boeing F-15 program, told Scout Warrior in an interview a few months ago.   These updated EW capabilities replace the Tactical Electronic Warfare Suite, which has been used since the 1980s, not long after the F-15 first deployed. The service plans to operate the fleet until the mid-2040’s, so an overhaul of the Eagle’s electronic systems helps maintain U.S. air supremacy, the contract announcement said.  Boeing won the initial contract for the EPAWSS project last year  and hired BAE Systems as the primary subcontractor.  Overall, the US Air Force is vigorously upgrading the 1980s-era F-15 fighter by giving new weapons and sensors in the hope of maintaining air-to-air superiority over the Chinese J-10 equivalent. The multi-pronged effort not only includes the current addition of electronic warfare technology but also extends to super-fast high-speed computers, infrared search and track enemy targeting systems, increased networking ability and upgraded weapons-firing capability, Air Force and Boeing officials said. “The Air Force plans to keep the F-15 fleet in service until the mid-2040’s.  Many of the F-15 systems date back to the 1970’s and must be upgraded if the aircraft is to remain operationally effective. Various upgrades will be complete as early as 2021 for the F-15C AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar and as late as 2032 for the various EW (electronic warfare) upgrades,” Air Force spokesman Maj. Rob Leese told Scout Warrior a few months ago.  The Air Force currently operates roughly 400 F-15C, D and E variants. A key impetus for the upgrade was well articulate in a Congressional report on the US and China in 2014. (US-China Economic and Security Review Commission --www.uscc.gov). Among other things, the report cited rapid Chinese technological progress and explained that the US margin of superiority has massively decreased since the 1980s. As an example, the report said that in the 1980s, the US F-15 was vastly superior to the Chinese equivalent – the J-10. However, Chinese technical advances in recent years have considerably narrowed that gap to the point where the Chinese J-10 is now roughly comparable to the US F-15, the report explained. Air Force and Boeing developers maintain that ongoing upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that this equivalence is not the case and that, instead, they will ensure the superiority of the F-15. Among the upgrades is an ongoing effort to equip the F-15 with the fastest jet-computer processer in the world, called the Advanced Display Core Processor, or ADCPII. “It is capable of processing 87 billion instructions per second of computing throughput, translating into faster and more reliable mission processing capability for an aircrew,” Boeing spokesman Randy Jackson told Scout Warrior. High tech targeting and tracking technology is also being integrated onto the F-15, Gibbons added. This includes the addition of a passive long-range sensor called Infrared Search and Track, or IRST. The technology is also being engineered into the Navy F-18 Super Hornet. The technology can detect the heat signature, often called infrared emissions, of enemy aircraft. “The system can simultaneously track multiple targets and provide a highly effective air-to-air targeting capability, even when encountering advanced threats equipped with radar-jamming technology,” Navy officials said. IRST also provides an alternate air-to-air targeting system in a high threat electronic attack environment, Navy, Air Force and industry developers said. The F-15 is also being engineered for additional speed and range, along with weapons-firing ability. The weapons-carrying ability is being increased from 8 up to 16 weapons; this includes an ability to fire an AIM-9x or AIM-120 missile. In addition, upgrades to the aircraft include adding an increased ability to integrate or accommodate new emerging weapons systems as they become available. This is being done through both hardware and software-oriented “open standards” IP protocol and architecture. The aircraft is also getting a “fly-by-wire” automated flight control system. “Fly by wire means when the pilot provides the input - straight to a computer than then determines how to have the aircraft perform the way it wants - provides electrical signals for the more quickly and more safely move from point to point as opposed to using a mechanical controls stick,” Gibbons explained. Along with these weapons upgrades and other modifications, the F-15 is also getting upgrades to the pilot’s digital helmet and some radar signature reducing, or stealthy characteristics. However, at the same time, the F-15 is not a stealthy aircraft and is expected to be used in combat environments in what is called “less contested” environments where the Air Force already has a margin of air superiority over advanced enemy air defenses.  For this reason, the F-15 will also be increasing networked so as to better support existing 5th-generation platforms such as the F-22 and F-35, Air Force officials said. The intent of these F-15 upgrades is to effectively perform the missions assigned to the F-15 fleet, which are to support the F-22 in providing air superiority and the F-35 in providing precision attack capabilities, Leese said. “While these upgrades will not make these aircraft equivalent to 5th generation fighters, they will allow the F-15 to support 5th generation fighters in performing their missions, and will also allow F-15s to assume missions in more permissive environments where capabilities of 5th generation fighters are not required,” Leese added. Gibbons added that the upgrades to the F-15 will ensure that the fighter aircraft remains superior to its Chinese equivalent.    “The F-15 as a vital platform that still has a capability that cannot be matched in terms of ability to fly high, fly fast, go very far carry a lot. It is an air dominance machine,” Gibbons explained.   Kris Osborn can be reached at Kris.Osborn@Scout.com.

Now experts want to 'reverse' the flaperon's journey in an effort to determine the most likely crash site.  Air crash investigators want to create several replicas of this piece of wreckage from MH370 and dump it in the ocean after being fitted with satellite trackers to determine drift rates  Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, pictured, said he remains optimistic that the missing Boeing 777 Malaysian Airlines jet will be found  Peter Foley, Australian Transport Safety Bureau director of Flight 370 search operations will track these replica 'flaperons' which will be dumped in the ocean next March and tracked So far, experts have searched approximately 46,000 square miles of the ocean floor during a two-year operation but have failed to find the missing jet.  Greg Hood Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner, who last month took over responsibility for the search, is currently trying to identify new areas where the jet could be. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Lochte's shame-faced sidekicks jet out of Rio: Conger and... 'You took something and got better every day': John Stewart... Share this article Share However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. Hood said: 'If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity.'  This Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 vanished on March 8, 2014, killing all 239 people A multi-national team has searched extensively for the missing jet without success This piece of wreckage was confirmed as belonging to the missing jet after it washed ashore on the island of Reunion, more than 15 months after the jet disappeared without a trace Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 15 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 340 miles. Foley said: 'Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot.'  Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 40,000 feet after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 12,000 feet and 20,000 feet a minute before it crashed. A rate of 2,000 feet a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. Foley said: 'The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it's found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide. 'If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking.' Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 65-foot swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 4,000 square miles of seabed, which is outside the original 23,000-square-mile high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 1,700 miles and 1,200 miles from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. Hood said: 'We are still hopeful and optimistic.' Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. Foley added: 'We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it.'

Miami, United States:  With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts are set to embark on a spacewalk on Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. Early Morning Start The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05 am (1205 GMT) with veteran NASA astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers -- also known as extravehicular (EV) crew -- are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM," she added. "In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." Second Spacewalk Planned NASA is planning a second spacewalk on September 1 for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. NASA has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment -- and it is not the same as what we do on the ground."

(AP Photo/Rod McGuirk)  (The Associated Press) Previous Next CANBERRA, Australia –  Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood said. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current vast expanse southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location. "If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity," Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 15 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether wind or currents determine how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers (340 miles). "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot," Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit to ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner flew far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters (12,000 feet) and 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 meters (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it's found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide," Foley said. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking, "he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take until December. Less than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of seabed which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometer (23,000-square-mile) high-priority search zone has yet to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ship are based. "We are still hopeful and optimistic," said Hood, who took over leadership of the Australian bureau in July. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. "We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it," Foley said.

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More ‘It’s here. It’s real:’ Stealth fighters vie for attention from air show attendees — and the Canadian Forces David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  08.18.2016 ShareAdjustCommentPrint ABBOTSFORD, B.C. — Last weekend, the unicorn finally came to Canada. Sitting on the tarmac at the Abbotsford Air Show, the F-35 stealth fighter made its first appearance in this country. Recently declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force — though critics point out much more work needs to be done on the jet — officials with its manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, were jokingly referring to it by the name of the mythical beast, because it’s been talked about here so much and seen not at all. But the plane’s appearance in Abbotsford marked the first major shot in the next phase of the high-stakes marketing battle to sell a new fighter to the Canadian Forces. And the two main contenders in that battle — Boeing with its Super Hornet and Lockheed with the F-35 — came face-to-face in Abbotsford. “There’s no better vehicle to educate the public than to allow them to see the actual aircraft,” said Jack Crisler, one of Lockheed Martin’s top F-35 officials. “It’s here. It’s real.” The Liberal government is expected to decide within months how it wants to proceed on replacing Canada’s aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. Justin Trudeau came to power last fall pledging that a Liberal government wouldn’t buy the F-35, an aircraft he said was too expensive and unnecessary given Canada’s needs. That should have been the kiss of death for Lockheed Martin. But Crisler said he’s feeling good these days about how Canada is moving ahead on the fighter jet file. Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan has talked about holding a fair and open competition. Lockheed Martin, along with other aircraft firms, recently submitted information to the government about their planes, and met Monday with federal officials. “It looks like we’re being included, so we look forward to competing on that basis,” Crisler said. “I’m certainly more optimistic than I was in December 2015.” The controversial stealth fighter became a political nightmare for the Harper government after it pledged to buy 65 of the planes, which were plagued by technology problems and complaints from U.S. lawmakers about their cost. Auditor General Michael Ferguson found that Canadian defence officials withheld key information from parliament about the proposed purchase, underestimated the costs of the jets and didn’t follow proper procurement rules. In June, Lockheed Martin almost saw its hopes of selling planes to Canada disappear completely. The Liberal government was close to moving on an interim purchase of Super Hornets and Trudeau claimed the F-35 “does not work and is far from working.” That prompted Lockheed Martin to warn that Canadian companies who had contracts on the F-35 would suffer. Plans for a Super Hornet interim deal seemed to disappear. As for Trudeau’s F-35 comment, Crisler has a diplomatic response: “The evidence is not consistent with a statement like that. If you’re not living it day-to-day, you might not see that.” At the Boeing tent at the Abbotsford air show, officials smiled while pointing out the F-35 wasn’t going to be showcased in a flight demonstration that weekend. In contrast, their Super Hornets roared back and forth in front of the crowds on both days of the show. “This is a remarkable event where we can show what our aircraft are capable of,” said top Boeing official Roberto Valla. A Boeing representative providing commentary for the demonstrations introduced the Super Hornet as a “fifth generation stealth fighter” — a dig at Lockheed, which also bills the F-35 as such. Boeing officials were happy to outline their sales pitch: their aircraft is combat proven, less expensive than the F-35 and will be operating with the U.S. military until at least 2040. During a demonstration in which a Postmedia reporter flew in one of the planes, Boeing pilot Ty Frautschi claimed the Super Hornet’s capabilities are suited to both combat and Arctic patrols; its two engines provide added safety for northern flights. The jet is designed to take the pounding from short landings on aircraft carriers, he said, which would also help it handle the short runways at the Canadian military’s forward operating locations in the Arctic. Both Lockheed and Boeing are promoting their longtime presence in Canada as part of their pitch. By September, Crisler said, Canadian firms will have been awarded US$1 billion worth of work on the F-35. For its part, in conjunction with the air show, Boeing announced the opening of a new software lab in Vancouver, including 50 new jobs. Crowds gathered to gawk and take photos of the planes, though the two F-35s didn’t fly. The U.S. Air Force pilots that flew them up from Utah were under strict rules not to discuss the Canadian situation. Instead, they chatted about the aircraft’s capabilities. F-35 pilot Lt.-Col. Curtis Pitts highlighted the plane’s powerful radar and sensors, and the stealth technology that provides it with increased survivability. If necessary, Pitts said, he’d be ready to go to war in the F-35 today. “It’s hard to find bad news” about the plane, said Pitts. “It’s all good news.” In the end, though, the Canadian Forces will have bad news for one of its suitors. dpugliese@postmedia.com Twitter.com/davidpugliese Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Back To Top[*] Boeing delivers 50th 787 Dreamliner to ANA Aug. 19, 2016 - 10:26AM JST Boeing and ANA (All Nippon Airways) celebrated the delivery of the airline’s 50th 787 Dreamliner during a ceremony Thursday at Boeing’s Everett Delivery Center. The milestone marks yet another record for ANA as it becomes the world’s first airline to operate 50 787 Dreamliners. “The 787 Dreamliner has played a significant role in opening up new routes into new markets, while also forming the backbone of our long-haul fleet,” said Osamu Shinobe, president and CEO, ANA. “As the launch customer of the 787 Dreamliner family, we are proud to welcome the 50th 787 Dreamliner into our fleet, where it will continue to serve our passengers with the most innovative and memorable flying experience.” As part of efforts to expand its global network, ANA also announced plans to launch new routes from Tokyo, Narita to Phnom Penh, Cambodia in September this year and Mexico City, Mexico in February next year using 787 Dreamliners. ANA became the launch customer of the 787 when it purchased 50 in 2004, and was the first to bring the airplane into service in 2011. The airline operates more than 11 percent of all 787s around the world today and has flown an estimated 125,000 flights with the Dreamliner. “As the launch customer of the 787 and our largest 787 customer, we are honored to celebrate this important milestone with ANA,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and CEO Ray Conner. “ANA is a valued Boeing customer and has been a vital partner on this program. Today’s event demonstrates the strength of our enduring relationship and we look forward to introducing the 787-10 to ANA in the coming years to complete the entire family of 787 Dreamliners in their fleet.” Already the world’s largest Dreamliner operator, ANA has an additional 33 787s on order, including the longest and newest member of the family, the 787-10. The airline also has 20 777-9X airplanes on order. ANA recently showcased its 50th 787 Dreamliner at the Farnborough International Airshow, performing high-performance demonstration flights for thousands in attendance and wowing millions of fans around the world on the Internet.

Two NASA astronauts have installed the International Docking Adapter (IDA). Jeff Williams, commander of Expedition 48, and flight engineer Kate Rubins started the spacewalk at 8:04 a.m. EDT to accomplish the task. Due to minor communication problem, the spacewalk came to an early end at 2.02pm EDT. Before the spacewalk was carried out, the ground robotics team using the ISS’s robotic arm Dextre positioned the IDA in front of the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA-2) so it becomes convenient for the astronauts to install it. Installation of the IDA means that the ISS will be able to accommodate different space taxis, including SpaceX and Boeing vehicles. Before this, only Russian vehicles were able to dock with the ISS. Williams said, “We've opened up a new chapter [of] the story of the International Space Station. Congratulations to the entire team”. In addition, Williams and Rubins also clicked photos of the new docking port and routed additional cables for a second IDA. As mentioned above about the communication problem which happened with Williams' right ear piece, these additional minor tasks were called off. Both the astronauts moved back to the ISS’s airlock around 1.30 EDT and by 2.02 EDT, both of them were safely inside the ISS. This was Williams fourth spacewalk and first for Rubins. If SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying an initial unit would not have met a catastrophic failure then there is a possibility that NASA has installed the first IDA last year only. Now, the second would be installed in 2018. According to a story published on the topic by Reuters News, "Two NASA astronauts completed a six-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station on Friday to install a parking spot for upcoming commercial space taxis, which will end U.S. reliance on Russia for rides to the orbiting outpost. Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed." California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit,” Hill said, speaking on a panel of NASA staff assembled to discuss the upcoming Mars mission. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit, so that research can continue in low-earth orbit," according to a recent Tech Crunch report. The timing fits with the end of The U.S. Government’s current funding of the ISS program, which was extended by President Obama’s administration from its original deorbiting date of 2016 through 2020. Operations were prolonged through 2024 to help give NASA a platform from which to run its near-Earth preparatory missions leading up to the ultimate manned mission to Mars. A report published in News Ledge informed, "NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are conducting one of the most vital spacewalks for the future of the International Space Station. The pair switched their spacesuits to battery power at 8:04 am ET and began a more than six-hour spacewalk. Their mission? To install the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs). Without these adapters, manned missions from Boeing and SpaceX are a no go." Getting the first IDA to the ISS took a bit longer than expected. The first one was originally launched to the ISS back by SpaceX in June 2015. But that mission failed when the launch vehicle disintegrated about two minutes after launch.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in US efforts to create a marketplace in space. Nasa posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach Nasa to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” Nasa also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavours 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” Nasa spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an email. In its RFI, Nasa stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. Nasa received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS programme, said in an email. Orbital ATK Inc, which has a Nasa contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr, president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former Nasa astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a test bed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support Nasa’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co and Space Exploration Technologies Corp, declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion (Dh4.40 billion) deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since Nasa agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, US-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable Nasa to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to Nasa might be how to minimise the harmful effects of space on the human body” — from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure” — as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, president Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analogue to this type of exercise is the ‘CubeSat’ initiative, in which Nasa allows schools and non-profit organisations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving Nasa access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. Nasa opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

CNN Money2:31 UP NEXT Later this year, tech entrepreneur turned space pioneer Elon Musk is planning the blastoff of a new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, that would be twice as powerful as any other in use and one of the biggest since the Apollo era’s mighty Saturn V. The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969.  Quotes in the article Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 60.40 -0.72 -1.18% Boeing Co BA ▲ 149.57 +0.05 +0.03% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 779.30 -6.03 -0.77% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▼ 484.10 -2.55 -0.52% SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph — over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all — making space travel routine — in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs — whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” © Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images With SpaceX, Elon Musk aspires to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. Space is not orbit Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” “Not quite ‘rarest,’ ” Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult — landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast — about five miles per second — that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor — “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea — a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors.© Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. More than 700 people have bought tickets — at $250,000 each — to ride on his spacecraft. Dreams are born It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he’s proud that more than 700 people — more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space — have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.”© NASA/NASA via Getty Images Landed SpaceX rockets sit in Launch Complex 39 at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla. SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Commercial milestone The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. “We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered,” he said in an interview late last year. “And we’d love to see whether we’re correct about that.” Innovation revolution To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, “holds similar revolutionary potential.” He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground — including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. “When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine,” Allen said. “That’s the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts.” For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand — especially if they’re successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building “the highway to lower orbit” so that the next generation “will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space.” His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned “residential and light industrial,” he said. Musk is focused on Mars. “It’s fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can’t get there. You need to build the Union Pacific,” he said. “Once there’s a transportation link established to Mars, it’ll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don’t even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars.” That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, “because it is hard” pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos’s rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars.

It’s a brave – or perhaps desperate – company that’s willing to challenge French workers’ assumption that they get to spend a month en vacances but now Airbus, one of the country’s most high-profile businesses, is taking a stand.  Rather than simply bid bon voyage to its staff at the start of August, the pan-European plane-maker has offered overtime to workers at its Toulouse base as it battles to get production of its new A350XWB airliner on track. An A350 rolls out of the production centre in Toulouse Credit: Airbus The company has set itself a target of producing 50 of its twin-engine jets and is offering additional work to the 1,500 staff on the A350 production line as it hopes to take on rival Boeing’s similar sized 787 airliner, which came into service two years earlier. Hitting production targets on the A350, which seats 270 to 370 passengers and starts at $270m (£207m) for the smallest model, is crucial for Airbus after the programme ran into serious delays earlier this year. Work fell behind after suppliers of cabin fittings and toilets let Airbus down. Chief executive Fabrice Bregier singled out subcontractor Zodiac as a major cause of delays, using Airbus’s annual conference to publicly shame the company over its performance and saying it had been dropped as a supplier to another of company’s jets. Airbus boss Fabrice Bregier has blamed suppliers for delays with the A350 programme Credit: Bloomberg Aviation experts are eagerly watching output of the A350, with Airbus’s own figures showing it delivered 15 in the year to the end of July, with unofficial sources saying another three had since rolled out of the Toulouse plant. This means the company will have to significantly accelerate production rates to meet its target and avoid penalties for missing delivery slots. “Airbus has made commitments to airlines and is pulling out all the stops so it doesn’t face late delivery costs,” said Howard Wheeldon, an independent aviation analyst. “Yes, overtime is an additional cost but it’s probably cheaper than delivering a plane late.”  Saj Ahmad, analyst at Strategic Aero Research, added: “That Airbus is breaking its own norms by working through August points to desperation to get the A350 on track. There’s only so much blame it can peddle to suppliers – if they were the true pacing item, then why bother building aeroplanes through the summer that could be missing parts? “It would be a disaster for Airbus to miss its 50-aircraft target. The costs of the A350 programme aren’t coming down and delayed deliveries mean airlines seek compensation, so it’s a doubly whammy.”  Mr Ahmad added that if Airbus misses deliveries it could also drive customers to rival Boeing, which is increasing the rate at which it produces competitors to the A350.  A spokesman for Airbus said: “We have set up a timetable adaptation plan for employees at the A350 final assembly line in Toulouse in order to maintain sufficient resources during the summer season and to support the manufacturing flow. This plan involves the introduction of overtime.” Follow Telegraph Business READ MORE ABOUT: Airbus airline industry Boeing Show more Business latest 23 Nov 2016, 7:17pm Market report: Gold skids to nine-month low as dollar extends gains 23 Nov 2016, 7:07pm No relief for soaring business rates burden 00:38 23 Nov 2016, 6:56pm Britain’s debt mountain set to hit £2 trillion in the 2020s  23 Nov 2016, 6:46pm Thirteen things you need to know about the Autumn Statement  01:38 23 Nov 2016, 6:20pm Autumn Statement: Eurosceptic MPs accuses OBR of anti-Brexit forecasts as it says leaving EU will cost £60bn  23 Nov 2016, 6:18pm Comment: Hammond's fiscal blunder almost guarantees a hard-landing Ambrose Evans-Pritchard Premium 23 Nov 2016, 5:09pm Spring Statement and autumn Budget ahead as Hammond shakes up the fiscal calendar 23 Nov 2016, 4:22pm Autumn Statement 2016 calculator:  work out how your finances have changed 23 Nov 2016, 3:40pm Autumn Statement 2016: Five charts which show the state of the UK economy Premium 01:21 23 Nov 2016, 3:15pm When is Black Friday 2016 and who has the best deals? 23 Nov 2016, 2:47pm How the internet reacted to the Autumn Statement: The best tweets   23 Nov 2016, 2:43pm Phillip Hammond pledges to tackle the UK's productivity gap 23 Nov 2016, 2:37pm Comment: Phillip Hammond the cautious Chancellor failed to make any truly bold decisions Ben Wright Premium 51:36 23 Nov 2016, 1:39pm Autumn Statement 2016: The Chancellor's speech in full 01:32 23 Nov 2016, 1:38pm Autumn Statement 2016 summary and highlights: Everything you need to know 23 Nov 2016, 12:43pm Severn Trent outbid for Dee Valley Water amid jobs row 23 Nov 2016, 12:30pm House building contracts surge as industry shakes off post-referendum lull 23 Nov 2016, 12:18pm Hammerson expands European presence with outlet portfolio buy 23 Nov 2016, 11:58am 'Door is open' for Sir Philip Green to save the BHS pension scheme, watchdog says 23 Nov 2016, 11:44am Rio Tinto to sell Scottish aluminium smelter to Liberty for £330m 23 Nov 2016, 11:42am Eurozone business activity grows at fastest pace this year If you would like to add a comment, please register or log in Register Log in Contact us Rewards Archive Reader Prints Advertising Syndication Guidelines Privacy Terms and Conditions Leave your feedback © Telegraph Media Group Limited 2016

The stage for the rocket's debut: the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX's use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government's monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph - over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsize ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all - making space travel routine - in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin.     ▲ Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos says commercial space exploration can advance at the fast pace of Internet commerce only if the cost is reduced through advances in reusable rockets. Bloomberg photo While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended "learning period" that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. "When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs - whether it's a year from now or five years from now," she said, "the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?" Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they've apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there's something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That's what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos's Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket "the rarest of beasts." "Not quite 'rarest,' " Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult - landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: "Welcome to the club!" Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos's Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into "space," a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth's surface. But Musk's SpaceX spacecraft don't just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast - about five miles per second - that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch "Star Wars." Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor - "like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall," Musk said. Orbit and space "are different leagues," Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea - a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it.     ▲ Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson's goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. More than 700 people have bought tickets - at $250,000 each - to ride on his spacecraft. Washington Post photo by Ricky Carioti. The Washington Post And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a "phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that." Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn't have one qualified to carry people. "If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA's human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs," Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, "Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct." At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. "It was a seminal moment for me," he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. "A magic sculpture garden," he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency's website for its Mars plan but could not find one. "Because, of course, there had to be a schedule," he said in a 2012 speech. "And I couldn't find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn't on the website at all. Which was shocking." Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. "We're sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this," Musk said, "while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies." As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. "Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up," he wrote in his memoir. "For sheer adventure, you couldn't beat outer space." In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he's back. He's building Stratolaunch, that would become the world's largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and "air-launch" into orbit.     ▲ Paul G. Allen teamed with aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which was the first commercial vehicle to reach space in 2004. Now he's building Stratolaunch, the world's largest airplane. Vulcan Branson's goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he's proud that more than 700 people - more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space - have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. "Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore," Branson's Virgin Galactic says on its website. "But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet's seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves." The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world's first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. "We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered," he said in an interview late last year. "And we'd love to see whether we're correct about that." To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, "holds similar revolutionary potential." He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground - including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. "When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine," Allen said. "That's the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts." For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA's human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry "is on the crest of another wave." "There's a lot of hype," he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. "But will we be able to generate enough demand?" he said. "It can't just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?" Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand - especially if they're successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building "the highway to lower orbit" so that the next generation "will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space." His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned "residential and light industrial," he said.     ▲ SpaceX and Blue Origin both land their rocket boosters vertically, but the Falcon9's booster travels higher and much farther before it lands on a platform in the ocean. The Washington Post Musk is focused on Mars. "It's fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can't get there. You need to build the Union Pacific," he said. "Once there's a transportation link established to Mars, it'll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don't even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars." That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, "because it is hard" pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos's rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars. <저작권자 © 울산매일, 무단 전재 및 재배포 금지>  저작권 문의 워싱턴포스트 다른기사 보기 페이스북 이메일 기사 수정 :   2016-08-21 00:35   김동균 기자 웹출판 :   2016-08-21 00:33   관리자 입력.편집 :   2016-08-21 00:30   김동균 기자 icon오늘의 인기기사 비난 댓글 가득한 손연재 인스타그램 김기춘 "최순실 개입 몰라 자괴감…중정때 최태민 조사안해" '갤럭시노트7을 구하라' 김의성이 이승환을 "친구"라 불렀더니 생긴 일 벤츠 코리아 '더 뉴 E 200 아방가르드' 출시 비난 댓글 가득한 손연재 인스타그램 댓글 (200자평) 0개 전체보기 200자까지 쓰실 수 있습니다. 등록 ※ 비속어와 인신공격성 글 등은 바로 삭제됩니다. 특히, 근거 없는 글로 타인의 명예를 훼손하면 민·형사상 처벌을 받을 수 있습니다.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” ——— Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html     Tags: space, williams, shuttle, spacewalk, launch, flight, Other stories from today: Syria’s first responders: ‘Most dangerous job in the world’ Democrat Hernandez won’t campaign for congressional seat Spacewalking astronauts install new door for visitors     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   For what are you most thankful?

Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Aug 20, 2016 at 8:13AM Washington is getting ready to deliver a big load of cash to Israel. Image source: Getty Images. If I told you Washington is gearing up to deliver a big load of cash to Israel, to pay for military purchases, would that surprise you? If you've been keeping up with the news, probably not. But here's something that may surprise you: Much of the money America is planning to "give" to Israel as military aid is actually making a U-turn -- and coming right back into the pockets of U.S. defense contractors Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Raytheon (NYSE:RTN). The news Last month, the Obama administration asked Congress to increase the level of annual U.S. military aid to Israel from its current level -- about $3 billion a year -- to as much as $40 billion over 10 years. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget calls the new aid package, which is still under discussion, "the largest pledge of military assistance to any country in U.S. history." Historically, the U.S. has awarded military aid to client states on the condition that the funds awarded be spent on military equipment manufactured by U.S. suppliers. Israel, however, has been granted a unique exemption, allowing it to spend as much as 25% of its military aid on purchases from non-U.S. suppliers. Israel generally takes advantage of this exemption by using U.S. aid to buy weapons from Israeli manufacturers, helping to build up its own arms industry -- an industry that has, over the past few decades, developed into a competitor to U.S. companies. If the U.S. raises the amount of defense aid to the level Israel is seeking, one condition may be that Israel spends more of its military aid dollars here in the U.S. Spend...on what? Israel's military wish list reportedly includes F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets from Lockheed Martin and armored personnel carriers built with help from General Dynamics. But there's perhaps even greater interest in getting funds to pay for Israel's multiple missile defense initiatives: Iron Dome -- short-range missile defense against rockets and artillery shells. Arrow -- a hypersonic "theater" level defense system against ballistic missiles up to 150 km distant. David's Sling -- a two-stage system for shooting down tactical ballistic missiles, medium- to long-range rockets, and cruise missiles at distances up to 300 km. Israel also has an ultra-short-range Iron Dome derivative project under works. Dubbed "Iron Beam," it would use high-energy laser weapons to shoot down short-range rockets, artillery, and mortars too small to be effectively targeted by an anti-missile missile. And there's an Arrow derivative ("Arrow 3") that's being developed as a potential anti-satellite weapons. What it means to investors So, what does additional funding for Israeli missile defense mean for Boeing and Raytheon? Quite a lot, actually. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, about 9% of all U.S. funding for our own Missile Defense Agency is spent on Israeli missile defense programs. In particular, DefenseNews.com reports that the current U.S. 2017 defense budget contains $200 million in funding for development of Israel Aerospace Industries' Arrow missile defense systems. Boeing partners 50-50 with IAI on that project, so 50% of funding for Arrow must be spent buying equipment from Boeing. Similarly, Raytheon -- which partners 50-50 with Israel's Rafael on the Iron Dome and David's Sling missile defense systems -- stands to reap about $75 million in revenue this year from U.S. support of these two systems. To be clear, this is what the two defense contractors could receive from fiscal year 2017 funding alone -- and 2017 isn't even an especially "good" year in this regard. In 2014, for example, one single contract (to supply Israel with replacement interceptor missiles for the Iron Dome system) netted Raytheon nearly $150 million. Over the course of a new 10-year agreement including $40 billion (or even just $30 billion) in U.S. funding, the revenue opportunities for these companies will be even greater.

This is according to US adventurer and modern day Indiana Jones, Blaine Gibson, who has been investigating the disappearance. Gibson arrived in Durban on Friday to team up with Liam Lotter from KwaZulu-Natal, and Neels Kruger from Pretoria, who discovered debris confirmed to be from the missing Boeing 777. The flight was en route to Beijing when it disappeared. Lotter found debris on a Mozambique beach during the December holidays which was sent for analysis, and Neels Kruger found another piece on a Mossel Bay beach. Gibson also found debris on a sandbar off the Mozambique coast. Describing himself as “a lawyer who loves adventures and solving mysteries”, he confirmed he had spent many months searching for clues. He has also been to Madagascar where he found more debris believed to be from the missing plane. “An Ausralian oceanographer, who is doing the drift analysis, told me that the two most likely places debris from the plane would be found would be on the eastern coast of Madagascar and the eastern coast of South Africa, particularly Durban,” said Gibson. Gibson made contact with the two South Africans following their separate pieces of debris being confirmed as from the ill-fated flight. The three will travel to Port Shepstone tomorrow to begin a further search. Lotter, who is hosting Gibson at his home in Wartburg, said they would be walking along beaches from Port Shepstone up the coast to Durban. Kruger was already on the South Coast. Lotter and Gibson visited beaches in uMhlanga on Friday and Gibson said he did not believe that the Boeing had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean as has been speculated. ”I found three or four pieces of debris from the main cabin in Madagascar in June. Debris will not only tell us where the plane crashed, but also why. “I do not believe it could have been a controlled landing pilot suicide as has been speculated, but rather a high impact crash. Although I prefer to stay away from any theory. There are too many theories and not enough evidence,” said Gibson. He asked beachgoers to keep an eye out for any pieces of debris from the plane or even personal items, which could have washed ashore. “Pieces of the plane would be light grey or white and could look as though they are from a boat, surfboard or even a box,” said Gibson. Disappearance He added that he had gone to the first commemoration of the disappearance and had met many of the victims’ families. Lotter said he had become caught up in the search for the missing plane since finding his piece of debris and also asked that Durbanites keep their eyes open for any evidence that may have washed up on the beach. “A small piece of debris on the beach might not mean anything to you, but it could mean everything to one of the family members of the missing passengers,” said Lotter. Kruger said he realised that the possibility of finding another piece of the plane was a “needle in a haystack situation”, but that sharing their experiences with one another carried great value. “Sharing this with those who cross our paths would also help in future search efforts,” he said. Meanwhile, air crash investigators are planning to dump replica Boeing 777 wing flaps, fitted with satellite trackers, into the Indian Ocean in a last ditch effort to try to locate the elusive wreckage. An estimated 74 030km2 have been searched during the two-year operation to find the missing aircraft. In July, Malaysia, China and Australia agreed that the exhaustive hunt would be suspended once the current search of the south west portion of the Indian Ocean (from Australia) is completed. The hunt has cost in the region of $160-million (R2.1-billion).

The stage for the rocket’s debut: the Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Complex 39A, where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took off for the moon in 1969. SpaceX’s use of 39A is the ultimate symbol that the government’s monopoly on space travel is over. To Musk, it also is proof of an additional triumph — over his fellow billionaire and rival Jeffrey P. Bezos, who had fought to secure the launch pad for himself. Nearly five decades after the United States beat the Soviet Union to the moon, another space race is emerging, this time among a class of hugely wealthy entrepreneurs who have grown frustrated that space travel is in many ways still as difficult, and as expensive, as ever. Driven by ego, outsized ambition and opportunity, they are investing hundreds of millions of dollars of their own money in an attempt to open up space to the masses and push human space travel far past where governments have gone. Musk, who made his first fortune on Zip2 and PayPal, and Bezos, who founded Amazon and owns The Washington Post, are the most prominent of a quartet of billionaires aspiring to open the frontier of space the way the public-private partnerships of the 19th century pushed west at the dawn of the railroad age. The two others are Paul Allen, a Microsoft founder, and Virgin Group founder Richard Branson. All have upended industries, including retail, automobiles and credit cards, and are now embarking on the greatest disruption of all — making space travel routine — in a business long dominated by commercial-space contractors such as Boeing and Lockheed Martin. While their efforts have reignited interest in space, they also have raised moral complexities and regulatory challenges in pursuing an endeavor that is inherently dangerous. Congress has opted to regulate the industry only loosely, granting it an extended “learning period” that would allow companies to grow and to practice space travel. Already, one pilot has died in the quest to make commercial space travel a reality. But his sacrifice came in the service of a company, Scaled Composites that was operating a spacecraft for Virgin Galactic, not a government acting in the national interest. Some critics, such as Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Texas, said that safeguards should not be overlooked. “When the inevitable accident with significant loss of life occurs — whether it’s a year from now or five years from now,” she said, “the American public will look back at what we are doing today and ask how we could be so short-sighted?” Since late last year, when Musk and Bezos traded what were interpreted as barbs on Twitter over who pulled off the most daring feat in space, they’ve apparently entered a detente, with peace offerings, even words of encouragement. But there’s something about the exchanges that still bothers Musk, who in a recent interview wanted to make it clear: Space is not orbit. That’s what he meant when he lit up Twitter after Bezos’s Blue Origin flew a rocket to the edge of space and landed it at its West Texas test range, a feat that NASA has never achieved. Bezos declared the reusable rocket “the rarest of beasts.” “Not quite ‘rarest,’ “ Musk shot back, pointing out that SpaceX has previously launched rockets in test flights and landed them after relatively short trips. In a series of tweets, he vowed something even more spectacular, and difficult — landing a much larger and more powerful rocket capable of traveling many times the speed of sound, which is required for going into orbit. Later, after SpaceX landed its Falcon 9 rocket, Bezos tweeted what many considered a backhanded compliment: “Welcome to the club!” Months later, Musk still was fixated on it. Bezos’s Blue Origin may have crossed the boundary into “space,” a somewhat arbitrary barrier generally agreed as starting at 62 miles above Earth’s surface. But Musk’s SpaceX spacecraft don’t just go up; they go up and out, following an arc and moving so fast — about five miles per second — that they stay aloft and can circle the Earth in less time than it takes to watch “Star Wars.” Reaching the threshold of space is a somewhat simple up and down endeavor — “like shooting a cannon ball up and then the cannon ball falls down for four minutes of free fall,” Musk said. Orbit and space “are different leagues,” Musk said. The tension began appearing in legal briefs in 2014. SpaceX challenged a patent held by Blue Origin that gave it the right to land rockets on floating barges at sea — a feat SpaceX has now pulled off multiple times. The point of landing the rockets, though is to reuse them, which then would dramatically lower the cost of space flight. SpaceX has yet to refly any of its rockets, however. Blue Origin, by contrast, has flown the same booster four times in test flights, showing that recovering the rocket is not the same as reusing it. And there was Launch Complex 39A. Musk won the lease in 2013, but Blue Origin filed a legal protest, arguing that the criteria NASA used to come to its decision were flawed. Musk derided the protest as a “phony blocking tactic and an obvious one at that.” Blue Origin had not yet sent a rocket to space, which Musk eagerly pointed out, and didn’t have one qualified to carry people. “If they do somehow show up in the next 5 years with a vehicle qualified to NASA’s human rating standards that can dock with the Space Station, which is what 39A is meant to do, we will gladly accommodate their needs,” Musk wrote in an email published at SpaceNews.com. Then in a taunt that shot across the Internet, he added, “Frankly, I think we are more likely to discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct.” At the time, Blue Origin was tight lipped about the remarks. But years later, it responded by announcing that Bezos had secured a spot of his own at Cape Canaveral: Launch Complex 36, just down the road from 39A, so he and Musk will be neighbors. It was supposed to have happened by now: Space tourism. Bases on the moon. Humans to Mars and beyond. The next giant leap. And the next. Bezos was 5 years old during the Apollo 11 moon landing and remembers watching it on his living room television with his parents and grandparents. “It was a seminal moment for me,” he has said. In 2013, he embarked on a three-week quest to recover from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean the F-1 engines used in the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets. Using deep-water rovers, his team found its quarry: castaway engine parts, more than three miles down, deeper than the wreck of the Titanic. Where others might have seen piles of rusted debris fit for a junkyard, Bezos saw art. “A magic sculpture garden,” he called it. After Musk sold his first company, Zip2, to Compaq, for more than $300 million, he started thinking more seriously about space exploration and wondered when NASA was planning on getting to Mars. He searched the space agency’s website for its Mars plan but could not find one. “Because, of course, there had to be a schedule,” he said in a 2012 speech. “And I couldn’t find it. I thought the problem was me. Because, of course, it must be here somewhere on this website, but just well-hidden. And it turned out it wasn’t on the website at all. Which was shocking.” Musk, who also runs Tesla Motors, plans to send an uncrewed spacecraft to Mars as soon as 2018, and hopes that people could arrive by 2025. While that seemingly impossible goal remains aspirational, SpaceX continues to build bigger and more powerful rockets, and has disrupted the existing commercial and military launch markets by offering affordable and transparent prices. Last year, however, a unmanned Falcon 9 rocket carrying cargo to the International Space Station blew up, forcing the company to delay all launches for six months. But it now has a backlog of more than 70 missions representing more than $10 billion in revenue. “We’re sort of checking the various boxes that are needed to do this,” Musk said, “while providing useful services to NASA and commercial companies.” As a child, Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, knew the names of the Mercury 7 astronauts, as if they were the star players of his favorite baseball team. “Like countless other boys, I planned to become an astronaut when I grew up,” he wrote in his memoir. “For sheer adventure, you couldn’t beat outer space.” In 2004, Allen teamed up with legendary aerospace engineer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, which won the Ansari X Prize, a $10 million contest, and became the first commercial vehicle to reach space. Allen licensed the rights to the technology behind the spacecraft to Branson and concentrated on other interests. But now he’s back. He’s building Stratolaunch, that would become the world’s largest airplane with a wingspan wider than a football field, end zones included. It is designed to carry a rocket tethered to its belly to an altitude of about 35,000 feet. The rocket would drop away from the plane, fire its engines and “air-launch” into orbit. Branson’s goal is to create the first commercial spaceline. And he’s proud that more than 700 people — more than the approximately 550 people who have actually been to space — have bought tickets to ride on his spacecraft, some paying as much as $250,000. “Perhaps it is in our culture, perhaps it is in our DNA, or perhaps it is a bit of each of those, but we humans seem hard-wired to explore,” Branson’s Virgin Galactic says on its website. “But because government space agencies are not asked to help ordinary citizens to become astronauts, most of our planet’s seven billion people have had no opportunity to experience space and all of its possibilities for themselves.” The last time the United States was not able to launch its own astronauts to space, the hiatus lasted 2,098 days, from the last of the Apollo-era missions in 1975 to the first space shuttle flight in 1981. Today, NASA is again in a hiatus, this one beginning when the shuttles were retired in 2011. But now there is a painful twist: The United States has to rely on Russia, the country it bested in the Cold War race to the moon, to ferry U.S. astronauts to and from the International Space Station. That is expected to end by late 2017, or early 2018, when a cadre of carefully chosen NASA astronauts would board a spacecraft on the Florida Space Coast and launch from U.S. soil. That historic moment would feature a rocket that for the first time would be owned and operated by a commercial company, not NASA. Today, SpaceX and Boeing, the companies that NASA is entrusting with the lives of its astronauts, are vying to see which will fly first. The victor would become the company that restores U.S. human spaceflight in what would be one of the most tense and dramatic launches in decades. Then could come the birth of regular commercial space-tourism trips. Wealthy ticketed passengers, fresh off days of space training camp, could board a private spacecraft, buckle into luxurious window seats and shoot just past the edge of space, where they would float weightless, joining the ranks of the world’s first space tourists in a flight that would last several minutes. Virgin Galactic had said its first flight would be as early as 2009, but that has been delayed again and again, most recently when an aircraft came apart during a test flight, killing the co-pilot. Since then, the company has rebounded, unveiling its new spacecraft earlier this year. While Virgin Galactic no longer gives a timeline, Bezos has said he believes Blue Origin could start taking tourists by 2018. Branson and Bezos, both known to prize customer service, are honing their sales pitches, one promising a concierge to the cosmos and the other promoting windows the size of doors for a better view. But while the companies say they are not in a race to see who flies customers first, some corporate jockeying is underway. Branson has said he thinks people would prefer the comforts of SpaceShipTwo, a space plane that would land on a runway, over a rocket launch that would propel a thimble-like capsule into space and then land under parachutes. “We believe going into space in a spaceship and coming back in that spaceship, on wheels, will be a customer experience that people would prefer than perhaps one or two other options that are being considered,” he said in an interview late last year. “And we’d love to see whether we’re correct about that.” To these space barons, the dawn of this new Space Age is similar to the advent of the personal computer and the Internet. Regular access to space is a new catalyst for innovation, one that as Allen recently said, “holds similar revolutionary potential.” He, Musk and Branson have plans to launch constellations of small satellites. These satellites could more affordably beam the Internet to the billions who are not now connected, provide better communication and allow companies and governments to continuously monitor events on the ground — including phenomena as diverse as wars and agriculture. “When such access to space is routine, innovation will accelerate in ways beyond what we can currently imagine,” Allen said. “That’s the thing about new platforms: When they become easily available, convenient and affordable, they attract and enable other visionaries and entrepreneurs to realize more new concepts.” For years, many have been waiting for the commercial space industry to become a real market, one where companies actually make money and prosper. William Gerstenmaier, the head of NASA’s human spaceflight division, said he thinks that the industry “is on the crest of another wave.” “There’s a lot of hype,” he said at a Federal Aviation Administration space conference this year, citing other times when industry felt it was on the cusp of revolutionary change. “But will we be able to generate enough demand?” he said. “It can’t just be solely government demand. It has to be augmented by the private sector. . . . Will that be enough to push us over or to reach that tipping point that actually enables this industry to become more self-sufficient than it was in the past?” Bezos, Branson and others are betting that there will be enough demand — especially if they’re successful in getting to space quickly and easily, like flying a plane. Bezos has talked about building “the highway to lower orbit” so that the next generation “will be able to use that heavy infrastructure that I put in place so there can be a huge dynamic entrepreneurial explosion in space.” His goal is eventually to establish such a transportation link that all heavy industry could be moved off Earth into space, where companies could mine asteroids for their precious metals. Earth, then, could be preserved as if it were exclusively zoned “residential and light industrial,” he said. Musk is focused on Mars. “It’s fundamentally about transport. Without transport you can’t get there. You need to build the Union Pacific,” he said. “Once there’s a transportation link established to Mars, it’ll open up incredible entrepreneurial opportunities for anyone that wants to go there and establish everything from the first iron foundry to the first pizza joint to things we don’t even conceive of on Earth that are just new on Mars.” That effort will be exceedingly difficult, and likely even fatal, he said. The timeline Musk has laid out is incredibly ambitious, with the first unmanned flight coming as soon as 2018. Of the 43 robotic missions to Mars, including fly-bys, attempted by four countries, only 18 have been total successes. No private company has ever dared try it before, and SpaceX has yet to fly the Falcon Heavy, which has been delayed repeatedly because of technical challenges. In the past, such bold, “because it is hard” pronouncements were made by presidents, not billionaires. But Musk and Bezos are now cast in a sort of Cold War reenactment, performing the roles once held exclusively by nations and their heroes. Bezos’s rocket is named after the first American astronaut, Alan Shepard, who reached the edge of space in a 15-minute ride in 1961. But unlike his Soviet counterpart, Yuri Gagarin, Shepard did not reach orbit. That would not happen for the Americans until the next year, when John Glenn rode a more powerful rocket. Bezos, too, is preparing his next giant leap: producing by the end of the decade a rocket that can reach orbit. By then, though, Musk could be shooting for Mars.

But their crew capsules cannot dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle set-up and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles,” announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias.

This commercial hand-off is freeing up Nasa to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s.

An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a range of hooks and cables. Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250 mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians.   0 Share this 0 Share this 0 Last updated: 19 August 2016, 19:40 BST Advertisement Latest news videos Advertisement Most Popular Most read Most shared 1 What causes dark circles under your eyes? 2 Autumn Statement: What will be announced? 3 How to fix your Windows 10 Start menu 4 Mortgage mistake thousands are making 5 Strictly star speaks out after street attack Advertisement   Please note: Comments must be on topic and relevant to the article or subject.

AP This image provided by NASA shows American astronauts Jeffrey Williams, left, and Kate Rubins taking a spacewalk to hook up a docking port. AP By MARCIA DUNN / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. – Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port – their major objective – in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half-hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral, Fla., in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now-obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed.

An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights – intended to go all the way to the space station and dock – will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular Teen in coma after getting hit by metal object through car's windshield on 57 freeway Police officer, wife die in possible murder-suicide in Long Beach Gas station employee stabbed in Anaheim, two suspects in custody Congressman Issa declares re-election win in 49th district Judge denies Muslim women's request to drop trespassing claim in Urth Caffe lawsuit User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Picture: Zanele Zulu Durban - Durban beaches could hold vital clues in the mystery of the missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 flight which disappeared with 239 passengers and crew on board, shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur in March 2014. This is according to US adventurer and modern day Indiana Jones, Blaine Gibson, who has been investigating the disappearance. Gibson arrived in Durban on Friday to team up with Liam Lotter from KwaZulu-Natal, and Neels Kruger from Pretoria, who discovered debris confirmed to be from the missing Boeing 777. The flight was en route to Beijing when it disappeared. Lotter found debris on a Mozambique beach during the December holidays which was sent for analysis, and Neels Kruger found another piece on a Mossel Bay beach. Gibson also found debris on a sandbar off the Mozambique coast. Describing himself as “a lawyer who loves adventures and solving mysteries”, he confirmed he had spent many months searching for clues. He has also been to Madagascar where he found more debris believed to be from the missing plane. “An Ausralian oceanographer, who is doing the drift analysis, told me that the two most likely places debris from the plane would be found would be on the eastern coast of Madagascar and the eastern coast of South Africa, particularly Durban,” said Gibson. Gibson made contact with the two South Africans following their separate pieces of debris being confirmed as from the ill-fated flight. The three will travel to Port Shepstone tomorrow to begin a further search. Lotter, who is hosting Gibson at his home in Wartburg, said they would be walking along beaches from Port Shepstone up the coast to Durban. Kruger was already on the South Coast. Lotter and Gibson visited beaches in uMhlanga on Friday and Gibson said he did not believe that the Boeing had crashed in the southern Indian Ocean as has been speculated. ”I found three or four pieces of debris from the main cabin in Madagascar in June. Debris will not only tell us where the plane crashed, but also why. “I do not believe it could have been a controlled landing pilot suicide as has been speculated, but rather a high impact crash. Although I prefer to stay away from any theory. There are too many theories and not enough evidence,” said Gibson. He asked beachgoers to keep an eye out for any pieces of debris from the plane or even personal items, which could have washed ashore. “Pieces of the plane would be light grey or white and could look as though they are from a boat, surfboard or even a box,” said Gibson. Disappearance He added that he had gone to the first commemoration of the disappearance and had met many of the victims’ families. Lotter said he had become caught up in the search for the missing plane since finding his piece of debris and also asked that Durbanites keep their eyes open for any evidence that may have washed up on the beach. “A small piece of debris on the beach might not mean anything to you, but it could mean everything to one of the family members of the missing passengers,” said Lotter. Kruger said he realised that the possibility of finding another piece of the plane was a “needle in a haystack situation”, but that sharing their experiences with one another carried great value. “Sharing this with those who cross our paths would also help in future search efforts,” he said. Meanwhile, air crash investigators are planning to dump replica Boeing 777 wing flaps, fitted with satellite trackers, into the Indian Ocean in a last ditch effort to try to locate the elusive wreckage. An estimated 74 030km2 have been searched during the two-year operation to find the missing aircraft. In July, Malaysia, China and Australia agreed that the exhaustive hunt would be suspended once the current search of the south west portion of the Indian Ocean (from Australia) is completed. The hunt has cost in the region of $160-million (R2.1-billion).

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port _ their major objective _ in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013.

Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides _ at a hefty price for US taxpayers. NASA started using private US companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one _ cobbled together from spare parts _ should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position _ the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights _ intended to go all the way to the space station and dock _ will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” Express TechIE Samsung Galaxy S7 Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Gionee S6 Xiaomi Mi 5 Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaPakistan says three of its soldiers killed in cross border firing; 'response to ceasefire violations,' says Army BusinessHuge surge in Jan Dhan account deposits, Rs 21,000 crore mobilised IndiaNavjot Kaur Sidhu, Pargat Singh will join Congress on Nov 28: Amarinder Singh IndiaDemonetisation logjam: Govt reaches out to Opposition, PM likely to attend RS tomorrow BusinessFormer Tata Steel honcho rebuts Cyrus Mistry charges on Corus buy EntertainmentAlia Bhatt is like Jennifer Lawrence: a star who’s also terrific actor EntertainmentBefikre's song Khulke-Dhulke: Ranveer Singh, Vaani Kapoor and a Bollywood Punjabi wedding, watch video EntertainmentBaahubali 2 leaked scene may have done more good than harm EntertainmentSalman Khan meets his onscreen son Ali Haji after nine years.

The spacewalk took place to install the new docking mechanism, the first of two International Docking Adapters (IDA) onto Pressurized Mating Adapter-2. The mission was of 6 hours. These ports will work as parking places for the private space crafts that are expected on ISS soon. The two astronauts are Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins. This was the fourth walk for Jeff outside the station, of his career, whereas flight engineer Rubins walked for the first time after practicing. The port is delicate as it has the automatic parking system instead of grapple and berthing which is carried out by astronauts. It has all the necessary power and data connections The adapter is developed by Boeing which is circular in shape, with the height of 42 inches and width of 63 inches. It will work along with Boeing’s CST 100 Starliner and SpaceX’s crew dragon. The equipment is installed on SpaceX Dragon Cargo spacecraft which arrived on 20th July 2016 on the station. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a “very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability.” The only work of the astronauts after they set foot off the station is to tether the adaptor. Most of the work would have been completed by “Dextre” Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), which is Canadarm2 robotic arm by pushing the adaptor closer to the installation point. SPDM is a very sophisticated device, it can’t be used on Earth as it can’t support its own weight. However, in space due to lack of external forces and gravity it works, but has to be handled carefully. The second addition of the docking adaptor will be worked upon by 2018.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins on Friday floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Ms Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $US70 million ($A91 million) per person. During Friday's spacewalk, Mr Williams and Ms Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle's docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $US100 billion ($A130 billion) research laboratory that flies about 400 km above Earth. "It's a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Mr Williams and Ms Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port's installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Mr Williams' spacesuit, Mr Navias said. Mr Williams and Ms Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on September 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station's exterior frame.

Related News/Archive Hillsborough deputies: Alligator comes knocking at Plant City home's front door 7 Months Ago New gates installed at Ben T. Davis Beach to eliminate racing 7 Months Ago New black museum prepared to deal with visitors' emotions (w/video) 2 Months Ago The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-by-5-feet-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the southwestern U.S., possibly New Mexico.

At left is Expedition 48 Commander Jeff Williams. (NASA via AP) AP Friday, August 19, 2016 NAPA, Calif. -- Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month, packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule. RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Napa native on 1st space mission aboard ISS Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides - at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. WATCH VIDEO: Napa native heading to ISS for 4-month mission NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one - cobbled together from spare parts - should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position - the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. WATCH VIDEO: Napa native heading to ISS on 1st space mission A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights - intended to go all the way to the space station and dock - will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again."

Privacy Policy Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins on Friday floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $US70 million ($A91 million) per person. During Friday's spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle's docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $US100 billion ($A130 billion) research laboratory that flies about 400 km above Earth. "It's a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port's installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams' spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on September 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station's exterior frame. © RAW 2016 Send your photos, videos and stories to 9NEWS Email contact@9news.com.au Large files 9news.wetransfer.com You can remain anonymous.

The company has successfully delivered supplies to the International Space Station, landed several first stage boosters and is currently fighting Boeing to win NASA‘s astronaut contract. But we’re just a few months away from another significant milestone in the company’s lifespan, as it readies a beast of a rocket, dubbed the Falcon Heavy. The most powerful rocket in operation The rocket is set to carry a bigger payload to orbit than the Space Shuttle. That’s 54.4 tonnes as opposed to the Shuttle’s 24 tonnes. Only the Apollo-era Saturn V rockets were capable of lofting heavier cargo, with a maximum payload of 140 tonnes. Then again, the Saturn V is no longer used, leaving the Falcon Heavy on top. Related: 12 important space missions, events to look forward to in 2017 Still not convinced? SpaceX’s website has a better way of conveying the new rocket’s power… “Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner–complete with passengers, luggage and fuel — to orbit.” SpaceX took the Kerbal route The Falcon Heavy is essentially a Falcon 9 with two extra Falcon 9 rocket boosters attached to it – an approach akin to Kerbal Space Program, really. Even the second stage of the rocket is mostly identical to the standard Falcon 9 second stage. The result is that SpaceX is able to drive down costs by using this existing technology. In fact, the company claims to out-lift the current US heavy-lift king (the Delta IV Heavy) for “one-third the cost”. Landing three boosters at once? SpaceX envisions the new rocket to be very reusable – at least as reusable as the Falcon 9. SpaceX: ‘Falcon Heavy can lift the equivalent of a fully loaded 737 jetliner–complete with passengers, luggage and fuel — to orbit’ We all saw those impressive first stage rocket landings, but SpaceX will try to land all three Falcon Heavy boosters in the same fashion. At least if the aforementioned SpaceX video is to be believed… Will this be done on the first test flight though? SpaceX has applied for two more landing pads to be constructed at the Kennedy Space Centre.. First flight in December 2016 The Falcon Heavy is set to undergo its first proper test flight in December, but details beyond this aren’t clear just yet. SpaceX seems to be against carrying client payloads, but a report from Space Flight Now suggests that the company might reconsider its plans. It will be capable of missions to the Moon, Mars and beyond The new rocket has also been designed for missions beyond Low Earth Orbit and the International Space Station. “Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars,” the company explained on its website. It will also be capable of carrying cargo to other worlds — SpaceX claims the ability to carry 13.6 tonnes to Mars and 2.9 tonnes to Pluto.

More Comments LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon CANBERRA, Australia — Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. Related Pilot of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 plotted a simulated route to the middle of the Indian Ocean MH370: Debris discovered off south Australian coast means missing plane’s wreckage could span 10,000 km Severe Asia-Pacific pilot shortage poses significant opportunity for trainers “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres and 6,100 metres a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometres of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometre high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometres and 1,900 kilometres from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. SpaceX delivered the new gateway last month, packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without the new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for the future spaceships. “We have a new port of call for the new U.S. commercial crew vehicles,” announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person test of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years ago. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. The commercial handoff is allowing NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the station's airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASA's now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person. During Friday's spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttle's docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. "It's a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeing's debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking port's installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams' spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on Sept. 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the station's exterior frame.

The space agency is seeking a commercial owner to take over the space station sometime in the mid-2020s as it continues to plan for a manned Mars mission, NASA Deputy Associate Administrator Bill Hill told Digital Trends. “NASA’s trying to develop economic development in low-earth orbit. Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-earth orbit.” <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PG6JmKUpTsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The space station is already living on borrowed time. It was scheduled to be deorbited this year, but the Obama administration extended federal funding for the ISS through to 2024 so it could help conduct research for a manned Mars mission. So far, NASA hasn’t announced a buyer for the most expensive real estate in history, but the obvious choices would be SpaceX or Boeing, both of which are scheduled to start sending astronauts into orbit starting next year. Their presence at the ISS is why NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are going space walking this week to finish installing a new docking adapter. Since NASA decommissioned the space shuttle program in 2011, the agency has been paying Russia millions to take its astronauts into orbit. SpaceX has been running resupply missions to the ISS since 2012, and starting next year, the space travel company will join Boeing in breaking Russia’s monopoly on space taxis. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhGydridbEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The influx of commercial operators in space is what allows NASA to back away from the ISS as it continues to plan for a manned mission to Mars. SpaceX has already completed nine resupply mission to the ISS, but CEO Elon Musk seems more intent on colonizing Mars than building more space stations. Boeing, on the other hand, has made no plans to reach Mars so they could be a strong possibility as a buyer. There’s also a chance the space station could be acquired by Deep Space Industries, an asteroid mining company that plans to launch their first spacecraft by 2020. The company plans on using water found on asteroids in the form of ice as fuel. It hopes to sell the fuel to other space travel companies operating in orbit, but to do so, it will first need a location to set up its gas station. Other contenders for the most coveted real estate available to mankind are Orbital ATK and Sierra Nevada, both of which have booked space taxi contracts with NASA to ferry supplies to the space station for the next eight years. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UGjZahSG-w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> The two space travel companies have also won contracts to design and build deep space habitats for NASA astronauts on long haul missions. The commercial space taxi contracts open space that was previously used for cargo, so NASA plans to add a seventh astronaut to the crew of the International Space Station to increase research opportunities in low-earth orbit. Meanwhile, Russia’s Roscosmos space agency is backing away from its role in the space station; the agency just announced it’s considering reducing its crew from three to two, according to RT. “If you look at the original plan, it envisioned the launch of Multipurpose Laboratory Module to the ISS, and only then a crew increase. But MLM launch was postponed several times, while the crew nevertheless was increased.” Russia also has some stake in the real estate on the ISS, and it’s not clear what that would mean for a space station sale. What do you think of NASA’s plan to sell off the International Space Station to a commercial investor?

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month, packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. Article Continued Below SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial hand-off is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 ½-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX’s crew Dragon ship will fly on the company’s own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission’s end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing’s Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance’s trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, “Hey, now that they’ve retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?” “We can’t tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be,” Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. “But we’re well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again.” Read more about: Spacex The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over the bureau’s leadership last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the US$160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area, which includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales, made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters and 6,100 meters a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 meters a minute would be typical of a controlled descent.

(Boeing via AP) Spacewalking astronauts install new front door for visitors Last Modified: Friday, August 19, 2016 11:50 AM By The Associated Press CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. SpaceX delivered this new gateway last month, packed in the trunk of a Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position — the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19, 2011, to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator. A newcomer to spacewalking, Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launch pad at Kennedy Space Center and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American Southwest, possibly New Mexico. These test flights — intended to go all the way to the space station and dock — will last about two weeks. NASA will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots. One of four NASA astronauts training for these test flights, Robert Behnken noted last week that the space agency has come a long way since 2011, when he kept being asked, "Hey, now that they've retired the shuttle, is there still a NASA?" "We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again."

Officials are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 - a wing flap - most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives. The next phase of the deep-sea sonar search is being planned in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers turns up nothing. But a new search would require a new funding commitment. Malaysia, Australia and China agreed in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted. Divers have been searching over 120,000 square kilometres of the southern Indian Ocean off Western Australia, but the search is expected to end without more funding French gendarmes and police stand near a large piece of plane debris which was found on the beach in Saint-Andre, on the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion in July last year 'If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,' Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood said. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. WASHED UP DEBRIS: THE SEARCH FOR MISSING MH370  The first piece of debris believed to have come from MH370 was discovered last July on a beach on Reuinion island in the Indian Ocean. Experts believed that the debris was one of the plane's flaperon and that other debris that washed up on the shore was suitcase items from China and Indonesia. Later that year in December a grey piece of debris was found in southern Mozambique thought to belong to the aircraft. Two months later an object with the words 'no step' then washed up off the coast of the African country. Then in March this year, an engine part was found in South Africa while in Apirl the segment of a flap track fairing and part of a horizontal stabiliser were found off Mozambique. Officials say it was almost certainly from MH370. Meanwhile on Monday, investigators in Australia on said they were examining a wing flap found last month on an East African island The 'large piece of aircraft debris' arrived at the Australian Transport Safety Bureau headquarters in the capital, Canberra, for examination. Replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's oceanography department in Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available.  If more money becomes available the Australian bureau plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from.  The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers. 'Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,' Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours.  Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood in is Canberra office  Police officers inspect metallic debris found on a beach in Saint-Denis on the French Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean in August last year The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing.  What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel.  Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters after both engines lost power.

Share this article Share But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible.  Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau's analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters after both engines lost power French police officers carry a piece of debris, the first trace of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, in Saint-Andre, Reunion Island Less than 10,000 square kilometers of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometer high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone.  These are between 2,700 kilometers and 1,900 kilometers from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. 'We are still hopeful and optimistic,' said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. 'We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,' Foley said.  Photo taken on Jul.29, 2015, shows a piece of debris on Reunion Island Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area (stock image) Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters and 6,100 meters a minute before it crashed.  A rate of 600 meters a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. 'The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it's found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,' Foley said. 'If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking,' he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter swells could take them until December to finish scanning.

 US astronauts begin spacewalk to install new docking port Kerry Sheridan, AFP Aug. 19, 2016, 9:31 AM 28 facebook linkedin twitter email print US astronaut Kate Rubins works on the docking port of the International Space Station on August 19, 2016 © NASA TV/AFP Lizabeth Menzies Miami (AFP) - With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk Friday to install a special parking spot for them. The spacewalk began at 8:04 (1204 GMT) when Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins switched their spacesuits to internal battery power.  Shortly afterward, they made their way outside the orbiting laboratory to begin the work of attaching an international docking adaptor, launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA describes the gear as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be installed in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called Friday's installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process, which is managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. - Rubins's first spacewalk - Williams is making his fourth career spacewalk. He has accumulated 19 hours of spacewalk time in his life. The spacewalk is Rubins's first. But the work will be hardly brand new for her. She has already practiced the necessary maneuvers, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. She is the 12th woman to walk in space. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. Late Wednesday, the space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship, placing it next to the station's Harmony module for installation. The last US spacewalk was on January 15, when a problem with American Tim Kopra's spacesuit allowed a small amount of water to build up inside his helmet by the end of the outing. It was the latest in a series of spacesuit issues, but was not as severe as an emergency in 2013 when Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet flooded, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, Todd said. NASA commentator Rob Navias said the US space agency has done a thorough review of the spacesuits being worn by Rubins and Williams, and they are in "excellent shape" for Friday's spacewalk. NASA is planning another spacewalk on September 1 to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time," he added.

Experts use drift modeling to define new MH370 search zone World by Rod McGuirk, The Associated Press Posted Aug 19, 2016 6:48 am MST Last Updated Aug 19, 2016 at 8:00 am MST Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood in his office on Thursday, Aug.18, 2016, in Canberra, Australia.

(AP Photo/Rod McGuirk) CANBERRA, Australia – Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometres (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometres (340 miles). “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres (12,000 feet) and 6,100 metres (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometres (4,000 square miles) of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometre (23,000-square-mile) high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometres (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometres (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

Americans Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins hooked up the docking port in just a few hours. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments SpaceX delivered the new gateway last month, packed in a Dragon cargo capsule. Americans have not rocketed into orbit from their home turf since Nasa's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in another year or two. But their crew capsules cannot dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle set-up and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "We have a new port of call for the new US commercial crew vehicles," announced Mission Control commentator Rob Navias. SpaceX is aiming for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides - at a hefty price for US taxpayers. Nasa started using private US companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger step. This commercial hand-off is freeing up Nasa to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually Nasa's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. Nasa ultimately wants two of these ports at the lab. Another one - cobbled together from spare parts - should fly up in about a year. Flight controllers in Houston set the spacewalking stage earlier in the week, using a robot arm to move the docking port to within a few feet of its intended lock-down position - the very spot where Atlantis undocked on July 19 2011 to close out the shuttle era. An hour into Friday's spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Mr Williams and Ms Rubins took over, connecting a range of hooks and cables. Soon, all 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port as the 250 mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Mr Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a few weeks. Mr Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Ms Rubins on September 1 to retract a radiator. Mr Williams, a veteran spacewalker, was the first one through the hatch on Friday morning. "Come on out," he urged Ms Rubins. "The view is phenomenal," Ms Rubins said before getting straight to work. Ms Rubins is only the 11th American woman to conduct a spacewalk and the 12th in the world. The first professional virus-hunter in space, she has been experimenting with a DNA decoder also delivered last month. SpaceX's crew Dragon ship will fly on the company's own Falcon rocket from a former shuttle launchpad at Kennedy Space Centre and, at mission's end, splash down off the Florida coast. Boeing's Starliner, meanwhile, will launch aboard the United Launch Alliance's trusty Atlas V rocket and parachute down somewhere in the American south west, possibly New Mexico. These test flights - intended to go all the way to the space station and dock - will last about two weeks. Nasa will provide most if not all of the initial test pilots.

(NASA via AP) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised the crew. Advertisement Continue reading Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed.

An hour into Friday’s spacewalk, the mechanical arm let go, and Williams and Rubins took over, connecting a slew of hooks and cables. The last of the 12 hooks were driven into place, firmly securing the port, as the 250-mile-high complex soared over the Indian Ocean. The space station is currently home to two Americans, one Japanese and three Russians. Up there for five months, Williams and two of the Russians will return to Earth in a couple weeks. Williams will conduct one more spacewalk with Rubins on Sept. 1 to retract a radiator.

Space Station--NASA/Newsmakers/Getty Images Advertisement After 15 years as a pure research lab, the International Space Station might be ready for business. NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” Popular Now What the 2016 Elections Mean for Manufacturers Top US Trading Partners Millennial Recruiting Magic: Solutions from Manufacturers Large and Small NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an e-mail. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an e-mail. Orbital ATK Inc. (IW500/277), which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a testbed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. (IW500/9) and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. On Friday, two ISS crew members will install a new docking port to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body—from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure—as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science ... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and nonprofit organizations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams' helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. "We're done for the day," Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit's cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker's drowning in 2013. The station's new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven't rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA's last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can't dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday's success paved the way for these future spaceships. "Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station," Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA's second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these 3 1/2-foot-by-5-foot-on-the-inside parking places at the lab. Another one — cobbled together from spare parts — should fly up in about a year.

US astronauts prepare spacewalk to install new docking port Technology Friday 19 August 2016 - 11:33am File: NASA describes the equipment as 'a metaphorical gateway to a future' that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft to park automatically. Photo: REUTERS / NASA / Handout MIAMI - With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts are  to embark on a spacewalk on Friday to install a special parking spot for them. Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins will step outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. The docking adapter was robotically moved from @SpaceX Dragon last night to get ready for tomorrow's #spacewalk.https://t.co/e7fFUlyeDi — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 18, 2016 NASA describes the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft -- the first since the space shuttle programme ended in 2011 -- to carry astronauts to the space station. Set your alarm! 2 astronauts will perform a #spacewalk tomorrow. Watch starting at 6:30am ET https://t.co/AbGYg6kenq pic.twitter.com/SC7oTKTZeP — NASA (@NASA) August 19, 2016 The docking adaptor will be the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability". Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures about a metre high and about 1.6 metres wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that will enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. The spacewalk is set to start at 8:05 am (1205 GMT) with veteran NASA astronaut Williams emerging from the space station airlock on his fourth career spacewalk. Flight engineer Rubins will be making her first venture outside the ISS. But the work will hardly be brand new for her. She has already practised the necessary manoeuvres, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. A series of spacewalks last year have helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it centimetres from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers -- also known as extravehicular (EV) crew -- are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts will have only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM. "In space, it has a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." NASA is planning a second spacewalk on 1 September for a separate operation to retract one of the thermal radiators outside the space station. Astronauts unsuccessfully tried to push it back into position last year, Todd said. "We will go back here in a couple of weeks and restow that guy for its final time." However, a problem with an American spacesuit that appeared to allow water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved, he added. Tests on the suit back on Earth showed an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's heating and cooling loops. Although it worked well in simulation tests, a blockage in a secondary set of holes might still react differently in zero gravity, Todd said. Watch to see how we’re working to send astronauts to deep space destinations: https://t.co/Um9MW4Dpd0 #NASAMarsDay https://t.co/tZBnz5QfIk — NASA (@NASA) August 18, 2016 The issue was not as severe as a spacesuit breakdown in 2013 that flooded Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's helmet, forcing him to end his spacewalk early, he added. NASA has been using the same spacesuits for some 30 years, continuing to study what makes them work and fail, Todd said. "We are still learning how to use this suit and how to care for them in a zero-gravity environment -- and it is not the same as what we do on the ground." AFP Comment Now!

"We can't tell you exactly what month this launch is going to be," Behnken said during a visit to Kennedy Space Center. "But we're well on a track to actually get launches off the Florida coast happening again." ___ Online: NASA: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/commercial/crew/index.html More from Associated Press: Rescuers search collapsed buildings in Italy after another powerful earthquake hits region near Perugia Texas Longhorns jump all the way up to No. 11 in latest AP poll after beating Notre Dame A college professor has promised to consume only water and sports drinks after the university's president overrode a nearly unanimous decision to grant him tenure Craig Sager is hoping to return to NBA sidelines by November after receiving a rare third bone-marrow transplant David Ortiz honored with a corn maze cut in his likeness More: Associated Press facebook linkedin twitter email print × Recommended For You Powered by Sailthru Spacewalking astronauts installing new door for visitors Spacewalking astronauts installing new door for visitors CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

Elroy Hilbert 1924 - 2016 Obituary Condolences Gallery Elroy Edward Hilbert Born: November 16, 1924; in Chicago, IL Died: Aug 3, 2016; in Union, IL Elroy Edward "Buck" Hilbert, 91, of Union, IL died on Wednesday, Aug 3, 2016 at his home. Buck was born November 16, 1924 in Chicago, IL, the oldest of three children, to Elroy Lawrence and Florence (Nuber) Hilbert. His parents and his two siblings (Dianne Buckles and Frank Hilbert) preceded him in death. Buck was bitten by the aviation "bug" early in life. At age 12 he became a line boy at Elmhurst Airport and made his first solo flight in 1941 at the Wood Dale Airport. Immediately upon graduation from Lane Tech High School, Buck joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and trained as an aircraft maintenance specialist. He graduated as a flight officer in 1944 and was sent to B-17 training. He was discharged in 1946, but was recalled to active duty in 1950, and flew as an Army Aviator Liaison Pilot in the Korean War. Various jobs followed including crop spraying, flight instruction, Wisconsin Bell, Wisconsin Power & Light, and rural mail carrier. He was able to relate to most people, always making friends from any background or position. Buck was hired to fly for United Airlines in 1952, where he worked for the next 32 years. Buck often remarked that he had, "the greatest job in the world." He had a front seat in the evolution of commercial aviation flying DC-3s, Convairs, Viscounts, DC-6s, DC-7s, Boeing 707s, Boeing 727s, and finishing his career flying DC-8s. In 1951, Buck married Elizabeth "Betty" A. Briegel. She died in 1960. He married again in 1961 to Dorothy E. (Bortkvitch) Steffenhagen. In 1971 they moved to Union, IL, and turned an old hog farm into an aviator haven known as "Hilbert's Funny Farm". Although he earned his living as a commercial pilot, his love for history and the preservation of early flying machines led him to seek out, restore, and fly numerous antique and classic aircraft. In 1976, he participated in the restoration of a Swallow biplane and subsequent public relations tour in celebration of United Airlines 50th anniversary, flying the original airmail route of the plane all over the U.S. As a promoter of general aviation, Buck was a member of numerous associations, chapters and clubs. He was a founding member of the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) and the first president of EAA's Antique & Classic Division. He and Dorothy volunteered annually for the EAA Convention (AirVenture) in Oshkosh, WI and for the Sun 'n Fun Fly-In, Lakeland, FL. He was recognized for his many contributions to the aviation world throughout his life, and holds a place in both the Illinois Aviation and EAA Hall of Fame. He was also honored as an Elder Statesman for the National Aeronautical Association. Buck was a Certified Flight Instructor and an Airframe & Powerplant mechanic. He authored many articles for EAA publications, including a monthly column called "Pass it to Buck" for Vintage magazine, and was frequently asked to speak at flying clubs' events and other aviation organizations. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. In addition to his love for aviation, Buck was a regular contributor to the McHenry County Historical Society, The Illinois Railway Museum, and other organizations that work to preserve and share local history. Dorothy Hilbert died in Union, IL, in December of 2006. Buck is survived by his six children, Bob (Diane), Christine, Alice (Tom) Taylor, Elroy E. (Laurie), Lee (Corinn), and Leslie; eight grandchildren, Heidi, Robert, Matthew, Sierra, Tim, Luke, Whitman, and Benjamin; two great grandchildren, Kyle and Nicholas; numerous cousins, nieces, nephews, one cat; as well as countless friends and honorary children. Donations/Memorials may be made to Northern Illinois Hospice or the EAA Young Eagles Program. A Memorial is planned for October 1, 2016, at The Wings and Wheels Museum in Poplar Grove, IL.

NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender “out of the box concepts” for the space station since the agency says it’s become clear that “companies don’t think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues.” “Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined,” the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed “to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability.” NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. “It’s an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station,” NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said in an e-mail. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn’t have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an e-mail. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed that it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is “emblematic” of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK’s Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. “The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies,” Culbertson said in a statement. “As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a testbed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA’s increasingly ambitious missions to deep space.” NASA Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station’s “primary structural hardware” and determine whether the outpost’s functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020.  During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don’t have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body—from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure—as a way to make longer missions feasible. Commercial space tourism companies will be interested in that kind of data. Companies such as Blue Origin LLC and Virgin Galactic Ltd. are looking to the stars as the ultimate vacation venue, and in time, such ventures could contemplate voyages longer than brief excursions into space. Launched by Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin envisions a time when millions of people live off-earth, President Rob Meyerson told Space.com recently. “We think if you want to get there, you need to be pushing the barriers of how to conduct really useful science ... of trying things out in microgravity.” One analog to this type of exercise is the “CubeSat” initiative, in which NASA allows schools and nonprofit organizations to conduct research in space. These nanosatellites, about four inches cubed, offer groups a platform to engineer and launch experiments while giving NASA access to the research. To date, the agency has chosen 119 CubeSat missions, with 46 already launched and 29 scheduled within 12 months. NASA opened its latest round of submissions earlier this month.

Photo: Bullit Marquez / AP) CANBERRA, Australia — Experts hunting for the missing Malaysian airliner are attempting to define a new search area by studying where in the Indian Ocean the first piece of wreckage recovered from the lost Boeing 777 — a wing flap — most likely drifted from after the disaster that claimed 239 lives, the new leader of the search said. Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 square kilometers (46,000 square miles) turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the $160 million search will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location of the aircraft. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Get Khaosod English by email. Binge-read when you want. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year — 16 months after the plane went missing — will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modeling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year — the third anniversary of the disaster — and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analyzed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modeling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550 kilometers (340 miles). “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area — which includes experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defense Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales — made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurizing the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 meters (40,000 feet) after both engines lost power. But critics who favor the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimize debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said his bureau’s analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 meters (12,000 feet) and 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 meters (2,000 feet) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap — if it’s found that it is not deployed — will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking,” he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-meter (65-foot) swells could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 10,000 square kilometers (4,000 square miles) of seabed, which is outside the original 60,000-square-kilometer (23,000-square-mile) high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700 kilometers (1,700 miles) and 1,900 kilometers (1,200 miles) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood.

Jeff Williams takes on his fourth walk while Kate Rubins embarks on her first. (Credit: ABC licensed)  With more private spaceship traffic expected at the International Space Station in the coming years, two US astronauts embarked on a spacewalk to install a special parking spot for them. Key points: Two astronauts will install an adaptor for commercial spacecraft Adaptor will allow automatic parking and sharing of power and data Spacewalk will be first time astronauts have taken equipment from a robot arm on ISS Americans Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins stepped outside the orbiting laboratory to attach an international docking adaptor launched aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship last month. NASA has described the equipment as "a metaphorical gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of US spacecraft — the first since the space shuttle program ended in 2011 — to carry astronauts to the space station. "Commercial crew flights from Florida's Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America's human spaceflight launch capability and increase the time US crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars," NASA said in a statement.

(NASA) The docking adaptor is the first of two such additions to the space station. The second is expected to be shipped in 2018. ISS operations integration manager Kenneth Todd called the installation a "very significant milestone on the path to establishing commercial crew capability." Built by Boeing, the circular adaptor measures around 42 inches (one meter) tall and about 63 inches (1.6 meters) wide. The adaptors will work with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon, two spaceships under construction that are planned to ferry astronauts to the space station. The docking adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment because it will allow automatic parking instead of the current grapple and berthing process managed by astronauts. It also has fittings that enable the space station to share power and data with the spacecraft. Photo: The space walk is expected to take more than six hours. (NASA: AFP Photo) A delicate operation over more than six hours The space agency is streaming live coverage on August 19 from 8:30pm (AEST). This is the fourth career spacewalk for veteran NASA astronaut Williams, who is about to mark 500 days in space over four missions, and the 194th for the space station. It is also the first spacewalk for Flight Engineer Rubins, who has practiced the necessary manoeuvres, including mating the cables, in NASA's neutral buoyancy laboratory in Houston. The two astronauts have ventured outside the space station's Quest airlock in what is expected to be a six-and-a-half-hour task. A series of spacewalks last year helped prepare the groundwork for the adaptor's arrival. The space station's robotic arm pulled the docking adaptor from the trunk of the SpaceX Dragon cargo ship on Wednesday, placing it inches away from the station's Harmony module, where it will be installed. Once the spacewalkers — also known as extravehicular (EV) crew — are outside the space station, an extension of the Canadarm2 robotic arm, called the "Dextre" Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), will push the bulky adaptor even closer to its installation point. The plan is for the robotic manipulator to push the adaptor into place so the astronauts only to tether it. The operation will remain delicate, however, because the SPDM is highly sensitive to external pressure, lead spacewalk officer Glenda Brown said. "This is the first time that the EV crew members have actually taken a handoff from the SPDM," she told a news conference this week. "We have to be very careful about putting loads into the SPDM. In space, it has got a lot of capability, but on the ground it can barely support its own weight." NASA says that a problem that allowed water to build up inside an astronaut's helmet in January has been resolved by the discovery of an apparent flaw in a piece of hardware called a sublimator, which manages condensation in the suit's healing and cooling loops.

Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for the lost Boeing 777 in case the current two-year search of 46,000 square miles (120,000 square kilometres) turns up nothing, said Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood, who took over leadership of the bureau last month. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the 160 million US dollar (£122 million) operation will be suspended once the current stretch of ocean south-west of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges which would pinpoint a specific location for the planet. "If it is not in the area which we defined, it's going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity," Mr Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year - 16 months after the plane went missing - will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether it is the wind or the currents that affect how they drift, Mr Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modelling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia's behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year - the third anniversary of the disaster - and track their movements. Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap which washed up on Tanzania in June are being analysed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau's headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau's director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modelling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 340 miles (550km). "Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot," Mr Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group which defined the current search area - that includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane's manufacturer Boeing, Australia's Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales - made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no-one was at the controls when the plane hit the ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner veered far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 40,000ft (12,200m) after both engines lost power. But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the aircraft beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimise debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Mr Foley said his bureau's analysts were working on the flap to ascertain whether or not it was deployed when the plane hit the water. They will test their hypothesis with the Boeing accident investigation team to validate their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 12,000ft (3,700m) and 20,000ft (6,100m) a minute before it crashed. A rate of 2,000ft (600m) a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. "The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap - if it's found that it is not deployed - will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide," Mr Foley said. "If it's not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we've been looking," he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 65ft (20m) waves could take them until December to finish scanning. Less than 4,000 square miles (10,000 sq km) of seabed, which is outside the original 23,000 square mile (60,000 sq km) high-priority search zone, remain to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 1,700 miles (2,700km) and 1,200 miles (1,900km) from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ships are based. "We are still hopeful and optimistic," said Mr Hood. Mr Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened on board Flight 370. "We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it," he said.

Even for frequent flyers, the phenomenon of how a plane weighing around 300 metric tonnes can leave the ground and fly from one side of the world to another can seem miraculous. In contrast, however, to leading aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus, airlines are often no more technologically advanced than your average retailer or bank. So, how can airlines provide a digital experience that is more worthy of the wonderment that flying still gives to people? Evolving flight experience As India aims to become the third-largest aviation market by 2020 and #1 by 2030, technology is permeating the experience of air travel from start to finish. The days of walking into a high street travel agent to research, price up and book a holiday are long gone. Websites such as Expedia and Lastminute.com enable holidaymakers to plan, book and pay for holidays on the move via mobile apps – whether it’s a two week beach getaway or an impulsive weekend city break. As well as designing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces, these companies use insights gained from big data analytics to provide a personalised experience based on a user’s interests, behaviours and buying patterns. For example, Expedia has enough data to fill 6.7 billion books (based on an average of 200 pages). The availability of internet connectivity at airports and on aircraft is also increasing to match the evolving needs of business travellers. While stepping onto a plane used to mean you’d spend a few hours offline, the skies are unlikely to remain a worldwide blackspot for long. Wi-Fi is available as a free service on a limited or unlimited basis at almost all of Europe’s biggest airports. While in-flight Wi-Fi is yet to take-off due to issues with reliability, connected in-flight experiences are approaching fast on the horizon. Premium airlines such as Emirates and Virgin Atlantic traditionally excel at in-flight entertainment, with an extensive range of movies, TV and audio shows and games. However, smartphones, tablets and pro-audio headphones allow travellers to plan their own in-flight entertainment schedule. Soon, the expectation will be to HD stream hours of uninterrupted Netflix from 30,000ft or use virtual reality simulations to explore your destination before you’ve even touched down. The connected airport One part of the digital experience that is still not without its margin for error is the process in between walking into an airport and boarding your flight. Travellers are often subject to long queues to check-in to flights, or even to simply drop off their luggage. Furthermore, if delays occur customers sometimes need to work hard to find information on estimated departure times, which can lead to frustrated passengers. Given the technologies that bring passengers to the airport, the onus is on airlines to ensure that they are providing a personalised and seamless travel experience. Airlines are investing heavily in digital transformation projects, overhauling their IT systems and providing a user-centric connected experience from booking to landing. The majority of leading operators are now able to provide mobile boarding passes using digital QR codes and scanners, with many also investing in intuitive apps that allow passengers to manage their bookings and update their travel details and itineraries on the move. Air France-KLM is an example of an airline group using mobile to improve the airport experience. It is the first airline to integrate Facebook into its check-in process, giving customers the option of receiving their flight documentation via Messenger. By equipping passengers with mobile boarding passes as well as installing self-service machines for check-in and to print baggage labels, the queuing time before passengers drop-off their bags and have their passports checked is reduced. To provide a paperless, queue-free and stress-free airport experience that customers will remember and build loyalty with, airlines must consider two key questions. Firstly, are our internal systems and connectivity infrastructure up to the challenge or will they fall over at times of peak demand? In an industry that is highly seasonal and experiences extreme peaks and troughs, airlines must be prepared to scale their infrastructure up and down quickly to provide a consistent experience at all times. This is one of the main reasons why airlines and airports are adopting flexible and scalable cloud computing platforms. Secondly, can we provide a consistent experience across all of the territories we cover? For example, if I have a great airport experience at London Heathrow when flying to Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Mumbai, I want that experience to be replicated when I arrive and on my return journey. The emerging markets are increasing exponentially in their importance to the air travel industry. Eight out of ten of the fastest growing airline markets are located in Africa; 1.3 billion passengers will travel through China in 2034; and India is set to see an additional 260 million passengers. Therefore, delivering an experience that is truly global is tantamount to customer satisfaction and retention. Those players ahead of the game have already begun investing in digital transformation and overhauling their IT infrastructure. Returning to the example of Air France-KLM – in order to support a seamless, personalised travel experience, it has partnered with Tata Communications to add next-generation connectivity to 170 sites in its growth markets. The new superfast network will power the airline’s mission-critical systems across the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Travellers’ tech According to Crisil Ltd., India is one of the five fastest-growing aviation markets globally with 275 million new passengers in 2015.  The airlines operating in India have been projected to report a collective operating profit of Rs. 8,100 crore (US$ 1.29 billion) in FY 2016. Competition within the aviation industry for the preference of holidaymakers and business travellers alike is also growing. While factors such as fare price and flight convenience are fundamental decisions when booking flights, IATA statistics show that 9% of people cited ‘previous good experience’ as their main reason for choosing a particular airline. Validating good user experience as an imperative while booking air travel, SITA and Air Transport World conducted a global passenger survey, reiterating the fact that airline passengers across the globe are more comfortable with technology than humans when looking for a better user experience. The survey also revealed that even if the passengers are not satisfied with one type of self-service technology, they tend to try another rather than revert to human contact. Therefore, as customer expectations are driven by intuitive, personalised technologies for travellers such as price-comparison apps, smart devices and ubiquitous connectivity, the digital travel experience is set to become a means for airlines to differentiate themselves from the competition. While building a strategy that places user experience at the heart of every stage of a customer’s journey through innovative mobile, video and social apps – and even virtual reality technologies –  airlines must invest in a connectivity infrastructure that will power all these innovations, and enable them to provide a seamless, brilliant passenger experience the world over.

Officials are planning the next phase of the deep-sea sonar search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in case the current two-year search of 120,000 sq km turns up nothing, Australian Transport Safety Bureau chief commissioner Greg Hood said. However, a new search would require a new funding commitment, with Malaysia, Australia and China agreeing in July that the US$160 million search will be suspended once the current vast expanse southwest of Australia is exhausted unless new evidence emerges that would pinpoint a specific location. “If it is not in the area which we defined, it’s going to be somewhere else in the near vicinity,” Hood said in an interview this week. Further analysis of the wing fragment known as a flaperon found on Reunion Island off the African coast in July last year –15 months after the plane went missing – will hopefully help narrow a possible next search area outside the current boundary. Six replicas of the flaperon will be sent to Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s oceanography department in the island state of Tasmania where scientists will determine whether wind or currents determine how they drift, Hood said. This will enable more accurate drift modelling than is currently available. If more money becomes available, the Australian bureau, which is conducting the search on Malaysia’s behalf, plans to fit the flaperons with satellite beacons and set them adrift at different points in the southern Indian Ocean around March 8 next year – the third anniversary of the disaster – and track their movements. Officials call off search for missing Malaysia Airlines plane Meanwhile, barnacles found on the flaperon and an adjacent wing flap that washed up on Tanzania in June are being analysed for clues to the latitudes they might have come from. The flap is in the Australian bureau’s headquarters in Canberra where it has been scoured for clues by accident investigators. Peter Foley, the bureau’s director of Flight 370 search operations since the outset, said the enhanced drift modelling would hopefully narrow the next search area to a band of 5 degrees of latitude, or 550km. “Even the best drift analysis is not going to narrow it down to X-marks-the-spot,” Foley said. Some critics argue that the international working group that defined the current search area – which includes experts from the US National Transportation Safety Board, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch, the plane’s manufacturer Boeing, Australia’s Defence Science and Technology Group, satellite firm Inmarsat and electronics company Thales – made a crucial mistake by concluding that the most likely scenario was that no one was at the controls when the plane hit to ocean after flying more than five hours. The airliner flew far off course during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. What happened to the plane has become one of the biggest mysteries in aviation, with a wide range of theories, including that a hijacker could have killed everyone on board early in the flight by depressurising the plane. The current search area was defined by analysis of a final satellite signal from the plane that indicated it had run out of fuel. Scientists have determined how far the plane could have travelled from a height of up to 12,200 metres after both engines lost power. Missing MH370 could have crashed north of search area, says oceanographer But critics who favour the theory that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah hijacked the plane argue that he could have glided the plane beyond the current search area. Some say he could have made a controlled ditch at sea in order to minimise debris and make the plane vanish as completely as possible. Officials say Zaharie flew a similar route on his home flight simulator only weeks before the disaster. Foley said Australian analysis of the flap in Canberra suggested that it had not been deployed when it hit the water. It had been retracted inside the wing. A pilot attempting a soft landing would have extended the wing flaps. The Australians are awaiting the verdict of a Boeing accident investigation team on their findings. Recent analysis of the final satellite signals also suggest the plane was descending at a rate of between 3,700 metres and 6,100 metres a minute before it crashed. A rate of 600 metres a minute would be typical of a controlled descent. “The rate of descent combined with the position of the flap – if it’s found that it is not deployed – will almost certainly rule out either a controlled ditch or glide,” Foley said. Hunt for missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 likely to end by August, search chief says “If it’s not in a deployed state, it validates, if you like, where we’ve been looking, ”he said. Crews have not given up hope of finding the plane in the current search area, which because of bad weather and 20-metre swells could take until December. Less than 10,000 sq km of seabed which is outside the original 60,000 sq km high-priority search zone has yet to be searched. More than 20 sonar contacts require closer examination by a sonar-equipped underwater drone. These are between 2,700km and 1,900km from the Australian port of Fremantle where the search ship are based. “We are still hopeful and optimistic,” said Hood, who took over leadership of the Australian bureau in July. Foley said finding the plane was the only chance of the solving the mystery of what happened aboard Flight 370. “We will never know what happened to that aircraft until we find it,” Foley said.

Home Latest News Popular news National International Business Sports Entertainment Science/Tech Environment Feature Bahasa Full Site U.S. astronauts prepare station for commercial space taxis Minggu, 21 Agustus 2016 05:45 WIB - 0 Views id NASA, Jeff Wiliam, Kate Rubin, space taxis Astronaut Jeff William twitted his message on August 18, 2016 from space. (@Astro_Jeff) United States (ANTARA News) - Two NASA astronauts completed a six-hour spacewalk outside the International Space Station to install a parking spot for upcoming commercial space taxis, which will end U.S. reliance on Russia for rides to the orbiting outpost. Station commander Jeff Williams and flight engineer Kate Rubins floated outside the stations airlock and headed toward the berthing slip once used by NASAs now-retired space shuttles, a NASA TV broadcast showed. "Great view," said Rubins, who made her first spacewalk. Since grounding the shuttle fleet in 2011, the United States has been dependent on Russia to ferry astronauts to and from the space station, at a cost of more than $70 million per person. During Fridays spacewalk, Williams and Rubins attached an adapter onto the shuttles docking port that will allow commercial space taxis under development by Space Exploration Technologies and Boeing to park at the station, a $100 billion research laboratory that flies about 250 miles (400 km) above Earth. "Its a gateway to a new era in commercial space," said NASA mission commentator Rob Navias. California-based SpaceX, owned and operated by technology entrepreneur Elon Musk, plans to begin test flights of its new passenger Dragon capsule to the station in 2017. Boeings debut flight of its CST-100 Starliner capsule is expected in 2018. NASA had hoped to have the first of two new docking ports installed last year, but the equipment was destroyed during a SpaceX cargo ship launch accident in June 2015. A replacement docking port is under construction and expected to be delivered to the station in early 2018. On Friday, Williams and Rubins routed a cable for the second docking ports installation in early 2018. The astronauts had planned to tackle a few other lower-priority maintenance tasks, but NASA decided to end the spacewalk after an intermittent communications problem developed with Williams spacesuit, Navias said. Williams and Rubins are scheduled to make another spacewalk on Sept. 1 to retract a solar array cooling panel that is no longer being used and to install a high-definition television camera on the stations exterior frame.

Most Popular Author Copy Created with Sketch. By Eric Tegler Aug 4, 2016 The F-35 just flew a victory lap. Last month, three U.S. Air Force F-35As made the Atlantic crossing to appear at the Farnborough Air Show in England (while PM rode along in the tanker that refueled the Joint Strike Fighter). The debut came two years after the F-35 failed to make its first appearance at the international air show following an engine fire. Recent reports suggest the F-35 Lightning II may have finally turned a corner, overcoming the technical problems that have plagued its development and nearing readiness to serve in the field. It's a big moment for the long-awaited plane, and it's been a long, long time coming. The Joint Strike Fighter was declared operational by the Marine Corps in July 2015; the Air Force just declared initial operational capability (IOC) this week and the Navy hopes to do so by February 2019. If the schedule holds, the F-35 will be baseline operational 18 years after it was selected over Boeing's X-32, and 23 years after the program began. History is littered with multi-mission aircraft that never quite measured up. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below For over two decades, the F-35 has been the symbol of everything that's wrong with mammoth defense contracts: behind schedule, over budget, and initially, over-sold. How did things get this way, and how did the trillion-dollar albatross come out flying in the end? There Can Be Only One The development of the F-35 has been a mess by any measurement. There are numerous reasons, but they all come back to what F-35 critics would call the jet's original sin: the Pentagon's attempt to make a one-size-fits-all warplane, a Joint Strike Fighter. Most Popular When the program began in 1996, the JSF was conceived as a way to replace the F-16 Falcon, F-15E Eagle, A-10 Warthog, F/A-18 Hornet, and AV-8B Harrier across their respective roles and missions. The Joint Strike Fighter program called for a common design with three variants to share 80 percent of their parts. There would be the conventional F-35A, the Air Force's plane. There would be the short takeoff and landing (STOVL) F-35B for the Marines. The Navy would get the carrier landing F-35C. At its dawn, the F-35 was projected to be four times more effective than older, legacy fighters in air-to-air combat, eight times more effective in air-to-ground combat, and three times better at reconnaissance and suppression of enemy air defenses. Design goals called for the JSF to be the premier strike aircraft through 2040, second only to the F-22 Raptor in air supremacy. GIF Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The F-35 wouldn't just be shared across the branches of the U.S. military; it was to be shared around the world. A coalition of "partner nations" would not only fly and produce the aircraft but support it worldwide. Eventually, eight foreign partners—Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Turkey, and the United Kingdom—signed on to invest in and acquire the aircraft. To date, seven have received their first jets and eight have pilots and maintainers in training. Two of the three foreign military sale customers (Israel, Japan, and South Korea) will receive their first jets in 2016. Stll, we could have seen this coming, and not just because of the technical complexity involved in making a warplane for so many constituents. Long before the delays and overruns that riddles the F-35 program, history was littered with illustrations of multi-mission aircraft that never quite measured up. Take Germany's WWII Junkers Ju-88, or the 1970s Panavia Tornado, or even the original F/A-18. Today the Hornet is a mainstay of the American military, but when it debuted it lacked the range and payload of the A-7 Corsair and acceleration and climb performance of the F-4 Phantom it was meant to replace. That didn't sit well with the Marines. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below F-35 supporters were undaunted in the face of that evidence, adamant that the technological advances needed to make a do-it-all aircraft for several brances of the military had finally arrived. Back in 2000, I interviewed Lt. General Michael A. Hough of the U.S. Marine Corps, director/deputy director of the Joint Strike Fighter Program from 1997 to 2001. During the interview, Hough thumped the table with his fist, declaring the JSF would not suffer the problems of past multipurose aircraft, which were prone to run over budget and see their progress stall. The Rocky Years Things got rocky pretty quickly. The Air Force wanted a stealthy plane, and those stealth requirements drove a JSF design which, at least initially, did not have internal weapons bays. That didn't sit well with the Marines, who would demand their inclusion. This design change would add weight to the F-35. So would the Marines' desire for a vertical takeoff plane, something the USMC demanded because it said it had no alternative replacement for the Harrier. Defense journalist and War Is Boring blogger David Axe observed that "in demanding STOVL capability, the Marines foisted a fat, bulky airframe on the program, even though the Air Force's F-35A didn't really want to be that fat." Most Popular Building one plane for three branches wasn't the only place the JSF program ran into trouble. The Pentagon hoped to take advantage of "concurrency": that is, the idea of keeping down costs by building production planes at the same time it was finishing ground and flight testing. Never mind that most aspects of the F-35, from its engines and flight control system to its software and autonomic logistics system, were still in early stages of development at the program's outset and far from finished technologies ready to be integrated. You can imagine what happened. During the flight testing, the military found the F-35 needed structural and electronic modifications. The fact that it had already produced many of the aircraft made the fix far more expensive. In the decade following 2003, the program faced over a dozen major setbacks. They just kept coming and coming. In 2004, the F-35B was more than 2,000 pounds overweight, unable to meet its performance goals. In 2006, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) warned that, as a result of the policy of concurrent development, retrofitting aircraft with systems that were not fully functional or working as intended could be terribly expensive. By 2013, the cost of retrofitting was put at $1.7 billion. Starting in 2007, suspected Chinese cyber intrusions resulted in the theft of several terabytes of data related to the F-35's design and electronics systems. This attack and another 2012 hack of BAE Systems (which makes the F-35's flight control software, electronic warfare systems, aft fuselage, as well as its horizontal and vertical tails) forced hardware and software redesigns, adding more cost and delays. From a troublesome helmet mounted cueing system to inadequate ejection seats and logistics software, the F-35 has continued to face challenges. Who gets the blame for a 20-year misadventure? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The mess got so bad that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates removed JSF program manager Maj. Gen. David Heinz (USMC) in 2010 and delayed development even more. Problems assembling the F-35's four-piece wing and structural fatigue in one of the bulkheads supporting the wing on the F-35B, combinged with a strike at Lockheed Martin, forced reduced initial production buys. The cascade of woes nearly resulted in the cancellation of the F-35B in 2010-11. To avoid further delays resulting from design changes, in 2012 the Pentagon accepted a reduced combat radius for the F-35A and a longer takeoff run for the F-35B. The F-35B's estimated combat radius was reduced by 15 percent. (F-35Bs had to refuel 15 times on the recent transatlantic flight.) Who gets the blame for a 20-year misadventure? In 2013, the GAO's Michael Sullivan asserted that Lockheed had failed to get an early start on systems engineering and had not understood the technologies involved at the program's launch. But a RAND study the same year found the three F-35 variants had drifted so far apart during development that having a single base design may prove to be more expensive than if services had just built separate aircraft tailored to their own requirements from the get-go. And to this the fact that enormous defense projects almost always go over-budget and you've got a recipe for the start-and-stop, muddled first two decades of the F-35. The Price Tag and the Promise Cost estimates for the F-35 have changed yearly over the past 15 years. It's safe to say, though, that the program is the most expensive in U.S. history (so far), pegged at more than $320 billion in 2012. In 2014, the GAO found that the F-35 fleet would have operating costs 79 percent higher than the aircraft it was to replace. A 2015 Pentagon Selected Acquisition Report said that program costs had increased 43 percent from 2001, including unit cost (up 68 percent). The report added that the F-35A's cost per flying hour is $32,500 while the F-16C/D is $25,500. Private analysts have called the F-35 a "money pit," and argued that the purpose of Lockheed's extensive national and global supplier base—which includes 1,300 suppliers in 45 states and nine foreign countries—was not so much to realize logistics efficiency and security, but to make sure the Joint Strike Fighter was too big to fail. They succeeded. The F-35 may be one of the most derided and controversial warplanes, but it's here, nearly ready to go into service in force. That's a good thing. Frankly, we need the F-35. The average age of current USAF airframes stands 27 years, and it's nearly as bad in the Navy. Decades-old Marine airplanes are being brought back from the boneyard. As a fifth-generation aircraft, the F-35 offers new combat capabilities and information exploitation. It will work with the F-22 and our 4th generation fighters such as the F-18 and F-16 to "kick down the door" in defended environments. GIF The F-35 is, at least so far, a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. We have paid a steep price for it, the full accounting of which has yet to be reckoned. Let's hope it was worth it.

This compares to a profit of US$254 million (HK$1,972 million) for the same period in 2015. Earnings per share were US1.6 cents (HK9.0 cents) compared to US6.46 cents (HK50.1 cents) for the first six months of the previous year. The operating environment in the first half of 2016 was affected by economic fragility and intense competition. There was sustained pressure on revenues, reflecting suspension of fuel surcharges, weak currencies in some markets, weak premium class demand, particularly on long-haul routes, and a higher proportion of passengers transiting through Hong Kong. All these factors impacted the Group’s operating performance. The contribution from subsidiary and associated companies increased. The Group’s passenger revenue in the first six months of 2016 was US$4,309 million (HK$33,413 million), a decrease of 7.8% compared to the same period in 2015. Capacity increased by 4.2%, reflecting the introduction of new routes and increased frequencies on other routes. Load factor decreased by 1.4 percentage points, to 84.5%. Revenue was adversely affected by the suspension (from February) of fuel surcharges, which remained suspended for the rest of the period despite a subsequent rise in fuel prices. Yield fell by 10.1% to US cents (HK54.3 cents), reflecting the suspension of fuel surcharges, strong competition and adverse currency movements. There was a significant reduction in premium corporate travel, particularly on long-haul routes. Revenue from long-haul routes declined compared to the same period in 2015, despite a 4.7% increase in long-haul capacity. The Group’s cargo revenue in the first six months of 2016 was US$1,214 million (HK$9,415 million), a decrease of 17.2% compared to the same period in 2015. The cargo capacity of Cathay Pacific and Dragonair increased by 0.6%. The load factor decreased by 1.9 percentage points, to 62.2%. Tonnage carried decreased by 0.2%. The overall market was weak during the period, although tonnage stabilised in the second quarter. Yield fell by 17.6% to US$0.21 (HK$1.59), reflecting strong competition, overcapacity and the suspension (from April) of fuel surcharges. Demand on European routes continued to be weak and demand on transpacific routes weakened. India was one of the few routes where demand strengthened. The Group managed freighter capacity in line with demand and carried a higher percentage of cargo in the bellies of its passenger aircraft. Total fuel costs for Cathay Pacific and Dragonair (before the effect of fuel hedging) decreased by US$519 million (HK$4,023 million) (or 31.9%) compared with the first half of 2015, despite a rise in the price of fuel in the second quarter. A 33.3% decrease in average prices was partially offset by a 2.0% increase in consumption. Fuel remains the Group’s most significant cost, accounting for 29.1% of operating costs in the first half of 2016 (compared to 34.2% in the same period in 2015). Lower fuel prices were partially offset by fuel hedging losses. After taking hedging losses into account, fuel costs decreased by US$433 million (HK$3,360 million) (or 20.2%) compared with the first half of 2015. Congestion at Hong Kong International Airport and air traffic control constraints in the Greater China region continued to impose costs on the Group. The Group is doing more to improve the reliability of its operations. Productivity improvements kept the increase in non-fuel costs in the first half of 2016 below the increase in capacity. There was a 0.5% reduction in non-fuel costs per available ton kilometer. In response to weak revenues, the Group introduced measures intended to reduce non-operational costs. The Group is reviewing productivity and expenditure, has stopped the hiring and replacement of non-operationally critical staff, and is restricting non-essential discretionary spending. Despite these short-term measures, the Group continues to make long-term investments. Cathay Pacific introduced a passenger service to Madrid in June. This service has been well received. The airline will introduce passenger services to London Gatwick in September, using new Airbus A350-900XWB aircraft. It stopped operating flights to Doha in February but still offers codeshare services with Qatar Airways on this route. Dragonair did not introduce any new routes in the first half of 2016. Frequencies on Dragonair’s Da Nang, Penang, Wenzhou and Wuhan services were increased. Frequencies on Dragonair’s Clark and Kota Kinabalu services were reduced. There were no changes to the Group’s freighter network in the first half of 2016. Cathay Pacific will introduce a freighter service to Portland in November. The Group continued to manage freighter capacity in line with demand. Cathay Pacific took delivery of its first Airbus A350-900XWB aircraft in May. A second was delivered in July and the third in August. The airline is scheduled to take delivery of further nine aircraft of this type during the remainder of 2016. The A350-900XWBs are fuel efficient and have the right range, capacity and operating economics for the Group’s requirements. Cathay Pacific retired two Airbus A340-300 aircraft in the first half of 2016. It will retire one more aircraft of this type in the second half of this year and will retire the remaining four aircraft of this type in 2017. The airline will have retired our three remaining Boeing 747-400 passenger aircraft by October. One parked Boeing 747-400F freighter aircraft was delivered to Boeing in July and another aircraft of this type in August. The remaining two aircraft of this type will be delivered to Boeing in August and September. Cathay Pacific took delivery of its final Boeing 747-8F freighter in August. Product The new Airbus A350-900XWB aircraft have the latest cabins, seats and entertainment systems and inflight connectivity for passengers’ mobile devices. The Group opened a new lounge in Vancouver in May and reopened the business class lounge at The Pier at Hong Kong International Airport in June. The G16 lounge in Hong Kong closed for renovations in July and will reopen in the second quarter of 2017. The Group’s new first and business class lounge at London Heathrow will open in the third quarter of 2016. In January the Group announced that Dragonair is to be rebranded as Cathay Dragon, bringing the brands of its two airlines into closer alignment. The first aircraft with the Cathay Dragon livery went into service in April. Cathay Pacific Chairman John Slosar said: “We expect the operating environment in the second half of the year to continue to be impacted by the same adverse factors as in the first half. The overall business outlook therefore remains challenging. We expect passenger yield to remain under pressure. Overcapacity and economic fragility will dampen cargo demand. Fuel prices have increased this year, but are still lower than in previous periods. The benefits from lower fuel prices will continue to be partially offset by losses on our fuel hedging contracts. The fuel surcharge remains suspended. In this difficult environment, we will manage capacity and strive to make further improvements in operational efficiency. We will also continue to be vigilant on costs. “The strategic objective of the Cathay Pacific Group is to provide sustainable growth in shareholder value over the long term. To that end we will continue to build a modern and fuel-efficient fleet and to strengthen our network and will strive to provide a high standard of customer service. We will continue to develop our strategic relationship with Air China. As we celebrate our 70th anniversary, our commitment to the Hong Kong and its people remains unwavering. We will continue to make long-term strategic investments to develop and strengthen Hong Kong’s position as Asia’s premier aviation hub.” SOURCESaudi Gazette TAGS Cathay Pacific Group profit SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleTerminal 5 — King Khalid International Airport Riyadh Next articleGoogle All-Stars Academy to debut in MENA region Imran Syed RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Sabic profit falls 6.8% QNB Group net profit up 11% in first nine months Profit NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,491,680FansLike 41,180FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts King’s Shoura address to shed light on domestic, foreign policies Nov 23, 2016 Kingdom to have two industrial mining cities Nov 23, 2016 ‘SR2,000 visa fee won’t affect most Indian pilgrims’ Nov 23, 2016 More Rohingyas flee to Bangladesh as violence spreads in Myanmar Nov 23, 2016 National program to optimize water, energy consumption Nov 23, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

During a spacewalk of 5 hours and 58 minutes on Friday, the two astronauts fixed the first two points of the International Docking Adapter (IDA), EFE news reported. The IDA's will be used for future arrivals of manned commercial aircraft from Boeing and SpaceX, developed under the NASA manned commercial programme, the agency said in a statement. The installation will give NASA an independent access to the ISS for the first time since the withdrawal of its fleet of space shuttles in 2011. So far, NASA depends on the Russian Soyuz vessels. Jeff Williams said in a statement that the IDA has opened a new chapter in the history of the ISS enabling the access for future commercial vehicles. The new docking mechanism was transported in June to the ISS aboard a Dragon capsule by California-based private firm SpaceX, after the first IDA was lost during the launch failure of a SpaceX flight in June 2015. According to NASA, commercial flights from Florida to the ISS will increase the time for US crews to devote to scientific research and help prepare astronauts for deeper space missions, including possible travel to Mars.  (With IANS inputs) First Published: Sunday, August 21, 2016 - 00:13 More from zeenews   India Indian Army chief meets Chinese army commander Punjab Assembly elections: Sidhu's wife Navjot Kaur, hockey Olympian Pargat Singh to join Congress on Nov 28 Demonetisation: PM Modi may attend Rajya Sabha on Thursday More from India World Iraqi civilians flee as paramilitary groups close in on flashpoint town west of Mosul France to convene Syria meeting after Assad, allies launch ''total war'' Trump won with lowest minority vote in decades, fueling divisions More from World Sports 'I am only 31', Parthiv Patel sends people reminder after being included in Indian squad Ace shuttlers Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu enter second round at Hong Kong Super Series Ross Taylor cleared for 2nd Test against Pakistan, will undergo eye-surgery post match More from Sports Entertainment Are you a party animal?

During a spacewalk of 5 hours and 58 minutes on Friday, astronauts Jeff Williams, Commander of the 48th expedition and flight engineer Kate Rubins, fixed the first two points of the International Docking Adapter (IDA), EFE news reported. The IDA's will be used for future arrivals of manned commercial aircraft from Boeing and SpaceX, developed under the NASA manned commercial programme, the agency said in a statement. The installation will give NASA an independent access to the ISS for the first time since the withdrawal of its fleet of space shuttles in 2011. So far, NASA depends on the Russian Soyuz vessels. Jeff Williams said in a statement that the IDA has opened a new chapter in the history of the ISS enabling the access for future commercial vehicles. The new docking mechanism was transported in June to the ISS aboard a Dragon capsule by California-based private firm SpaceX, after the first IDA was lost during the launch failure of a SpaceX flight in June 2015. According to NASA, commercial flights from Florida to the ISS will increase the time for US crews to devote to scientific research and help prepare astronauts for deeper space missions, including possible travel to Mars. --IANS ss/ksk/vm (This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

The first flight for this year’s Hajj was historic as it departed the Tamale International Airport directly to Saudi Arabia. The flight, Boeing 740-400 series, was seen off by President John Dramani Mahama and the Chief Imam, Sheikh Osman Shaributu. The second and third batches are scheduled to depart Tamale for Medina before those in Accra will be airlifted to the Kingdom for the Islamic rite. After arrival on Friday, the 500 Ghanaians were checked in into their hotel. The would-be pilgrims were taken through strict rules guiding this year’s rite by the Pilgrims Affairs Office of Ghana (PAOG). Before going aboard the Saudi Arabia government-owned Nas Airline flight, they had been screened by officers of the Ghana Immigration Service, Ghana Airport Company, the military, National Security and other auxiliary staff. A special prayer service was held for all those embarking on this year’s Hajj Friday morning.

NASA is soliciting ideas from private enterprise on ways to use the orbiting laboratory for commercial purposes, taking another, tentative step in U.S. efforts to create a marketplace in space. NASA posed the request as a way to engender "out of the box concepts" for the space station since the agency says it's become clear that "companies don't think they can go straight to a commercial space station without continuing to take advantage of the ISS to test the waters and see what really will sell or where there may be issues." VIDEOS TOP JOBS "Commercial companies continue to approach NASA to use the ISS in ways we never imagined," the agency said in a blog post accompanying its request for information (RFI). The solicitation is designed "to determine private market interest in using unique ISS capabilities that have limited availability." NASA also requested ideas on operating models, contract structures, and other sustainable business plans for future commercial endeavors 250 miles above the planet. "It's an opportunity to gather new ideas from people/industry for future opportunities on the space station," said NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson. In its RFI, NASA stressed that that for the moment, it just wants to hear ideas. It doesn't have a budget to help spur any proposed projects, or plans to release them for public perusal. NASA received 11 submissions "from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies," Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, said in an e-mail. Orbital ATK Inc., which has a NASA contract to ferry supplies to the ISS, confirmed it had submitted information, which it declined to reveal. The space station is "emblematic" of how government-funded technologies are migrating to the private sector, said Frank Culbertson Jr., president of Orbital ATK's Space Systems Group and a former NASA astronaut. He spent four months aboard the ISS in 2001. "The station is now much more affordable as a research and development platform for commercial companies," Culbertson said. "As an astronaut who lived aboard the ISS myself, I am particularly interested in human research beyond low earth orbit and the use of the space station as a testbed for technology demonstrations that will eventually support NASA's increasingly ambitious missions to deep space." Two other companies that work closely with the space agency, Boeing Co. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., declined to comment. Boeing is the prime contractor on the ISS, with a five-year, $1.2 billion deal through September 2020. Part of that contract calls for it to assess the station's "primary structural hardware" and determine whether the outpost's functional life could be extended through December 2028. The ISS will operate until at least 2024 since NASA agreed in 2014 to keep the lab open for an additional decade. The space station was originally scheduled to shut down in 2020. During an almost six-hour spacewalk Friday, astronauts Kate Rubins and Jeff Williams installed the first of two new docking adapters to allow for planned, U.S.-launched crew missions managed by Boeing and Space X. Those contracts will enable NASA to fly astronauts to the ISS in 2018, marking the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired that they don't have to hitch a ride on a Russian rocket. One research area of deep interest to NASA might be how to minimize the harmful effects of space on the human body-from muscle and vision degradation to radiation exposure-as a way to make longer missions feasible. » Next page...

Now, the former Alton High standout is trying to make it a fulfilling career. She’s participating in the Professional Women’s Bowling Association Tour and trying to carve out a niche for herself in the PWBA competition. “The PWBA re-started again last year and this is my first year on the tour,” said the 31-year-old Purkey, a propulsion engineer at Boeing in St. Louis. “There are 14 stops on the summer tour and they were all over the country. It’s really exciting to be on the tour.” The events started April 28 in Las Vegas and ended Aug. 7 in Chicagoland’s Addison. The Smithfield Tour championship unfolds Sept. 1-4 in Midlothian, Va. Purkey picked her spots the way she converted her spares — smoothly. Because she holds a regular job, her PWBA competition is secondary. Nevertheless, Purkey has a sponsor that pays for some of her expenses, including clothing. “I competed in seven of the stops this year,” she said, pointing to action in Detroit, Chicago and Green Bay, among others. Purkey cashed in one check for $1,200 for a Top 32 finish; thus, she’s making some progress. “There’s not enough money to compete on the tour full time, but I love it,” Purkey said. “It’s a great opportunity for me.” The PWBA is attempting to regain its luster after losing gloss when it ceased operations in 2003. The league had been around since 1960. It came back to life in 2015. “When I heard it was coming back, I wanted to compete in it,” Purkey said. “I was bowling in some leagues in St. Louis and there were a lot of good friends from college still bowling.” All she had to do was register for the PWBA. “You had to have a 190 average to bowl in it,” Purkey said. “Honestly, I think it will keep growing. I’m planning on competing in it for the next three or four years. At least, that’s the plan.” Bowling has become a natural activity for her and it’s easy to see why. Purkey, has been doing it for a long time and enjoyed her share of success. “I started bowling when I was 5 years old, so basically I’ve been doing it all my life,” Purkey said. Dad, Jay, got her involved as well as older sister Whitney, a 2001 AHS graduate. It was Whitney Cox reigning as the IHSA girls’ state bowling champion in 2001 following her sixth-place finish in 2000. Ashley placed sixth in 2002 and sixth in 2003, her senior season. When Ashley was a sophomore, she bowled with Whitney. AHS coach Jeff Woszczynski benefited from having both sisters propel the program. Alton qualified for state in 2001 and 2003, finishing 10th each time. They kick-started the success the Redbirds enjoyed on the lanes after that. Overall, the boys and girls have gone to the state finals 14 times, beginning 15 years ago. “And Ashley just missed medaling at state her sophomore year,” Woszczynski said of 2001. “When Whitney won state, everything changed for her about bowling. “Ashley has always been a very determined bowler. She even married a bowler (Kevin Purkey) and he’s a very good bowler. “I give Ashley a lot of credit for taking a shot on the bowling tour,” Woszczynski added. During her prep days, Purkey said she maintained a 215-to-220 average. She went on to bowl collegiately at Wichita State and the Shockers won the NCAA championship in 2007. Now, Purkey sports a 225 average. “I’m passionate about bowling and I’ve always wanted to be a pro bowler,” she said. “Coach (Woszczynski) stimulated my interest in bowling. He was a good coach and we had some good teams.” Follow #AdVsports on Twitter Tags Alton High School featured bowling by Steve Porter August 20, 2016 12:00 AM Local News News Crime Business Legal Sports Team Spotlight College signings Obituaries Features Spotlight Arts & Entertainment Commentary Announcements Births Recipes Religion Puzzles Contribute Submit a news tip Submit a sports tip Submit a letter to the editor Submit a calendar event Obituary Information Birth announcement form Anniversary announcement form Engagement announcement form Wedding announcement form Financial Institution Guide questionnaire Women In Small Business Suggestion Box Contests Greater Alton Sports Trivia answer Granite City Sports Trivia answer Edwardsville Sports Trivia answer Pro Picks Challenge Reader's Choice 2016 Nominations - Granite City Advertise Business advertising Garage Sales Classifieds Sunday circulars Love Lines Novena ad Celebration ad Memorial ad Graduation ad Bridal Event Booth Space Veterans Day ad Events Submit events Garage Sales About Contact us Pickup locations Careers Archives Team Spotlight College signings Contact Us Advertise My Account AdVantage News | 235A East Center Drive, Alton, IL 62002 | Phone: 618.463.0612 | Copyright 2014 Built with Metro Publisher™
    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News Bread and Circuses: The F-35 Buzzes Over Chicago by Jared Labell, August 20, 2016 Print This | Share This If the city of Chicago were a house, the State would have condemned it as blighted property long ago, bulldozing its rotten wood and crumbling concrete structure into a pile fit for a funeral pyre. Chicago hasn’t been condemned yet, despite the city’s abundance of bureaucrats, infamous history of government corruption and violence wrought upon its residents, and its atrocious financial standing. Chicago remains a dilapidated house, but one that’s on the verge of burning down in a self-inflicted economic arson fire. With that in mind, the city will begin to close out the summer this weekend with the 58th Annual Chicago Air and Water Show on Saturday August 20th and Sunday August 21st along North Avenue Beach. Similar to the bread and circuses of empires past, Chicago annually distracts taxpayers with big, shiny objects to take their minds off of the political and economic failures of their government. This year’s free event is no different, as festivities are draped in the flag and promoted heavily with food, drinks, and fun for the entire family. Among other participants and aircraft featured in the event, the centerpiece of the show this year is the rollout of the notorious F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter. Corporate sponsors Shell and Boeing, as well as media outlets like WBBM Newsradio, ABC 7 television, and The Chicago Tribune, help underwrite the cost of the show, making it free for the public’s enjoyment. But don’t thank these sponsors for the free entertainment just yet, because nothing is free, and when the F-35 is involved, rest assured that taxpayers are picking up the tab, one way or another. Just a few weeks ago, Antiwar.com published my synopsis of the F-35 program –  I’m Paying Taxes, But What Am I Buying? – which detailed the $400 billion jet’s beleaguered history of cost overruns, operational fiascoes, and the opportunity costs of maintaining a weapons system that’s projected to incinerate trillions of dollars from US taxpayers throughout the estimated duration of its production and deployment lifecycle. The Straus Military Reform Project, part of the Project on Government Oversight’s Center for Defense Information, offers another detailed rundown of the most expensive weapons system in history. Readers are encouraged to become well-acquainted with the Department of Defense’s worst boondoggle, as the F-35 is a prime example of how the government misspends tax dollars at an alarming rate and with little to no accountability. Unless a coalition of activists, taxpayers, and average folks from across the political spectrum demand accountability for this detrimental misallocation of resources, we will be no better off than those poor souls in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. As Orwell wrote, “War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea…” resources that were confiscated from the public and funneled into lavish government military programs, like those fabled Floating Fortresses in his seminal novel. Chicago’s Air and Water Show comes just a little more than a week after it was announced that the Pentagon granted Lockheed Martin, the F-35’s manufacturer, an additional $1 billion of our tax dollars to make up for expenses associated with low-rate initial production costs incurred by the company. The joint program office obligated the funding by way of a preexisting undefinitized contract action (UCA), but that’s not the end of the largesse. “The agreement has a not-to-exceed value of $5.37 billion, meaning that the government could use it to inject even more cash at a later date,” reported Defense News. Previous to this newest round of corporate welfare handouts, Lockheed Martin CFO Bruce Tanner had said of the F-35’s production issues and cost overruns, “We will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation. We simply don’t have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I’m optimistic that we are going to get cash soon.” Tanner’s optimism was logical. Of course the Pentagon would pay up. Old Right journalist John T. Flynn dispelled the myth of the supposedly positive aspects of military Keynesianism in his book, As We Go Marching, warning of “an economy supported by great streams of debt and an economy under complete control, with nearly all the planning agencies functioning with almost totalitarian power under a vast bureaucracy." Flynn’s thorough indictment of the New Deal-era warfare state and America’s lunge toward economic collectivism is as relevant today as it was then. Most of the post-World War II factions of the War Party are still operating under the same delusions as their antecedents, and Flynn emphasized that politicians, laborers, and businesses would sadly embrace imperialism and economic ruin because of the perverse incentives of Empire. “Thus militarism is the one great glamorous public-works project upon which a variety of elements in the community can be brought into agreement,” Flynn wrote mournfully more than seventy years ago. The 58th Annual Chicago Air and Water Show isn’t actually free. And neither are we until the American Empire is dissolved.

Tom Aman Good article. I saw the F-22 at the Chicago air show about 5 years ago, and the B-1 passing over Wrigley Field. SEAN THOMAS The entire economy is one big swindle. Why pick on the F-35? It does it’s job just fine, if you comprehend the purpose. It’s function like most everything else is to distribute currency to stimulate the purchase of otherwise unnecessary items. RD1485 Yes. These F-35’s are actually useless against Russia’s Krasukha line of electromagnetic warfare systems. Brian McKeever Not sure what the boondoggle F-35 has to do with the rest of this article, but as a former resident of the city who only moved to advance his career it is pretty clear the author of this piece has never lived there. Chicago’s government may be dysfunctional, but a large portion of Chicago–particularly the North and Northwest sides and the strip along the lake–are quite livable. I very much enjoyed my time in that city. Jared Labell Hi Brian. If you look at the bio following the article, you’ll notice that I do in fact live and work in Chicago. I fight taxes and the state for a living. As a former resident, you may be unaware that Chicago increased property taxes by more than $500 million last year, and through this year’s state stopgap budget, an additional $250 million property tax hike is soon to befall the city — all to pay for government pensions, not services. Nothing else. And more tax hikes are on the horizon. So the connection should be obvious, it’s the bread and circuses — distracting the public with a large spectacle, in this case militaristic and nationalist fervor in the form of a costly air and water show, sponsored by the media and corporate interests, and all the whole the city is going broke. When did you leave Chicago? It is clear to me from reading comment that it must have been long ago, if at all. Don’t defend governments. It’s unseemly.

On the contrary, it is self-reinforcing and will continue to grow at the expense of all thing civil…and it will be willingly supported by the population. It seems to me the only check on continuously growing militarism is utter destruction, a la Germany & Japan. A fearsome prospect.

The 86-ton antennas, which the Hawthorne, Calif.-based company acquired from NASA’s KennedySpaceCenter at Cape Canaveral, will be used to track flights of the crewed version of SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft from Cape Canaveral to the International Space Station, probably in 2017. The company already has made multiple cargo runs between Earth and ISS using its uncrewed Dragon capsules, driven into space by the company’s Falcon 9 rockets. In 2012, SpaceX became the first private company to rendezvous with ISS. SpaceX and Boeing both have contracts to fly crews to ISS. Since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011, NASA has depended on Russian Soyuz flights to get astronauts to ISS. As one of the contract’s “milestones,” NASA requires SpaceX to track the flights from ground stations at various locations, thus the Boca Chica antennas. The company broke ground on a launch site at Boca Chica in September 2014 with the company’s CEO and chief designer and then-governor Rick Perry on hand. SpaceX plans 12 launches per year from the site once it’s complete. The company had planned the first launch from Boca Chica for 2016, though it discovered the site needed to be stabilized, which involved trucking in 310,000 cubic yards of soil and has delayed construction. The revised schedule has the first Boca Chica launch taking place sometime in 2018. SpaceX said the first ground station antenna will arrive at Boca Chica via tractor-trailer in October. A thick concrete foundation will have to be poured first and allowed to cure for at least one month before the antenna is installed, the company said. The antenna’s heavy hydraulics will be removed prior to shipping and replaced by electronics once at Boca Chica. According to the contract, SpaceX must have the first antenna installed before the end of the year and “qualified” (certified by NASA as being installed correctly) by spring, SpaceX said. No date has been set for shipment of the second antenna, the company said. NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson said SpaceX has been awarded two “post-certification” missions to ISS, which can proceed only after two successful test flights are completed. “The way the program works is we’ll have two test flights: one uncrewed — obviously that would come first — then crewed,” she said. Thompson said the crewed test flight will involve two astronauts, though she didn’t know how many would be traveling to ISS on the first actual mission. All flights are scheduled to take place in 2017, though Thompson said specific dates haven’t been set. sclark@brownsvilleherald.com Discuss Print Posted in Business on Saturday, August 13, 2016 10:16 pm.

Space Camp Alum Dr. Kate Rubins spent her first spacewalk installing a new front door that astronauts will use when they launch from American soil. Rubin and ISS Commander Jeff Williams spent 6-and-a-half hours installing the door, which will be used by Space X and Boeing. NASA astronauts will start using it in 2018.  Boeing Starliner will use the Atlas V, which is made in Decatur, and they are building the first rocket for that Starliner right now. So in 2018, rather than paying Russia $70 million per seat, NASA will be paying American companies to send our astronauts into space.

The docking adaptor will serve as a "parking spot" for incoming spaceships.  ( NASA | YouTube ) Advertisement With private companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin now venturing into commercial spaceflight, the International Space Station (ISS) is expecting more spaceship traffic in the coming years. Before that can happen, however, the space station has to have a "parking spot" for all upcoming commercial spaceships. On Friday, Aug. 19, two NASA astronauts successfully installed a new docking port at the ISS, ending the United States' dependence on Russia for rides to the orbiting outpost. Astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins hovered outside the space station for a spacewalk that lasted five hours and 58 minutes to attach the first of two international docking adaptors. The second docking adaptor will be launched to the space station in late 2017. Williams, who is currently the Station Commander of the six-member crew, has performed a spacewalk four times in his career, while Rubins, who is the flight engineer, experienced the spacewalk for the first time. For more than two hours, the two astronauts attempted to tie down the docking adaptor, which had been built by Boeing, and successfully attached it. The adaptor is around 1 meter (42 inches) in height and 1.6 meter (63 inches) in width. After installation, the robotic machinery at the ISS completed the hard mate, successfully making it permanent. During the rest of the mission, Williams and Rubins linked data and power cables for the adaptor. These fittings will allow the space station to share data and power with visiting spacecraft. "With that, we have a new port of call," Rob Navias, NASA commentator, said as the space station floated over Singapore at 10:40 a.m. (1440 GMT). Kenneth Todd, the operations integration manager at the ISS, described the installation as a significant milestone in the aspect of establishing commercial crew capability. NASA believes the new docking port at the space station is the "gateway to a future" that will allow a new generation of American spacecraft to lift astronauts to space. According to NASA, the new adaptors will work with SpaceX's Crew Dragon and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, both of which are still under construction and are expected to ferry astronauts to the space station. The new adaptor is more sophisticated than past equipment as it will enable automatic parking instead of the grapple and berthing process, NASA said. Rubins and Williams will perform another spacewalk on Sept. 1 to revoke a solar array cooling panel no longer in use, as well as to install a television camera on the exterior frame of the ISS.

Home Gaming Sci + Tech Gear Lifestyle Movies + TV Contact Sci + Tech Trending Astronauts are Installing a Critical New Airlock on the ISS August 19, 2016 Share Tweet Pin Reddit Stumble NASA astronauts Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins are conducting one of the most vital spacewalks for the future of the International Space Station. The pair switched their spacesuits to battery power at 8:04 am ET and began a more than six-hour spacewalk. Their mission? To install the first of two international docking adapters (IDAs). Without these adapters, manned missions from Boeing and SpaceX are a no go. Getting the first IDA to the ISS took a bit longer than expected. The first one was originally launched to the ISS back by SpaceX in June 2015. But that mission failed when the launch vehicle disintegrated about two minutes after launch. Installing the international docking adapter Williams is no stranger to working outside the ISS. Today’s spacewalk will be his fourth. For Rubins, it will be her first stroll into space. Did You Know: Today’s spacewalk is the 194th for the International Space Station. The first three happened in quick succession as astronauts Jerry Ross and James Newman worked on the ISS three times in just six days in December 1998. The longest spacewalk was in March 2001 and lasted 8 hours, 56 minutes. Work for today’s spacewalk began on Wednesday when ground controllers used the robotic arm to snatch the IDA from the Dragon spacecraft and place it 2 feet away from the Pressurized Mating Adapter-2 (PMA). Once the IDA is moved into contact with the PMA, Williams and Rubins will hook up tethers. After that, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) astronaut Takuya Onishi will send commands to close the hooks between the two docking ports. With the IDA secured to the ISS, the two spacewalking astronauts will connect the all-important power and data connectors. Related New Horizons Will Be Seeing Red Again on 2014 MU69 In about four hours, Williams and Rubins will wrap up their work installing the first IDA. And with it, the first important step to NASA no longer relying on Russia to get astronauts to the ISS. SUCCESS! Intl. Docking Adapter officially installed at 10:40am ET. Will welcome future @Commercial_Crew vehicles. https://t.co/t8KQbBZMJV — Intl. Space Station (@Space_Station) August 19, 2016 Launching astronauts from the U.S. The last time NASA astronauts headed to orbit from the U.S. was the final shuttle flight in 2011. Five years later, Williams and Rubins are laying the foundation for those flights to start again. NASA tapped SpaceX and Boeing to bring their astronauts to the ISS and back again. SpaceX is targeting a test flight with two astronauts in late 2017. Boeing is looking at 2018 for their first test flight. Once the tests are completed and NASA gives the go-ahead, the two companies can begin ferrying astronauts to the ISS. Look for these dates to shift around some. It wouldn’t surprise me for both tests to be in 2018 with the first official crew mission to the ISS in 2019. With SpaceX and Boeing shouldering the load for delivering astronauts to orbit, it frees up NASA for grander things. The main one being a manned mission to Mars in the 2030s. We’ve heard all about the elusive mission to Mars when we were kids. But it feels like some progress is finally being made now.

United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed and Boeing, sent a pair of U.S. Air Force satellites into space on a Delta IV rocket on Friday. The launch from Cape Canaveral went smoothly about an hour after midnight at 0052edt (0452gmt). The rocket will deliver two Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program into near geo-synchronous orbit later in the morning. The United Launch Alliance (ULA) fulfilled a similar mission for the Air Force on July 28, 2014. The launch marked the 110th mission for ULA since it was founded in 2006 and the seventh so far in 2016.

(Scott Sommerdorf | The Salt Lake Tribune) Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams during an interview in his office, Wednesday, April 17, 2013. McAdams proposed a $1.1 billion budget for 2015 on Oct. 28, 2014. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) Economic development and jobs are top priorities for us. As Salt Lake County mayor and as a state senator, we've supported many projects where businesses get tax support in exchange for creating good-paying jobs and bringing more economic growth to the state. But when taxpayer dollars are on the line, one question stands out: Is it a fair deal for taxpayers? West Jordan City's proposed data center project would be built on 230 acres of vacant West Jordan farmland. It will be highly automated and managed remotely with software installed on laptops. Initially, 50-70 jobs would result. The Economic Development Area plan put forth by West Jordan City asks for a total tax subsidy of $240 million — taxes that would come from the school district, the county, the county library, the state, and even city energy taxes for 20 years. VIDEOS TOP JOBS If you do the math, we'd be paying between $2 million and $3.4 million per job. That's far more than has ever been spent by economic development officials to lure businesses such as eBay, Adobe or Boeing. Those companies not only support thousands of jobs, but also produce a multiplier effect, as they spend money locally for goods and services. The data center's equipment is manufactured and purchased in China. Much of the building itself is pre-fabricated, trucked in and then assembled. West Jordan City has provided shifting and incomplete budget numbers. We know that the city has approved projects whose terms were rejected by other neighboring cities and has a poor track record with past Economic Development Areas. Four EDAs that the city created went bankrupt or left Utah's market; one only produced taxes for six of the projected 12 years; and one didn't trigger any growth until six years after its approval. As elected officials who must balance our budgets and advertise every proposed tax increase, we must scrutinize these deals. A bad deal means less money to fund all the services our residents currently receive, a shortage for our school children, and a worst case scenario of having to raise taxes to make up a deficit. We know that the proposed structures, which are essentially very large refrigerated buildings to keep computer servers from overheating, come with a legal contract for delivery of 4.8 million gallons of water per day. They may use less during the winter season, but the water must be available should they need it. Utah is the second driest state in the country. In our fast-growing area, water is a finite and a precious commodity and is essential to every current and future resident and business. The data center company in question is worth billions of dollars and earns a profit of more than $22 million a day. We offer one vital ingredient other states cannot match — numerous fiber optic cables buried in the ground for them to connect to the Internet. In fact, Salt Lake County has one of the greatest densities in the country for fiber optic lines. We should not sell our real estate or our taxpayers short just because a famous name comes calling. The data center needs our location far more than we need the 50-100 server manager jobs it offers. Openness and accountability for how we spend your hard-earned tax dollars is our priority. Our duty as public servants is to shine a light on any deal that involves taxes and billion dollar private corporations. After all, it's your money.

(Photo: HO / AFP/Getty Images) Cape Canaveral, Fla. — Spacewalking astronauts installed a new front door for visitors at the International Space Station on Friday, the crucial first step in welcoming commercial crew capsules as soon as next year. The two Americans, Jeffrey Williams and Kate Rubins, hooked up the docking port — their major objective — in just a few hours. They were about to tackle some extra chores, but a problem cropped up with the right earpiece in Williams’ helmet and he had trouble hearing. Mission Control decided to play it safe and bring them inside about a half hour early. The spacewalk concluded at the six-hour mark. “We’re done for the day,” Mission Control advised the crew. Williams assured flight controllers that his helmet was dry. The last NASA spacewalk in January was cut short because of a small water leak in one helmet. A much bigger leak, from the suit’s cooling system, almost led to a spacewalker’s drowning in 2013. The station’s new gateway arrived last month, packed in the trunk of a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule. Americans haven’t rocketed into orbit from their home turf since NASA’s last shuttle flight in 2011. SpaceX and Boeing expect to resume human launches from Cape Canaveral in another year or two. But their crew capsules can’t dock without this new-style parking spot, which replaces the now obsolete shuttle setup and is meant to be internationally compatible. Friday’s success paved the way for these future spaceships. “Thanks for your help in getting the front door on the space station,” Mission Control radioed. SpaceX is shooting for a test flight of its souped-up Dragon with two astronauts as early as a year from now. Boeing is aiming for a two-person shakedown of its Starliner capsule in early 2018. Until then, Russia will keep providing all the rides — at a hefty price for U.S. taxpayers. NASA started using private U.S. companies to carry out cargo shipments a few years back. Commercial crew launches will be an even bigger advance. This commercial handoff is freeing up NASA to focus on true outer-space exploration; the space agency is working to get astronauts to Mars in the 2030s. This is actually NASA’s second new docking ring. The first was destroyed in a SpaceX launch accident last summer. NASA ultimately wants two of these parking places at the lab.

It was a key step in NASA’s drive to regain independent access to the lab complex for the first time since the space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011. Attached to the station’s no-longer-needed shuttle port at the front of the station, the Boeing-built International Docking Adapter will allow spacecraft from both companies to bring crews to the outpost, ending NASA’s sole reliance on Russian Soyuz ferry ships.

The successful spacewalk occurred a day after a key leader at NASA announced the space agency was looking to hand off control of the ISS to a private company within the next decade. The astronauts installing the new International Docking Adapter (IDA) were Jeff Williams, the commander of the most recent expedition of NASA astronauts to the ISS, and flight engineer Kate Rubins. The spacewalk was the first for Rubins and the fourth for Williams. The IDA will allow new capsules built by private space exploration companies to connect to the ISS. With the new entrance, NASA is also effectively ending Russia’s dominance of handling cargo to the ISS – all other entrances to the ISS are controlled by the United States’ historic space rival. NASA believes that by allowing more commercial access to the ISS, it is preparing the way for the first manned mission to Mars. “Commercial crew flights from Florida’s Space Coast to the International Space Station will restore America’s human launch capability and increase the time U.S. crews can dedicate to scientific research, which is helping prepare astronauts for deep space missions, including the journey to Mars,” NASA spokesman Mark Garcia said in a statement. The expansion of NASA’s partnership with private companies does not end with the IDA. NASA Deputy Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development Bill Hill announced Thursday that the space agency is planning to hand over control of the ISS to a private company by the mid-2020s. “Ultimately, our desire is to hand the space station over to either a commercial entity or some other commercial capability so that research can continue in low-Earth orbit,” Hill said at the conference.

(Aug. 15, 2016) -- Six Technology Investment Agreements were awarded under the Architecture Implementation Process Demonstrations as part of the Future Vertical Lift efforts that continue in the Joint Multi Role Technology Demonstrator program. The JMR TD is an Army science and technology program designed to develop, expand and demonstrate new capabilities in vertical lift technology and is a precursor to the Department of Defense FVL program. FVL will deliver the next generation of vertical lift aircraft to the joint warfighter, providing the speed, range, payload and mission systems critical to successfully engaging the enemy in future operations. The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center leads the JMR TD effort. The six TIAs were awarded to: The Boeing Company, GE Aviation Systems, Honeywell, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation and Rockwell Collins. The AIPD efforts are the second major demonstration effort within the Mission Systems Architecture Demonstration portion of the JMR TD. "These awards represent the next major step in identifying the elements required for successful implementation of a truly Open Systems Architecture for DoD's future vertical lift fleet," said Dan Bailey, JMR TD program director. The AIPD TIAs are 12-month efforts with each company proposing a technical path to use available design tools and standards. The TIAs are intended to further mature the Joint Common Architecture approach and its role in supporting both Open System Architecture and systematic reuse of software and integration knowledge. The previous demonstration, JCA Demo, was a proof of concept to verify the feasibility of the JCA approach. The next major demonstration, Capstone, will begin in the 2018 timeframe and include a more complete implementation of the many elements of an architecture and the partnerships required to execute that strategy. ---- The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center is part of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, which has the mission to ensure decisive overmatch for unified land operations to empower the Army, the joint warfighter and our nation. RDECOM is a major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Materiel Command.
