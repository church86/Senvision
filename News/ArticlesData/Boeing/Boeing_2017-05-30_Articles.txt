Although he stopped short of cancelling the Liberal government’s plan to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighters from Boeing, Sajjan said the U.S. firm has damaged its relationship with Canada. Boeing has complained to the U.S. government that Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is receiving subsidies, which in turn, allowed it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behaviour of a trusted partner,” Sajjan told industry representatives Wednesday at the CANSEC defence trade show in Ottawa. He called on Boeing to withdraw its complaint. Sajjan said Canada requires “trusted industry partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also recently chastened Boeing for its actions. But Sajjan’s dressing down of the company in such a high profile forum is considered by industry representatives as unprecedented. The Liberals are now reviewing the Super Hornet jet proposal and whether it should continue. “We are continuing our discussions with the U.S. government and we continue to do that,” Sajjan said of talks over the acquisition of the fighter jets. Canada, however, is no longer talking to Boeing officials. The Super Hornet purchase, if it proceeds, is expected to cost $5 billion to $7 billion. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. That was expected to be in place by the end of the year or early next year. It is unclear now on when that deal might proceed or whether it will be scuttled if Boeing does not withdraw its complaint against Bombardier. Other aerospace firms are in the wings ready to offer Canada new aircraft. Those companies include Lockheed Martin with its F-35 fighter jet. Sajjan said Canada has had a good relationship with Boeing over the decades but it is now reviewing all procurements with that company. Sajjan’s dig at Boeing comes as the U.S. firm prepares to announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project. That will happen at CANSEC on Thursday. On the Wednesday at CANSEC the Boeing team was highlighting the company’s long-term commitment to Canada. The U.S. investigation into Bombardier will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim.   Boeing Company Harjit Sajjan sponsored Mark Norman’s replacement makes his public debut  Protesters jam up CANSEC traffic Video Connect With Us Email Alerts Get the latest news in your mailbox as it happens Weather Weather Currently Feels Like We want you to have the most accurate weather report you can.

Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a “trusted partner” and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. He repeated the Canadian government’s thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. “A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial,” the minister said. “That is why our government _ and I stress this _ our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing’s petition against Bombardier.” Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company’s trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. “It’s more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case,” he said. “We’re going to continue working with the U.S. navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada.” Day said Boeing operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country’s aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. “We value Canada as a supplier-partner.” Sajjan also said the defence policy review that he will unveil next week will be linked to the government’s broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. Sajjan also made a pitch for the defence industry to help Canada with its broader agenda with the U.S. _ keeping borders open to trade in the face of possible protectionist action by the Donald Trump administration. “We call on all of our industry partners to speak with one voice about the interconnectedness of the defence industry supply chain between Canada and the United States,” Sajjan said. “We need your help in making the clear case of ensuring goods continue to flow freely across our two countries. We need your voices to articulate the consequences should our borders be closed. The government will continue to deliver this same message.” Follow us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Get our daily briefing on innovation, leadership, technology & the economy. Weekdays at 6 AM ET.

In the prepared text of a speech, Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon an anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier Inc, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the U.S. firm's behavior. Earlier this month, in response to the trade challenge, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners on the U.S. market at artificially low prices. Sajjan says the Super Hornets are needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its ageing fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces ... I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it," he continued.

Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the U.S. company's behavior. Canada has threatened to scrap plans to buy Boeing fighter jets over the dispute. "We have a longstanding relationship with Boeing, and as I stated, we're hoping that this can be resolved in a ... manner that respects everyone," Sajjan told reporters on the sidelines of a defence industry event in Ottawa. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners in the U.S. market at artificially low prices. In response to Sajjan's request to withdraw the petition, Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that "this is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues." Earlier this month, in response to Boeing's challenge at the U.S. International Trade Commission, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. . When asked whether Ottawa would scrap the order if Boeing failed to drop its complaint, Sajjan said "we need to let the process take its course." The Super Hornets are needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces ... I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said during a speech. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it."

Skip to navigation Skip to content Skip to sidebar News National More Defence minister says Boeing’s complaint about Bombardier means it’s no longer a ‘trusted partner’ David Pugliese, Ottawa Citizen  05.31.2017 The Liberal government announced earlier this year a plan to purchase "interim" Super Hornets form Boeing. Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan rises during Question Period in the House of Commons on Parliament Hill, Friday, April 7, 2017 in Ottawa. The Boeing F-18 Super Hornet performs during its demonstration flight, on the first day of the 47th Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, north of Paris on June 18, 2007. ShareAdjustCommentPrint Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan suggested Wednesday that Boeing, the U.S. aerospace firm from whom the government is considering purchasing billions of dollars worth of fighter jets, can no longer be considered a trusted partner. And though he stopped short of cancelling the Liberal government’s plan to purchase 18 Super Hornet fighters from Boeing, Sajjan said company has damaged its relationship with Canada. Boeing has complained to the U.S. government that Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier is receiving subsidies, allowing it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. Boeing convinced the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Bombardier. “It is not the behaviour of a trusted partner,” Sajjan told industry representatives Wednesday at the CANSEC defence trade show in Ottawa. He called on Boeing to withdraw its complaint, saying Canada requires “trusted industry partners.” Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland also recently chastened Boeing for its actions. But industry representatives consider Sajjan’s dressing down of the company in such a high-profile forum unprecedented. The Liberals are now reviewing the Super Hornet jet proposal and whether they should continue with it. “We are continuing our discussions with the U.S. government and we continue to do that,” Sajjan said. Canada, however, is no longer talking to Boeing officials. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. It was expected to do so by the end of this year or early next. If it proceeds, the Super Hornet purchase is expected to cost between $5 billion and $7 billion.  It is now unclear when the deal might proceed, or if it will be scuttled if Boeing does not withdraw its complaint against Bombardier. Other aerospace firms are in the wings ready to offer Canada new aircraft, including Lockheed Martin with its F-35 fighter jet. Sajjan said Canada has had a good relationship with Boeing over the decades but is now reviewing all procurement with that company. The defence minister’s dig at Boeing comes as the U.S. firm prepares to announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project. That announcement is expected to come at CANSEC on Thursday. On Wednesday the Boeing team used the defence industry trade show to highlight the company’s long-term commitment to Canada. The U.S. investigation into Bombardier will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim. • Email: dpugliese@postmedia.com | Twitter: davidpugliese Comments We encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

In the prepared text of a speech, Mr Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon an anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the US firm’s behaviour. Earlier this month, in response to the trade challenge, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners on the US market at artificially low prices. Mr Sajjan said the Super Hornets were needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its ageing fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces … I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it," he continued. * Reuters business@thenational.ae Follow The National’s Business section on Twitter Pages: Add your comment View all comments More Aviation Extended travel ban on electronic devices likely to hit demand for EU and US carriers Emirates shows a clean pair of heels on jet cleaning Executive travel: Business class experience in economy while on Emirates flight to Budapest More turbulence ahead for loss-making Air India MOST VIEWED Business | All Emirates shows a clean pair of heels on jet cleaning Statement saying GFH Financial Group pulling out of merger talks with Shuaa Capital removed from bourse site More turbulence ahead for loss-making Air India Executive travel: Business class experience in economy while on Emirates flight to Budapest Extended travel ban on electronic devices likely to hit demand for EU and US carriers Need a plumber or a handyman?

Hainan Airlines unveils third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane as part of collaboration with DreamWorks Animation Hainan Airlines unveils third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane as part of collaboration with DreamWorks Animation TRASPORTI E LOGISTICA Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp Pubblicato il: 31/05/2017 12:47 The plane featuring a design by young American designer Hannah Foss takes its inaugural flight, in celebration of the Chinese airline's 24 th anniversary BEIJING, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A Hainan Airlines' Dreamliner, adorned with Po, the main character in the Kung Fu Panda film, and the famous panda's friends, took off on the inaugural flight for its new service HU7181, from Haikou to Beijing, on the morning of May 29, 2017. As the Chinese airline's third Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in the fleet to receive the "King Fu Panda" makeover, the eye-catching yellow-colored airplane started its maiden flight to the cheers of the crowd. The flight carried a special passenger, Hannah Foss, a young designer from the state of Alaska. When Hannah Foss submitted her "Kung Fu Panda"-themed Dreamliner design last September, she was one of nearly 3,000 online entries that all shared the same dream: To have their design painted on a real-life, Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. That dream started several months ago when Hainan, Boeing and DreamWorks announced a partnership that would include the introduction of six specially-painted Dreamliners over the next two years, featuring characters and scenes from the popular animated franchise. "I have loved painting and designing since I was a child. I have designed a dinosaur exhibition for a museum and depicted the Northern lights around the Arctic Circle in my artwork. But I never thought that my design would be painted on a plane someday. It feels amazing! This is the first time that I have come to China, taken a Boeing Dreamliner and witnessed the process of the painting of a plane. I really appreciate these "firsts" that Hainan Airlines has offered to me," Ms. Foss said as part of a speech she gave over the plane's announcement system during which she shared her thrilling story with the over 200 passengers on the flight. "This is an exceptional journey for me, giving many Americans like myself the opportunity to learn about Hainan Airlines and better understand the distinguished Chinese company's idea of cherishing every person's dream in addition to its ongoing commitment to fulfilling dreams." Hannah grew up in Adelaide, South Australia and moved to Alaska in 2008.    Some of her adventures include spending several years as a paleontological artist, CGI-animating a couple of museum films, constructing a 16-ft long dinosaur puppet called Snaps, eating tasty muktuk, snow-machining on the Chukchi Sea and meeting a polar bear. In addition to having her design painted on a Dreamlinerand to be part of this amazing journey, Hannah won two round-trip, business class tickets to China, as well as a weeks' accommodations at a luxury hotel. The "Kung Fu Panda" story is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and history. Hannah's design wove together popular characters like Po and Tigress, with traditional Chinese "chops" and a painted sunrise. The design was awarded the top prize based on its originality, creativity, humor, its reflection of Chinese culture, and its wow factor. When Hannah's design is painted onto the new Dreamliner, the airplane will fly several of Hainan's more than 40 nonstop routes between China and North America. It will join two other specially painted airplanes, the first of which touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last year. That airplane carried over 100 students and teachers from Lincoln High School in Tacoma, WA, who were returning from a life-changing, 11-day trip to China. Hainan Airlines is proud to partner with DreamWorks and Boeing to bring the "Kung Fu Panda" franchise to Hainan's elite service and premier experience. Look forward for more partnerships like this in the future, and be sure to keep an eye out for #TheFlyingPanda throughout our North American network! Hainan Airlines has continued with its strategy of working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative as part of its overall plan to aggressively expand its presence in international markets. Nevertheless, despite the complexities of operating in the highly competitive international markets, the airline has never wavered from its original set of goals of consistently combining the brand's unique Oriental hospitality with modern service standards, a concept which is embodied in the Kung Fu Panda planes. The airline has promoted its image in the global aviation market through the cooperation with DreamWorks, demonstrating the newfound stature of Chinese companies on the world stage while allowing travelers everywhere to gain a better understanding of Chinese culture and its richness.     Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517732/3rd_Kung_Fu_Panda_themed_plane.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517733/Hannah_Foss.jpgPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/517731/Hannah_Foss_with_crew.jpg   Tweet Condividi su WhatsApp TAG: Immediapress, comunicati, aziende informano, press release Commenti Per scrivere un commento è necessario registrarsi ed accedere: ACCEDI oppure REGISTRATI Il rifornimento in volo 'mozza il fiato' Cerca Notizie Più Cliccate 1.

Deal Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Head of the Public Relations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Reza Jafarzadeh warned Washington that any restriction on Tehran's purchase of passenger planes would violate the 2015 nuclear deal. "Any restriction on the sales of airplanes to Iran violates the nuclear deal by the US," Jafarzadeh said on Wednesday. Stressing that the European governments do not agree with imposition of restrictions on the sales of passenger planes to Iran, he said that they will not allow the US to do so because the interests of their companies will be at risk. On Tuesday, the Iranian government warned the foreign states and companies which have signed contracts to sell passenger planes to Tehran of the country's reciprocal moves if the other parties defy their undertakings. "If any measure is taken in violation of the contract to purchase planes, we will reciprocate," Government Spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran. His remarks came after US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin announced last week that the department is reviewing licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran. Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. The review suggests that Trump’s support for Boeing’s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has said that halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. For Boeing, losing the Iran Air deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the wide-body jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to Iran Air by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year. Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40% this year under plans that include Iran Air’s still-tentative order. Iran's National Flag Carrier, Iran Air, has agreed to buy 200 US and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need US licenses because of their reliance on US parts. Meantime, Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh announced late in March that the giant aviation company Airbus has delivered the third passenger plane to the country. "The third Airbus, an A330, landed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport," Parvaresh said at the time. He noted that the A330 plane which has 32 business class and 206 economy class seats is suitable for long-distance flights.         Related News Iran Issues Stern Warning over Passenger Planes Contracts  LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo Homs: Army Forces Claim More Territory in Syria's Desert Iraqi Volunteer Forces Capture Ba'aj West of Mosul from ISIL Iraqis Leave Zanjili Neighborhood as Security Forces Continue Fighting ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Pounding ISIL with Rockets in Syrian Border Region Syria: Army Soldiers Recapture Maskana's Water Pumping Station in Eastern Aleppo 7 Dead, 48 Injured in London Attacks Damascus: Inside Syrian Army's Tank Factory US-Backed Militants Take Control of Syria's 3rd largest Dam as Kurds Allow ISIL to Withdraw from Raqqa Syrian Soldiers Expel ISIL from Aleppo; Maskana Freed Envoy: Iran to Continue Supporting Syria in Anti-Terror Fight Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in UK Iran Warns Against Terrorist Plots to Undermine Security in Region Iran: Paris Deal Withdrawal Shows US Irresponsibility Towards Int'l Community Dara'a: Syrian Army Kills Tens of Al-Nusra Terrorists, 3 Commanders Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army managed to capture 22 villages and farms near Maskana and eventually forced the ISIL terrorists to retreat from its last stronghold in Aleppo province, the town of Maskana, towards Raqqa province.

Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors.

Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the "unfounded" action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint.

"A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial," the minister said. "That is why our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. "We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing's petition against Bombardier." Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company's trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. "It's more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case," he said. "We're going to continue working with the U.S. navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." "Our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners." Day said Boeing operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country's aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. "We value Canada as a supplier-partner." Sajjan also said the defence policy review that he will unveil next week will be linked to the government's broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers.

Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld next play/pause pre OTTAWA — As he highlighted the defence industry as a driver of economic growth, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also used a major speech Wednesday to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the "unfounded" action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors in Ottawa. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. The minister stressed the military's links with industry in a speech that also gave new details about the defence policy review that he will unveil next week — it will be linked to the government's broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. He identified four areas of focus: alternative fuels, surveillance tools, remotely piloted systems and systems to counter IEDs. "We will establish world-class research clusters, comprised of academics, industry leaders, government scientists," Sajjan said, adding that cutting edge research and development "will determine the outcome of tomorrow's conflicts." The Canadian Forces will help companies field test new products to ensure they meet military needs. "It means we give business the experience and exposures they can use to pursue opportunities in global markets." The military's newly installed second-in-command, Lt.-Gen. Alain Parent, said the Canadian Forces will make innovation a priority because it is a "strategic imperative" in the world's complex security environment. "To prevail in that environment, we need to exploit every decisive advantage over potential adversaries," Parent told the same large CANSEC military trade show. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, in a separate CANSEC speech, underlined the contribution of the defence industry to the Canadian economy — $9 billion a year of economic activity and 63,000 skilled jobs in small and large firms. "To remain competitive, Canada must be committed to innovation," Bains said. "I appreciate this industry's long history of finding new and better ways to accomplish the mission." Boeing, however, was singled out for pointed criticism. Sajjan repeated the Canadian government's thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. "A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial," Sajjan said. "That is why our government — and I stress this — our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. "We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing's petition against Bombardier." Scott Day, a spokesman for Boeing, defended the company's trade action, suggesting it should not be linked to its military relationship with Canada. "It's more of a commercial issue with regard to the Bombardier case," he said. "We're going to continue working with the U.S. navy, providing information on the Super Hornet that will be provided to the government of Canada." Day said Boeing operations in Canada account for 14 per cent of the country's aerospace industry. That includes 560 companies that provide parts to Boeing commercial airplanes and 2,000 company workers in the country. "We value Canada as a supplier-partner." Sajjan also made a pitch for the defence industry to help Canada with its broader agenda with the U.S. — keeping borders open to trade in the face of possible protectionist action by the Donald Trump administration. "We call on all of our industry partners to speak with one voice about the interconnectedness of the defence industry supply chain between Canada and the United States," Sajjan said. "We need your help in making the clear case of ensuring goods continue to flow freely across our two countries. We need your voices to articulate the consequences should our borders be closed.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Mike Blanchfield, The Canadian Press on May 31, 2017. Minister of National Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan speaks at the Canadian Association of Defence and Security conference in Ottawa, Wednesday May 31, 2017. Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld OTTAWA – Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan used a major speech Wednesday to the defence industry to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the “unfounded” action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a “trusted partner” and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. He repeated the Canadian government’s thinly veiled retaliation threat to scrap the planned purchase of 18 Super Hornet fighter jets from the Boeing. “A productive relationship between industry and government is crucial,” the minister said. “That is why our government – and I stress this – our government is disappointed in the action of one of our leading industry partners. “We strongly disagree with the decision of the United States Commerce Department to initiate a trade remedy case in response to Boeing’s petition against Bombardier.” Sajjan also said the defence policy review that he will unveil next week will be linked to the government’s broader innovation agenda. He said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. Sajjan also made a pitch for the defence industry to help Canada with its broader agenda with the U.S. – keeping borders open to trade in the face of possible protectionist action by the Donald Trump administration. “We call on all of our industry partners to speak with one voice about the interconnectedness of the defence industry supply chain between Canada and the United States,” Sajjan said. “We need your help in making the clear case of ensuring goods continue to flow freely across our two countries. We need your voices to articulate the consequences should our borders be closed. The government will continue to deliver this same message.” 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

Accordingly, we are engaged in a fleet review with Boeing, and are taking up opportunities to accelerate fleet growth in 2018 and 2019 by extending 10 of our planned lease returns in these years, and adding selectively to our current order where Boeing may have some delivery opportunities over the next 24 months,” Ryanair said at the release of its 2016-17 full-year results. Speaking during the question and answer session of the results briefing in London, Ryanair CFO Neil Sorahan said talks are underway to extend leased aircraft into 2018 and into the summer of 2019. New aircraft are also an option, as is retaining older aircraft that were slated to be sold and leave the fleet post 2020-21. “We’ve said to Boeing that if they have two or three aircraft at the right price, we would be more than happy to pick up those slots,” Sorahan said. “We’re in negotiations; we are not over the line yet.” This will give Ryanair “more firepower” for opportunities created by “deep restructuring” at competitor airlines, such as Etihad equity partners Alitalia and airberlin, which Ryanair chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said “will continue to get smaller.” “We are aware of the need to have additional short-haul aircraft to respond quickly as these unique growth opportunities arise,” Ryanair said. Ryanair also named Poland and Romania as other targets. One area for fleet growth will be Ryanair’s new Polish charter airline, Ryanair Sun. This airline will launch in summer 2018 under its own air operator’s certificate with a fleet of five aircraft, growing to 15 aircraft by summer 2019. Sorahan told ATW  the new charter airline is purely a niche market opportunity in Eastern Europe—it is unrelated to Brexit and does not form part of a wider plan. Over the last five weeks, Ryanair CCO David O’Brien said the team has met with 180 airports, all of which were willing to improve their proposals to attract Ryanair growth. Ryanair posted a 94% average load factor for 2016-17, demonstrating to airports that the LCC is a “reliable partner” when it comes to delivering aircraft filled with passengers, O’Brien said. Under the existing fleet plan, Ryanair will grow its fleet to 427 aircraft by March 2018. In 2019 the fleet will total 448 aircraft, growing to 481 in 2020, 516 aircraft in 2021, 540 in 2022, 575 in 2023 and 585 in 2024. Ryanair already has Boeing 737 MAXs on order, which will begin arriving in autumn 2019.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/Files 1/2 left right People attend the Bombardier stand during the European Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (EBACE) at Cointrin airport in Geneva, Switzerland, May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/Files 2/2 OTTAWA Canada's defence minister, Harjit Sajjan, said on Wednesday that Boeing Co will be a trusted military ally in decades to come, but that its anti-dumping petition against Bombardier Inc is not behavior expected of a partner. Sajjan called on Boeing to abandon the anti-dumping challenge it has launched against Canadian plane maker Bombardier, saying Ottawa was disappointed by the U.S. company's behavior. Canada has threatened to scrap plans to buy Boeing fighter jets over the dispute. "We have a longstanding relationship with Boeing, and as I stated, we're hoping that this can be resolved in a ... manner that respects everyone," Sajjan told reporters on the sidelines of a defence industry event in Ottawa. Boeing accuses Bombardier of selling airliners in the U.S. market at artificially low prices. In response to Sajjan's request to withdraw the petition, Boeing spokesman Dan Curran said by email that "this is a commercial matter that Boeing is seeking to address through the normal course for resolving such issues." Earlier this month, in response to Boeing's challenge at the U.S. International Trade Commission, Canada said it was reviewing the planned purchase of 18 Boeing Super Hornet jets.. When asked whether Ottawa would scrap the order if Boeing failed to drop its complaint, Sajjan said "we need to let the process take its course." The Super Hornets are needed as an interim measure until Ottawa can run a competition to replace its aging fleet of CF-18 fighters. "The interim fleet procurement requires a trusted industry partner. For decades, Boeing has been an outstanding partner with the Canadian Armed Forces ... I expect that to be the case in the decades to come," he said during a speech. "However, our government is of the view that their action against Bombardier is unfounded. It is not the behavior we expect of a trusted partner, and we call on Boeing to withdraw it."

"Aseman Airlines has recently signed an MoU with the Boeing company to buy 30 Boeing 737 planes but finalization of the contract depends on permission of OFAC (the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the US Department of the Treasury)," Secretary of Iranian Airlines Association Maqsoud Asa'adi Samani said. CEO of Iran's national flag carrier, Iran Air, Farhad Parvaresh announced in April that Boeing will deliver its first passenger plane to the country early next year. "The first Boeing 777 jumbo jet will be handed over to Iran in April 2018," Parvaresh told reporters. In a relevant development in early April, Iran signed a new agreement with Boeing to purchase several twinjet narrow-body passenger planes. The agreement was signed between Iran's Aseman Airlines and Boeing and involves the purchase of 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes. The agreement came after almost a year of negotiations between Aseman Airlines and Boeing. Boeing is to provide 50 planes of the same type to Iran Air through a similar agreement. The overall value of Iran Air’s order that also involves 30 long-range wide-body 777 aircraft is estimated to be $16.6 billion. The planes are expected to be delivered to Aseman Airlines from 2019. The Iranian airline is expected to receive at least five of the purchased aircraft during the same year. Boeing 737 MAX planes - that would enter service in the second half of 2017 – have a passenger capacity of 130 people and are specifically adequate for domestic and regional flights. The planes that Aseman Airlines has purchased from Boeing would increase the company’s passenger transportation capacity to above 8,000 seats. Iran Air said in December 2016 that it had finalized an agreement with Boeing to buy 80 new planes. The company accordingly announced that Boeing would start to deliver the planes in 2018 and the deliveries would be completed within 10 years. Iran has already received the first three of a total of 100 Airbus planes that it has purchased from the European company through an agreement worth around $18 billion. More deliveries are expected to take place over the next months.         LATEST STORIES (8) Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo Homs: Army Forces Claim More Territory in Syria's Desert Iraqi Volunteer Forces Capture Ba'aj West of Mosul from ISIL Iraqis Leave Zanjili Neighborhood as Security Forces Continue Fighting ISIL in Western Mosul Iraqi Popular Forces Continue Pounding ISIL with Rockets in Syrian Border Region Syria: Army Soldiers Recapture Maskana's Water Pumping Station in Eastern Aleppo 7 Dead, 48 Injured in London Attacks Damascus: Inside Syrian Army's Tank Factory US-Backed Militants Take Control of Syria's 3rd largest Dam as Kurds Allow ISIL to Withdraw from Raqqa Syrian Soldiers Expel ISIL from Aleppo; Maskana Freed Envoy: Iran to Continue Supporting Syria in Anti-Terror Fight Iran Condemns Terrorist Attack in UK Iran Warns Against Terrorist Plots to Undermine Security in Region Iran: Paris Deal Withdrawal Shows US Irresponsibility Towards Int'l Community Dara'a: Syrian Army Kills Tens of Al-Nusra Terrorists, 3 Commanders Syrian Army Controls 22 Villages, Farms near Maskan in Eastern Aleppo TEHRAN (FNA)- Syrian army managed to capture 22 villages and farms near Maskana and eventually forced the ISIL terrorists to retreat from its last stronghold in Aleppo province, the town of Maskana, towards Raqqa province.

Gen. Arnold Bunch: Air Force to Get KC-46 Tanker Program Schedule Update in June Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch: Air Force to Get KC-46 Tanker Program Schedule Update in June Jane Edwards May 31, 2017 Latest News, Resources 116 Views Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy of the U.S. Air Force’s acquisition office, has said Boeing has begun a schedule risk evaluation and will update the service branch by the first week of June whether the KC-46 tanker aircraft program will face another phase of schedule delays, Defense News reported Tuesday. “Boeing’s design of several subsystems and production of conformed hardware are still pending [Federal Aviation Administration] approval, which is slowing flight test execution,” Bunch said in a written testimony Thursday before a House Armed Services subpanel. He noted that several test planes are still integrating design changes and that Boeing is likely to hand over the first aircraft by Sept. 12. Bunch also called on lawmakers to support further modernization work on the KC-135 aircraft and provide sufficient funds for the development of KC-Y and KC-Z planes as follow-on aircraft programs to KC-46A since the 179 new tankers will only replace less than half of the Air Force’s existing fleet of KC-135 and KC-10 aircraft. His testimony came two months after the Government Accountability Office released a report, which showed a 14-month delay in the delivery of the first 18 KC-46 tanker planes and nine air refueling pods.

The airline took the delivery of its 30th Boeing 777-300ER that welcomed with a traditional water salute. The 777-300ER’ arrival, the latest addition to the European carrier’s growing fleet of more than 100 Boeing airplanes, also comes into prominence as a highly significant delivery for the carrier as it is the first aircraft to feature seats by Turkish Seats Industries (TSI), a complete Turkish brand through a close collaboration with Boeing. TSI, the first locally aircraft seat producer in Turkey, which is a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Assan Hanil, aims to play a key role in the global aircraft seat market with its innovative, lightweight, quality products. “While consistently investing in its overall services, Turkish Airlines has always put special emphasis to further built in its infrastructure investments which also make a major contribution to further progress of Turkish Aviation Industry. Three years ago, we partnered in a significant initiative to pioneer another first in Turkish Civil Aviation. By establishing Turkish Seat Industry (TSI), in collaboration with Assan Hanil, we took a more active role in the industry through logistical support. And now we’re taking the delivery of the first aircraft equipped with those locally produced seats designed by TSI, an installation manufactured in Turkey that conforms to all international standards. With adding this 30th Boeing 777-300ER to our ever expanding fleet, we look forward to TSI to become a leading brand across the industry, and be a substantial part of our aircrafts in the near future.” said M. İlker Aycı, Chairman of the Board and the Executive Committee of Turkish Airlines. Commenting this delivery, Can Şaşmaz, General Manager of TSI, said; “TSI have completed the delivery of economy class seats for a Turkish Airlines’ B777 aircraft which is registered as TC-JLK and with a MSN number 60402, where TSI have completed the design, certification and production of the seats earlier than Boeing’s prediction. As TSI, we are honoured and proud to be an important part of Turkish Aviation History and supply seats to iconic Boeing B777 aircraft, in addition to gain the Turkey’ national flag carrier’, Turkish Airlines’ confidence in supporting the airlines aircraft, to note the airline has one of the youngest aircraft fleet currently in operation worldwide.” “Turkish Airlines has been a long-standing and key partner for Boeing and we are proud of their confidence and trust in Boeing’s technology and industry-leading airplanes such as the 777,” said Marty Bentrott, Vice President for Sales, Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “This delivery is especially significant since it is the first to feature seats by Turkish Seat Industries (TSI). We look forward to further developing and strengthening our relationship with Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Aviation Industry.”  Turkish Airlines and Boeing share a long history that goes back to 1945, with the arrival of the airline’s first DC-3/C-47 airliners. Turkish Airlines entered the jet age in the late 1960s, when the airline began operating DC-9, DC-10 and Boeing 707 airplanes. Over the years, the Turkish carrier has also flown the Boeing 727, 757, MD-80 and the most modern 737 and 777 airplanes. Boeing’s backlog with Turkish Airlines includes two 777 Freighters and 75 737 MAXs.  Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Rate Article: 2.5 Select ratingPoorOkayGoodGreatAwesome   Tweet comment (0) Share: Facebook Twitter Google+ Linkedin Pinterest Delicious Stumbleupon Digg Reddit EDITOR’S CHOICE 1 - 4 OF 12 Saudi Fast Food Chains Dry Up During Ramadan Muslim Convert 'Jihadi Jack' Not a Jihadi Anymore, Escapes Daesh ‘Wide Covfefe’: Royal Jordanian Pokes Fun at POTUS Again Iftar Held Outside Trump Tower in Protest Against Islamophobia High-Rise Apartment Building Topples in Alexandria Egypt Launches Series on 'Illegal Migration' Trump’s Popularity Rockets in Saudi Arabia, Say Polls Egyptian Cleric Declares Ramadan Prank Shows ‘un-Islamic’ 7 Sentenced to Death over Rape of Disabled Boy in Kuwait Solar-Powered Hospitals Are Saving Lives in Syria N.J.

(Photo: Wavebreakmedia Ltd./Dreamstime) Share article on Facebookshare Tweet articletweet Plus one article on Google Plus+1 Print Article Adjust font size AA AA AA AA AA AA AA by Jonathan S. Tobin May 31, 2017 4:00 AM @jonathans_tobin On his first official trip abroad, the president rallied Arabs and Israelis to unite against Iran. But by giving Boeing a pass to sell Tehran planes, he’s sending a very different message. During his trip to the Middle East last week, President Donald Trump had one consistent theme and he never wavered from it: The region needs to unite to stop Iran. Mutual antipathy for Tehran has driven Arab regimes such as Saudi Arabia to make common cause with Israel. It was also the motivation for the massive $110 billion arms deal Trump struck with the Saudis, who believe that President Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran has endangered their security. But while Trump talks tough about the Iranians, the normally bellicose Islamist regime has been restrained, at least by its standards, in response. Why? The Iranians may be unhappy with Trump’s effort to orchestrate the creation of a Middle East NATO that would oppose their dream of regional hegemony, but they are actually quite pleased with other elements of his administration’s Iran policy. For all of Trump’s bluster, his decision not only to leave the nuclear agreement in place but to erect no obstacles to a major U.S. commercial deal with Iran may have convinced the ayatollahs that the president isn’t quite as hostile as he wants to seem. One of the least noticed aspects of the nuclear deal was a provision that granted Tehran an exception to U.S. sanctions that remained in place after it was signed. That provision allowed U.S. companies to sell “commercial passenger aircraft and related parts and services” to Iran, and Boeing took advantage of it, joining European businesses in a race to secure Iranian business. It was a clever strategy that enabled Obama to undermine the remaining resistance to the deal. If, as Obama hoped, a major U.S. firm such as Boeing were to conclude a massive deal of its own with Iran, the jobs created by the sale would build a strong new constituency opposed to retightening the screws on Tehran no matter the regime’s subsequent actions. Boeing’s deal with Iran was concluded in June 2016, and the Obama administration subsequently issued the requisite licenses for it to move forward. But the Trump administration still has a chance to raise objections and to block the delivery of the planes to Tehran. The grounds for objection were already clear last year, when Boeing was celebrating the deal: Many of the companies with which it would be doing business have strong connections to or are owned by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which coordinates Iran’s international terrorist network. Yet so far, the Trump administration has remained suspiciously silent about the deal, leading Iran to the not unreasonable conclusion that while the president may be willing to talk about its role as the world’s leading state sponsor of terror, he is as reluctant to do something about it as his predecessor was. There’s a glaring contradiction between Trump’s indulgence of Boeing’s desire to profit from its dealings with Iran and his efforts to rein in a dangerous foe of U.S. interests. Trump has no good options when it comes to tearing up the nuclear deal that he spent so much of the 2016 campaign denouncing as a betrayal of U.S. interests. Walking away from the pact at a moment when neither America’s European allies nor Russia and China are willing to re-impose sanctions would simply give the Iranians permission to move quickly toward a bomb without providing a means short of war to stop them. But Trump does have options that can start the process of rebuilding an international quarantine against Iranian terror and punishing the regime for its illegal missile tests. Earlier this month, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed a sweeping set of measures designed to impose new restrictions on trade with Iran because of its human-rights violations and support for terror. The point of such efforts is to expand the list of Iranian individuals and companies affected by the sanctions that still remain in place, so as to hamper the ability of the IRGC and other agents of the regime to profit from foreign trade. Moreover, even if other nations won’t re-impose their own sanctions on Iran, U.S. measures that bar foreign banks from the American financial system if they do business with terror-connected Iranian entities can still have a devastating impact on the regime. President Trump mocked John Kerry as the worst negotiator in history for his disastrous role in making the nuclear pact possible. But if he doesn’t move to support the Senate bill and to do something about the Boeing deal, then he will effectively be throwing in his lot with Obama’s secretary of state, who remains a public opponent of increased sanctions on Iran. The reason for Trump’s reluctance to move against Boeing is obvious: Promises to create American jobs were as important to the success of his campaign as were his criticisms of Obama. Putting any further obstacles in the way of the transaction would have a devastating impact on the company and the thousands of workers it employs. Moreover, Boeing is looking to expand its ties with Iran and has applied for another license to sell 30 more planes to entities within the country. But Iran uses commercial planes such as the ones Boeing sells to ferry supplies, munitions, and “volunteers” to Syria, where they have helped preserve the rule of the barbarous Assad regime. No one in the White House can pretend that Boeing’s budding business relationship with the Islamic Republic is unrelated to the security concerns that Trump discussed with the Saudis and Israelis last week. All of which is to say that there’s a glaring contradiction between Trump’s indulgence of Boeing’s desire to profit from its dealings with Iran and his efforts to rein in a dangerous foe of U.S. interests. If he stays silent and/or allows the planes to be delivered, it may preserve jobs for some of the working-class voters who backed him. But it will also validate Tehran’s belief that he is as much a paper tiger as Obama was. And an Iran unfettered by fear of U.S. power, hard and soft, would be an even bigger threat to global security.

Deutsch News provided by Hainan Airlines Co., LTD 31 May, 2017, 02:29 ET Share this article The plane featuring a design by young American designer Hannah Foss takes its inaugural flight, in celebration of the Chinese airline's 24th anniversary BEIJING, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A Hainan Airlines' Dreamliner, adorned with Po, the main character in the Kung Fu Panda film, and the famous panda's friends, took off on the inaugural flight for its new service HU7181, from Haikou to Beijing, on the morning of May 29, 2017. As the Chinese airline's third Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in the fleet to receive the "King Fu Panda" makeover, the eye-catching yellow-colored airplane started its maiden flight to the cheers of the crowd. Hainan Airlines’ third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane starts its maiden flight Hannah Foss, the winner of Hainan Airlines’ Design Your Own Livery contest in North America, visits the airline’s hangar A group photo of Hainan Airlines’ flight attendants with Hannah Foss The flight carried a special passenger, Hannah Foss, a young designer from the state of Alaska. When Hannah Foss submitted her "Kung Fu Panda"-themed Dreamliner design last September, she was one of nearly 3,000 online entries that all shared the same dream: To have their design painted on a real-life, Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. That dream started several months ago when Hainan, Boeing and DreamWorks announced a partnership that would include the introduction of six specially-painted Dreamliners over the next two years, featuring characters and scenes from the popular animated franchise. "I have loved painting and designing since I was a child. I have designed a dinosaur exhibition for a museum and depicted the Northern lights around the Arctic Circle in my artwork. But I never thought that my design would be painted on a plane someday. It feels amazing! This is the first time that I have come to China, taken a Boeing Dreamliner and witnessed the process of the painting of a plane. I really appreciate these "firsts" that Hainan Airlines has offered to me," Ms. Foss said as part of a speech she gave over the plane's announcement system during which she shared her thrilling story with the over 200 passengers on the flight. "This is an exceptional journey for me, giving many Americans like myself the opportunity to learn about Hainan Airlines and better understand the distinguished Chinese company's idea of cherishing every person's dream in addition to its ongoing commitment to fulfilling dreams." Hannah grew up in Adelaide, South Australia and moved to Alaska in 2008.    Some of her adventures include spending several years as a paleontological artist, CGI-animating a couple of museum films, constructing a 16-ft long dinosaur puppet called Snaps, eating tasty muktuk, snow-machining on the Chukchi Sea and meeting a polar bear. In addition to having her design painted on a Dreamlinerand to be part of this amazing journey, Hannah won two round-trip, business class tickets to China, as well as a weeks' accommodations at a luxury hotel. The "Kung Fu Panda" story is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and history. Hannah's design wove together popular characters like Po and Tigress, with traditional Chinese "chops" and a painted sunrise. The design was awarded the top prize based on its originality, creativity, humor, its reflection of Chinese culture, and its wow factor. When Hannah's design is painted onto the new Dreamliner, the airplane will fly several of Hainan's more than 40 nonstop routes between China and North America. It will join two other specially painted airplanes, the first of which touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last year. That airplane carried over 100 students and teachers from Lincoln High School in Tacoma, WA, who were returning from a life-changing, 11-day trip to China. Hainan Airlines is proud to partner with DreamWorks and Boeing to bring the "Kung Fu Panda" franchise to Hainan's elite service and premier experience. Look forward for more partnerships like this in the future, and be sure to keep an eye out for #TheFlyingPanda throughout our North American network! Hainan Airlines has continued with its strategy of working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government's One Belt, One Road initiative as part of its overall plan to aggressively expand its presence in international markets. Nevertheless, despite the complexities of operating in the highly competitive international markets, the airline has never wavered from its original set of goals of consistently combining the brand's unique Oriental hospitality with modern service standards, a concept which is embodied in the Kung Fu Panda planes. The airline has promoted its image in the global aviation market through the cooperation with DreamWorks, demonstrating the newfound stature of Chinese companies on the world stage while allowing travelers everywhere to gain a better understanding of Chinese culture and its richness.   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hainan-airlines-unveils-third-kung-fu-panda-themed-plane-as-part-of-collaboration-with-dreamworks-animation-300466031.html SOURCE Hainan Airlines Co., LTD 31 May, 2017, 08:12 ET Preview: Hainan Airlines dévoile son troisième avion aux couleurs de Kung Fu Panda dans le cadre de sa collaboration avec DreamWorks Animation 20 May, 2017, 12:16 ET Preview: Hainan Airlines continúa ofreciendo una mejor experiencia a los pasajeros My News Release contains wide tables.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Hainan Airlines unveils third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane as part of collaboration with DreamWorks Animation The plane featuring a design by young American designer Hannah Foss takes its inaugural flight, in celebration of the Chinese airline‚s 24th anniversary BEIJING, May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — A Hainan Airlines’ Dreamliner, adorned with Po, the main character in the Kung Fu Panda film, and the famous panda’s friends, took off on the inaugural flight for its new service HU7181, from Haikou to Beijing, on the morning of May 29, 2017. As the Chinese airline’s third Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner in the fleet to receive the „King Fu Panda” makeover, the eye-catching yellow-colored airplane started its maiden flight to the cheers of the crowd. Hainan Airlines’ third Kung Fu Panda-themed plane starts its maiden flight Hannah Foss, the winner of Hainan Airlines’ Design Your Own Livery contest in North America, visits the airline’s hangar A group photo of Hainan Airlines’ flight attendants with Hannah Foss The flight carried a special passenger, Hannah Foss, a young designer from the state of Alaska. When Hannah Foss submitted her „Kung Fu Panda”-themed Dreamliner design last September, she was one of nearly 3,000 online entries that all shared the same dream: To have their design painted on a real-life, Hainan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner. That dream started several months ago when Hainan, Boeing and DreamWorks announced a partnership that would include the introduction of six specially-painted Dreamliners over the next two years, featuring characters and scenes from the popular animated franchise. „I have loved painting and designing since I was a child. I have designed a dinosaur exhibition for a museum and depicted the Northern lights around the Arctic Circle in my artwork. But I never thought that my design would be painted on a plane someday. It feels amazing! This is the first time that I have come to China, taken a Boeing Dreamliner and witnessed the process of the painting of a plane. I really appreciate these „firsts” that Hainan Airlines has offered to me,” Ms. Foss said as part of a speech she gave over the plane’s announcement system during which she shared her thrilling story with the over 200 passengers on the flight. „This is an exceptional journey for me, giving many Americans like myself the opportunity to learn about Hainan Airlines and better understand the distinguished Chinese company’s idea of cherishing every person’s dream in addition to its ongoing commitment to fulfilling dreams.” Hannah grew up in Adelaide, South Australia and moved to Alaska in 2008.    Some of her adventures include spending several years as a paleontological artist, CGI-animating a couple of museum films, constructing a 16-ft long dinosaur puppet called Snaps, eating tasty muktuk, snow-machining on the Chukchi Sea and meeting a polar bear. In addition to having her design painted on a Dreamlinerand to be part of this amazing journey, Hannah won two round-trip, business class tickets to China, as well as a weeks’ accommodations at a luxury hotel. The „Kung Fu Panda” story is deeply rooted in traditional Chinese culture and history. Hannah’s design wove together popular characters like Po and Tigress, with traditional Chinese „chops” and a painted sunrise. The design was awarded the top prize based on its originality, creativity, humor, its reflection of Chinese culture, and its wow factor. When Hannah’s design is painted onto the new Dreamliner, the airplane will fly several of Hainan’s more than 40 nonstop routes between China and North America. It will join two other specially painted airplanes, the first of which touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport last year. That airplane carried over 100 students and teachers from Lincoln High School in Tacoma, WA, who were returning from a life-changing, 11-day trip to China. Hainan Airlines is proud to partner with DreamWorks and Boeing to bring the „Kung Fu Panda” franchise to Hainan’s elite service and premier experience. Look forward for more partnerships like this in the future, and be sure to keep an eye out for #TheFlyingPanda throughout our North American network! Hainan Airlines has continued with its strategy of working hand-in-hand with the Chinese government’s One Belt, One Road initiative as part of its overall plan to aggressively expand its presence in international markets. Nevertheless, despite the complexities of operating in the highly competitive international markets, the airline has never wavered from its original set of goals of consistently combining the brand’s unique Oriental hospitality with modern service standards, a concept which is embodied in the Kung Fu Panda planes.

Boeing cut nearly 1,600 jobs in the state in April, the biggest one month drop since January 2003. (Andy Bronson / The Herald) Aerospace blog Boeing continues to cut jobs, citing need to stay competitive Dan Catchpole Wed May 31st, 2017 9:14pm Business You must sign in or register to continue reading content. EVERETT — The Boeing Co.’s workforce in Washington dropped by 1,582 in April. That is the biggest month-over-month decline for the airplane maker since January 2003, when it cut approximately 1,800 jobs in the state, according to The Daily Herald’s analysis of employment data on Boeing’s website. At the time, the company was struggling through a downturn begun with the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which sent airlines reeling as would-be flyers opted to stay grounded. Commercial aviation further was hammered by rising fuel prices, a global recession and other market challenges. As airlines canceled and delayed orders for new jetliners, Boeing slashed its Washington workforce from 80,000 in the fall of 2001 to 62,000 one year later. It bottomed out at 52,763 in June 2004. Boeing executives say the need to curb costs in a competitive market is driving the current paring down of jobs. In 2016, the company cut its global workforce by nearly 11,000. Most of that reduction — 7,357 jobs — came in Washington, where Boeing makes nearly all its commercial airplanes. Company leaders have said they expect to reduce jobs at about the same rate in 2017. Through the first four months of the year, Boeing has shed 2,823 jobs around Puget Sound, dropping to 69,058 on April 27, the most recent data available. After the downturn in the early 2000s, the company’s workforce in the state peaked at 87,023 by October 2012. At the time, it had 175,742 employees around the world, with the vast majority in the United States. Its global payroll by late April had 144,976, a decline of nearly 31,000. Most of the job reductions since early 2016 have come through buyouts, retirements and selective hiring freezes. The company had avoided major layoffs until this year. So far, it has issued 1,162 layoff notices to workers in Washington. That total includes a limited number of notices issued twice. The company has declined to say exactly how many workers have been affected. Dan Catchpole: 425-339-3454; dcatchpole@heraldnet.com.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File PhotoMore By Tim Hepher PARIS (Reuters) - Russia's new jetliner, which conducted its maiden flight on Sunday, may have a hard time challenging the sales duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, but it does point the way to radical changes in how they could be building jets in the future. The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurized oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel <HXL.N>, Solvay <SOLB.BR> of Belgium and Toray <3402.T> of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fiber already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminum. Under the new technology, instead of using fiber that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fiber engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. Read More "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Photo by David Pugliese Share Adjust Comment Print Boeing will announce its industry team members for the Super Hornet interim fighter jet project on Thursday at CANSEC 2017. On the Wednesday at CANSEC the Boeing team hopes to highlight the company’s long-term commitment to Canada. It’s done that in the past but this time around Boeing is trying to dig itself out of a self-inflicted public relations disaster. The firm has put the proposed Super Hornet purchase by Canada in jeopardy by convincing the U.S. Commerce Department and International Trade Commission to launch an investigation into Canadian aerospace firm Bombardier. The investigation will examine the dumping of commercial aircraft into the U.S. market. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing into Boeing’s claim. Boeing claims that Bombardier received subsidies, which in turn, allowed it to sell its C-Series aircraft at below-market prices. The Liberal government’s response? It has suggested it might not go ahead with the Super Hornet deal. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s recent chastening of Boeing for its actions and promise to review military procurement involving Boeing leaves in limbo Canada’s purchase of 18 Super Hornet jets, a deal expected to cost $5 billion to $7 billion. Canada has not yet signed the deal to acquire the Super Hornets. That was expected to be in place by the end of the year or early next year.

Go LATEST MOST POPULAR NEWS VIDEO PHOTO NEWS VIDEO PHOTO HOME JG.TV News Business International Sports Life & Style Opinion INDEX New Russian Jet Heralds Carbon Manufacturing Shake-Up i An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk, Russia, Sunday (28/05). (Reuters Photo/PR Department of Irkut Corporation) By : Tim Hepher | on 11:00 PM May 30, 2017 Category : International, World Paris. Russia's new jetliner, which conducted its maiden flight on Sunday (28/05), may have a hard time challenging the sales duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, but it does point the way to radical changes in how they could be building jets in the future. The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurized oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. Pivotal Decision Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like US-based Hexcel, Solvay of Belgium and Toray of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fiber already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg," which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves. Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminium. Under the new technology, instead of using fiber that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fiber engineered textile which is placed in a mold and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real program and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320. Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programs. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Called the Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1) program, the new robotic spacecraft would be an autonomous, reusable spaceplane. The spaceplane would be used to lift a small expendable upper stage aloft to where it could launch a small satellite of about 3,000 pounds into low Earth orbit. “Phantom Express is designed to disrupt and transform the satellite launch process as we know it today, creating a new, on-demand space-launch capability that can be achieved more affordably and with less risk,” Darryl Davis, president of Boeing Phantom Works, said in a statement. The idea behind Phantom Express is that as a reusable spaceplane, it could be turned around and launched back into space quickly. Conventional rockets can be used just once while the U.S. Space Shuttle program—which was also reusable spaceplane—is a now a distant memory. But even then, the Shuttle did not have an especially quick turnaround time. Despite being decades newer, the Phantom Express will leverage some of the technology from the Space Shuttle program, which was developed during the 1970s. Indeed, the Phantom Express spaceplane’s engine technology is directly derived from the Space Shuttle. “The Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine, would power the spaceplane,” reads a Boeing statement. “It is designed to be reusable and operates using liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel.” But while the Phantom Express reuses some of the Space Shuttle’s technology, it offers advances in other areas. It would offer a much more advanced airframe design as well as new third-generation thermal protection. But the air vehicle would be far smaller and lighter than the Space Shuttle—nor would it need to be built to withstand quite the same stresses as its predecessor. “Once the spaceplane – called Phantom Express – reaches the edge of space, it would deploy the second stage and return to Earth,” Boeing states. “It would then land on a runway to be prepared for its next flight by applying operation and maintenance principles similar to modern aircraft.” Boeing and DARPA are planning to jointly invest their money into the development of the Phantom Express. The two entities hope to conduct a demonstration of 10 flights over 10 days—a feat which is unprecedented. If the experiment works, the Phantom Express could be a revolution in space launch technology. Dave Majumdar is the defense editor for The National Interest.

For some, the experience will offer nothing out of the ordinary, including the tiredness and jet lag associated with long-haul travel. Others, however, will fare – and feel – better. Blake Emery, Director of Differentiation Strategy for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, looks at how innovation has shaped a better passenger experience. What makes an airplane journey memorable? Was it the comfort of the seat, the quality of service, or the in-flight entertainment? Since the earliest days of air travel, the expectations of the flying public have largely remained unchanged: safety, cabin comfort, and in-flight service. While flying has never been safer, and airlines in the Middle East have set a high bar for both the quality of service and the standard of their cabins, there was still a need for aircraft manufacturers to step up and further enrich the cabin experience. This wasn’t about building bigger airplanes; it was about designing better ones that rely on innovation and attention to detail to truly improve the passenger journey. Think about your most recent flight: did you feel a sense of relief after walking down the narrow confines of the jet-way and boarding the aircraft to be greeted by an open area with high ceilings? Did you then comfortably settle into your seat, taking in the roomy cabin around you, instead of crouching to slide down your row, all the while dreading the next few hours? And when you got to your destination, did you feel less tired and jet-lagged than you expected to? If the answer to all the questions is affirmative, it was very likely that you were experiencing the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and its Boeing Sky Interior. The sense of relief you felt when stepping onboard the plane was the result of using an age-old architectural technique – compression and release – commonly employed in the construction of religious monuments and modern hotels. After queuing through the tunnel-like bridge, the aircraft’s entrance is specifically designed to give passengers a psychological sense of relief and space when they board the plane. The space and comfort you experienced are the results of a wider cabin, the largest windows currently in the sky, sculpted sidewalls for added enhancement, and spacious overhead storage bins which don’t protrude inconveniently over the seats, folding instead into the ceiling and walls. Even the latches on the bins have been given careful consideration and are designed to operate whether a passenger pulls or pushes them, opening the stowage in a carefully timed manner. The uniquely lower cabin altitude that better matches what your body is used to on the ground, and the human-centric cabin lighting which, depending on the time of the day, will emit soothing hues of the airlines’ choice, helped reduce your tiredness and symptoms commonly associated with jetlag. Although the flying public will take many of these features for granted, each element of the cabin’s design – however mundane it may seem – is intended to unconsciously appeal to the passengers’ psyche, improving their in-flight wellbeing. Each aspect is meticulously well-thought-out and refined, using a combination of science, passenger feedback, and practicality, with the goal of contributing to the overall customer experience. Importantly for customers such as Saudi Arabian Airlines, which currently operates the 787 Dreamliner, they also complement an airline’s in-flight product and brand. By placing emphasis on the details that matter to the comfort and well-being of the passenger, we always strive to better that journey for the people who travel on our airplanes. And when airplanes – such as the Dreamliner and the 777X – set new benchmarks for passenger comfort, they do so entirely by design. — SG SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSyria’s economy is on its knees Next articleMerkel hosts Indian PM, looks to broaden world ties Imran Syed RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince condole UK Premier King orders advance payment of month’s salaries on Ramadan 23 Saudi courts to force Saudi Oger to pay employees’ entitlements NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply June 2017 S M T W T F S « May       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,643,654FansLike 44,205FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince condole UK Premier June 5, 2017 King orders advance payment of month’s salaries on Ramadan 23 June 5, 2017 Saudi courts to force Saudi Oger to pay employees’ entitlements June 5, 2017 Saudi, Egyptian FMs discuss anti-terror cooperation June 5, 2017 King receives dean of diplomatic corps and heads of groups June 5, 2017 Archives June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Boeing & Aerospace Business World Russia’s challenger to 737 and A320 makes first brief flight Originally published May 30, 2017 at 1:14 pm The MS-21, which is also often referred to using the Cyrillic alphabet as MC-21, is Russia’s first post-Soviet airliner and represents a determined effort to regain the country’s standing as a center of aerospace engineering prowess. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter Less than a month after China’s national aerospace champion offered its challenge to Airbus and Boeing with the first flight of a 737-sized airliner, Russia entered the fray Sunday when jetmaker Irkut flew the MS-21 for the first time. The MS-21, which is also often referred to using the Cyrillic alphabet as MC-21, is Russia’s first post-Soviet airliner and represents a determined effort to regain the country’s standing as a center of aerospace engineering prowess. It features a carbon fiber reinforced plastic wing and tail, as well as the latest Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, similar to those on the Airbus A320 and Bombardier CSeries jets. The flight was not announced in advance. Irkut said in a statement that the larger of two proposed variants, the MS-21-300, successfully completed its flight in Irkutsk, Siberia, flying for just 30 minutes, reaching an altitude of 3,300 feet and a speed of 186 miles per hour.

The shortness of the flight and the relatively low speed and altitude could indicate some issue arose to cut the test flight short, but in its statement Irkut insisted all was normal. “During the flight a simulated landing approach was performed, followed by a flight over the runway, climbing and turning,” Irkut said. “This technique is typical for the maiden flight of new types of aircraft.” Larger yet lighter The Russian jet enters the same market as the Chinese C919, which had its debut flight in Shanghai on May 4. Designed to carry 163 to 211 passengers, the MS-21-300 — like the C919 — is aimed at the heart of the single-aisle market, today dominated by the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-800. Its fusleage is four inches wider than that of the Airbus jet and a full foot wider than Boeing’s, offering the possibility of wider seats and better passenger comfort. The MS-21 is also slightly longer than either of the Western aircraft, and it has an extra seven inches of wingspan. Yet data provided by independent Russian aviation sites indicates that the plane’s composite plastic wing and tail make it more than 3 tons lighter than the Boeing 737. The composite wing is not produced the way Boeing manufactures the wings of the 787 Dreamliner — by baking the material to hardness in a high-pressure oven, known as an autoclave. Instead, Irkut uses a technology called Resin Infusion that hardens the composite without the enormous energy and capital investment required for the autoclave process. Future threat The 21 in the MS-21’s name designates it a “21st century” aircraft. “MS” is for Magistralni Samolyot, meaning airplane for mainline or backbone routes. Irkut, a division of Russia’s state-controlled United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), has been tasked by President Vladimir Putin with restoring the country’s aerospace industry to its former pre-eminence and challenging the West’s dominance. Russia is also developing its own PD-14 jet engine, which it plans to offer as an alternative on the MS-21 to the Pratt & Whitney engine. The aircraft has won 175 initial firm orders from Russian buyers. It’s likely to sell more not only within Russia but within those countries of the former Soviet Union still dependent on Moscow. But can it sell well in the West? To do so, UAC will have to build an extensive support infrastructure to supply maintenance and spare parts for Western airlines — a tall order starting from scratch. Irkut’s ability to streamline the resin infusion technology to efficiently ramp up production will also be critical to the jet’s chances of success. In a report published Monday, U.S. aviation consulting firm AirInsight wrote that “if the MC-21 turns out to meet its specifications, then UAC has a fine product on its hands that may further disrupt the duopoly” of Airbus and Boeing. The challenge to the two Western aircraft makers is not so much to the new Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX single-aisle jets. Both of those are established successes, with Airbus having already stacked up more than 5,000 orders for the A320neo while Boeing has just over 3,700 orders for the MAX. But if the MS-21 gains a foothold in the market and sells well enough to survive, then looking a decade ahead the next new jet from Russia could be more of a threat. Earlier this month, Russia and China together announced a new joint venture to develop over the next decade a larger, twin-aisle airliner in the same size category as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350.

(Supplied photo) Etihad Airways on Tuesday announced plans to boost its European Dreamliner network with the deployment of Boeing 787-9 aircraft to Amsterdam and Madrid. The 299-seat Dreamliners will be introduced on year-round scheduled services to Amsterdam from September 1, and to Madrid, effective October 1, joining Düsseldorf and Zurich as the airline's other European Dreamliner services. The 787-9 will also operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months. With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the aircraft are gradually being introduced on a number of international routes from the airline's Abu Dhabi hub. Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 13 Boeing 787-9s to 11 destinations - namely Washington, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Johannesburg, Amman, Riyadh, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Perth and Brisbane from Abu Dhabi. Beirut, Beijing, Seoul and Melbourne are due to join the 787 network over the next few months. The Amsterdam route will have a taste of the 787 between 2 and 30 June to help meet demand during the early summer peak period. The current four weekly Madrid services will also be boosted with additional flights, moving to a daily operation from June 1. Peter Baumgartner, chief executive officer of Etihad Airways, said: "Flights to and from Amsterdam and Madrid cater to business and leisure travellers, and with growing demand, there was a strong case to introduce bigger aircraft to these destinations." The 787 is fast becoming our flagship long-haul aircraft and as more are delivered, we will continue to look at upgrading existing routes with these excellent planes." Etihad Airways' two-class Boeing 787-9s include award-winning interiors that feature 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats, offering superior levels of comfort, entertainment and in-flight connectivity. On-board décor and lighting have been inspired by contemporary Arabian design, complementing the signature 'Facets of Abu Dhabi' identity introduced by the airline during its livery relaunch in 2014.

Turns out, it's been around since the '60s. Back then, everyone was excited for supersonic commercial flight.  Sadly, that never panned out. However, that excitement got Boeing to thinking: its 747 might not be ideal for commercial flight if supersonic planes ruled the skies. So, instead of designing the 747 solely for passengers, Boeing also designed the plane for cargo. But it needed an easy way to load large cargo into the plane.  That's where that iconic hump comes in. Engineers decided to turn the front of the plane into a giant door. The nose would open up, making it easy to load tall cargo. But there was just one problem: the cockpit was located over the nose.  So, it was moved to the second deck, creating that giant hump you still see today.

Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland’s comment that it’s “reviewing current military procurement that relates to Boeing” appeared to be a not-so-subtle hint that the government would revisit its purchase of Super Hornets. The government has said it plans to sole-source 18 Super Hornets as a stop-gap measure before running a full competition to replace its aging CF-18 fleet. The Liberals say the Super Hornets, which internal estimates suggest could cost as much as $2 billion, are urgently needed. Military officials and defence industry representatives contacted by The Canadian Press on Thursday were united in assuming that Freeland’s warning related to the planned Super Hornet purchase. Freeland’s comments came as the next potential Canada-U.S. trade dispute unfolded Thursday with the aerospace giants clashing at a Washington hearing. “The U.S. market is the most open in the world, but we must take action if our rules are being broken,” U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement after the hearing began into Boeing’s claim that Bombardier received subsidies allowing it to sell its CSeries planes at below-market prices. Aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group said the Canadian government’s move was inevitable, putting into question Boeing’s strategy in taking on Bombardier. “If Boeing is smart it’ll press the do-over button and walk away,” he said in an interview, adding the aeronautics powerhouse has much more to risk from losing military contracts than the tiny gain from a successful trade complaint. “Boeing values Canada as a customer and supplier-partner for both our commercial and defence businesses,” said company spokesman Dan Curran. “Two of Canada’s most recent acquisitions of Boeing military products, the C-17 Globemaster and CH-47 Chinook, were delivered on-time and/or ahead of schedule.” In an emailed statement Boeing also pointed out that it places substantial amounts of commercial and defence work in Canada and has a supply chain that “leverages the breadth and depth of the Canadian aerospace industry.” Lobbyists, lawyers and aerospace executives crowded a room in Washington for a little battle playing out in the broader context of the day’s larger trade news: the U.S. announcement that NAFTA renegotiations will start in the next 90 days. Bombardier has made it clear that its true goal is to grab half the international market share for 100-to-150-seat aircraft, according to Boeing, which argues its rival has received an unfair head start from Canadian taxpayers. Boeing vice-president Raymond Conner said the sale of cheap, subsidized planes to Delta Air Lines helped build momentum for Bombardier to enter a new market. If Bombardier reaches its stated goal, he said, it would squeeze Boeing from that market and cost the company US$330 million a year in annual sales. “Today we are at a critical moment,” Conner told the seven-member U.S. International Trade Commission. “If you don’t fix it now, it will be too late to do anything about it later.” Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies of Bombardier’s CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the company to export planes at well below cost. A preliminary determination on the petition is expected by June 12. If the ITC determines there is a threat of injury to the U.S. industry, preliminary countervailing duties could be announced in July, followed in October by preliminary anti-dumping duties, unless the deadlines are extended. Final determinations are scheduled for October and December. Boeing is calling for countervailing duties of 79.41 per cent and anti-dumping charges of 79.82 per cent. It complains that Bombardier has received more than US$3 billion in government subsidies so far that have allowed it to engage in “predatory pricing.” Lawyers for the U.S. aerospace giant argued Thursday that Bombardier’s own words prove it was rescued financially by multibillion-dollar assistance from the Quebec government, which last year invested US$1 billion in exchange for a 49.5 per cent stake in the CSeries. The company also shored up its finances by selling a 30 per cent stake in its railway division to pension fund manager Caisse de depot for US$1.5 billion. Bombardier representatives countered that their planes never competed with Boeing in a sale to Delta—which the American rival describes as a seminal moment. Bombardier lawyer Peter Lichtenbaum said the plaintiff is a global powerhouse that hasn’t lost any sales as a result of Bombardier, has an enviable order backlog and doesn’t even compete with Bombardier in the sales campaigns it has complained about because the CSeries is smaller than Boeing’s 737-800 and Max 8 planes. “Boeing’s petition in this case is unprecedented in its overreach,” he said. “If this is a case of David vs. Goliath, Boeing has cast itself in the wrong role.” Boeing’s annual sales were US$94.6 billion last year. That means the US$330 million Conner expressed concern about amounts to one-third of one per cent of its annual sales. Bombardier revenues last year were US$16.3 billion, including US$9.9 billion from aerospace activities.

By Fora Staff Tuesday 30 May 2017, 3:30 PM Tue 3:30 PM 22,921 Views 21 Comments http://jrnl.ie/3416840 Share6 Tweet Email4 Image: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie Image: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ie RYANAIR SEES “MASSIVE” growth opportunities in continental Europe as loss-making legacy airlines in Germany and Italy rejig their troubled business models. Speaking at the announcement of Ryanair’s annual financial results today, chief executive Michael O’Leary said that monetary woes at Air Berlin and Alitalia have opened a further gap in markets that the Irish carrier already in some cases dominates. “At the moment we have more growth opportunities than our planned fleet deliveries for the next couple of years can cope with,” O’Leary said. As a result, Ryanair’s finance boss, Neil Sorahan, has been tasked with extending leases on 10 aircraft through to 2019. “We’re also having discussions with (plane manufacturer) Boeing about adding one or two aircraft deliveries in 2018 and 2019 where Boeing can facilitate those additional orders,” O’Leary said. Source: Ryanair Click here to view a larger version. Ryanair has been taking delivery of 175 Boeing 737-800 aircraft since 2015. That order is due to be completed by the end of next year. From 2019, it will start receiving the first of its 200 Boeing 737 Max planes. Those jets are frequently referred to as “game-changers” because they will give the airline eight extra seats – 197 in total – and use 15% less fuel on a per-seat basis. Ryanair said the extra capacity gives its scope to serve 200 million passengers per year by the end of March 2024. Sorahan was enthused about growth opportunities in Germany, where Ryanair operates 10 bases. German legacy carrier Air Berlin has been undergoing a major shake-up in recent months, seeing its fleet halved to 75 aircraft and downsizing its flight network from 387 to less than 100 routes. “We see more (German) corporates and private customers alike coming to Ryanair and more airports looking for our business,” Sorahan said. Mock-up of a Ryanair 737 Max 200 Source: Boeing On Alitalia – which earlier this month filed to be put under special administration – O’Leary said he believes that it will be restructured as well. He said said Ryanair is not prepared to invest in or acquire Alitalia, but will “help it survive” by offering to feed passengers into the Italian airline’s long-haul routes. Labour relations A thorn in O’Leary’s side will surely be the slip in Ryanair’s prized punctuality record, which dropped 2% in 12 months to the end of March 2017. That meant that 88% of all Ryanair were on time last year. The airline blamed this slight drop on “unusually disruptive weather” in November and December as well as air traffic controller strikes in France. On the subject of labour relations, O’Leary was dismissive of recent turbulence in Scandinavia. In his usual colourful language, the chief executive recently branded Nordic pension providers as “idiots” for refusing to invest in the airline over objections to its work practices. As many as seven retirement schemes in Denmark and Sweden sold their shares or blacklisted Ryanair after it clashed with trade unions in Copenhagen. “There has been some misinformed commentary up in Scandinavia recently about our labour relations which remain excellent,” O’Leary said today. “In 30 years we’ve never had a strike.” O’Leary has for years taken a no-nonsense approach to unions. He told Fora last week that any workers looking to unionise “will find their base either frozen or closed”. Ryanair hired 1,000 new staff last year bringing the total workforce to 13,000. O’Leary expects to recruit another 1,000 people this year. Brexit has been high on Ryanair’s agenda since the UK voted to leave the European Union last June. O’Leary told investors today that it remains “a big dark cloud hanging over us the next 18 months”. He repeated warnings that there may be “a period of days week or months” after March 2019 where there may be no flights between the UK and European Union in the absence of a bilateral agreement between the two regions. He said if that was the case, Ryanair would relocate UK-based aircraft to European bases. Ryanair posted a profit of just over €1.3 billion in the financial year ended 31 March 2017, up from €1.2 billion for the previous 12-month period. It said that it expects traffic to grow by 8% to 130 million by the end of March 2018. Sign up to our newsletter to receive a regular digest of Fora’s top articles delivered to your inbox.

On Tuesday, the European budget airline said in its fiscal year 2017 annual report that it's extending 10 of its planned lease returns in 2018 and 2019 to help boost fleet growth. XAutoplay: On | Off Ryanair is also considering adding "selectively" to its current Boeing order to have planes delivered in the next 24 months. With some models, carriers can be on the waiting list for years before deliveries start. Ryanair's U.S.-listed shares rose 1.45% to 107.76 in afternoon trade on the stock market today, hitting a fresh record high. Boeing rose 0.2% to 186.88, holding above a 185.81 buy point. Ryanair has 79 737-800 jets left to be delivered by fiscal 2019 on its massive 183-plane order from Boeing. The carrier has also agreed to buy up to 200 Boeing 737 Max 200 aircraft during fiscal 2020 to 2024. The carrier reported full year profit in line with analysts' views, despite a shift in capacity to Spain over terrorist attacks in the Middle East and North Africa, causing some overcapacity but a weaker pound sterling helped cut costs. Ryanair plans to boost fiscal 2018 profit by 8%.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Boeing Wins Contract to Build DARPA XS-1 Experimental Space Plane But hey! What happened to Blue Origin? Rich Smith (TMFDitty) May 30, 2017 at 10:13AM For nearly three years now, we've been following the saga of the XS-1 Spaceplane -- the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) project to build a new and improved, 21st-century space shuttle. Designed to fly "10 times in 10 days," the unmanned XS-1 will rocket to the edge of space and then fire a different rocket to launch payloads into orbit -- never leaving the atmosphere itself, and never actually entering orbit. Instead, after delivering its cargo the XS-1 will return to land on Earth like an airplane. In contrast to the actual space shuttle, which famously cost about $1 billion a mission to fly, XS-1 aims to deliver up to 3,000 pounds of cargo to orbit for just $5 million per flight. Artist's conception of Boeing's Phantom Express XS-1 spaceplane. Image source: Boeing. NASA has hired privately held Vector to build the second-stage "rocket" that will push payloads the last mile into orbit, using Vector's internally developed Vector-R rocket for this purpose. The question up till now, though, has been who would build the spaceplane itself. Would it be: Boeing (NYSE:BA), in collaboration with Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos' "Blue Origin" space company? Northrop Grumman, teaming up with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic? Or privately held Masten Space Systems, working with equally private XCOR Aerospace? Now we know the answer: It's Boeing ... and Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE:AJRD). Boeing wins the prize -- but not Blue Origin On Wednesday, May 24, DARPA made its announcement: Boeing will "build and fly an experimental vehicle for aircraft-like access to space." Dubbed the Boeing Phantom Express, this will be the "first of an entirely new class of hypersonic aircraft that would bolster national security by providing short-notice, low-cost access to space." After Boeing successfully completed phase 1 of the XS-1 competition, DARPA has tapped the company to proceed through phases 2 and 3 as well -- fabrication and flight. And yet, Boeing's victory seems to have left Blue Origin in the lurch. Somewhere between 2014, when Boeing entered this competition, and this week, when Boeing won it, Blue Origin appears to have fallen off the Boeing team, to be replaced by Blue Origin's rocket-building rival Aerojet Rocketdyne. According to DARPA's press release, "the XS-1 technology demonstrator's propulsion system is an Aerojet Rocketdyne AR-22 engine, a version of the legacy Space Shuttle main engine (SSME)." In confirmation of this, Aerojet issued its own press release on Wednesday, stating that "Aerojet Rocketdyne is a member of the Boeing team" and that it has been "selected to provide the main propulsion for the Boeing and the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) reusable Experimental Spaceplane (XS-1)." So it's official now: DARPA will proceed with building its spaceplane, with Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne doing the work. So what happens now? What happens now According to DARPA, Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne now move into phase 2 of the project, transforming XS-1 from concept into aircraft. This should be accomplished before the end of 2019, and will include at least 10 test-firings of the Phantom Express' engines over the course of 10 days. This accomplished, the companies will proceed to phase 3 in 2020, running between 12 and 15 flight tests to prove the aircraft can actually fly 10 times in 10 days. Ultimately, DARPA will ask its contractors to demonstrate Phantom Express' ability to hit flight speeds of Mach 10, and launch a demonstration payload weighing between 900 and 3,000 pounds into low-earth orbit. If they succeed in doing this, they'll prove the ability to put a pound of payload in orbit for as little as $1,700 -- and change the economics of spaceflight forever.

The new delivery, which was welcomed with a traditional water salute, is a highly one for the carrier as it is the first aircraft to feature seats by Turkish Seats Industries (TSI), a complete Turkish brand through a close collaboration with Boeing. TSI, the first locally aircraft seat producer in Turkey, which is a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Assan Hanil, aims to play a key role in the global aircraft seat market with its innovative, lightweight, quality products. “Three years ago, we partnered in a significant initiative to pioneer another first in Turkish Civil Aviation. By establishing Turkish Seat Industry (TSI), in collaboration with Assan Hanil, we took a more active role in the industry through logistical support. And now we’re taking the delivery of the first aircraft equipped with those locally produced seats designed by TSI, an installation manufactured in Turkey that conforms to all international standards. With adding this 30th Boeing 777-300ER to our ever expanding fleet, we look forward to TSI to become a leading brand across the industry, and be a substantial part of our aircrafts in the near future.” said M. İlker Aycı, chairman of the Board and the executive committee of Turkish Airlines.   “Turkish Airlines has been a long-standing and key partner for Boeing and we are proud of their confidence and trust in Boeing’s technology and industry-leading airplanes such as the 777,” said Marty Bentrott, vice president for Sales, Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Central Asia, Boeing Commercial Airplanes. “This delivery is especially significant since it is the first to feature seats by Turkish Seat Industries (TSI). We look forward to further developing and strengthening our relationship with Turkish Airlines and the Turkish Aviation Industry.” Turkish Airlines and Boeing share a long history that goes back to 1945, with the arrival of the airline’s first DC-3/C-47 airliners. Turkish Airlines entered the jet age in the late 1960s, when the airline began operating DC-9, DC-10 and Boeing 707 airplanes. Over the years, the Turkish carrier has also flown the Boeing 727, 757, MD-80 and the most modern 737 and 777 airplanes. Boeing’s backlog with Turkish Airlines includes two 777 Freighters and 75 737 MAXs. - TradeArabia News Service Tags: Boeing | Turkish | Airlines | 777 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils dxbpass Fairmont Nile City stays green on World Environment Day InterCon opens Staybridge Suites in Jeddah Jannah Hotels employs cats to counter workplace stress Gulf Air promotes destination Georgia to Bahrain travel trade Fairmont Quasar Istanbul welcomes over 5,000 GCC guests since opening Aviation leaders assemble in Mexico for Iata’s 73rd AGM Hurley appointed as Rotana's new corporate VP - sales Emirates showcases eco-friendly aircraft cleaning technique Geneva nominated as 'Europe's Leading Destination' at WTA SalamAir to launch Taif flights this week Airbus plans major presence at Paris Air Show AirAsia free seats promo is back!

Monday 5 Jun 2017 / Tehran - 09:07 / GMT - 04:37 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Economy http://fna.ir/KTR70Q Tue May 30, 2017 4:50 Iran Issues Stern Warning over Passenger Planes Contracts Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- The Iranian government warned the foreign states and companies which have signed contracts to sell passenger planes to Tehran of the country's reciprocal moves if the other parties defy their undertakings. "If any measure is taken in violation of the contract to purchase planes, we will reciprocate," Government Spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht told reporters in his weekly press conference in Tehran on Tuesday. His remarks came after US Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin announced last week that the department is reviewing licenses for Boeing and Airbus to sell aircraft to Iran, telling lawmakers he would increase sanctions pressure on Iran. Mnuchin did not elaborate on the review of the licenses, which were issued under a 2015 agreement between Tehran and world powers to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities. The review suggests that Trump’s support for Boeing’s defense and jetliner businesses could have political limits. Iran has said that halting the airplane deals would breach the 2015 nuclear agreement. For Boeing, losing the Iran Air deal could affect 777 production, since 15 of the wide-body jetliners are included in the first approved batch of Boeing aircraft due for delivery to Iran Air by 2020. Deliveries start in May next year. Boeing said in December it would cut 777 output by 40% this year under plans that include Iran Air’s still-tentative order. Iran's National Flag Carrier, Iran Air, has agreed to buy 200 US and European passenger aircraft worth up to $37 billion at list prices, though such deals typically include big discounts. They include 80 jets from Boeing, 100 from Airbus and 20 turboprops from Franco-Italian ATR. All the aircraft need US licenses because of their reliance on US parts. Meantime, Managing Director of Iran Air Farhad Parvaresh announced late in March that the giant aviation company Airbus has delivered the third passenger plane to the country. "The third Airbus, an A330, landed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport," Parvaresh said at the time. He noted that the A330 plane which has 32 business class and 206 economy class seats is suitable for long-distance flights.         Related News Official: Any Restriction on Sales of Passenger Planes to Iran Violates N.

Over the weekend, the Irkut MC-21, a prospective new jet airliner that's expected to be Russia's answer to the Boeing-737 and the Airbus A-320, conducted its maiden flight. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov MC-21, Russia's Answer to Boeing, Performs Its Maiden Flight (PHOTO, VIDEO)Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, whose portfolio includes aircraft construction, has taken a highly active role in promoting the new aircraft and supporting its development. On Monday, the minister finally revealed the real reason for the number '21' in the MC-21's name.  In a post on his official Facebook page, Rogozin wrote that his aircraft designer friend has told him that "the MC-21 is 21% superior to its competitors in every respect – fuel consumption, maintenance requirements, comfort, noise isolation, and weight. And of course, buyers will earn 21% more by flying these aircraft, compared to the catalogue prices of Boeing and Airbus planes." "There you have it. Now I understand where our mainline aircraft [Russian 'Magistralny Samolet' – abbreviated as MS or MC] got its lucky number from," Rogozin quipped. © Sputnik/ IRKUT Corporation/Marina Lisceva Russia to Offer Integrated Contracts for MC-21 Plane - Deputy Prime MinisterEngineers have confirmed that the MC-21's maiden flight Sunday took place as expected, with all the plane's onboard systems working flawlessly. The twin-engine short- and mid-range airliner is expected to have at least three variants, with passenger capacity ranging between 150-212 persons.  The MC-21 is designed to be faster, more efficient, and less expensive than its Western counterparts, incorporating the latest in the field of airframe, engine and avionics systems technology in its design. For example, the plane features a composite wing-design, which improves fuel efficiency, and will eventually be fitted with new Russian-made PD-14 engines, which meet and exceed global safety, noise, and fuel efficiency standards. The aircraft is also designed to have a superior cruising speed, and a price tag tens of millions of dollars less than those of its Boeing and Airbus competitors. Last week, Rogozin said that there are already 185 orders for the MC-21, with dozens more expected as interest rises amid flight testing.  On Monday, Russian Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov said that the MC-21 should receive its airworthiness certificate in 2019. Eight planes, including three for flight testing, are currently being assembled at the Irkutsk Aviation Plant. Russia hopes to produce up to 1,000 of the planes for the medium-haul passenger liner market, which is by far the most capacious segment of the global aviation market, by 2037. © Sputnik/ Sergey Mamontov 'Great Export Potential': Russia's MC-21 Passenger Jet Conducts Maiden Flight (VIDEO)Work on the MC-21 first began in the late 2000s, and intensified in 2014 after the downturn in relations with Western countries. Moscow has taken a number of steps to allow Russian aviation companies to win back the commercial passenger aircraft market, both domestically and abroad. On Tuesday, RIA Novosti reported that the Russian government had instructed its representatives in the boards of directors of state companies to vote in favor of the purchase or lease of only Russian-made aircraft. ...

The 787-9 will also operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months.   With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the aircraft are gradually being introduced on a number of international routes from the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub.   Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 13 Boeing 787-9s to 11 destinations – namely Washington, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Johannesburg, Amman, Riyadh, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Perth and Brisbane from Abu Dhabi. Beirut, Beijing, Seoul and Melbourne are due to join the 787 network over the next few months.   The Amsterdam route will have a taste of the 787 between June 2nd and 30th to help meet demand during the early summer peak period. The current four weekly Madrid services will also be boosted with additional flights, moving to a daily operation from June 1.   Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways chief executive officer, said: “With two of Etihad Airways’ most popular European destinations joining our 787 network later this year, we are giving more guests the opportunity to fly on our next generation aircraft.   “Flights to and from Amsterdam and Madrid cater to business and leisure travellers, and with growing demand, there was a strong case to introduce bigger aircraft to these destinations. The 787 is fast becoming our flagship long-haul aircraft and as more are delivered, we will continue to look at upgrading existing routes with these excellent planes.   “Since introducing our first 787 into commercial service more than two years ago, we have enjoyed excellent feedback from guests on our ground-breaking cabin interiors that have set a benchmark for high service levels in the region and across the world.”   Etihad Airways’ two-class Boeing 787-9s include award-winning interiors that feature 28 Business Studios and 271 Economy Smart Seats, offering superior levels of comfort, entertainment and in-flight connectivity. On-board décor and lighting have been inspired by contemporary Arabian design, complementing the signature ‘Facets of Abu Dhabi’ identity introduced by the airline during its livery relaunch in 2014.   Etihad Airways has pending deliveries of a further 58 Dreamliners over the next few years. - TradeArabia News Service   Tags: Etihad | Dreamliner | madrid | Amsterdam | B787 | More Travel, Tourism & Hospitality Stories Dubai Parks and Resorts unveils dxbpass Fairmont Nile City stays green on World Environment Day InterCon opens Staybridge Suites in Jeddah Jannah Hotels employs cats to counter workplace stress Gulf Air promotes destination Georgia to Bahrain travel trade Fairmont Quasar Istanbul welcomes over 5,000 GCC guests since opening Aviation leaders assemble in Mexico for Iata’s 73rd AGM Hurley appointed as Rotana's new corporate VP - sales Emirates showcases eco-friendly aircraft cleaning technique Geneva nominated as 'Europe's Leading Destination' at WTA SalamAir to launch Taif flights this week Airbus plans major presence at Paris Air Show AirAsia free seats promo is back!

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson ABU DHABI, 30th May, 2017 (WAM) -- Etihad Airways today announced plans to boost its European Dreamliner network with the deployment of Boeing 787-9 aircraft to Amsterdam and Madrid. The 299-seat Dreamliners will be introduced on year-round scheduled services to Amsterdam from 1st September, and to Madrid from 1st October, joining Dusseldorf and Zurich as the airline’s other European Dreamliner services. The 787-9 will also operate seasonally to Athens during the summer months. With a phased delivery of nine Boeing 787-9s this year, the aircraft are gradually being introduced on a number of international routes from the airline’s Abu Dhabi hub. Etihad Airways currently operates a fleet of 13 Boeing 787-9s to 11 destinations from Abu Dhabi: Washington, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Johannesburg, Amman, Riyadh, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, Perth and Brisbane. Beirut, Beijing, Seoul and Melbourne are due to join the 787 network over the next few months. The Amsterdam route will have a taste of the 787 between 2nd and 30th June to help meet demand during the early summer peak period. The current four weekly Madrid services will be also boosted with additional flights, moving to a daily operation from 1st June. Peter Baumgartner, Etihad Airways Chief Executive Officer, said, "With two of Etihad Airways’ most popular European destinations joining our 787 network later this year, we are giving more guests the opportunity to fly on our next generation aircraft. Flights to and from Amsterdam and Madrid cater to business and leisure travellers, and with growing demand, there was a strong case to introduce bigger aircraft to these destinations. The 787 is fast becoming our flagship long-haul aircraft and as more are delivered, we will continue to look at upgrading existing routes with these excellent planes. Etihad Airways has pending deliveries of a further 58 Dreamliners over the next few years. © Copyright Emirates News Agency (WAM) 2017. © Copyright Zawya. All Rights Reserved.

(File Photo) The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered three FIRs pertaining to the affairs of the civil aviation ministry under the previous Congress-led government. The First Information Reports (FIRs) relate to the purchase of 50 Boeing aircraft for the erstwhile Air India, leasing of aircraft, and handing over of lucrative international airline routes to private airlines, while the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines has been registered as a preliminary enquiry, a source in the CBI told Hindustan Times on condition of anonymity. The cases come on the heels of the CBI raiding former finance minister P Chidambaram’s son Karti. The FIRs do not mention any public official by name but are built around a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) submitted to Parliament in 2011 and a subsequent report by the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC). Both reports pointed out glaring gaps in the acquisition process, which experts believe led to the national air carrier bleeding financially. In January 2017, the Supreme Court had also asked the CBI to complete the probe on the same matter by June while hearing a public interest litigation filed by activist-lawyer Prashant Bhushan on the Boeing purchase. “The Supreme Court had asked the attorney general to look into the allegations in a time-bound manner. We examined the evidence and decided to register three separate cases. We will finish the investigation soon,” said a senior CBI official privy to the development. According to the CBI official who spoke to HT, the CBI director sanctioned the registration of a case on Saturday after it remained under the scanner since 2014. The other two cases — the merger and surrendering of routes — are part of a larger probe into the mismanagement of the national air carrier whose losses increased from Rs 63 crore to over Rs 7,000 crore in the 10-year period between 2004 and 2014 coinciding with the Congress-led UPA rule. The FIR only mentions “unnamed official of civil aviation ministry”. The auditor, which covered the 2002-2010 period in its review, had said in its 121-page report that Air India was forced to buy aircraft from Boeing in a hurry. It also detailed events that led to the company’s ambitious $11-billion purchase on a paltry equity base of $34 million. A Boeing spokesperson declined to comment. Former civil aviation minister Praful Patel told HT: “I am not aware of this. But if it is indeed true, I am happy. They should investigate and the truth must come out.” The first two decisions — purchase of aircraft and the merger — were decided by an empowered group of ministers headed by P Chidambaram, the then finance minister, and Pranab Mukherjee, the then external affairs minister. Patel was part of the group as civil aviation minister. The CAG report, however, pinned the responsibility on Patel’s ministry, “The erstwhile Air India was advised to revisit its proposal by “the aviation ministry” into expanding its requirement of aircraft. Whilst their earlier proposal for 28 aircraft had taken two years to prepare and submit, the revised long-term fleet for 50 aircraft plan was completed in four months,” the auditor had said. more from india While you were away: Top stories to get you up to date Jun 05, 2017 08:10 IST World Environment Day: Despite increasing green cover, India is losing its forests Jun 05, 2017 09:35 IST Nurturing Recruitment-Ready Students Promotional Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

    * MS-21 first jetliner using composite wings without
autoclaves
    * Move foreshadows changes in the way many jets may be built
    * Boeing pondering same technology for possible mid-market
plane
    * Upcoming technology choices to shape jet industry for
decades

    By Tim HepherPARIS, May 29 (Reuters) - Russia's new jetliner, which
conducted its maiden flight on Sunday, may have a hard time
challenging the sales duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, but it does
point the way to radical changes in how they could be building
jets in the future.
    The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia'sUnited Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne
aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a
costly pressurised oven called an autoclave.
    The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology
already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for
cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircaft with
composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers.
    Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make
wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for
its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market
between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737.
    "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without
 autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said.
    A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market
opportunities and declined further comment.
    Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its
two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next
generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from
2030 and last well into the second half of the century.
    Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy
publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of
jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same
production system as the one developed for the NMA.
    Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years
and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology
choices represent a colossal 75-year bet.
    Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how
to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month.
Airbus has declined to comment on the report.

    PIVOTAL DECISION
    Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but
achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787
Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save
money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon.
    Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on
fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to
build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA
or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to
build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help.
    Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is
a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel
<HXL.N>, Solvay <SOLB.BR> of Belgium and Toray <3402.T> of
Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing.
    At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay
showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to
supply manufacturers on a bigger scale.
    "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to
produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds,"
said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel
Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance.
    Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from
carbon fibre already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg",
which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane
parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves.
    Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to
produce than aluminium.
    Under the new technology, instead of using fibre that is
pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fibre
engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused
with resin under a vacuum.
    The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a
process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal.
Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear.
    Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for
years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way.
    But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique
for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before
the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing.
    The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to
catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western
giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded
models to future designs.
    "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is
on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank
Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay
Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21.
    He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size
to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.
    Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And
composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds
planemakers have in mind.
    Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of
its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for
the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be
closer to the 60-80 mark.
    Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft
would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to
a higher tempo using the widely expected composites.
    Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output
require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider
automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology
works first time, following widespread delays with new jet
programmes.
    "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based
on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need
to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his 707 to an Australian aviation museum. Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:15 AM, May 30, 2017 SYDNEY — Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the Hollywood actor, who is a qualified pilot, acquired the jet when Australia’s national carrier retired it more than 30 years later. “It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS),” Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 145km from Sydney. A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it. “The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again,” Travolta said. “I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia.” HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia’s east coast. “We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it,” De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. “When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we’ve been in detailed discussions and negotiations since.” Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Boeing & Aerospace Business Boeing puts 737 up against small business jets for $6.9B defense contract Originally published May 29, 2017 at 8:00 pm Updated May 29, 2017 at 9:53 pm Boeing is pitching to the Pentagon a 737-based replacement for the 17-aircraft fleet of JSTARS jets, used for surveillance of ground forces in a combat zone and to target enemy positions. The rivals are two high-end business jets. The contract may lead to further lucrative work. Share story By Dominic Gates Seattle Times aerospace reporter For a vital aircraft that will fly above distant battlefields, the Air Force will choose between Goliath and two Davids. One is a jet originally designed to carry around 135 passengers, the two others built to carry fewer than 20 people. With a $6.9 billion deal on the line, a militarized version of Boeing’s Renton-built 737 jet is going up against the Gulfstream G550 and the Bombardier Global 6000 high-end business jets for a special-mission contract to be awarded as early as this fall. The 17 JSTARS jets at issue will be stuffed with high-tech military radar and computer-analysis equipment.

The planes are heavily used in combat zones for surveillance of ground forces and to target enemy positions. The current JSTARS fleet is now active in strikes on the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Boeing hopes a JSTARS win could incline the Air Force to choose the 737 to replace more than 100 different types of special-mission aircraft in its inventory — contracts that are lucrative far beyond the mere number of 737s involved. But the competition from Savannah, Georgia-based Gulfstream and Canada’s Bombardier is formidable. For special missions, air forces around the world are increasingly selecting business jets that fly higher, faster and further than airliners. The U.S. Air Force initially chose the Gulfstream for a separate electronic-jamming plane code-named Compass Call, although Boeing this month formally challenged that process. Fred Smith, director of global sales and marketing at Boeing Military Aircraft, dismisses the business jets as “a great solution for countries with smaller air forces and navies.” As for the U.S., he said, “for a bigger mission, you need a bigger airplane.” JSTARS 737 virtual tour In a conference room inside Boeing’s former Space Center in Kent, now a hive of different defense programs, a reporter donned a virtual-reality visor to take a look at a virtual mock-up of the jet maker’s 737 JSTARS contender. JSTARS stands for Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System. It’s a joint Air Force and Army system, revolving around a massive, long-range radar that monitors what’s happening on the ground in a battle zone. The virtual mock-up shows the radar hidden in a canoe-shaped bump about 20 feet long under the jet’s fuselage. Inside the virtual airplane, operators seated at 10 stations toward the rear of the aircraft monitored large computer screens, analyzing the radar data and communicating with U.S. forces. Aft of the stations, large metal cabinets housed the computer servers and other equipment. Forward of them was a robust printer and a “mission table,” with a tabletop computer display screen of the battle zone. At the front of the cabin, immediately behind the flight deck, was a crew rest area for long-endurance missions and extra seats. Then Smith showed off a Boeing marketing trick, designed to impress upon the Air Force why size matters. With a click of a button, an arc of light sliced through the virtual cabin, superimposing upon Boeing’s mock-up another cabin wall that cut off half the computer stations. “That’s the G550 fuselage,” Smith said. Highflying G550 The Gulfstream jet is proposed by a team led by defense firm Northrop Grumman and L3 Technologies, a leading integrator of military electronics. L3 is the lead system integrator role on the Compass Call contract and is set to choose the aircraft for that program — Boeing’s protest of the contracting process centers on L3’s close collaboration with Gulfstream. L3 integrated the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance mission systems on G550s sold to Australia, Israel and Singapore and for other special-mission models sold to Japan and Germany. Northrop is the prime contractor on the current JSTARS fleet. First deployed in combat during the first Iraq war in 1991, those jets are all converted 707 airliners — now with an average age of 48 years and ripe for replacement with something more efficient. Alan Metzger, Northrop’s vice president for surveillance and targeting systems, said in an interview that though the Air Force needed a 707-sized jet to house all the equipment when the original JSTARS contract was awarded in 1985, a smaller business jet is appropriate today because the technology has all been miniaturized. “I don’t understand why you need a 135-passenger aircraft to carry around 10 Air Force operators,” Metzger said. Northrop bought a G550 and outfitted it with the current JSTARS mission equipment to demonstrate not only that the jet was big enough and met all requirements but that it had sufficient margin for any anticipated future growth. The key advantage of the business-jet solution is performance, he said. The G550 will fly hundreds of miles farther than a 737 and burn less fuel. It’s so much lighter it can take off from a shorter runway, giving it access to almost twice as many bases around the world, Metzger said. And the G550’s standard flight ceiling is 51,000 feet, compared with 41,000 feet for the 737. That matters when you are beaming radar down into a mountainous region such as, say, Afghanistan. At lower altitudes, a mountain peak up ahead may be in the way. As the plane flies higher, it has a direct line of sight into more of the landscape below. “You’ll see less if you have to look through rock, instead of over it,” Metzger said. Global 6000 foreign sales The third JSTARS contender, offering the Bombardier business jet as the platform, is a team led by defense giant Lockheed Martin, partnered with electronics and mission-systems integrator Raytheon. Raytheon is separately bidding against Northrop to provide the high-tech radar equipment on the JSTARS plane and all three contenders are ready to offer whichever radar system wins. The Bombardier Global 6000 is larger than the G550, both longer and with a wider cabin, yet still about half the weight of the smallest 737. The U.S. Air Force uses a Global 6000 for its E-11 special-mission jet, which is an airborne node for relaying battlefield communications. And the Bombardier jet too has won a series of foreign military orders, said Stephane Villeneuve, Bombardier’s vice president of specialized aircraft. It’s the platform for the U.K.’s Sentinel reconnaissance fleet, AWACS aircraft for the United Arab Emirates, intelligence-gathering aircraft for India and maritime-patrol aircraft for Israel. “In the international market, people are going to a business jet for all the missions we are describing here,” Villeneuve said. 737 cost effectiveness That trend threatens Boeing’s hope of extending its line of modified commercial jets for the military by replacing all the U.S. Air Force special-mission aircraft with 737-based models. Most of the existing planes are aging 707-based platforms, with a variety of missions and each with its own strangely opaque code name, including: • Cobra Ball, a fleet of three aircraft that collect data on ballistic-missile launches. • Rivet Joint, a 17-strong fleet of aircraft that gather and analyze military-electronic signals. • Constant Phoenix, a two-aircraft fleet that collects atmospheric data from nuclear tests. The Gulfstream and Bombardier jets each cost just over $60 million at list prices, some $20 million cheaper than the Boeing 737 model on offer. And they do burn a lot less fuel than the big jet. Nevertheless, one of Boeing’s major arguments is that the Air Force will save money on a fleet of 737s because maintenance and operational costs are so much lower. There are more than 9,000 of its 737s in service around the world, Boeing argues, with spare parts available anywhere in the world within 24 hours and with a tremendous reliability record that minimizes downtime. Smith compares the Air Force’s options to someone looking to repair a Ford truck rather than a fancy sports car. “There’s a maintenance shop on every corner,” he said. “It’s extremely cost competitive.” He cited U.S. Defense Department data showing that when maintenance costs are included, the total operational cost of a 737 used to ferry around top military brass is about half that of a G550-based Air Force jet used for the same purpose. Rod Meranda, Boeing’s sales and marketing lead for the JSTARS program, contends that the Air Force also takes on less risk if it goes with Boeing. For example, he said, neither the G550 nor the Global 6000 has ever been fitted with an in-flight refueling capability — a JSTARS requirement. “There’s a lot of risk taking a small airplane, cutting a hole in it and putting in in-flight refueling,” said Meranda. “How much will it take to test that, something that’s never been done before?” Boeing by contrast has already installed in-flight refueling on its 737-based fleet of P-8 Poseidon anti-submarine jets. The Air Force plans to weigh the cost, risk and performance of the three proposals on offer and choose the JSTARS replacement by year end. If Boeing were to win, the necessary military modifications to the airframe would likely be done during final assembly on the Renton production line — perhaps even on the same dedicated military line now churning out the P-8s. Where Boeing would then install the mission equipment, the radar and all the computers, is unclear. Still, for Renton, a Boeing JSTARS win would be significant and worth more than just 17 airplanes. It would indicate a high likelihood of further special-mission aircraft contracts later. First though, Goliath has to beat the Davids.

(AFP/Greg Wood) Hollywood star John Travolta has donated his "beloved" Boeing 707 plane to an Australian aviation museum and is aiming to be part of the crew to deliver the vintage aircraft. Made for Qantas Airways in 1964, the "Saturday Night Fever" heartthrob and qualified pilot acquired the jet when Australia's national carrier retired it more than 30 years later.  "It gives me great pleasure to make this exciting historical announcement that my beloved Boeing 707 aircraft has been donated to the Historical Aircraft Restoration society (HARS)," Travolta, a Qantas ambassador since 2002, said in a statement. Australian aircraft preservation organisation HARS will help restore the plane so it can make the journey from the United States to their base some 90 miles (145 kilometres) from Sydney.  A date for the flight is not yet fixed but the actor, a long-time aviation buff, said he plans to be on it.  Read also: Dresses that tell a story: Princess Diana's life in fashion "The aircraft currently requires a lot of work to be restored to a safe flying state and having seen first hand the dedication and passion of people at HARS, I have no doubt this beautiful and historical aircraft will be flying again," Travolta said. "I am hoping to be part of the crew to fly the aircraft to Australia." HARS President Bob De La Hunty said the idea was first floated when he met Travolta in 2009 and the pair flew a Qantas 1955 Super Constellation aircraft along Australia's east coast. "We share a mutual respect for old airplanes and flying and at that stage we were keen to suggest to him that if he ever wanted to part with his Boeing 707 we would be very interested in it," De La Hunty told broadcaster ABC. "When we heard earlier this year that he was looking at possibly not continuing with his Boeing 707, we made contact. He jumped at the idea and so we've been in detailed discussions and negotiations since." Boeing 707s dominated passenger aircraft in the 1960s, helping usher in an era of long-range travel which had previously been dominated by rail and sea.

Quotes in the article Boeing Co BA ▲ 190.23 +2.91 +1.55% Hexcel Corp HXL ▲ 52.17 +0.16 +0.31% The MS-21, a new single aisle airliner produced by Russia's United Aircraft Corporation, is the first passenger plane borne aloft by lightweight carbon-composite wings built without a costly pressurized oven called an autoclave. The manufacturing process provides a test for a technology already being assessed by Western rivals, who are looking for cheaper and faster ways to build some of their aircraft with composites, according to aerospace executives and suppliers. Even as it sets up the world's largest autoclaves to make wings for its giant 777X, Boeing is exploring alternatives for its "New Midsize Airplane" (NMA), in the middle of the market between its big wide-body jets and best-selling 737. "There's a good chance part of the NMA will be built without autoclaves," a person familiar with the project said. A Boeing spokesman said it was studying mid-market opportunities and declined further comment. Sources say Boeing's choice of technology for its two-aircraft NMA family will lay the foundation for the next generation of its money-spinning 737, expected to appear from 2030 and last well into the second half of the century. Load Error Boeing has not yet discussed this part of its strategy publicly, but industry sources said it may include a trio of jets seating 160 to 210 people and built using broadly the same production system as the one developed for the NMA. Both families of planes are likely to be built for 30 years and stay in service for another 20-30. So today's technology choices represent a colossal 75-year bet. Airbus too is monitoring the technology as it considers how to respond to Boeing's mid-market jet, CNN reported last month. Airbus has declined to comment on the report. PIVOTAL DECISION Composites have been used in aviation since the 1970s but achieved a breakthrough in the past decade as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 entered service, promising to save money on fuel by replacing most metal parts with lighter carbon. Those are long-haul jets, which means that the savings on fuel are worthwhile even though the planes are expensive to build. For short-haul planes that burn less fuel, like the NMA or future 737, it is more important to find cheaper ways to build them, and avoiding the need for autoclaves could help. Betting on technology that does not require an autoclave is a gamble also for composite suppliers like U.S.-based Hexcel (HXL.N), Solvay (SOLB.BR) of Belgium and Toray (3402.T) of Japan, whose share of aerospace manufacturing is growing. At a recent JEC composites fair in Paris, Hexcel and Solvay showcased out-of-autoclave prototype parts as they gear up to supply manufacturers on a bigger scale. "It's one of the big questions now in aerospace: how to produce out-of-autoclave on a large scale and at high speeds," said Henri Girardy, business development manager at Hexcel Composites, adding jetmakers would accept no cut in performance. Boeing's Dreamliner and the Airbus A350 are built from carbon fiber already impregnated with resin, called "prepreg", which is supplied to jetmakers, tailored by machines into plane parts and cured inside giant pressure-cooking autoclaves.© REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Belgian chemicals group Solvay displays a prototype aircraft wing skin made using alternative resin-infusion production methods without a traditional autoclave at the JEC World exhibition at Villepinte Analysts say these parts cost around 30-40 percent more to produce than aluminum. Under the new technology, instead of using fiber that is pre-impregnated with resin, parts are made from a dry-fiber engineered textile which is placed in a mould and then infused with resin under a vacuum. The parts can then be cured in an oven without pressure, a process estimated to cost 25 percent more than metal. Ultimately, that gap needs to narrow significantly or disappear. Boatbuilders and windfarm makers have used this method for years. Secondary airplane parts have also been made that way. But although Canada's Bombardier partly used the technique for its CSeries, it was rare for flight-critical parts before the designers of the new Russian plane chose it for the wing. The MS-21 has yet to score large sales but has been able to catch onto the latest manufacturing wave at a time when Western giants are starting to think beyond their recently upgraded models to future designs. "This is an excellent technology demonstrator because it is on a real programme and a primary-structure part," said Frank Nickisch, global director of strategic projects at Solvay Composite Materials, which provided materials for the MS-21. He noted that the wings on the MS-21 are of comparable size to a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.© REUTERS An MS-21 medium-range passenger plane, produced by Irkut Corporation, takes off in Irkutsk Still, more needs to be done to bring down costs. And composite firms are not yet ready to support output at speeds planemakers have in mind. Industry sources say Boeing is expected to build 20-30 of its proposed mid-market planes a month, about twice the rate for the 787. Future 737 and A320 replacements are likely to be closer to the 60-80 mark. Nickisch said the proposed new Boeing middle-market aircraft would be a good test case for whether the industry can switch to a higher tempo using the widely expected composites. Yet tough planemaker targets on cost, performance and output require progress on three fronts: cheaper materials, wider automation and computer simulation to ensure new technology works first time, following widespread delays with new jet programmes. "Prepreg technology has been developing for 40 years, based on day-to-day knowledge. But to bring in a new process we need to be able to predict it first, with databanks," Girardy said.

For The Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA) that has been something of a headache because the company doesn’t sell a commercial jet for anywhere near that price. But in an agreement announced last Friday, the U.S. manufacturer struck a deal with Italy’s SACE SpA to under which the Italian financial firm will guarantee up to $1.25 billion in loans to finance purchases of new Boeing airplanes. In its announcement of the deal, SACE noted that Boeing purchased $2.5 billion in goods and services from 2015 to 2016 from Italian firms and supported 12,000 jobs in the country. Boeing has about 150 direct employees in Italy according to the announcement. The Ex-Im’s charter was renewed in December 2016, but because no new appointments have been made to the bank’s board it can not authorize a loan or a guarantee valued at more than $10 million.The bank’s rules require a quorum of 60% of its nominal five members in order to make larger deals. The board now has just two members. Some U.S. Senators have blocked new appointments to the board, arguing that the bank is no more than the “Bank of Boeing.” U.S. airlines, not eligible for Ex-Im financing guarantees, also argued against renewing the bank’s charter. President Trump took office opposed to the Ex-Im bank, but after meeting with Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg reportedly changed his mind. That change has not yet filtered down to the Senate nor has it resulted in the President nominating new members to the bank’s board. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, SACE completed its first deal this month, providing guarantees of around $300 million for three Boeing 737-800s that have been sold to Turkey’s SunExpress. The planes have a list price of $98 million, but the actual price would likely have been 30% or so less than that. Italian aerospace company Leonardo supplies about 14% of the parts, including the center and rear fuselage sections, for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner at the company’s plant near Taranto. This is Boeing’s first deal with a non-U.S. financial firm to help it finance aircraft purchases. One odd thing about the refusal to appoint new members to the Ex-Im bank’s board is that the bank turns a profit and makes or guarantees loans to hundreds of small U.S. firms.

"I'm looking at the new high list for the S&P 500 today, and you know what I saw? I like what I saw, which is a broad distribution among the 70 companies that hit this august list — 70 out of 500 making new highs," the "Mad Money" host said on Wednesday. While the rally may feel tech-driven, Cramer noticed that only 11 of the 70 companies that hit new highs were tech stocks, mostly from the semiconductor space. Of the rest, 23 were utility companies, an understandable group to be hitting new highs considering the market's worries about a slowing U.S. economy. Watch the full segment here: show chapters Cramer takes to the new high list to prove the rally is wider than it seems    Wednesday, 31 May 2017 | 11:57 AM ET | 11:50 "But that leaves 36 stocks that have nothing to do with tech or utilities rallying today, and those are where I gain solace, solace that perhaps things aren't as narrow or as unhealthy as they seem to so many," Cramer said. First, he turned to 3M, an industrial conglomerate that has consistently delivered strong results for shareholders. "I've often called 3M what I call 'a core holding,' meaning it's a stock you never want to sell if you can avoid it," the "Mad Money" host said. "3M is exactly the kind of stock you want on the new high list if you're concerned about a rally being too narrow." Boeing, the largest aerospace company in the world, also hit a new high. Cramer pointed out that as one of the United States' biggest exporters, Boeing would not be able to sell its products if the economy was dramatically slowing. Cramer also noticed that railroad operator CSX was on the list, which would also not be outperforming if the cargo industry was on the verge of collapse. Even with the appointment of new CEO Hunter Harrison, which gave the stock a boost, Cramer takes CSX's success as a sign of strength in commerce. Consumer strength was illuminated by Carnival Corporation's place on the list. Cramer called the cruise line "the ultimate in discretionary spending," meaning that customers do not need to spend on cruises, but since they are, the consumer cannot be as weak as some may think. "And then there's the clinchers, frankly: McDonald's, Yum [Brands] and Starbucks. These are three classic growth names that have all the same concerns: labor costs going up, strong dollar liabilities, higher price-to-earnings multiples than we might otherwise expect. But they're all hitting the new high list nonetheless," Cramer said. Some sectors makes the "Mad Money" host uneasy. One is the downtrodden bank stocks, which have been lower on negative effects of trading, and the oil stocks. "The oils? If you own 'em, it's deathly," he said. "The fact is, there's too much oil. On the other hand, though, I think the group has already gotten pretty cheap. The oils represent value here and that's not a sin." And while retail has been a consistent, market-wide concern, Cramer said that Wal-Mart and Costco's successes are at least challenging Amazon's domination. "Sure, it's easy to point endlessly to the coming FANG apocalypse," Cramer said. "I just want to point out that when you look at the new high list, it's about as broad as you could ask, sans the utilities and their safe dividends. That doesn't mean we should break out the party hats. It does mean that we're in less dangerous territory than many people now think after five fabulous months of 2017 market action."

Dassault Aviation, Boeing, SAAB and Rosoboronexport have responded to the global request for information (RFI) issued in January this year. New Delhi (Sputnik) – Apart from some basic guidelines for procurement, the Indian Navy had sought answers on a range of issues like electronic warfare capability, endurance and payload. The Navy is also desirous of licensed production of the aircraft after acquiring transfer of technology in the case. "We have received the reply from all the four to whom RFI had been issued. Now, we will examine the RFI and will take it forward," Admiral Sunil Lanba, Indian Navy chief said on Wednesday. Multi-role fighters are intended as day-night capable; all-weather multi-role deck based combat aircraft which can be used for air defense, air-to-surface operations, buddy refueling, reconnaissance, and EW missions from Indian Naval aircraft carriers. Solicitation issued on January had asked global vendors if it can perform Short Take-off But Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) or Catapult Take-off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) operations, or both. Swedish SAAB is pitching its single engine Sea Gripen which has capability to operate from both STOBAR/CATOBAR while Russian upgraded MiG-29K can operate from STOBAR. Boeing's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and Dassault's Rafale M are also in the fray for approximately $15 billion contract. Indian Navy is expected to issue the tender soon following the go-ahead signal from the government. "Hopefully, we will select and shall have deck-based carrier airborne fighter in next 4-5 years," Admiral Lanba added. The selected aircraft will operate from indigenously developed IAC-1 aircraft carrier which will be conventional ski jump based STOBAR layout and INS Vikramaditya. "The IAC-1 which is under-construction at the moment is going as per the timeline and she will start her trial in 2019, we will take delivery in 2020," Admiral Lanba said. © Sputnik NEWSLETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address   Advertise with Us | About Us | GlobalSecurity.org In the News | Internships | Site Map | Privacy Copyright © 2000-2017 GlobalSecurity.org All rights reserved.

Environment Minister Catherine McKenna would only say Wednesday that Canada remains committed to the Paris Accord, refusing to speculate about U.S. President Donald Trump's musings about withdrawing from the agreement. "Canada's just going to keep marching on, like the rest of the world," McKenna told an event in Toronto. McKenna has said what the U.S. chooses to do is up to the U.S., but Canada won't wait. Last week in Germany, McKenna met with Chinese special envoy for climate change Xie Zhenhua and European Union environment commissioner Karmenu Vella, where they discussed jointly hosting a meeting of environment ministers this fall to chart a path for implementing Paris among the world's major economies. It very likely will take place in Canada, around the same time as the United Nations General Assembly, which starts in New York City on Sept. 12. Currently the U.S. is not part of that group. "Canada is going to show leadership with China and the EU and we certainly hope the U.S. will be joining us," McKenna told The Canadian Press in a recent interview. ——— WETTLAUFER EXPECTED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO MURDER CHARGES: A former Ontario nurse accused of killing eight seniors in her care is expected to plead guilty to first-degree murder charges in their deaths at a court appearance on Thursday. Elizabeth Wettlaufer currently faces a total of 14 charges, including eight counts of first-degree murder, four counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault. Police have alleged those crimes involved the use of certain drugs and took place over the last decade in three Ontario long-term care facilities where Wettlaufer worked as a registered nurse, and at a private home. A source close to the case tells The Canadian Press that Wettlaufer is scheduled to plead guilty to eight counts of first-degree murder in a Woodstock, Ont., court on Thursday. Wettlaufer's defence lawyer did not respond to requests for comment on the expected development. A spokeswoman with Ontario's Ministry of the Attorney General says "significant developments" are expected in the case on Thursday, but did not provide further details. ——— DEATH OF ASYLUM SEEKER 'GREATEST FEAR': Officials with an organization that helps asylum seekers say their biggest concern has been that someone could die while trying to illegally cross into Canada. Now a woman, who American officials say may have been trying to reach Manitoba on foot from the United States, has been found dead in a remote part of northwestern Minnesota. "This has been our greatest fear all along, is that people are risking their lives to make this crossing," said Maj. Rob Kerr with the Salvation Army in Winnipeg. "It's surprising now that it's happened at this point in time, at the end of May. It was our greatest fear back in February, March when it was so cold out." The Kittson County sheriff's office says the body of Mavis Otuteye, 57, was found Friday in a field close to the Canadian border near the Minnesota town of Noyes. Authorities believe Otuteye was a citizen of Ghana in western Africa. Chief deputy Matt Vig told WDAZ-TV that Otuteye was reported missing a day earlier and was likely heading to Canada on foot to try to reunite with her daughter. He said Otuteye had been living in Delaware for the last several years. Final autopsy results were pending, but Vig said preliminary results indicate she died of hypothermia. The officer said part of her body was in a shallow pool of water in a drainage ditch. ——— BUSINESS LEADERS EXPRESS CONCERN AFTER B.C. ELECTION: Some business leaders in Canada are expressing concerns that the fallout from British Columbia's election is discouraging the private sector from investing in the province. Val Litwin, the president of the B.C. Chamber of Commerce, says the promises in NDP-Green agreement to block the Trans Mountain expansion, review the Site C dam, increase the hourly minimum wage to at least $15 and hike the carbon tax have done little to calm investor nerves. Litwin says he hopes the NDP, should it form a minority government with the help of the Greens, would consult with businesses before making tax changes or raising the minimum wage as they would end up paying those costs. Gary Leach, the president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, says the resolution to immediately stop Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion project would send a chilling message to investors across Canada. Liberal Premier Christy Clark has said she will recall the provincial legislature in June where she expects a confidence vote will result in the probable defeat of her government. The Liberals won 43 seats in the May 9 election, one shy of a majority, but the formal, four-year agreement between the Greens and NDP would give them 44 seats, handing them a one-seat majority. ——— SAJJAN BLASTS BOEING OVER TRADE SPAT: As he highlighted the defence industry as a driver of economic growth, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan also used a major speech Wednesday to blast American firm Boeing for picking a trade spat with Bombardier. Sajjan said Canada is disappointed by the "unfounded" action by one of its major partners in the defence industry and he delivered that message to hundreds at a breakfast speech at a major trade show for military contractors in Ottawa. Boeing has petitioned the U.S. Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate subsidies for Bombardier's CSeries aircraft that it says have allowed the Canadian company to export planes at well below cost. Sajjan said Boeing is not behaving like a "trusted partner" and the government wants the company to withdraw the complaint. The minister said the military wants to help foster a partnership with the defence industry that allows for the development of cutting-edge equipment for Canadian soldiers. He identified four areas of focus: alternative fuels, surveillance tools, remotely piloted systems and systems to counter IEDs. ——— COMMISSIONER SAYS INQUIRY WILL RETURN TO YUKON: Chief commissioner Marion Buller says the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Girls will return to Yukon, but perhaps will visit a different community next time. Buller has said previously that the inquiry will need more time and more money to complete its work, but has not said how much is needed or when the request will be made to the federal government. She says after testimony wraps up in Whitehorse this week, the commissioners will discuss how much more time is needed. As for money, Buller says the commissioners will be careful about deciding how much more to ask for because they know they are working with taxpayers' dollars. The federal government gave the commissioners a budget of about $53.9 million and asked them to complete their work by the end of 2018, but most family hearings will not take place until this fall. The commissioners heard emotional testimony on Tuesday from four families who have lost loved ones and Buller says from her perspective the day was a great success. ——— LEADERS CALL FOR RCMP TO PROBE DEATHS IN NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO: Deep distrust of police in a northwestern Ontario city has prompted area indigenous chiefs to ask for the RCMP to investigate the recent deaths of teens in the community. Three chiefs travelled to the provincial legislature Wednesday to plead for the Mounties' intervention as well as increased oversight of the police services board in Thunder Bay, Ont. They say the deaths of two teens whose bodies were pulled from local waterways earlier this month continue what they call an ongoing trend of indifference on the part of Thunder Bay police. They also noted the similar death of another indigenous person in 2015 that touched off an official probe into the force's practices around investigating the deaths or disappearances of indigenous people. Previously, the force's actions were also scrutinized at an inquest probing the deaths of seven students who had come to Thunder Bay to pursue an education beyond their remote fly-in communities. The Thunder Bay Police Services Board said it takes issue with some of the chiefs' assertions. It noted that while systemic racism is an issue plaguing indigenous communities, the problem goes well beyond relationships with police. ——— NOVA SCOTIA VOTER TURNOUT AT ALL-TIME LOW: Voter turnout in Nova Scotia slumped to an all-time low in Tuesday's provincial election, with just over half of eligible voters casting ballots. Fewer than 54 per cent of eligible voters cast ballots, a drop from the 2013 voter turnout of slightly more than 58 per cent. Premier Stephen McNeil called it "alarming," and vowed to take a "hard look" at the issue. Of the 748,633 registered electors in the province, only 400,898 cast a ballot in a race that saw McNeil win a second consecutive majority government. The urban riding of Halifax Citadel-Sable Island recorded one of the lowest voter turnouts on record, with just over 40 per cent of electors registering a vote. Cape Breton-Richmond had the biggest turnout — nearly 70 per cent. Elections Nova Scotia spokesman Andy LeBlanc says the low turnout was a disappointing departure from the strong early voting trend, in which 112,900 voters cast their ballots at advanced polls. ——— FORMER JURORS CALL FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE: Former jurors and New Democrat MPs are urging the federal government to create a national support system for Canadians who are called to serve as jurors. Mark Farrant says he developed post-traumatic stress disorder after serving on a jury in 2014 and wants Ottawa to take steps to ensure others don't face similar struggles. Farrant says jurors perform a significant public service, and need federal help to address the emotional toll the task can exact on their lives and families. NDP House leader Murray Rankin says his party is calling for a national standard of support for Canadians serving on juries. He says serving as a juror can be very stressful and traumatizing, and the federal government should stand behind Canadians who carry out their public duties. Farrant says he met this week in Ottawa with MPs including Bill Blair, the parliamentary secretary to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould, and officials from the Justice Department. ——— EAST COAST TOWN WANTS TO GIVE AWAY ARMOURED VEHICLE: If you're in the market for a large, tank-like vehicle, the Nova Scotia town of New Glasgow has a deal for you. The town's police chief says he wants to give away the department's Cougar light-armoured vehicle, which was a gift from the former local MP, Peter MacKay, when he was defence minister. The 10-tonne vehicle was first used by the Canadian military in the 1970s, but their fleet of Cougars has since been retired, and some were given to other militaries and police forces. New Glasgow officials have been trying to off-load the six-wheeled machine for the past six months, admitting it had rarely been used since it arrived four years ago. It was supposed to be used by the police emergency response team, but that unit was recently disbanded.  Halifax Regional Police have shown some interest in the vehicle, but talks are still underway. ———   The Canadian Press Previous Ex-nurse expected to plead guilty to 8 first-degree murder charges Next Officials warn residents to stay off of Puntledge River due to high water flows Related Articles ‘Come From Away’ wins 3 Drama Desk Awards, including outstanding musical June 04, 2017 Ottawa vigilant as Canada 150 birthday party looms after London attack: mayor June 04, 2017 Military faces intensive archival search to pinpoint gay purge numbers June 04, 2017 CP Regional News B.C. legislature in ‘uncharted territory’ as it tussles with Speaker appointment June 04, 2017 Halifax author Kris Bertin wins $10,000 Danuta Gleed Literary Award June 03, 2017 Hundreds gather to mourn B.C. fire chief killed in flooding creek June 03, 2017 First Nation applauds B.C.

Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen WASHINGTON – The multiple ways in which Donald Trump could threaten Canada-U.S. trade will be on full display this month, with a series of looming decisions and public events that hold the potential to escalate disputes. One expert counts three pathways to pain: NAFTA negotiations, punitive actions, and pressure on CEOs to shift operations to the U.S. Story continues below Gary Hufbauer says this flurry of individual actions will allow the president to point to immediate results in his “America First” agenda, giving him something to show voters in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections if NAFTA talks languish into the following year. READ MORE:  Harjit Sajjan blasts Boeing over trade spat “I think the NAFTA negotiations are going to be long, and tedious, and difficult, and not yield much fruit between now and the (midterms) in 2018,” said Hufbauer, a prominent trade analyst at Washington’s Peterson Institute. “So… these other parts of the agenda will be what Trump emphasizes when we come down to the congressional and senatorial races.” Lots is happening this month. There are at least four actions on the punitive front that Canada will be watching in June: a report on Bombardier by the Commerce Department around June 12, which could lead to duties; a decision on additional softwood-lumber duties June 23; and investigations into the national-security implications of importing steel and aluminum, which Trump says will be released in June. READ MORE: Chrystia Freeland says feds lobbying Americans hard on benefits of NAFTA There’s also a big hearing on NAFTA on June 27. The U.S. government will collect public input on what it should demand in negotiations later this year, and foreigners are invited to share submissions for the Washington event. The Canadian government is preparing for this multi-front challenge: — On Tuesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan came within a whisker of threatening the U.S. company that launched the complaint against Bombardier. Ottawa has said it is reviewing plans to spend at least $5 billion on Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets. Sajjan said in a speech: “(This) is not the behaviour of a trusted partner.” — On softwood lumber, Ottawa is threatening two other trade actions. It says it might ban exports of U.S. coal from B.C., and is also studying whether the state of Oregon’s business subsidies constitute grounds for punitive action. — On steel and aluminum, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed Trump during a chat in Sicily for a Canada exemption from any punitive action. The countries have relatively balanced trade in steel. In fact, Canada is by far the largest importer of U.S. steel — it took in 51 per cent of U.S. exports last year, Mexico took 39 per cent, and the next four countries took a mere one per cent each. READ MORE: Free trade, climate change on Justin Trudeau’s agenda at G7 summit in Italy The American cabinet official responsible for many of these trade actions is aware of this. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a congressional hearing last week: “We actually have steel surplus with Canada and Mexico, so that puts them in a little different position, as well as the fact that they are participants in NAFTA.” The Canadian government will keep taking its message on the road. Transport Minister Marc Garneau will be in Pennsylvania steel country Friday as the latest cabinet minister to travel throughout the U.S., spreading the message about US$635 billion a year in bilateral trade of goods and services, the nine million U.S. jobs related to Canadian trade, and the US$1.2 million of trade occuring every minute of the day. Garneau alone has been in Washington, D.C., Washington State, and Florida recently as the Canadian cabinet scours the continental United States is search of potential allies as these disputes arise. “It’s just making our American neighbours aware of just how much is at stake,” Garneau said in an interview. FULL COVERAGE: Softwood lumber dispute He’ll be meeting in Pittsburgh with two Republican congressman and with the head of the United Steelworkers union — Leo Gerard, who is Canadian. Gerard happened to be inside the Oval Office for the public event where Trump blasted Canadian trade in dairy, lumber, and energy. But Garneau warns against getting too exercised by this daily noise. He says he’s looking farther ahead, past June, at another big date: Aug. 16. That’s when the U.S. will have finished its NAFTA consultations and will be ready to present its demands to Canada and Mexico for the renegotiation. “The vast majority of what we’re looking at will be under NAFTA,” Garneau said in an interview. “There’s a certain amount of stuff that gets out there in the media that may not necessarily be what the United States’ final position is… “We know the art of negotiation. The real serious negotiations will be based on what is put on the table in front of us, three months from now. That’s what we will be focused on… That’s when the rubber hits the road.” Buy American is another issue on the transport minister’s mind. Domestic procurement could be a key sticking point in the NAFTA talks, and also surface as an issue in an eventual U.S. infrastructure bill. The last time it was a major irritant some Canadian companies responded by opening U.S. facilities. That’s the third kind of pressure Hufbauer expects to see, beyond sector-by-sector penalties and NAFTA harball bargaining. He says Trump already has pressed CEOs of major companies, especially in the auto sector but in others as well, with one purpose: “Threatening them to locate in the United States.” © 2017 The Canadian Press Report an error Boeing boeing bombardier dispute Bombardier Canada-US Canada-US Trade Donald Trump Justin Trudeau NAFTA Softwood lumber Editor's Picks Politics Donald Trump's Paris pull-out would put Justin Trudeau, Canadian businesses on alert, critics warn Money New GDP numbers could be bad news for Canadians with debt Canada Who wins and who loses in Ontario's decision to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour?

Airlines use guarantees from export credit agencies to secure cheaper commercial funding, but the U.S. Ex-Im has been closed to deals valued at more than $10 million since July 2015 as some lawmakers blocked the appointment of a new board. During the height of the financial crisis, export-credit agencies supported as much as 30% of commercial aircraft deliveries. The total has fallen to less than 5% as Ex-Im remained on the sidelines and agencies in the U.K., Germany and France that back Airbus SE deals also halted new business because of a probe into alleged corruption. While President Donald Trump has in recent weeks reversed his prior opposition to the Ex-Im, sales supported by overseas agencies would provide additional options for Boeing customers that find it tough to secure commercial finance. The new pact with Italy's Sace SpA is the first between Boeing and an overseas export credit agency and provides a template for the company to secure similar deals with other countries that supply large parts of its jetliners, said Jon Byron, an aviation financier at Apple Bank. Sace's involvement reflects the role of Italian companies such as Leonardo SpA in providing parts for Boeing jets, which Sace said supported 12,000 jobs in the country. It sealed its first deal this month with guarantees for three 737-800 planes acquired by Turkey-based SunExpress. Boeing's best-selling jet has a list price of $98 million, though airlines typically secure large discounts. U.K. Export Finance, Britain's state-owned export agency that has long backed sales of Boeing jets powered by Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC engines, is expanding its offerings. Other countries with large Boeing suppliers -- such as Japan and South Korea -- are expected to follow the path taken by Italy, said bankers. Boeing declined to comment on any pending agreements with other agencies but said the Sace deal provided an alternative for some customers, even as the company continues to push for Ex-Im to be reopened for large deals. Airlines have traditionally been by far the largest user of Ex-Im guarantees and Boeing has led the lobbying battle to keep the bank open, claiming it is at a competitive disadvantage to Airbus without access to comparable U.S. financing. The aerospace giant has resorted to renting some jets to customers unable to secure commercial funding. Aerospace accounted for almost half of Ex-Im's business in fiscal 2015 and had been moving beyond commercial jetliners to back sales of satellites, rocket launches, business jets and helicopters, as well as aircraft repairs and other aviation services.

Source: IHS Markit/Patrick Allen Key Points A Swiss panel of experts has recommended procuring 30 new aircraft and a ground-based air defence system, at a total cost of approximately CHF8 billion (USD8.2 billion) The aircraft would replace Switzerland's current fleet of Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs and Boeing F/A-18C/D Hornets Two panels tasked by the Swiss Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection, and Sport (VBS), have reported on a number of potential options for the replacement of the country’s ageing Boeing F/A-18C/D Hornets and Northrop F-5E Tiger IIs to provide air defence and security for the country. A summary report covered the potential replacement requirements for the aircraft, as well as the role of ground-based air defence (GBAD) in protecting the country’s airspace. The panels concluded that four possible options were available for the Swiss government in looking for a replacement air defence capability: Option 1: Procurement of 55-70 new combat aircraft, in addition to a multi-layered GBAD system, which could cover an area of 45,000 sq km and protect 20 sites. Cost: CHF15-18 billion, with CHF4 billion allocated to the GBAD system. Option 2: Procurement of 40 new combat aircraft and a GBAD system, which would cover approximately 15,000 sq km, and the overall procurement would include the retention of some legacy weapons systems. Cost: CHF8 billion for aircraft, CHF1 billion for GBAD. Option 3: Procurement of 30 new combat aircraft and a multi-layered GBAD system covering 45,000 sq km , with existing GBAD resources being utilised against low-level air threats. Cost: CHF6 billion for aircraft, CHF2-2.5 billion for GBAD. Option 4: Procurement of 20 new combat aircraft and a GBAD system. Under this option, the service life on the Boeing F/A-18 C/D Hornet fleet would be extended to the early 2030s, and the GBAD system would cover 15,000 sq km and focus primarily on threats such as helicopters, unmanned aerial vehicles, and combat aircraft.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News Jet plans to take on lease up to 8 single aisle aircraft Shares0 Wed, 31 May 2017-08:08pm , PTI Private carrier Jet Airways today said it plans to lease 6-8 single aisle aircraft in the fleet this fiscal. The airline has already leased one B-737NG of these planes this fiscal and the rest will be inducted in the fleet by March next year, the Naresh Goyal-promoted carrier said. The city-headquartered airline currently has 103 aircraft in the fleet, with 69 of them B-737s. "Our new fleet of Boeing B737-Max will come from June next year onwards. This year, we plan to take anything between 6-8 aircraft from the open lease market and induct in the fleet, primarily B 737NGs," Jet Airways Chief Financial Officer and acting CEO, Amit Agarwal said during a post- earnings analysts call here. "We have already added one (such) aircraft into the fleet," he added. Je Airways had, in 2015, announced an order for 75 Boeing 737 Max aircraft as a part of its fleet replacement strategy. Delivery of these planes is to commence from next year. Jet Airways has reported nearly 95 per cent fall in consolidated net profit at Rs 23 crore in the three months ended March 2017 as higher fuel prices and lower fares took a toll on its bottomline. In fact, if the other incomes of Rs 310.45 crore, which include income from transfer of frequent flyer programme, sale and leaseback income and real estate income are removed, then its a net loss of Rs 287 crore. The airline plans to reduce debt by USD 200 million by this fiscal, Agarwal said, adding it was cut by Rs 1,900 crore in the last fiscal. "The company has continued to focus on reducing debt despite challenging situation in the market place. The company has been able to reduce its net debt by Rs 468 crore in Q4FY17 and over all by Rs 1,900 crore during the fiscal 2016-17," the official said. According to Jet Airways, its net debt on balancesheet stood at Rs 9035 crore or USD 1.4 billion at the end of March this year. Agarwal also said that the airline is evaluating its participation in the central Government's regional connectivity scheme, UDAN. "In the first round we had not bid for the RCS routes. In the second round, we will continue to evaluate whether it makes sense for us, especially when we are a network carrier," he said adding the airline has to asses as to see how it benefit its network.

Adravida Barata. JAKARTA: A Indonesian passenger plane carrying 146 people skidded off the runway as it landed in the eastern Papua region Wednesday, an official said, the latest mishap to hit the country’s aviation sector. No one was hurt after the Boeing aircraft operated by domestic carrier Sriwijaya Air overshot the wet runway at the airport in Manokwari city, said transport ministry spokesman J. Adravida Barata. TV footage showed people being evacuated from the plane, as it rested on its belly on grass next to the runway. The airport will be closed for several hours so that the plane can be removed, Barata added. It is just the latest of many accidents for Indonesia’s air transport sector. In February, a Sriwijaya plane carrying 192 people from China to Bali was forced to turn back after the crew realised one of its doors was not properly closed. In the same month, a passenger plane operated by Indonesian flag carrier Garuda skidded off the runway as it landed at the airport serving the city of Yogyakarta in heavy rain. The aviation sector has been booming in recent years as a growing middle class increasingly use planes to get around the vast archipelago, but critics say safety standards have not kept pace with the expansion.

Keene, 95, participated in 50 bombing missions and flew 100 missions transporting supplies over the Himalayas. Despite his lengthy resume, Keene got a chance to fly up in a Boeing B-29 one last time on April 29, according to The Orange County Register. 95-year-old Irvine veteran gets one more mission on a B-29 https://t.co/O3NpZjAQ05 pic.twitter.com/Z6xQPbRoZk— O.C.

VETERANS MAKE IT THEIR MISSION TO CLEAN UP HISTORIC CEMETERY Still, the flight didn’t go exactly as Keene would have preferred, his grandson told the Register. “He was very upset that he couldn’t fly the plane,” Grant Keene said. “Even told the pilot how many more (flying) hours he had than the guy.” The elder Keene received two Distinguished Unit Citations and multiple Air Medals during his time in the service. Going up in the B-29 allowed his family to get a glimpse into his experience as a pilot. “I always appreciated machinery and aircraft and I always loved my grandfather,” Grant Keene said. “For me it was a way to live through his experiences.” Advertisement Trending in US Portland pro-Trump, anti-Trump demonstrations converge, sparking violence Illinois man jumps into moving car to save a stranger's life: See the video North Carolina boat exploded after gas was pumped into fishing rod holder Disability attorney who stole $600M from the government disappears, FBI says Georgia authorities hunt for escaped inmate in Atlanta area Site Index Sections Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World Sports Weather On Air Tools Live Video Newsletters Alerts Podcasts Radio Apps & Products About Careers College Students Fox Around the World Advertise With Us New Terms of Use (What's New) New Privacy Policy Ad Choices Help Email Newsroom Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Follow Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram RSS Newsletters Fox News Back to Top This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. 2017 FOX News Network, LLC.

By Suzy Strutner United Airlines seriously can’t catch a break.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday proposed fining United $435,000 for operating 23 flights in 2014 with a Boeing 787 that the government alleged was not in airworthy condition. The news comes about seven weeks after the fateful incident in which officers dragged a passenger off a plane when he refused to give up his seat for a United employee. The FAA alleged that back in June 2014, United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on the Boeing aircraft but failed to perform a required inspection before returning the aircraft to service. A United spokesman said, “The safety of our customers and employees is our top priority.

(CAT) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ABT, BA and CAT stock are all ready to break higher May 30, 2017, 11:00 am EDT  |  By Johnson Research Group     The market has been able to maintain its low-volatility trend move higher as we get into what are typically the more quiet days of summer trading. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) are three of the large-cap companies on our technical radar screens today as all three companies are part of the market’s melt-up as stocks continue to push to new highs. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Abbott stock surged on Friday with relatively heavy volume, pushing the stock towards a bullish technical trigger. ABT shares were pushed forward on a break above the stock’s 50-day moving average. This initiated a technical buy signal and thus the heavy volume. The move came close to seeing Abbott shares break above their top Bollinger Band, a move that would have accelerated and extended the rally of this biotech company. ABT stock will run into a little resistance at $45 from past chart resistance and the fact that the top Bollinger Band still resides at this price. A move above $45 will give traders a boost of confidence that this market leader is ready to take it to the next level with a price target of $50 from there. Boeing Co (BA) The continued political headlines have caused many of the air and defense stocks to start seeing selling as doubt over the Administration’s agenda, including defense spending, grew unsteady. This was the fundamental reason for the weakness in Boeing stock through March and April. After this consolidation, BA shares are beginning to build momentum again as the stock is headed towards $200 with a head of steam building. Chart watchers have been eyeing $185 as historical resistance as the stock has been stopped in its ascent at that price a number of times. Now, the break above this price has traders increasing their volume trading on Boeing. From a short-term perspective, BA shares are likely to become overbought as they approach $200. That will combine with the round-numbered resistance that comes naturally from a price point like $200. Expect to see the stock pause due to these factors. However, Boeing should be able to make a momentum move through this price and continue its leadership role in the market. Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) Another group of companies that have been affected by doubt around the Trump administration’s ability to move their agenda forward are the heavy machinery industrial companies. Caterpillar shares declined more than 10% into a short-term bottom in May, giving investors an opportunity to buy this stock “on sale”.  CAT shares have regained their price of $105 and are wrestling with chart resistance in trying to break higher. Short interest in the latest report showed that the bears have been selling out of their positions, helping to fuel the rally higher. The short interest of 4.0 now indicates that we’ve probably seen the majority of short covering help the stock higher. Look for a little rest as the stock takes a breather before breaking above $105, but from there, the momentum will move this heavy equipment manufacturer higher towards the $115-mark. As of this writing, Johnson Research Group did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The FAA alleged that in June 2014, United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on the Boeing Co aircraft but failed to perform a required inspection before returning the aircraft to service. A United spokesman said, "The safety of our customers and employees is our top priority. We immediately took action after identifying the issue and are working closely with the FAA in their review."

On January 5, the apex court had given a direction on a petition filed by the Centre for Public Interest Litigation led by lawyer Prashant Bhushan. On Monday, the CBI registered three FIRs and a preliminary enquiry (PE) to go into the decisions taken by the Manmohan Singh government, including surrender of profitable routes to favour private airlines. The cases were registered against unidentified officials of Air India, Ministry of Civil Aviation and others under charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption. CBI sources said “all stakeholders” were under its scanner. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had recently said the government was open to strategic divestment of Air India, which had a debt of ₹50,000 crore and a market share of 14 per cent. Both Air India and Indian Airlines have been dogged by controversies since the Manmohan Singh government assumed office in 2004. In September 2005, Indian Airlines signed a ₹10,000-crore deal to acquire 43 Airbus A-320 family aircraft. Months later, Air India acquired 68 Boeing aircraft at over ₹35,000 crore. This too ran into controversy; government officials who had objected to such a large number of aircraft being ordered were reportedly shunted out before the deal was inked in January 2006. In 2007, the government completed the Air India-Indian Airlines merger into one airline under the name Air India. But problems soon emerged between the staff of the airlines. Before the merger, the airlines followed different human resource management policies. The then Civil Aviation Secretary told the Parliamentary Committee on Public Sector Undertakings that unless there was a merger in “the hearts of the people” the new airline will not work as intended. Under the Manmohan Singh government, the number of domestic carriers increased with IndiGo, Go Air, Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet taking to the skies. This too led to controversy as it was alleged that Indian Airlines was pressured to give up preferred times of operations in favour of private airlines. It was not uncommon for a flight by a private airline to depart on the same route a few minutes before an Indian Airlines’ flight. While the Manmohan Singh Government had three civil aviation Ministers, Praful Patel was Minister when Indian Airlines and Indian Airlines ordered the aircraft, the merger took place between the two airlines and many new airlines took off.

The CBI, as the federal police is known, registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry in the light of orders from the Supreme Court in January, according to the statement dated May 29 on its website. The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for 700 billion rupees ($10.8 billion), the CBI said. The acquisition allegedly caused a financial loss to the “already stressed” national carrier, it said. Tell a friend File image Air India spokesman Dhananjay Kumar and a spokeswoman for Boeing in India declined to comment. Praful Patel, who was India’s civil aviation minister at the time of the purchases, and an Airbus spokesman in India didn’t immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. In December 2005, India’s cabinet gave an approval to the national carrier to buy 68 aircraft from Boeing In 2006, state-owned Indian Airlines Ltd. inked an agreement to buy 43 planes from Airbus SE. While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation of India Ltd., which operated under the brand Air India. Allegations The CBI said it’s also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft “without due consideration.” Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favour of national and international private airlines, which caused a “huge loss” to the national carrier, it said. Read also: Gupta plane had 'official business' Air India’s aircraft deal was controversial at the time of the purchase itself. A day after the Mumbai-based carrier chose to buy 23 Boeing 777 aircraft and 27 Dreamliners, Nigel Harwood, Airbus’s then vice president of sales for India, said in an interview that the European company wasn’t given a “fair chance.” Air India denied that, saying it took “strong exception” to the claims. India is considering selling a majority stake in Air India to a strategic partner after a $3.6 billion bailout failed to turn around the loss making national carrier, Bloomberg News reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The proposal includes reviving Air India within five years of selling a 51 percent stake, they said.

Since then there have been many more to have claimed scores of lives. Here, we count down the 10 deadliest plane crashes of all time.   It’s worth noting at this point that 2017 is on its way to being one of the safest years in aviation history, with just 37 crashes and 117 fatalities so far, according to the Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives. Last year, too, was one of the safest. 10. American Airlines Flight 191 Date: May 25, 1979 Fatalities: 272 The DC-10 left Chicago O’Hare on the Friday afternoon of Memorial Day weekend only for its left engine to detach from its wing and fall off, rolling the plane in the air and sending it crashing to earth just a mile from the runway. The plane “burst into a pillar of flame and smoke that could be seen up to eight miles away,” the Chicago Tribune reported at the time. All 271 people on board and two on the ground were killed in what remains America’s worst aviation disaster. How to survive a plane crash The crash was found to be the result of a shortcut taken by removing the plane’s engines for maintenance, cracking an aluminium component which held the engine to the wing. 9. Iranian Air Force Ilyushun II-76 Date: February 19, 2003 Fatalities: 275 The official report into the military aircraft that crashed in the Sirach Mountains near Kerman in Iran found that bad weather, including high winds and fog, brought the plane down, killing all on board, all members of the Revolutionary Guards. The Aviation Safety Network classifies the crash as a Controlled Flight into Terrain. 8. Iran Air Flight 655 Date: July 3, 1988 Fatalities: 290 A controversial incident during tense times in the Gulf, owing to the Iran-Iraq War, the Airbus A300, a civilian airline, was shot down by surface-to-air missiles fired from US military cruiser USS Vincennes, killing all on board. The flight was in Iranian airspace, over Iranian territorial waters and on its usual flight path, yet, according to the US government, Vincennes mistook it for an F-14A Tomcat fighter plane. Crew on the American ship made 10 attempts to contact the Iran Air aircraft on military and civilian radio frequencies, with no response, before firing. Iranians mark the 21st anniversary of the downing of a Iranian passenger jet by the US Credit: 2009 AFP/ABOLFATH DAVARI In 1996 the US government and Iran reached a settlement at the International Court of Justice, the former expressing “deep regret over the loss of lives”, but not admitting legal liability or formally apologising. The US agreed to pay $213,103.45 compensation per passenger, about £346,000 in today’s valuation. 7. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Date: July 17, 2014 Fatalities: 298 A similar incident took place over eastern Ukraine when a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777-200 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down near the Russian border, likely by pro-Russian forces in control of the region during the War in Donbass between separatist insurgents and the Ukrainian government. All 298 on board died when the plane crashed into a field near Torez. Some airlines had already begun to avoid Ukrainian airspace owing to the Crimean crisis that began early in 2014, with the International Civil Aviation Organisation warning of a risk to passenger jets in the area, but not all carriers had changed their routes. A fire burns amid the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Credit: DOMINIQUE FAGET In September 2016, Dutch prosecutors concluded that the missile used to shoot down the plane had been transported into eastern Ukraine from Russia, adding that the launch vehicle returned across the border a day after the crash. The conflict in the region is ongoing. 6. Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 163 Date: August 19, 1980 Fatalities: 301 The death of all 301 passengers on board the Lockheed L-1011 on the runway at Riyadh is the world’s deadliest aviation accident not to involve a crash or mid-flight break up. The flight took off from the Saudi capital airport en route to Jeddah, only to return to Riyadh minutes later for an emergency landing after a fire started in the cargo department. However, when the plane landed, instead of initiating an emergency evacuation, the pilot taxied the aircraft back towards the airport, stopping on the runway for nearly three minutes. It then took some 23 minutes to access the aircraft once the engines were stopped. By the time the doors were opened all on board had died from smoke inhalation. The source of the fire is believed to have been two butane stoves in the cargo. An evacuation was never initiated. At a glance | 10 deadliest years in aviation history 5. Air India Flight 182 Date: June 23, 1985 Fatalities: 329 Deemed the deadliest terror attack involving a plane at the time, the Air India Boeing 747 crashed off the coast of Ireland en route from Toronto to Sahar International in India, after a bomb placed in the cargo hold by Sikh extremists Babbar Khalsa exploded over the Atlantic. The passenger responsible is believed to be 'M Singh' who checked himself onto the flight - along with a suitcase - but did not board. A second bomb intended to go off in tandem on another flight exploded early in the terminal building at Narita Airport, Japan. An investigation into the bombing of Flight 182 found numerous failings in the security processes in Canada that allowed the terrorist attack to be successful. A number of memorials commemorate those who died, in Canada and Ireland. 4. Turkish Airlines Flight 981 Date: March 3, 1974 Fatalities: 346 A design flaw on the Douglas DC-10 led an aircraft carrying 335 passengers and 11 crew to crash in the Ermenonville Forest north of Paris, after taking off from Orly Airport bound for London Heathrow, en route from Istanbul. Around 10 minutes after the plane took off from Orly, the rear left cargo door blew off owing to a problem with how the hatches latched shut - they could be forced shut by baggage handlers without the pins locking correctly - causing an explosive decompression in the cabin and severing cables linking the flight deck with the aircraft’s elevators, rudder and two engines. The aircraft pitched sharply nose-down and began picking up speed as the pilots lost control, before it crashed into trees travelling at around 490mph. In the wake of the accident, the locking mechanism on the cargo doors was redesigned. The crash remains the deadliest single-plane crash with no survivors, the worst on French soil and the second worst in Europe. Safest years in aviation history | Total deaths 3. Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision Date: November 12, 1996 Fatalities: 349 The world’s deadliest mid-air crash involved Saudia Flight 763 and Kazakhstan Airlines Flight 1907 over the city of Charkhi Dadri in northern India. The Saudia-operated Boeing 747 was bound for Dhahran from Delhi while the Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin II-76 was bound for Indira airport from Shymkent when they collided, killing 312 people on board the former and 37 on the latter. The crash occurred after the Ilyushin aircraft was cleared to descend to 15,000 feet, but then descended past that level to 14,500 feet while the 747 was ascending in the opposite direction. By the time the air traffic controller could warn of the proximity between the two aircraft it was too late. The tail of the Kazakhstan plane cut through the Saudia wing, causing the aircraft to go into a rapidly descending spiral, while the Ilyushin entered a gentler but still fast and uncontrolled descent. The captain of a passing US Air Force aircraft saw the crash and described a “a large cloud lit up with an orange glow”. A number of factors were found to have caused the crash, including the failure of the Kazakhstan Airlines pilot to follow the ATC instructions.

Japan Airlines Flight 123 Date: August 12, 1985 Fatalities: 520 The largest single aircraft accident in history was the crash of a Boeing 747 into Mount Takamagahara in central Japan. Just four survived when the aircraft spiralled out of control, its wing clipping a mountain ridge, before flipping and landing on its back, following an explosive decompression towards the rear of the plane, the result of a faulty repair job seven years earlier. Pilots were able to keep the plane in the air for 32 minutes after the mechancial failure - a time that has not been matched repeating the scenario in flight simulators since - before crashing into a mountain. Today, there is a shrine on the mountain dedicated to the crash, as well as a museum opened by the airlines that includes last letters and notes written by passengers to loved ones, to which all staff must visit. Though four passengers were able to survive, all female and sat in the middle of rows towards the rear of the aircraft, some concluded that more could have been saved had the wreckage been reached quicker by rescuers, and the offer of assistance from a nearby US base been accepted. A month after the crash a Japan Airlines maintenance official committed suicide, leaving a note, “I am atoning with my death”. 1. Tenerife Airport Disaster Date: March 27, 1977 Fatalities: 583 “The magnitude of the accident speaks for itself, but what makes it particularly unforgettable is the startling set of ironies and coincidences that preceded it,” wrote author and pilot Patrick Smith of the accident that took place at Tenerife North Airport (formerly Los Rodeos) 40 years ago, when two Boeing 747s, one belonging to KLM, the other to Pan Am, collided on a foggy runway. Los Rodeos air crash Neither of the two aircraft were supposed to be at Los Rodeos, both having been diverted away from Las Palmas on the nearby island of Gran Canaria, after it transpired that Canary Island separatists planted a bomb in the airport flower shop. The collision occurred when the KLM aircraft attempted to take-off without clearance while the Pan Am aircraft was still taxiing along the same runway, having missed its turning to leave. As the KLM 747 emerges from dense fog, having begun an errant take-off, owing to poor communication and confusion over radio contact, the pilot of the Pan Am was recorded as saying “There he is! Look at him! Goddamn, that son of a bitch is coming!” The KLM attempted to leapfrog the Pan Am but couldn’t and clipped the mid-section of the latter with its belly. There were no survivors on the KLM flight while 61 of the 396 on the Pan Am survived.

Irkut Corporation plans initial production of 20 planes a year, increasing to 70 by 2023. Read more Russia’s new civilian airliner takes off on maiden flight (PHOTOS, VIDEOS) The aircraft is expected to compete with the Boeing 737, Airbus A320 and China’s COMAC C919. “We plan to complete the testing in 2018. We are starting the second stage of flight testing for the PD-14 engine. The airliner will be powered only by Russian-made jet engines starting in spring 2019,” said Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin at the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. The first examples of the airliner are to be powered by Pratt & Whitney PW1400G engines, while those for the domestic market will use the new PD-14 engine. The Prime Minister ordered a rethink of the commercial prospects for the plane, as new contracts could boost the country’s economy. According to Rogozin, the issue will be discussed at a meeting of the aviation board. Rogozin said the new aircraft would be sold with a 'full circle contract' meaning the manufacturer will be responsible for the planes through delivery until they are operating on revenue earning flights. “As the МС-21 is ahead of its rivals, Boeing and Airbus. We are seeking to announce the price which will be much more competitive than the one set by US and European colleagues,” Rogozin said.

X Ryanair offers to take over Alitalia’s short-haul business Irish airline’s profits grew by 6 per cent last year to €1.3 billion Tue, May 30, 2017, 06:52 Updated: Tue, May 30, 2017, 10:03 Barry O'Halloran Ryanair flew 120 million passengers in the course of its financial year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. Photograph: Reuters         Ryanair plans to offer Alitalia a deal that would see the airline effectively take over the bankrupt Italian carrier’s short-haul business while also selling its long-haul flights on its website. The Irish airline said on Tuesday that it grew profits after tax by 6 per cent to €1.316 billion in the 12 months to March 31st and announced plans to return €600 million to investors through a share buy-back scheme. According to chief commerical officer, David O’Brien, Ryanair is planning to propose a tranfser deal to the government-appointed commissioners s charged with saving Alitalia. Under its terms, Ryanair would take over much of Alitalia’s short-haul business and feed passengers to its long-distance network. “We’d even sell their long-haul flights on our website,” Mr O’Brien added. While analysts were not sure that the Italians would accept the deal they suggested that government efforts to save the flag carrier could deliver an outcome that would suit Ryanair. “They cannot keep it on life support but keeping it as a long-haul focused airline, which Ryanair would like, is an option,” one said. Ryanair has a bigger share of the Italian market than its troubled rival. Its operations there flew 36 million passengers in the 12 months ended on March 31st. Chief executive Michael O’Leary confirmed that Ryanair was in talks with Boeing to add “selectively” to the orders it has with the American aircraft manufacturer. The airline took delivery of 52 Boeing 737s in its 2017 financial year. Ryanair flew 120 million passengers during the financial year, an increase of 13 per cent on 2016. It grew revenues by 2 per cent to €6.54 billion. It plans to buy back €600 million worth of equities from investors between this week and October, bringing total returns to shareholders since 2008 to €5.4 billion. Mr O’Leary said Ryanair believed that profits this year could rise 8 per cent to between €1.4 billion and €1.45 billion, subject to a range of uncertainties. “Investors should be wary of the risk of negative Brexit developments, or any repeat of last year’s security events at European cities, which could damage consumer confidence, close-in bookings, and this full-year-18 guidance,” he cautioned.       Topics: David O Brien Michael O Leary Irish Stock Exchange Alitalia Boeing Ryanair Europe United Kingdom Read More Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production BA left with financial headache and battered reputation Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

The CBI, as the federal police is known, registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry in the light of orders from the Supreme Court in January, according to the statement dated May 29 on its website. The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for 700 billion rupees ($10.8 billion), the CBI said.

While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation of India Ltd., which operated under the brand Air India. Allegations The CBI said it’s also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft “without due consideration.” Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favour of national and international private airlines, which caused a “huge loss” to the national carrier, it said.

If the U.K. government doesn't strike any sort of deal with the European Union regarding flying regulations, airlines will have to stop their activities in the country, Neil Sorahan, the chief financial officer of budget airline Ryanair told CNBC. "We need to get some kind of clarity on whether the U.K. is going to stay in the open skies (agreement). It looks like they're not and if they don't then we need to see some movements made in relation to negotiating bilateral agreements," he said. "If these bilateral agreements are not negotiated by October 2018 then the chances of being rectified by March 2019 are very slim, which means there's a distinct possibility that there could be no flights in and out the U.K. for a period of time … days, weeks, months, we don't know," Sorahan warned. show chapters Confident in our IT systems, says Ryanair CFO    Tuesday, 30 May 2017 | 1:43 AM ET | 03:07 The EU's open skies agreement allows for all transatlantic routes to be opened up to EU and U.S. airline firms. Ryanair has been one of the most vocal firms against the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union. The Irish airline operates widely across the continent. Its chief executive officer, Michael O'Leary, has said that the airline is "pivoting" its operations towards Europe in the aftermath of Brexit. The U.K.'s Department for Transport has previously replied to these concerns in February. It said it was committed to getting the "best deal possible" from EU exit negotiations. "We will work closely with the international aviation community to ensure that this global industry continues to be a major success story for the U.K. economy," the department said, according to the Financial Times. Sorahan from Ryanair said: "Our biggest concern is that we have no certainty as we roll into this time next year and we are in a position where we're in 12 months we have to start loading our summer schedule for 2019." Meanwhile over the weekend, British Airways saw massive disruption after its IT systems collapsed. However, Sorahan said that Ryanair has invested "an awful lot of money" into its IT systems and it is confident on their reliability. "What happened to them appears to have been a hardware which was impacted by a power surge. We have our critical data over a number of data centers, so if one goes down, it would fall over to the other centers," Sorahan explained. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

X Ryanair offers to take over Alitalia’s short-haul business Irish airline’s profits grew by 6 per cent last year to €1.3 billion Tue, May 30, 2017, 06:52 Updated: Tue, May 30, 2017, 10:03 Barry O'Halloran Ryanair flew 120 million passengers in the course of its financial year, up 13 per cent on the previous year. Photograph: Reuters         Ryanair plans to offer Alitalia a deal that would see the airline effectively take over the bankrupt Italian carrier’s short-haul business while also selling its long-haul flights on its website. The Irish airline said on Tuesday that it grew profits after tax by 6 per cent to €1.316 billion in the 12 months to March 31st and announced plans to return €600 million to investors through a share buy-back scheme. According to chief commerical officer, David O’Brien, Ryanair is planning to propose a tranfser deal to the government-appointed commissioners s charged with saving Alitalia. Under its terms, Ryanair would take over much of Alitalia’s short-haul business and feed passengers to its long-distance network. “We’d even sell their long-haul flights on our website,” Mr O’Brien added. While analysts were not sure that the Italians would accept the deal they suggested that government efforts to save the flag carrier could deliver an outcome that would suit Ryanair. “They cannot keep it on life support but keeping it as a long-haul focused airline, which Ryanair would like, is an option,” one said. Ryanair has a bigger share of the Italian market than its troubled rival. Its operations there flew 36 million passengers in the 12 months ended on March 31st. Chief executive Michael O’Leary confirmed that Ryanair was in talks with Boeing to add “selectively” to the orders it has with the American aircraft manufacturer. The airline took delivery of 52 Boeing 737s in its 2017 financial year. Ryanair flew 120 million passengers during the financial year, an increase of 13 per cent on 2016. It grew revenues by 2 per cent to €6.54 billion. It plans to buy back €600 million worth of equities from investors between this week and October, bringing total returns to shareholders since 2008 to €5.4 billion. Mr O’Leary said Ryanair believed that profits this year could rise 8 per cent to between €1.4 billion and €1.45 billion, subject to a range of uncertainties. “Investors should be wary of the risk of negative Brexit developments, or any repeat of last year’s security events at European cities, which could damage consumer confidence, close-in bookings, and this full-year-18 guidance,” he cautioned.       Topics: David O Brien Michael O Leary Irish Stock Exchange Alitalia Boeing Ryanair Europe United Kingdom Read More Steering parts shortage stalls BMW car production BA left with financial headache and battered reputation Russia squares up to Boeing and Airbus with maiden flight of jet Eight British Airways flights from Dublin cancelled over IT failure Knock Airport leads the way in Irish passenger growth BA chief says he will not resign over IT problems Road Warrior: Alitalia bid deadline ICG sells 21-year-old vessel for €45m What now for DAA as Toland checks out three years early?

The CBI, as the federal law agency is known, registered three cases and one preliminary inquiry in light of orders from the Supreme Court in January, according to the statement dated May 29 on its website. The cases include investigating allegations regarding buying planes for 700 billion rupees (S$15.02 billion), the CBI said. The acquisition allegedly caused a financial loss to the "already stressed" national carrier, it said. Air India spokesman Dhananjay Kumar and a spokeswoman for Boeing in India declined to comment. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Praful Patel, who was India's civil aviation minister at the time of the purchases, and an Airbus spokesman in India didn't immediately respond to phone calls seeking comment. In December 2005, India's Cabinet gave an approval to the national carrier to buy 68 aircraft from Boeing Co. In 2006, state-owned Indian Airlines Ltd. inked an agreement to buy 43 planes from Airbus SE. While the aircraft orders were made separately, the two national carriers were later merged by 2007 into the National Aviation Co of India., which operated under the brand Air India. The CBI said it's also investigating allegations of leasing of a large number of aircraft "without due consideration". Also part of the probe will be allegations about giving up profit-making routes by Air India in favour of national and international private airlines, which caused a "huge loss" to the national carrier, it said. Air India's aircraft deal was controversial at the time of the purchase itself. A day after the Mumbai-based carrier chose to buy 23 Boeing 777 aircraft and 27 Dreamliners, Nigel Harwood, Airbus's then vice president of sales for India, said in an interview that the European company wasn't given a "fair chance". Air India denied that, saying it took "strong exception" to the claims. India is considering selling a majority stake in Air India to a strategic partner after a US$3.6 billion (S$5 billion) bailout failed to turn around the loss making national carrier, Bloomberg News reported in February, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The proposal includes reviving Air India within five years of selling a 51 per cent stake, they said.

In a surprise statement, manufacturer Irkut Corporation nd its state-controlled parent company United Aircraft Corporation (UAC) said an MS-21-300 model had successfully completed a 30-minute flight at a height of 1,000 metres and travelling at 300 kilometres an hour. Squeezed by Western sanctions over its role in the Ukraine crisis, Russia is trying to rejuvenate domestic industrial production to make the country less dependant on foreign firms. The test flight, which was not announced to media beforehand, comes just three weeks after China staged the maiden flight of its new C919 passenger jet, highlighting the growing competition to industry heavyweights Boeing Co and Airbus SAS, plane-making division of Airbus SE. Russian officials have said the MS-21 is superior to its Western-made counterparts in many respects and will be snapped up by both Russian and foreign carriers, but Western analysts say both Russia and China face a huge challenge to shatter the transatlantic airplane duopoly. "The flight mission has been completed. The flight was fine, there were no observations which will prevent further testing," test pilot Oleg Kononenko was quoted as saying. Western aviation sources however expressed surprise at the flight's brevity and relatively low altitude compared with recent 3-4 hour debuts of North American and European models. "It suggests they either have severe limitations or may have had something happen and decided to come back," said a Western flight test engineer, speaking on condition of anonymity. A Western jetmaking source called it a "genteel flight". A UAC spokesman said the flight had been long enough to test everything that needed checking in the air. Russia has fought hard to shake off its Soviet reputation for old and creaking aircraft flown by inexperienced crews. Flag carrier Aeroflot last year earned its fourth star from independent ratings website Skytrax, ranking it alongside major European and Middle Eastern competitors and ahead of big US carriers such as Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. President Vladimir Putin called Irkut general director Oleg Demchenko to congratulate him and his employees with what the Kremlin called "a significant event". The twin-engine MS-21 will be built in two variants: the MS-21-300 which will have 160-211 seats, and the later MS-21-200 which will have 130-165 seats. It is sometimes referred to as the MC-21 when using the Russian name and Cyrillic letters. Production is expected to start in the next two years and state media have said numerous contracts with domestic and foreign carriers have already been agreed. Irkut said it so far had "firm orders" for 175 planes. America's Boeing and Europe's Airbus remain far ahead of their Chinese and Russian rivals, with bigger sales books and more advanced technical know-how. But the new plane could win sales in Russia and some eastern European and Asian countries, industry analysts say, with buyers attracted by its lower running costs. Irkut said operational costs for its new plane will be up to 15% cheaper than current generation aircraft. With a range of up to 6,000 kilometres, the MS-21 will be competing against the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft which currently dominate the medium-range narrow-body market. Both companies recently upgraded those families to achieve comparable 15% operational savings compared to previous versions. State defence conglomerate Rostec, which is headed by close Putin ally Sergei Chemezov, said it had agreed to purchase 85 aircraft. "At least 50 of them will be leased to Aeroflot,'' Rostec said, which currently operates a fleet dominated by narrow-body Airbus models, including 70 A320s. UAC president Yury Slyusar said he estimated global demand for the new MS-21 models at around 15,000 aircraft over the next 20 years. "I'm sure the airlines will appreciate our new aircraft," he said.

  News Magazines Events Industry Calendar Products   Home >> News: May 31st, 2017 >> Story Satnews Daily May 31st, 2017 It's Time to Roll Out and Get Ready for Arianespace’s Launch Thursday of Two Satellites Ariane 5 rolls out for Arianespace’s heavy-lift mission with ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B All is ready for Thursday's launch, and Arianespace has released the following information. The Ariane 5 for Arianespace’s sixth mission overall in 2017 is now at the launch zone, ready for a June 1 evening departure from the Spaceport in French Guiana to inject the dual-satellite payload of ViaSat-2 and EUTELSAT 172B into geostationary transfer orbit. Installed atop one of two mobile launch tables in service for Ariane 5, the heavy-lift vehicle was transferred today from the Spaceport’s Final Assembly Building to its ELA-3 launch zone. ViaSat-2 will be released first during tomorrow’s nearly 42-minute mission, which is designated Flight VA237 in Arianespace’s launcher family numbering system. The spacecraft, with a liftoff mass estimated at 6,418 kg., will be operated from an orbital position of 70 degrees West by ViaSat, a global broadband services and technology company based in Carlsbad, California.   Boeing and Airbus-built satellite payloads for Flight VA237    The Boeing-built ViaSat-2 relay platform is designed to bring considerable improvements in terms of speed, lower costs and extended broadband coverage within its footprint, which includes North and Central America, plus the Caribbean, northern South America, and the aeronautical and maritime routes in the Atlantic Ocean between North America and Europe. Completing Flight VA237 will be EUTELSAT 172B’s deployment by Ariane 5. This spacecraft will join the fleet of Paris-based Eutelsat, a leading satellite operator in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and has a liftoff mass set at 3,551 kg. EUTELSAT 172B is to be located at an orbital position of 172 deg. East for Asia-Pacific reach over land and sea from Alaska to Australia, delivering increased capacity for fast-growing applications that include in-flight and maritime connectivity, cellular backhaul, corporate networks, video distribution and government services. The spacecraft was built by Airbus as the initial all-electric telecommunications satellite produced in Europe—and the first of its type to be orbited by Ariane 5.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Airline Stock Roundup: British Airways’ IT Glitch, Ryanair’s FY17 Results, Laptop Ban Update &amp; More Shutterstock photo The past week saw U.K.-based carrier British Airways suffering a major IT system failure that resulted in the cancellation of flights and untold miseries to passengers. Also, updates (albeit of a mixed nature) on the laptop ban extension on U.S. flights grabbed headlines. Delta Air Lines DAL also made news in the past week, that was a day short of trading owing to the Memorial Day holiday on May 29, as it aims to ease U.S.-Mexico air travel through its association with Aeromexico. On the earnings front, European low-cost carrier Ryanair Holdings plc RYAAY reported modest results in fiscal 2017 (ended Mar 31, 2017) and issued a cautious outlook for fiscal 2018. Transportation – Airline Industry 5YR % Return Transportation – Airline Industry 5YR % Return (Read the last Airline Stock Roundup here ). Recap of the Past Week’s Most Important Stories 1. Delta strengthened its long-standing partnership with Mexico’s largest airline Grupo Aeromexico by implementing a joint cooperation agreement (JCA) to operate flights connecting the U.S. and Mexico. As part of the JCA, the carriers recently stated their intention to launch five flights targeting new markets. Apart from adding new routes, the carriers aim to increase the frequency of flights and use more modern aircrafts in four and two markets, respectively. The measures aimed at facilitating travel between the nations (likely to be implemented as early as this fall) are subject to government clearance. (Read more: Delta Air Lines & Aeromexico Aim to Ease US-Mexico Travel ). 2. Earlier this week, it was reported that the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly had said in an interview that passengers may be banned from carrying laptops in all flights to/from the U.S. However, a Politico report on May 30 stated that the US had decided against banning laptops from the cabins of US bound planes from Europe as of now. 3. Ryanair Holdings reported financial and operating numbers with net profit for fiscal 2017 up 6% year over year at €1,316 million despite a 13% decline in average airfares. The top line expanded 2% to €6,648 million on the back of a 13% rise in traffic to 120 million. Lower costs aided the bottom line. Moreover, load factor increased 100 basis points to 94%. The customer friendly „Always Getting Better (AGB)” program aided results. The carrier issued a „cautious” outlook for fiscal 2018 following anticipation of negative Brexit-related developments and repetition of terror attacks. Average fares are expected to decline in the band of 5-7% in fiscal 2018. Net profit for fiscal 2018 is expected in the band of €1.4-€1.45 billion, up approximately 8%. The low-cost carrier expects ancillary sales to account for 30% of the top line by Mar 2020. The company is looking to expedite the growth of its fleet by including more Boeing jets. Ryanair sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . 4. Passengers at British Airways had to undergo undue harassments as the largest carrier in the U.K. (in terms of on fleet size) encountered a major IT system failure, resulting in cancellation of multiple flights. The global disruption was apparently caused by ” an exceptional power surge, ” which caused the IT system to collapse resulting in the catastrophe. Whatever be the reason, the meltdown affected travel plans of thousands of passengers with chaos at Heathrow and Gatwick airports. The airline, which is investigating the incident, said that it will compensate the concerned passengers. However, costs on that front may exceed the £100 million mark. 5. According to a Bloomberg report , American Airlines Group AAL intends to curtail the legroom for passengers on its newest Boeing 737 planes. By trimming the space between rows more seats/passengers can be accommodated, thereby allowing it to sell more low-priced tickets. It is widely believed that the move is aimed at countering the threat posed by low-cost carriers like Spirit Airlines SAVE and JetBlue Airways Corp. JBLU . Performance The following table shows the price movement of the major airline players over the past week and during the last 6 months.  Company Past Week Last 6 months HA -0.90% -3.51% UAL 0.62% 14.94% GOL 7.7% 57% DAL 0.8% 1.83% JBLU 0.3% 12% AAL 4% 3.3% SAVE 0.21% -4.5% LUV 0.05% 27.6% CPA 1.13% 25.33% ALK -0.22% 4.3% The table above shows that majority of airline stocks traded in the green over the past week resulting in the NYSE ARCA Airline Index gaining almost 1% $113.33 over the period. The uptick was primarily driven by the decline in oil prices following the extension of supply curbs by top producers led by OPEC. The fall in oil prices naturally boosted airline stocks. Over the course of six months, the NYSE ARCA Airline Index appreciated 8.23%. Shares of GOL Linhas GOL appreciated the most (57%). What’s Next in the Airline Space? Focus will remain on May traffic reports from the likes of Delta and Hawaiian Holdings HA in the coming days. Investors would also await further updates on the laptop ban.

Li made the call during his talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin. He is on an official visit to Germany for an annual meeting between the two heads of government, a mechanism that has been in place since 2004. The twin-engine C919 made a maiden flight on May 5 in Shanghai with five crew members on board but no passengers. The success makes China the fourth jumbo jet producer after the United States, Western Europe and Russia. With a standard range of 4,075 km, the narrow-body jet is comparable with updated Airbus 320 and Boeing's new generation 737 planes, signaling the country's entry into the global aviation market. China has taken pride in developing the homegrown jumbo jet, regarding it as a symbol of national strength. In 2007, the State Council approved plans to develop a large passenger jet. In November 2015, the first C919 jet rolled off the assembly line. More than 200,000 technicians worked on the project. A total of 23 foreign and domestic customers, including China's national carrier Air China, had placed orders for 570 aircraft as of May 5, according to COMAC, the manufacturer. COMAC has to seek airworthiness certificates from domestic and foreign aviation safety regulators before making its first deliveries slated for around 2019. Airworthiness is the measure of an aircraft's suitability for safe flight. | PRINT | RSS SINA English is the English-language destination for news and information about China.

(3 letters) Pay attention. And when someone speaks, listen. It could save a life. Those were the points that Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg drove home when he delivered the keynote address at the Shaka Franklin Foundation’s 27th Love Our Children Luncheon. The Shaka Franklin Foundation is a nonprofit organization dedicated to suicide intervention and prevention. Like Groberg, founder Les Franklin, who lost two sons to suicide, knows just how important it is to lend an ear and get people the help they need before they take their own life. On Aug. 8, 2012, Groberg, who is now Boeing’s director of veteran outreach, was serving as a personal security detachment commander for Task Force Mountain Warrior in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, responsible for the safety of 28 coalition and Afghan National Army personnel as they traveled on foot to the provincial governor’s compound.

Instinctively, Groberg knew it was a suicide bomber so he sprinted toward the man and wrestled him to the ground. The bomb he was carrying detonated, killing four members of Groberg’s party. Groberg himself suffered life-threatening injuries and underwent 33 surgeries in the 36 months he spent recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He admitted that thoughts of suicide crossed his mind as he lay in that hospital bed. A high school track star whose dreams of competing in the Olympics were dashed after losing half of his calf muscle and sustaining a mild traumatic brain injury in the incident, Groberg advised those attending the event held at the Hyatt Regency Tech Center to not lose hope, no matter the situation. “Life is precious,” he said. “Find the strength to live and open up to others to let them in to help. Share your story and trust loved ones and those who care.” Groberg followed his own advice, and in November 2015, then-President Barack Obama presented him with the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military honor for valor in combat. The luncheon, which raised $165,000, also included the presentation of several scholarships. Raul Cardenas, vice chancellor of student affairs at the University of Colorado Denver, accepted a check for $25,000 to add to the Shaka Franklin Foundation for Youth  Scholarship Fund; Dan Ackeren accepted a $15,000 check for the Shaka Franklin Foundation for Youth Athletic Scholarship at the University of Denver; and military veteran Doug Hernandez was given a $2,500 scholarship to help him complete his senior year at CU Denver, after which he will enroll in medical school. Lida Citroen, an international branding specialist, introduced Groberg to an audience that included Matt Vogl, (cq) director of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus National Behavioral Innovation Center; Karic (cq) Roberts, who served 15 years in the U.S. Army as a combat engineer; and Roger Fink, president of FinkInk and the event’s master of ceremonies.

Pavel Golovkin AP Politics & Government May 31, 2017 4:55 PM Trump expects Saudi Arabia to invest billions of dollars in the U.S. By Anita Kumar akumar@mcclatchydc.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA Saudi Arabia’s young deputy crown prince had a message for America’s new president at their first meeting in March: The kingdom wanted to invest billions of dollars in U.S. companies, creating thousands of jobs. It was just what Donald Trump, the U.S.’s first billionaire president, wanted to hear after winning the White House, in part on his background as a businessman and his pledge to make some deals, according to people familiar with the meeting who are not authorized to speak publicly about it. While Trump repeatedly clashed with the democratically elected leaders of U.S. allies in Europe on his first overseas trip as president, he got along famously with his counterparts in the Middle East, especially in Saudi Arabia, where they treated him like royalty. Here’s one big reason why: Mohammad bin Salman, the influential 31-year-old prince who is helping to run the nation alongside his father, King Salman. Among the deputy crown prince’s plans is the sell-off of a piece of state-owned oil giant Aramco, with the proceeds to be invested in companies at home and abroad, including the United States. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman discusses US-Saudi strategic partnership & global security with @POTUS Trump #RiyadhSummit pic.twitter.com/yA4ItTwaIy— RiyadhSummit (@riyadhsummit) May 20, 2017 “It helps if you have a leader in the White House and the administration receptive to the situation in Saudi Arabia and willing to continue strengthening the ties,” said well-known Saudi economist Ihsan Buhulaiga. “That, of course, is a great help. But also this country thinks highly of the United States and the president of the United States.” The U.S. and Saudi Arabia struck a series of deals totaling more than $350 billion over 10 years during the president’s recent two-day visit to Riyadh, which Trump hopes is the first step toward an even bigger investment when Aramco stock is offered to the public. The two countries signed agreements – including some prospective ones – involving a variety of industries, such as technology, medical equipment, chemicals and real estate, with $110 billion on defense alone. Some of the companies involved are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Blackstone Raytheon, General Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, General Electric and Dow, according to a White House document. But there’s no guarantee any of the agreements will create jobs in the U.S. or, in some cases, that they will happen at all. In Riyadh, many Saudis worry that the kingdom will give too much money to the United States after Trump repeatedly said before he was president that Saudi Arabia failed to pay its fair share for U.S. defense assistance. The issue dominated social media during the president’s visit, with images like one where Trump slips his hand into King Salman’s pocket to take money as he hugs him. If Saudi Arabia, which has been making one billion dollars a day from oil, wants our help and protection, they must pay dearly! NO FREEBIES.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2015 I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2014 “In a state where we are suffering from our economy, people are worried about what we are going to pay,” said Aziza al Yousef, 60, a human rights activist, during an interview at her home in Riyadh. “What is he going to make us pay for? Are we getting anything from these deals or not? Is he really doing anything for us or just come here for us to pay a penalty?” But John Sfakianakis, director of economics at the Gulf Research Center in Riyadh and former adviser to the Saudi Arabian government, said there were “huge opportunities” for U.S. companies and Saudi Arabia. “For decades, Saudi private investors have invested in U.S. businesses and real estate,” Sfakianakis said. “Saudi has helped through these investments and buying of U.S. products keep thousands of jobs in America.” President Donald Trump’s nine-day maiden foreign trip began in Riyadh and included stops in Israel, the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily. Prince Mohammad, who serves as chairman of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs and as defense minister, introduced a plan that calls for selling a stake of less than 5 percent of the state-owned oil company, potentially creating the world’s biggest publicly traded firm. The son of King Salman and his third wife, known in Saudi Arabia simply as MBS, quickly became an aide to his father. His influence had already ballooned as his father rose in the government and made young MBS his private adviser. At his visit to the White House in March, Prince Mohammad told Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, about his idea, part of Saudi Vision 2030, which is well known and frequently mentioned in the capital city. Signs touting Saudi Vision 2030 are all over Riyadh, including the airport. “The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as 1 million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia,” according to a White House readout of the March visit. So far, there’s no evidence that Saudi Arabia could meet such a lofty goal of 1 million jobs. The move is designed to lessen Saudi Arabia’s dependence on oil. The government has had to take a series of cost-cutting measures in recent months as the cost of oil has dropped. Prince Mohammad’s plan was inspired in part by Abu Dhabi’s national wealth fund, Mubadala Development Co., experts say. The proceeds, estimated to be as much as $2 trillion, would be injected into the Public Investment Fund, a three-decade-old fund that has until recently mostly invested in domestic opportunities. But some are worried about the consequences of a series of lawsuits filed by more than 800 families of 9/11 victims. “The PIF has provided very little information about its strategy or investments to date, which has created some concern among local businesses and technocratic elites,” said Steffen Hertog, a Middle East expert who teaches at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Saudi Arabia has invested more than $114 billion in U.S. Treasury bills. Jean-Francois Seznec, a political scientist specializing in business and finance in the Middle East who teaches at the Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University, said Saudis were apprehensive about working with the U.S. amid the lawsuits, which could cost the kingdom a significant amount of money. The Saudi government is lobbying Trump and Congress to repeal the contentious 2016 law that allows relatives of 9/11 victims to sue the kingdom for their deaths. “There is a lot of weariness,” he said. Prince Mohammad wants the Public Investment Fund to be split between domestic and international investments. Last year, it invested $3.5 billion in the online taxi company Uber. During Trump’s visit, Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity manager, and the Public Investment Fund announced plans to invest $40 billion in infrastructure projects, mainly in the United States.　　　 Saudi leaders said the kingdom had much to offer when it came to economic development but the issue was often overshadowed by the headline-grabbing discussion on how to combat terrorism. “Our region, unfortunately, people focus on the problems, the terrorist issue, the wars in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, but there are issues that have been underreported – that’s the innovation and the willingness of our people to invest in their own future –that doesn’t really get that much attention,” said a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation who is not authorized to speak publicly.

The US military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the US mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km, but some are designed to travel 10,000 km or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office in January said that US ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States. — Reuters SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleGains in certain sectors send Saudi stocks higher Next articleAramco in joint venture with 3 other firms for building of maritime yard in Ras Al-Khair Mohammed Ahmed Al Aidroos RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince condole UK Premier King orders advance payment of month’s salaries on Ramadan 23 Saudi courts to force Saudi Oger to pay employees’ entitlements NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply June 2017 S M T W T F S « May       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,643,654FansLike 44,205FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts King, Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince condole UK Premier June 5, 2017 King orders advance payment of month’s salaries on Ramadan 23 June 5, 2017 Saudi courts to force Saudi Oger to pay employees’ entitlements June 5, 2017 Saudi, Egyptian FMs discuss anti-terror cooperation June 5, 2017 King receives dean of diplomatic corps and heads of groups June 5, 2017 Archives June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Among the deputy crown prince’s plans is the sell-off of a piece of state-owned oil giant Aramco, with the proceeds to be invested in companies at home and abroad, including the United States. Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman discusses US-Saudi strategic partnership & global security with @POTUS Trump #RiyadhSummit pic.twitter.com/yA4ItTwaIy— RiyadhSummit (@riyadhsummit) May 20, 2017 “It helps if you have a leader in the White House and the administration receptive to the situation in Saudi Arabia and willing to continue strengthening the ties,” said well-known Saudi economist Ihsan Buhulaiga. “That, of course, is a great help. But also this country thinks highly of the United States and the president of the United States.” The U.S. and Saudi Arabia struck a series of deals totaling more than $350 billion over 10 years during the president’s recent two-day visit to Riyadh, which Trump hopes is the first step toward an even bigger investment when Aramco stock is offered to the public. The two countries signed agreements – including some prospective ones – involving a variety of industries, such as technology, medical equipment, chemicals and real estate, with $110 billion on defense alone. Some of the companies involved are Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Blackstone Raytheon, General Dynamics, Exxon Mobil, General Electric and Dow, according to a White House document. But there’s no guarantee any of the agreements will create jobs in the U.S. or, in some cases, that they will happen at all. In Riyadh, many Saudis worry that the kingdom will give too much money to the United States after Trump repeatedly said before he was president that Saudi Arabia failed to pay its fair share for U.S. defense assistance. The issue dominated social media during the president’s visit, with images like one where Trump slips his hand into King Salman’s pocket to take money as he hugs him. If Saudi Arabia, which has been making one billion dollars a day from oil, wants our help and protection, they must pay dearly! NO FREEBIES.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 26, 2015 I just want to know how much is Saudi Arabia and others who we are helping willing to pay for our saving from total extinction. Pay up now!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2014 “In a state where we are suffering from our economy, people are worried about what we are going to pay,” said Aziza al Yousef, 60, a human rights activist, during an interview at her home in Riyadh. “What is he going to make us pay for? Are we getting anything from these deals or not? Is he really doing anything for us or just come here for us to pay a penalty?” But John Sfakianakis, director of economics at the Gulf Research Center in Riyadh and former adviser to the Saudi Arabian government, said there were “huge opportunities” for U.S. companies and Saudi Arabia. “For decades, Saudi private investors have invested in U.S. businesses and real estate,” Sfakianakis said. “Saudi has helped through these investments and buying of U.S. products keep thousands of jobs in America.” President Donald Trump’s nine-day maiden foreign trip began in Riyadh and included stops in Israel, the Vatican, Brussels and Sicily. Prince Mohammad, who serves as chairman of the Council for Economic and Development Affairs and as defense minister, introduced a plan that calls for selling a stake of less than 5 percent of the state-owned oil company, potentially creating the world’s biggest publicly traded firm. The son of King Salman and his third wife, known in Saudi Arabia simply as MBS, quickly became an aide to his father. His influence had already ballooned as his father rose in the government and made young MBS his private adviser. At his visit to the White House in March, Prince Mohammad told Trump and his son-in-law and top adviser, Jared Kushner, about his idea, part of Saudi Vision 2030, which is well known and frequently mentioned in the capital city. Signs touting Saudi Vision 2030 are all over Riyadh, including the airport. “The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as 1 million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia,” according to a White House readout of the March visit. So far, there’s no evidence that Saudi Arabia could meet such a lofty goal of 1 million jobs. The move is designed to lessen Saudi Arabia’s dependence on oil. The government has had to take a series of cost-cutting measures in recent months as the cost of oil has dropped. Prince Mohammad’s plan was inspired in part by Abu Dhabi’s national wealth fund, Mubadala Development Co., experts say. The proceeds, estimated to be as much as $2 trillion, would be injected into the Public Investment Fund, a three-decade-old fund that has until recently mostly invested in domestic opportunities. But some are worried about the consequences of a series of lawsuits filed by more than 800 families of 9/11 victims. “The PIF has provided very little information about its strategy or investments to date, which has created some concern among local businesses and technocratic elites,” said Steffen Hertog, a Middle East expert who teaches at the London School of Economics and Political Science. Saudi Arabia has invested more than $114 billion in U.S. Treasury bills. Jean-Francois Seznec, a political scientist specializing in business and finance in the Middle East who teaches at the Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University, said Saudis were apprehensive about working with the U.S. amid the lawsuits, which could cost the kingdom a significant amount of money. The Saudi government is lobbying Trump and Congress to repeal the contentious 2016 law that allows relatives of 9/11 victims to sue the kingdom for their deaths. “There is a lot of weariness,” he said. Prince Mohammad wants the Public Investment Fund to be split between domestic and international investments. Last year, it invested $3.5 billion in the online taxi company Uber. During Trump’s visit, Blackstone, the world’s biggest private equity manager, and the Public Investment Fund announced plans to invest $40 billion in infrastructure projects, mainly in the United States.　　　 Saudi leaders said the kingdom had much to offer when it came to economic development but the issue was often overshadowed by the headline-grabbing discussion on how to combat terrorism. “Our region, unfortunately, people focus on the problems, the terrorist issue, the wars in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, but there are issues that have been underreported – that’s the innovation and the willingness of our people to invest in their own future –that doesn’t really get that much attention,” said a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation who is not authorized to speak publicly.

The American appliance giant on Wednesday filed a petition with the US International Trade Commission against Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics. The so-called safeguard petition is meant to provide help to domestic manufacturers hurt by importers selling products at excessively low prices. “This filing addresses unprecedented behaviour by two serial violators of US trade laws,” Whirlpool Chief Executive Officer Jeff Fettig said in a statement. In the filing, Whirlpool alleges Samsung and LG pursued a strategy of selling washing machines in the US at artificially low prices, then doing an “end run” around US anti-dumping laws intended to prevent such behaviour. For example, the South Korean companies moved production to Vietnam and Thailand to avoid duties being imposed by the US on machines they made in China, Whirlpool alleges. The long-simmering conflict has the potential to become a high-profile test for President Donald Trump. Trade and domestic manufacturing were signature issues in his campaign, and Fettig serves as a member of the president’s manufacturing council. If the trade commission decides in Whirlpool’s favour, it could recommend that Trump’s administration step in and slap tariffs on the competitors’ products. Whirlpool’s filing would be the latest in a series of complaints companies have filed with the ITC, a federal tribunal that rules on trade disputes. Last month, Boeing accused Bombardier of selling passenger jets in the US at “absurdly low prices,” asking the US to impose duties on the Canadian jet builder. ‘One-Way Street’ Trump has threatened to pull the US out of its free-trade agreement with South Korea, calling the 2012 deal a “one-way street” that has only benefited the Asian country. The US trade deficit with South Korea last year, at about $28bn, was the eighth-largest shortfall among US trading partners, according to Census Bureau data. Whirlpool’s dispute follows cases in which the US government has determined that the South Korean companies injured US manufacturers by selling washing machines in the country at illegal prices, Whirlpool said. “In light of their apparent inability to compete with leading global brands like LG in the US market, Whirlpool has decided to seek government restrictions to limit consumer choices,” LG said in an emailed statement. The company said that in order for Whirlpool to succeed in its petition, it would have to prove that the imported goods are found to be a significant cause of serious injury to US producers - “a high legal standard that Whirlpool cannot meet,” LG said. Representatives for Samsung didn’t have an immediate response to the filing. The disagreement with the South Korean companies dates back years, with victories on both sides. In 2011, Whirlpool alleged that its overseas rivals were receiving unfair government subsidies and selling products in the US at below-market values. In 2013, South Korea filed a World Trade Organisation dispute challenging the US Commerce Department’s calculations. It won a ruling from the WTO last year. Lagging behind The situation has hampered sales at the Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company’s washer division, which has underperformed its other businesses, Fettig said. “If not for this unlawful behaviour, we believe our washer category would have thrived like the rest of our North American business,” he said. Whirlpool previously scored a win at the ITC in January, when it granted the company’s request to place dumping duties on imports of large residential washing machines from China. The 6-0 decision paved the way for final duties on the products of as much as 52.5%. The company posted earnings last quarter that fell short of analysts’ estimates, though in that case it blamed efforts to integrate Italy’s Indesit with its European operations.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, and U.S. President Donald Trump talk as they attend the Summit of the Heads of State and of Government of the G7 on May 26. A lot is happening this month in Canada-U.S. trade with at least four actions on the punitive front that Canada will be watching in June.  (PHILIPPE WOJAZER / AFP / GETTY IMAGES)   By Alexander PanettaThe Canadian Press Wed., May 31, 2017 WASHINGTON—The multiple ways in which Donald Trump could threaten Canada-U.S. trade will be on full display this month, with a series of looming decisions and public events that hold the potential to escalate disputes. One expert counts three pathways to pain: NAFTA negotiations, punitive actions, and pressure on CEOs to shift operations to the U.S. Gary Hufbauer says this flurry of individual actions will allow the president to point to immediate results in his “America First” agenda, giving him something to show voters in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections if NAFTA talks languish into the following year. “I think the NAFTA negotiations are going to be long, and tedious, and difficult, and not yield much fruit between now and the (midterms) in 2018,” said Hufbauer, a prominent trade analyst at Washington’s Peterson Institute. “So... these other parts of the agenda will be what Trump emphasizes when we come down to the congressional and senatorial races.” Article Continued Below Read the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump A lot is happening this month. There are at least four actions on the punitive front that Canada will be watching in June: a report on Bombardier by the Commerce Department around June 12, which could lead to duties; a decision on additional softwood-lumber duties June 23; and investigations into the national-security implications of importing steel and aluminum, which Trump says will be released in June. There’s also a big hearing on NAFTA on June 27. The U.S. government will collect public input on what it should demand in negotiations later this year, and foreigners are invited to share submissions for the Washington event. Read more: Harjit Sajjan lashes out at Boeing over trade spat with Bombardier Hundreds of Quebec lumber workers among first to lose work after Trump’s softwood tariffs Trump’s ‘America First’ budget makes wall, defence priority over federal agencies Canada ‘very prepared’ for NAFTA renegotiation talks with U.S., trade minister says The Canadian government is preparing for this multi-front challenge: On Tuesday, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan came within a whisker of threatening the U.S. company that launched the complaint against Bombardier. Ottawa has said it is reviewing plans to spend at least $5 billion on Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets. Sajjan said in a speech: “(This) is not the behaviour of a trusted partner.” On softwood lumber, Ottawa is threatening two other trade actions. It says it might ban exports of U.S. coal from B.C., and is also studying whether the state of Oregon’s business subsidies constitute grounds for punitive action. On steel and aluminum, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed Trump during a chat in Sicily for a Canada exemption from any punitive action. The countries have relatively balanced trade in steel. In fact, Canada is by far the largest importer of U.S. steel — it took in 51 per cent of U.S. exports last year, Mexico took 39 per cent, and the next four countries took a mere one per cent each. The American cabinet official responsible for many of these trade actions is aware of this. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told a congressional hearing last week: “We actually have steel surplus with Canada and Mexico, so that puts them in a little different position, as well as the fact that they are participants in NAFTA.” The Canadian government will keep taking its message on the road. Transport Minister Marc Garneau will be in Pennsylvania steel country Friday as the latest cabinet minister to travel throughout the U.S., spreading the message about $858 billion a year in bilateral trade of goods and services, the nine million U.S. jobs related to Canadian trade, and the $1.62 million of trade occurring every minute of the day. Garneau alone has been in Washington, D.C., Washington State, and Florida recently as the Canadian cabinet scours the continental United States is search of potential allies as these disputes arise. “It’s just making our American neighbours aware of just how much is at stake,” Garneau said in an interview. He’ll be meeting in Pittsburgh with two Republican congressman and with the head of the United Steelworkers union — Leo Gerard, who is Canadian. Gerard happened to be inside the Oval Office for the public event where Trump blasted Canadian trade in dairy, lumber, and energy. But Garneau warns against getting too exercised by this daily noise. He says he’s looking farther ahead, past June, at another big date: Aug. 16. That’s when the U.S. will have finished its NAFTA consultations and will be ready to present its demands to Canada and Mexico for the renegotiation. “The vast majority of what we’re looking at will be under NAFTA,” Garneau said in an interview. “There’s a certain amount of stuff that gets out there in the media that may not necessarily be what the United States’ final position is. “We know the art of negotiation. The real serious negotiations will be based on what is put on the table in front of us, three months from now. That’s what we will be focused on... That’s when the rubber hits the road.” Buy American is another issue on the transport minister’s mind. Domestic procurement could be a key sticking point in the NAFTA talks, and also surface as an issue in an eventual U.S. infrastructure bill. The last time it was a major irritant some Canadian companies responded by opening U.S. facilities. That’s the third kind of pressure Hufbauer expects to see, beyond sector-by-sector penalties and NAFTA harball bargaining. He says Trump already has pressed CEOs of major companies, especially in the auto sector but in others as well, with one purpose: “Threatening them to locate in the United States.” Read more about: United States, Donald Trump Delivered dailyThe Morning Headlines Newsletter Subscribe The Toronto Star and thestar.com, each property of Toronto Star Newspapers Limited, One Yonge Street, 4th Floor, Toronto, ON, M5E 1E6.

During the test, a Boeing-developed interceptor, carrying the Raytheon-built EKV, was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, following the launch of an ICBM from Kwajalein Atoll, stated an Aerojet press release, which added that the Aerojet Rocketdyne Alternate Divert Thruster (ADT) and DACS successfully maneuvered the EKV to destroy the incoming target. This first live-fire test is a major milestone for the decades-long, $330 billion ICBM program. This is akin to one bullet hitting another in terms of complexity and the distances traveled, noted some experts, and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) called the feat an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,”said director of MDA Vice Admiral Jim Syring in a statement. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the last test had taken place in 2014. Success was not guaranteed Tuesday — in fact the GMD system only hit its target nine out of 17 tests since 1999, reports Reuters. The U.S. test comes as North Korea becomes increasingly hostile, increasing its missile tests and developing its own ICBM that can reach the U.S.mainland, around 5,500 miles from the hermit state. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” said Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, prior to the launch. In this year’s budget proposal, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency and around $1.5 billion for the GMD program specifically. Critics of the program say that the tests do not adequately replicate battlefield conditions, because of the controlled environment and the system having real information no enemy would telegraph. Despite that critique, “this is an important day for homeland missile defense, and a bad day for Kim Jung-un,” said Tom Karako, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Hit-to-kill has once again been validated, this time against an ICBM,” said Karako. “The Missile Defense Agency has been on a long road to improve the reliability and capability of the GBI fleet. For two decades, the United States has expressed an unwillingness to accept vulnerability against certain types of missile threats, like those from North Korea. Today’s test promises good things for the defense of the nation.” Share Facebook Twitter Google + Stumbleupon LinkedIn Tags Aerojet aerojet rocketdyne alaska BAN boeing co Center for Strategic and International Studies feature featured GBI GMD govcon Ground-based Midcourse Defense icbm intercontinental ballistic missile Marshall Islands MDA MDA Director Military.com Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance missile defense agency Reuters Riki Ellison Tom Karako U.S. Military Vandenburg Air Force Base Vice Admiral Jim Syring Related Articles June 5 Morning Report: Friday Close – GovCon Index and Indices Weekly Performance Positive June 5, 2017 June 2 Market Close: GovCon Index Up as S&P 500, DJIA, and NASDAQ Reach New Highs Again June 2, 2017 138,000 Jobs Added in May; Unemployment Dips Slightly to 4.3 Percent June 2, 2017 Check Also Former Senator Kelly Ayotte Named BAE Systems Inc.

"Following" : "Follow"}} May 31, 2017 11:27am   Comments Share: The Federal Aviation Administration is proposing a $435,000 fine against United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL) for flying a passenger jet 23 times on domestic and international routes even though the plane wasn’t airworthy. The FAA alleged that United mechanics on June 9, 2014, replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on a Boeing Co (NYSE: BA) 787 in response to a problem reported by a flight crew two days previously. The FAA failed to perform a mandatory inspection of the work before returning the plane to service. “Maintaining the highest levels of safety depends on operators closely following all applicable rules and regulations,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement. “Failing to do so can create unsafe conditions.” Two of the 23 commercial flights took place after the FAA told United that it had failed to perform the inspection, which finally took place on June 28, 2014. The FAA says United has asked to meet with agency officials to discuss the incidents. A spokesman for the Chicago-based airline told the Associated Press that it’s working with the FAA on the matter. In an email exchange between Benzinga and United, United issued the following statement: "At United, the safety of our customers and employees is our top priority. We took action after identifying the issue and are working closely with the FAA in their review. United has had a rough year, public relations-wise. In April, a doctor was brutally dragged off a flight waiting to take off from Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport to make room for United employees.

United Airlines Related Media Gallery: Latest developments in cabin interiors Advertisement Chicago-based United Airlines will transition Boston-San Francisco flights to “premium transcontinental” service from July 1, offering 28 lie-flat business-class seats on each flight between the cities. United’s Boston-San Francisco flights will be operated with a mix of Boeing 757s and 777s. The route joins New York Newark-San Francisco and Newark-Los Angeles as United transcontinental routes featuring lie-flat business-class seats. In addition, United said business-class passengers on all three premium transcontinental routes will be offered new amenities starting July 1, including new dessert offerings and pre-arrival hot towel service and pre-arrival snacks. Also starting in July, economy plus passengers on the three routes will get meal service “including a complimentary hot fresh entrée, dessert and fruit, a pre-arrival snack and alcoholic beverages,” United said. United VP-marketing Mark Krolick added, “Flying between Boston or the New York area and the west coast can be akin to flying from the east coast to Europe, and we want to provide a satisfying and unparalleled meal in our economy cabin. This enhancement to economy plus is our first step toward a premium economy offering for our customers.” Dallas/Fort Worth-based American Airlines and Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines have brought back no-fee meals for all economy passengers on select transcontinental flights.

Emma Foehringer Merchant Science Date of Publication: 05.31.17. 05.31.17 Time of Publication: 11:00 am. 11:00 am How the ‘Orange Empire’ Became the Land of MegaWarehouses Getty Images This story originally appeared on Grist and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration. Just a few decades ago, California’s Inland Empire billed itself as “the Orange Empire” for the citrus orchards that fueled its primary industry. Today, many of those groves are gone, and so is the nickname. The landlocked region of 4 million people an hour east of Los Angeles now sprouts more enormous warehouses (a billion square feet of them) than fruit trees. Forty percent of the nation’s consumer goods—iPhones, sneakers, and everything available from Amazon—spend time sitting on those warehouse shelves after coming off ships at nearby ports, awaiting delivery to stores and homes. What was once a mostly rural region finds itself struggling with a high poverty rate and growing population. Residents are plagued by tremendous traffic and air pollution, which recently earned the region an “F” from the American Lung Association. From the Climate Desk Damian Carrington The Arctic Doomsday Seed Vault Flooded. Thanks, Global Warming Emma Foehringer Merchant Veggies Grown With Toilet Water Could Be Headed to Your Table Emma Foehringer Merchant Silicon Valley’s Mission to Save California Ag From Dying of Thirst Those environmental and health concerns will get much worse, advocates say, if the city of Moreno Valley—a town of 200,000 located in the heart of the Inland Empire—builds the largest warehouse project anywhere in the country. Tom Thornsley is a 60-year-old urban planner who moved to Moreno Valley in 1998, just as the rural-to-warehouse transformation was beginning. He thought he had chosen wisely, settling in a gray, ranch-style home that sat near a wide-open space zoned for more homes, not warehouses. “I know better than to look at dirt and not check what it would be,” he says. But after a developer proposed a project in 2012, city officials rezoned that dirt patch next to Thornsley’s house to make it home to one of the world’s largest warehouse complexes. The World Logistics Center, planned by a company called Highland Fairview, would be the largest such facility in the country, covering 2,610 acres—the size of 700 football fields. It would be more than 25 times bigger than the largest warehouse in the United States, a 98-acre hangar operated in Washington by the airplane manufacturer Boeing. As a planner, Thornsley doesn’t have a problem with industrial development. He’s worked on commercial buildings since 1989. But the environmental costs of the World Logistics Center are too much for his community, he says, so he’s become a leader in the effort to stop it—an effort that might hinge on next month’s special city council election. The World Logistics Center, which is now known locally by the acronym “WLC,” has turned Moreno Valley politics into a bloodsport. Community organizers and environmental groups have fought—in both city hall and the courtroom—to protect residents from the pollution it would cause and save protected species like peregrine falcons and California golden eagles that live in the nearby San Jacinto Wildlife Area. Once built, warehouses don’t pollute the way that factories and power plants do. But a project the size of the WLC would be a magnet for truck traffic, spewing exhaust on 69,000 estimated daily trips in and out of the complex. In a struggling region, though, the lure of jobs has proven difficult to overcome, despite the public health and quality of life concerns. “That’s why people are pressing so hard now,” Thornsley says, “to get somebody elected who’s not going to be, in essence, another developer’s puppet.” Southern California’s two ports are among the deepest on the West Coast, allowing massive ships to dock at Los Angeles and Long Beach. More than $360 billion worth of goods from production centers in the Asian Pacific were offloaded there in 2014. Warehouses originally crowded around the ports, until Los Angeles could no longer contain the growth. Demand for more space at cheaper rates pushed development farther east, and the Inland Empire became the hidden purgatory between production and consumption. Only the Philadelphia area currently has more warehouse space, but projects like the WLC would leave that East Coast hub in the dust. Over the past five years, the logistics industry has delivered a quarter of the new jobs in the region. But the economic boom carries a heavy environmental toll: Diesel trucks zip along the Inland Empire’s roads, carrying cargo to customers and piping particulates into the air. Winds rushing in from the ocean blow added pollution from LA and Orange County, which accumulates in the basin bounded to the north and east by mountains. That makes the Inland Empire one of the unhealthiest places to live in the country. Air pollution leads to higher risk of heart disease, asthma, bronchitis, cancer, and more. The South Coast Air Basin—which encompasses parts of Orange, Riverside, San Bernadino, and Los Angeles counties—exceeds federal and state requirements for lead and small particulate matter, which can lodge in the lungs. San Bernardino and Riverside counties, which make up the Inland Empire, ranked first and second, respectively, among the top 25 most ozone-polluted counties in the American Lung Association’s 2016 air quality report. Low-income neighborhoods and communities of color bear the brunt of this pollution, because they’re often situated near freeways or become sites for warehouses. Moreno Valley’s population is 18 percent African-American and about 54 percent Latino. In a community where nearly 20 percent of people live in poverty, it’s easy for a big developer to gain support for a project like the World Logistics Center—especially with the promise of 20,000 permanent jobs and $2.5 billion a year added to the local economy. But the downside includes 14,000 added diesel truck trips per day and a 44 percent increase in the city’s yearly greenhouse gas emissions. Many warehouse jobs are also low wage, temporary, and unsafe. The facilities rack up a plethora of safety violations, according to California health and safety inspectors, and workers report high levels of injury and illness. Many residents believe “this is the best I can get,” explains Sheheryar Kaaosji, coexecutive director of the Warehouse Workers Resource Center, which advocates for employee rights. “That’s what it comes down to.” Tom Thornsley, who has decades of experience in urban planning, says development decisions are all about weighing the pros and cons. When a project is proposed, environmental risk assessments let you know how harmful the development could be, which tells you whether it’s worth it and if you can do anything to mitigate the harm. Ultimately, he says, if a project’s benefits outweigh its problems, “You just decide you can live with it.” In the case of the World Logistics Center, he can’t. An analysis of health impacts prepared for the developer acknowledges the potential for increased incidences of asthma, heart disease, and premature deaths. Thornsley’s dismay over another warehouse project—for the shoe brand Skechers, which opened in 2011 and brought a net job loss—pushed him to join up with Residents for a Livable Moreno Valley, a community group created to combat rampant warehouse development. The group has found itself battling a formidable nemesis in the person of Highland Fairview’s charismatic CEO, Iddo Benzeevi. During the protracted WLC fight, Benzeevi has become a folk hero to some Moreno Valley residents. When the city council narrowly approved the project in August 2015, residents swayed by the promise of jobs chanted “Iddo, Iddo, Iddo.” “They think he walks on water,” Thornsley says. “I honestly couldn’t tell you why they find him to be so adorable.” In public council meetings ahead of the vote, many residents lauded the project as a game changer for the city. “These are not jobs that are just back and hands, they’re technical jobs, they’re jobs that are going to be able to support a family,” said one woman who has lived in Moreno Valley for more than 30 years. “Most people recognize Moreno Valley as one of three things: crime, corruption, or unemployment,” says resident Leo Gonzalez in a series of 2015 YouTube videos supporting the WLC. “I believe we have the ability to change all that.” In addition to currying favor with residents, Benzeevi skillfully navigated California’s arcane political and environmental laws. Thanks to a 2014 California Supreme Court decision involving Walmart, ballot initiatives that garner enough residents’ signatures can escape the state’s Environmental Quality Act review process. Benzeevi took full advantage of that for the WLC. Meanwhile, Thornsley’s group pushed back. Residents for a Livable Moreno Valley filed lawsuits against the project, which has also faced separate legal challenges from the regional South Coast Air Quality Management District, Riverside County and its transportation commission, and a roster of environmental groups including EarthJustice, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Coalition for Clean Air. “We already have among the dirtiest air in the nation,” says George Hague, a volunteer for the local Sierra Club chapter. “We keep trying to clean it up, but projects like this put us back.” Benzeevi disputes this, arguing that the benefits of job creation would outweigh the environmental impacts. “There is no better solution to reducing impacts to the environment than creating jobs where people live while utilizing the best available and viable clean technologies,” Benzeevi told Grist via an email from his public relations department. “This is precisely what the WLC does.” Benzeevi notes that Moreno Valley is requiring Highland Fairview to ensure that diesel trucks servicing the WLC meet a 2010 federal government standard for clean diesel. To which Hague counters: “They’re cleaner, but they’re not clean.” With options running out for WLC opponents, the special June 6 city council election to replace a single vacated seat represents a longshot chance to block the megawarehouse project, by putting an opponent on the board who can help overturn previous approvals. The council is now deadlocked 2-2. The open seat was previously held by Moreno Valley’s new mayor, Yxstian Gutierrez. A supporter of the World Logistics Center, Gutierrez won just under a third of the mayoral vote, but that was enough in a multi-candidate race. Benzeevi spent more than $160,000 to help his campaign. Highland Fairview is now backing a preferred candidate for Gutierrez’s open council seat, pouring tens of thousands into canvassing for his campaign through the Benzeevi-sponsored Committee for Ethics and Accountability in Government. WLC opponents are pinning their hopes on the three remaining candidates—one in particular has been an outspoken WLC opponent—who face long odds of winning. Whatever the election outcome, development in the Inland Empire shows no signs of slowing in the short term. But the environmental and health impacts of the logistics industry are starting to spur more awareness of the costs of warehouse growth. The California Air Resources Board voted in March to relocate its research facility to the Inland Empire’s Riverside County, which could potentially offer a more comprehensive understanding of the region’s poor environmental quality. And a bill in the state assembly is challenging the lack of environmental review in the initiative process—the very rule that allowed Benzeevi to push his megawarehouse project through local government. “We have such a disengaged citizenry—most of the people don’t understand the connection of the trucks to city hall,” says Kathleen Dale, a retired urban planner with the Residents for a Livable Moreno Valley group. “When you talk to people, this is a concern of theirs, but they’re not expressing it by going to the polls.” Go Back to Top.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz (Copyright Reuters 2017) United Continental (UAL) faces a potential fine by the Federal Aviation Administration for allegedly flying a plane that wasn’t in “airworthy” condition. Continue Reading Below The FAA said late Tuesday it’s seeking a fine of $435,000 over an incident that dates back to June 9, 2014. According to regulators, United mechanics replaced a fuel pump pressure switch on a Boeing (BA) 787, but the aircraft resumed service before the repair work was inspected. United flew that plane on 23 domestic and international passenger flights, the FAA claims. Crews performed the required inspection on June 28, 2014. The FAA believes that two of the flights occurred after the agency informed United of the missed inspection. “Maintaining the highest levels of safety depends on operators closely following all applicable rules and regulations,” FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement. “Failing to do so can create unsafe conditions.” The FAA said United has asked to meet with the agency to discuss the case.

(AMD) Stock Is Sending a Message. Listen. View All Posts Politically, the U.S. military industrial complex is sacrosanct. It is, for lack of a better phrase, the ultimate trump card. Transcending all other chess pieces invoking race, gender, religion, or any number of social identities, no one dares say anything even remotely critical of the military. Just for that reason alone, Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) — specifically, its defense division — is virtually untouchable. Source: Phillip Capper via Flickr This sentiment for BA stock and defense-related investments is exponentially multiplied in the present geopolitical climate. I’ve got news for you — Russia is not our friend, and probably never will be. Of all the talk emanating from the White House, and curiously, several Republicans, I’m left with a basic question: Since when did friends ever point nuclear warheads at each other? Make no mistake about it, folks! We’re in a cold war. In fact, I don’t think we’ve ever left it. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has waged a proxy war against the Russians. Even today in the global war against terror, our military operators confront terrorists armed with Russian weaponry. Bluntly speaking, our military industrial complex is in the business of destroying Russia. And as long as Russia exists, so too will demand for BA stock. Please don’t hate me for telling it like it is. I’m sure whatever is the Russian equivalent of Boeing stock is being yakked up by whatever is the Russian equivalent of InvestorPlace. All I’m saying is that ignoring the giant, pink elephant in the room may earn political points, but it’s not helpful profitability wise. Of course, BA stock is more than just Russia, Russia, Russia! Boeing enjoys tailwinds that have almost nothing to do with Russians. Instability May Spell Dollars for BA stock The most recent military-based catalyst is the Saudi Arabia arms deal that President Trump sealed. Worth nearly $110 billion — and the potential to boom to $350 billion — the White House characterized the contract as “a significant expansion of security relationship” between the two countries. Although Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) stands to gain the most from the arrangement, Boeing signed a significant amount of its own deals. In particular, BA stock could get a “two-fer” benefit from its passenger and military aircraft sales. With Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN) planning to setup a Saudi division, the potential for BA to do more business in the Middle East is far likely than not. President Trump’s visit to the holy lands of the world’s leading monotheistic religions has highlighted an inescapable undercurrent: the U.S. military industrial complex has no shortage of conflicts to exploit. Along with our perpetual game of one-upmanship with Russia, the Trump administration caused waves when it attacked Syrian military targets. On top of that, we’ve launched fierce rhetoric against North Korea. During the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly accused former President Obama of weakening America’s status on the world stage. Now, the tycoon has the keys to the car, and many American adversaries are egging him on. However this plays out, I imagine Boeing stock investors will at least be happy with their returns.

We will examine the RFI and take it forward," Lanba said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by FICCI on 'Building India's Future Navy Technology Imperatives'.      He, however, did not disclose the name of the companies which have shown interest in the proposal.      At present, the Navy operates 45 MIG-29K jets which face serviceability issues from time to time.     Currently, six planes are compatible for aircraft carrier. They are Rafale (Dassault, France), F-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden).      While F-18, Rafale and MIG-29K are twin engine jets, the remaining three have single engine.      The delivery of deck based fighter jets is expected to take four-five years.      The indigenously built aircraft-carrier Vikrant should complete trials in 2019. It was likely to be commissioned by 2020, Lanba said.      When asked about the recently approved Strategic Partnership (SP) model under which select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and battle helicopters, Lanba said the next step would be to identify strategic partners.      "All three service chiefs will have to go and get the AONs (Acceptance of Necessity) on what we want to be built through strategic partners, so that partners in each segment can be identified.      "We are hopeful that we should be able to move this process in next six months," he said.      Four segments -- submarines, fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured carriers/main battle tanks -- were identified under the new policy, aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment in defence manufacturing by private defence majors including leading foreign firms.      At the inauguration of the seminar, Lanba stated that the Navy has taken giant strides in the field of indigenous ship design and construction and has made a transition from being a 'buyer' to being a 'builder'.      He, however, stated that despite the achievements in indigenous shipbuilding, the Navy continues to be dependent on external assistance for niche technologies.      "An important aspect in attaining 100 per cent self- reliance in ship design and construction, therefore, is the indigenous development of high-end technologies, their transition into shipborne equipment and systems, induction into service and standardisation," he said.      Holding that self-reliance in defence production is a vital pre-requisite for achieving greater strategic autonomy, Lanba said it is no easy task and would require dedicated efforts by researchers, designers and manufacturers.      Lanba highlighted the three primary requirements that need to be met while inducting a technology or a product – affordability, timely delivery and performance.     To these primary imperatives, the Navy Chief went on to add a fourth dimension – that of life cycle sustenance by providing seamless technical support and making the technology future proof.      He stated that this aspect is most vital for building a navy of the future and the support of the industry therefore extends well beyond just supply to life cycle product support.

The report provides detailed insights on the market dynamics to enable informed business decision making and growth strategy formulation based on the opportunities present in the market. Winglets Market in the Global Aerospace Industry: Highlights  As per Stratview Research, the global aerospace winglets market offers a healthy growth opportunity of 9.7% CAGR during the forecast period of 2017 to 2022 and reach an estimated $559 million in 2022. The author of the report stated that increasing production rate of commercial and regional aircraft, certification of winglets as a standard equipment in the variants of the best-selling aircraft, such as B737 Max and A320neo family, increasing adoption rate of winglets by airlines in both the new as well as retrofit installations, winglet technology advancement, and increasing fleet size are the key drivers of the global aerospace winglets market. The research’s findings suggest that narrow-body aircraft is likely to remain the largest and the fastest-growing segment of the global aerospace winglets market during the forecast period of 2017 – 2022. B737 and A320 along with their recently launched variants would remain the growth engines of the winglets market in the narrow-body aerospace industry over the next five years.  In terms of winglet type, blended winglet dominates    the global aerospace winglets market, propelled by its certification in Boeing’s best-selling aircraft program B737, however, advanced technology winglet is projected to witness the highest growth during the forecast period of 2017 – 2022. Blended winglets offer 3% to 5% increase in fuel efficiency as compared to the aircraft without the winglets. As per the study, North America is projected to remain the largest market for winglets during the forecast period, driven by the presence of assembly plants of Boeing and Bombardier. The region is also manufacturing capital of the aerospace industry with the presence of major composite part fabricators and raw material suppliers. Asia-Pacific is the fastest-growing winglets market over the next five years, driven by upcoming commercial and regional aircraft with winglets as an option and high commercial aircraft fleet size.  The key winglet manufacturers are FACC AG, Korean Air Aerospace Division, RUAG Aerostructures, GKN Aerospace, Winglet Technology LLC, and BLR Aerospace LLC. New product development, collaboration with OEMs, and formation of long-term contracts with OEMs are the key strategies adopted by the key players to gain a competitive edge in the market.  Click Here and Ask for Free Sample on 202 Pages Aerospace Winglets Market Report Report Features  This report provides market intelligence in the most comprehensive way.

Mathematics, Science subjects to be taught in Hausa, Igbo, Yoruba Home / Cover / World News / US successfully tests ICBM defense system for first time US successfully tests ICBM defense system for first time — 31st May 2017 The U.S. military on Tuesday cheered a successful, first-ever missile defense test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a major milestone for a program meant to defend against a mounting North Korean threat. The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co (BA.N), and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States.

The airline’s new premium section, to be featured on its Boeing Co. 777-300ERs, will have six private suites instead of eight, Emirates said in an e-mailed statement. The cabins will be presented in November sporting “a totally fresh new look,” said Tim Clark, Emirates president. Read also: Emirates creates moisturizing pajamas for first-class passengers Emirates, which has been developing new first-class cabins for several years, has been hit by falling demand from premium Gulf passengers and industry-wide concerns about terrorism. To cope with some of the toughest operating conditions in its 30-year history, Emirates is revamping the bars on its Airbus SE A380s, mulling a premium-economy class for the first time and considering introducing narrow-bodies to its all-widebody fleet in cooperation with low-cost sister carrier FlyDubai. The smaller cabins come just after Qatar Airways announced its Qsuite, a new business-class section with double-beds that morph into meeting rooms. The market for the most expensive seats on an aircraft is at a crossroads, with many carriers either scaling back first-class offerings, while others such as Etihad Airways are taking the opposite approach by adding three-room cabins. Emirates, which is also known for onboard showers, will show its new first-class cabins and the corresponding routes at the biennial Dubai Airshow.

Four players have shown an interest in providing the Navy with 57 multi-role combat fighter jets for its aircraft carrier, Indian Navy chief Sunil Lanba said on Wednesday. The chief of naval staff also said the Scorpene submarine Kalvari is going through its final phase of trials and should be delivered by July-August. Having rejected indigenously built 'Tejas' as too heavy, the Indian Navy in January issued a Request for Information to procure 57 multi-role combat aircraft for its carrier. "The Navy has got response from four players for the RFI. We will examine the RFI and take it forward," Lanba said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by FICCI on 'Building India's Future Navy Technology Imperatives'. He, however, did not disclose the name of the companies which have shown interest in the proposal. At present, the Navy operates 45 MIG-29K jets which face serviceability issues from time to time. Currently, six planes are compatible for aircraft carrier. They are Rafale (Dassault, France), F-18 Super Hornet (Boeing, US), MIG-29K (Russia), F-35B and F-35C (Lockheed Martin, US) and Gripen (Saab, Sweden). While F-18, Rafale and MIG-29K are twin engine jets, the remaining three have single engine. The delivery of deck based fighter jets is expected to take four-five years. The indigenously built aircraft-carrier Vikrant should complete trials in 2019. It was likely to be commissioned by 2020, Lanba said. When asked about the recently approved Strategic Partnership (SP) model under which select private firms will be engaged to build military platforms like submarines and battle helicopters, Lanba said the next step would be to identify strategic partners. "All three service chiefs will have to go and get the AONs (Acceptance of Necessity) on what we want to be built through strategic partners, so that partners in each segment can be identified. "We are hopeful that we should be able to move this process in next six months," he said. Four segments -- submarines, fighter aircraft, helicopters and armoured carriers/main battle tanks -- were identified under the new policy, aimed at attracting billions of dollars of investment in defence manufacturing by private defence majors including leading foreign firms. The Ministry of Defence had recently scrapped navy's decision to appoint Flag Officer Delhi Area (FODA) and Flag officer Gujarat Naval area (FOGNA) without its consent. Responding to this, Lanba said, "We are in discussion with the Ministry of Defence and we will resolve it."

A 3D-printed rocket engine just launched a new era of space exploration Technology Wednesday 31 May 2017 - 12:37pm Contributors: The Conversation Africa This handout from Rocket Lab taken on May 25, 2017 shows the Electron rocket lifting off from its launch site on the Mahia peninsular in Hawkes Bay. Photo: Handout / ROCKET LAB / AFP Candice Majewski, University of Sheffield The rocket that blasted into space from New Zealand on May 25 was special. Not only was it the first to launch from a private site, it was also the first to be powered by an engine made almost entirely using 3D printing. This might not make it the “first 3D-printed rocket in space” that some headlines described it as, but it does highlight how seriously this manufacturing technique is being taken by the space industry. Members of the team behind the Electron rocket at US company RocketLab say the engine was printed in 24 hours and provides efficiency and performance benefits over other systems. There’s not yet much information out there regarding the exact details of the 3D-printed components. But it’s likely many of them have been designed to minimise weight while maintaining their structural performance, while other components may have been optimised to provide efficient fluid flow. These advantages – reducing weight and the potential for complex new designs – are a large part of why 3D printing is expected to find some of its most significant applications in space exploration, with dramatic effect. One thing the set of technologies known as additive manufacturing or 3D printing does really well is to produce highly complicated shapes. For example, lattice structures produced in exactly the right way so that they weigh less but are just as strong as similar solid components. This creates the opportunity to produce optimised, lightweight parts that were previously impossible to manufacture economically or efficiently with more traditional techniques. Boeing’s microlattice is an example of taking this to the extreme, supposedly producing mechanically sound structures that are 99.9% air. Not all 3D printing processes can achieve this, but even weight savings of a few percent in aircraft and spacecraft can lead to major benefits through the use of less fuel. 3D printing tends to work best for the production of relatively small, intricate parts rather than large, simple structures, where the higher material and processing costs would outweigh any advantage. For example, a redesigned nozzle can enhance fuel mixing within an engine, leading to better efficiency. Increasing the surface area of a heat shield by using a patterned rather than a flat surface can mean heat is transferred away more efficiently, reducing the chances of overheating. The techniques can also reduce the amount of material wasted in manufacturing, important because space components tend to be made from highly expensive and often rare materials. 3D printing can also produce whole systems in one go rather than from lots of assembled parts. For example, NASA used it to reduce the components in one of its rocket injectors from 115 to just two. Plus, 3D printers can easily make small numbers of a part – as the space industry often needs – without first creating expensive manufacturing tools. In orbit 3D printers are also likely to find a use in space itself, where it’s difficult to keep large numbers of spare parts and hard to send out for replacements when you’re thousands of kilometres from Earth. There’s now a 3D printer on the International Space Station so, if something breaks, engineers can send up a design for a replacement and the astronauts can print it out. The current printer only deals with plastic so it’s more likely to be used for making tools or one-off replacements for low-performance parts such as door handles. But once 3D printers can more easily use other materials, we’re likely to see an increase in their uses. One day, people in space could produce their own food items and even biological materials. Recycling facilities could also enable broken parts to be reused to make the replacements.   Astro printing. Barry Wilmore/NASA Looking even further ahead, 3D printers could prove useful in building colonies. Places like the moon don’t have much in the way of traditional building materials, but the European Space Agency has proven solar energy can power the production of “bricks” of lunar dust, which would be a good start. Researchers are now looking at how to use 3D printing to take this idea further and develop complete printed buildings on the moon. To make many of these applications a reality, we’ll need to research more advanced materials and processes that can manufacture components to withstand the extremely harsh conditions of space. Engineers also need to work on developing optimised designs and find ways of testing 3D printed parts to prove they’re safe. And then there’s the irritating issue of gravity, or rather the lack of it. Many current processes use powders or liquids as their raw materials so we’re likely to need some clever tricks in order to make these function safely in a low or microgravity environment. Some of these barriers may even require entirely new materials and techniques. But as research goes on, 3D printing is likely to be used more and more in space, even if a fully printed space vehicle isn’t going to launch any time soon. The sky is no longer the limit.

Images published by local media showed passengers being evacuated from the plane. The airport had to close for hours so that the plane can be removed. It is the latest incident for Indonesian air transport sector. In February, a Sriwijaya plane carrying 192 people from China to Bali was forced to turn back after the crew realised one of its doors was not properly closed. In the same month, another plane overshot the runway as it was touching down the airport of Yogyakarta city in heavy rain. -VNA Related News World Military plane crashes in Malaysia World Indonesia: military transport plane crashed, 13 dead World Indonesia: police plane crashes into the sea commercial plane Sriwijaya airline Manokwari city overshoot pincident Indonesia Vietnam news VietnamPlus Vietnam News Agency Indonesia Your comments about this article ...

Photo - AP/PTI   Sharelines US military successfully tests ICBM defence system for first time #US military successfully tests #ICBM defence system for first time Washington/Vandenberg Air Force Base (Claifornia): The U.S. military on Tuesday cheered a successful, first-ever missile defence test involving a simulated attack by an intercontinental ballistic missile, in a major milestone for a programme meant to defend against a mounting North Korean threat. The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defence Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co, and hailed it as an "incredible accomplishment." "This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat," Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. "This is one element of a broader missile defence strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats," Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday's launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defence Advocacy Alliance, described the test as "vital" prior to launch. "We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today," Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a programme that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defence Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD programme. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon's weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States. < Previous PageNext Page > STAY UPDATED Subscribe to our newsletter and be the first to know all the latest news Sign Up More in World Government plans to reinforce IT law to curb cyber crimes: Prasad BJP-RSS want to thrust one idea; opposition will defeat them: Rahul Comey to be pressed on whether Trump interfered with Russia probe Gallery Related content TimesTV Pentagon successfully tests ICBM defence system for first time Recommended for you British prime minister Theresa May says 'enough is enough' after London attackers kill seven Venezuela eyes assembly vote in July; man set ablaze dies PREVIOUS ARTICLE Militant attack kills six Pakistan police NEXT ARTICLE In pictures: Fighting continues in southern Philippine Oman #OmanPride Ramadan World Sports Opinion Business Technology Lifestyle Entertainment Advertising RSS Feeds Subscription TOO Apps Classifieds E Paper About us Blog Jobs Contact us Request a Quote Copyright © 2017 Muscat Media Group.

The U.S. military fired an ICBM-type missile from the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward the waters just south of Alaska. It then fired a missile to intercept it from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Experts compare the job to hitting a bullet with another bullet and note the complexity is magnified by the enormous distances involved. The Missile Defense Agency said it was the first live-fire test against a simulated ICBM for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), managed by Boeing Co (BA.N), and hailed it as an “incredible accomplishment.” “This system is vitally important to the defense of our homeland, and this test demonstrates that we have a capable, credible deterrent against a very real threat,” Vice Admiral Jim Syring, director of the agency, said in a statement. A successful test was by no means guaranteed and the Pentagon sought to manage expectations earlier in the day, noting that the United States had multiple ways to try to shoot down a missile from North Korea. “This is one element of a broader missile defense strategy that we can use to employ against potential threats,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters. Prior to Tuesday’s launch, the GMD system had successfully hit its target in only nine of 17 tests since 1999. The last test was in 2014. North Korea has dramatically ramped up missile tests over the past year in its effort to develop an ICBM that can strike the U.S. mainland. The continental United States is around 9,000 km (5,500 miles) from North Korea. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5,500 km (3,400 miles), but some are designed to travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles) or farther. Riki Ellison, founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, described the test as “vital” prior to launch. “We are replicating our ability to defend the United States of America from North Korea, today,” Ellison said. Failure could have deepened concern about a program that according to one estimate has so far cost more than $40 billion. Its success could translate into calls by Congress to speed development. In the fiscal year 2018 budget proposal sent to Congress last week, the Pentagon requested $7.9 billion for the Missile Defense Agency, including about $1.5 billion for the GMD program. A 2016 assessment released by the Pentagon’s weapons testing office in January said that U.S. ground-based interceptors meant to knock out any incoming ICBM still had low reliability, giving the system a limited capability of shielding the United States.

No one was hurt after the Boeing aircraft operated by domestic carrier Sriwijaya Air overshot the wet runway at the airport in Manokwari city, said transport ministry spokesman J. Adravida Barata. TV footage showed people being evacuated from the plane, as it rested on its belly on grass next to the runway. The airport will be closed for several hours so that the plane can be removed, Barata added. It is just the latest of many accidents for Indonesia’s air transport sector. In February, a Sriwijaya plane carrying 192 people from China to Bali was forced to turn back after the crew realised one of its doors was not properly closed. In the same month, a passenger plane operated by Indonesian flag carrier Garuda skidded off the runway as it landed at the airport serving the city of Yogyakarta in heavy rain. The aviation sector has been booming in recent years as a growing middle class increasingly use planes to get around the vast archipelago, but critics say safety standards have not kept pace with the expansion. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Saudi, Bahrain, Egypt and UAE cut ties with Qatar Outrage as Trump targets London mayor over attacks (VIDEO) Egypt cuts diplomatic ties with Qatar, following Saudi, Bahrain Islamic State jihadists claim London stabbing rampage (VIDEO) Singaporean who criticised police on FB charged with shoplifting 36 dead after gunman torches Resorts World Manila, cops say (VIDEO) Philippine police say Resorts World casino attacker a gambling addict, not terrorist US man splits from ex-teacher wife convicted of raping him 12 arrested after ‘evil’ London terror attack UN slaps sanctions on North Koreans amid US warning Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Selindung dalam hotel, rumah urut diserbu MPSJ Finding oil palm alternative could be key to haze issue — Jose Montesclaros Treating foreign maids with respect — Sin Chew Daily Indonesian mobile cinema keeps old film format alive in digital age John Travolta donates his Qantas plane to Australia museum Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Kennedy airport The following is the full text of the message. “Over the past two decades, I have on several occasions come to the US on business trips and study tours, and every time I was greeted with the warm hospitality of American friends.  During this official visit to the US as Prime Minister of Vietnam, myself and other members of the high-level delegation of the Government of Viet Nam are delighted to see old friends and meet new ones who share our strong desire to promote the friendship and cooperation between Vietnam and the US, so that we can together write a new chapter in the history of the relationship between our two peoples.  Despite ocean apart, Vietnam and the US have bridged the distance and come closer together since the establishment of diplomatic relations 22 years ago.  With the courage to rise above ourselves and the spirit of “shelving the past, heading toward the future,” we have overcome many difficulties and challenges to turn from foes to friends and now comprehensive partnership built on strong foundation. US exports into Vietnam increased five folds in the last 10 years. During this trip, businesses from both sides will sign many deals worth billions of dollars, creating tens of thousands of American jobs and boost exports from the US to Vietnam and vice versa, thus raising the livelihood of workers in both countries.  Our economies are fully complementary and with increasing trade come stronger mutual benefits.  Vietnam is importing in fast increasing number Boeing airplanes, Lockheed Martin satellites to strengthen our transportation and communication systems, as well as GE’s turbines to transition to a greener and cleaner energy sector.  Underwriter Laboratories newly built lab is providing certification services to ensure Vietnamese products meet global standards.  Agricultural imports from the US, including 0.5 million tons of cotton and 1.5 million tons of soybean, maize and corn in 2016 alone, are helping Vietnamese textile and aqua-culture products engage deeper into the global supply chain. In return, we are exporting to the US shrimps, tra/basa fish, tropical fruits, apparels, and footwear that are well liked by American consumers.  In May 2017, Vinamilk, the Vietnamese biggest diary group, imported 2,000 high-yield dairy cows and is expected to buy another 8,000 from the US to produce high-quality milk for Vietnamese children. More than 31,000 Vietnamese students are pursuing their higher education in the US.  They will be enormous resources for development in economic, science and technology fields for Vietnam as well as the strong foundation for bilateral relations.  The Fulbright University Vietnam and the Peace Corps programme will soon be launched in Vietnam to give Vietnamese students access to a world class education system and English language learning opportunities.  Furthermore, they will also stand as the vivid testaments of our growing bilateral relations. In Quang Nam, my beloved hometown, our work to preserve the natural beauty of Cua Dai beach and the heritage of Hoi An Old Town receive the wholehearted support from many American friends.  We are also grateful to the experts and scholars from Harvard University (MA), Portland University (OR), University of Arizona (AZ) and many other US research and training institutions for sharing with us their experience in disaster relief, climate change response and human resource development.  Wounds of the war are being healed with efforts to clean up dioxin hotspots and unexploded ordnance.  This genuine and sincere assistance is the solid building blocks for mutual trust and understanding, hence the foundation for a lasting relationship between Vietnam and the US decades to come. More than 20 years ago, many Americans only heard of Vietnam as the name of a war. But nowadays, they know of Vietnam as a sovereign nation with an independent foreign policy, a partner that deeply values its relations with the US and constantly seeks to reinforce a stable, long-term relationship with the US on the basis of mutual benefits and respect for each other’s sovereignty, political system, in the interest of peace, security, stability, cooperation and development in the region and the world at large. We wish to establish a strong working relationship with the Administration of President Trump to ensure not only the interest of the Vietnamese and American people but also the benefits of the ASEAN Community, for the sake of peace, security, stability, cooperation and prosperity of the Asia Pacific and the entire world.  In November this year, Vietnam will host the APEC Summit 2017 under the theme of “Creating new dynamism, fostering a shared future”. We welcome President Trump’s early acceptance of our invitation to attend this important Summit and look forward to building a substantive and effective agenda with the US and other member economies of the APEC. With such progress made in the past 20 years, we have all the reasons to believe that the Vietnam-US relationship will continue to flourish in the next 20 years and beyond.” VNA VN Prime Minister’s message during US visit, Government news, Vietnam breaking news, politic news, vietnamnet bridge, english news, Vietnam news, news Vietnam, vietnamnet news, Vietnam net news, Vietnam latest news, vn news   Name: * Email from: * Email to: * Messages:     Send      Read on Vietnam, Myanmar hold seventh political consultation Legislators scrutinise several draft laws on May 30 Vietnamese Gov’t to prevent fishing in foreign waters Vietnam, UN set cooperative development model Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc's first activities in the US PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc grants interview to Bloomberg PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc affirms support for Nasdaq’s cooperation with Vietnamese firms PM Nguyen Xuan Phuc meets VN delegation to UN, VN businesses in the US Asiaplomacy: Trump goes historic on Vietnam National Assembly Chairwoman: Vietnam treasures ties with Japan     Top Stories Tam Thanh - the fishing village of murals $4.4 billion enough to build hi-tech agriculture in Vietnam?
